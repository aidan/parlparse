 I agree that the antisocial behaviour legislation is not being applied with the vigour that we expect right across Wales, and it should be, both by the police, but particularly by local authorities, as my hon. Friend says. I saw a very good example of it being applied when I visited Llandudno Junction the other Friday, where a crack house has been closed down. While it was operating it was causing absolute devastation, blight and misery to neighbours in the area, many of whom were thinking of leaving their homes because they could not go out at night, their cars were being vandalised and their children were being threatened. That sort of thing must stop and we expect everybody to clamp down on it, as North Wales police and local councillors did so successfully there.</p>

 We shall continue to take that forward as effectively as possible. We have shown in the past that we always deliver under objective 1, despite whingeing and sniping by Opposition Members. The Labour Government have delivered in Cardiff and Westminster. The proof is that, whereas the gross value added per head in west Wales and the valleys was falling before 2000 and the objective 1 programme, it now consistently keeps pace with the UK average. That is a genuine tribute to the effectiveness of our policies.</p>

 Will EU structural funds be used to protect jobs in the Rhondda? Two weeks ago, Burberry announced that it intends to close its factory in Treorchy just after Christmas. Yet only last week, it announced a record increase in retail sales of 27 per cent. in the past few months. Does the Secretary of State worry that British brands, which trade on their Britishness, undermine that brand by outsourcing to other countries and stopping their production in Britain?</p>

 It is our policy to withdraw progressively from Iraq as the Iraqi forces are capable of taking on the security task. That is why it is important, when we are able to hand over to them, that we do so; otherwise we are a provocation rather than a help to them. That is why, earlier this year, we ceded control of al-Muthanna province, as there are now 5,000 Iraqi forces there doing that job. We are just withdrawing, or the Italians are, almost 3,000 forces from Dhi Qar province, where the Iraqis again will come in and do the job. We have already reduced our forces significantly over the past few years but, for example, we are working with the Iraqi forces to go through Basra part by part, making sure that we clean out the militia, put in place proper Iraqi security forces and undertake reconstruction. That is vital work, and I do not want to dismay our allies or hearten our enemies by suggesting that we will do anything other than stay until the job is done.

 Recently, the British Nuclear Group was fined &#163;500,000 after pleading guilty to the leak of 80,000 litres of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield. Some 25 per cent. of British Energy&#146;s share price was wiped out after it admitted to cracks in the boilers at Hunterston B and Hinkley Point, as well as underground leaks at Hartlepool. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that if, after all that, someone comes forward with a plan for a new fleet of nuclear power stations, the Government&#146;s policy remains that there will be no further subsidy from the taxpayer?</p>

 Our policy remains exactly as is, and it is important that it does so. My hon. Friend&#146;s point, however, is a perfectly good one. There are all those issues to do with replacing the existing generation of nuclear power stations. The reason the issue is on the agenda, as we can tell clearly from the launch earlier in the week of the Norwegian-British pipeline, is that, over the next few years, this country will go from being 80 to 90 per cent. self-sufficient in oil and gas to importing 80 to 90 per cent. Obviously, those are fossil fuels, and there is a danger that we will become increasingly dependent on imported supplies of energy.  <br>

 I cannot help making the observation that complaints about the Government&#146;s policy over Iraq would be more acceptable from those who had opposed the policy in the first place. The Prime Minister&#146;s answers, however, give an impression that is not borne out by events on the ground. The United Nations calculates that 3,000 Iraqi civilians are being killed every month. In those circumstances, how can the Prime Minister maintain that our presence is not, as General Dannatt told us, exacerbating the security situation?</p>

 It is correct that innocent civilians are dying in Iraq. But they are not being killed by British soldiers. They are being killed by terrorists and those from the outside who are supporting them, in defiance of the United Nations resolution that says the future of Iraq should be determined democratically by the Iraqi people. Whatever disagreement people have with the original decision on Iraq, I would have thought that we should all now support the United Nations and Iraqi Government position that we should stand up against the extremists and in favour of the democrats.</p>

 But surely we are entitled to question the strategy to which the Government are committed. Is it not clear that the opinions expressed by General Dannatt, Brigadier Butler, Senator John Warner and now James Baker lead to only one conclusion&#151;that the Government&#146;s strategy has failed? In those circumstances, the choice is stark: change the strategy or else get out.</p>

 I suspect that the right hon. and learned Gentleman believes that we should simply leave Iraq. That would be a mistake. Let me explain to him again that it is important to understand that if we desert the Iraqi Government now, when they are building up the Iraqi forces to take over security, it would be a gross dereliction of our duty to them. Incidentally, our mission in Basra, where, as we speak, British soldiers working alongside Iraqi forces have already gone through four of the 16 areas that are part of the process, is vital in restoring proper law and order to that city. If we got out now, when the job was not done, and simply deserted the situation, what good would that do, other than to ensure that those who support the extremists around the world gained heart from it? Of course, we should all debate the strategy, but the strategy is clear: progressively to withdraw as the Iraqi capability is put in place, and not to desert the democrats but to support them.</p>

 The point that my hon. Friend makes is absolutely right, and we will look at those recommendations&#151;we are looking at them very carefully&#151;and, obviously, we will want to implement them. Citizenship is relatively new; it has come on to the curriculum only over the past few years. But my hon. Friend is right to stress its importance, and in view of the debates that are happening at present about how people better integrate into our society and how people become more responsible citizens, citizenship is an absolutely central part of teaching in school. It is important that we improve the quality of it, and that we make sure that, where classes are inadequate, they are substantially improved.</p>

What sense does it make for housing benefit to have been paying, for the last 20 months, &#163;635 a month for Mr. and Mrs. Garghen in my constituency and their five children to be accommodated in inadequate temporary accommodation, when had we had a decent council house-building programme, the rent would have been less than half that amount?</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06101834000161">May I say how pleased I am to see that the Leader of the Opposition, my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), is in his place to listen to my argument? I know how strongly he feels about this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06101834000162">I wonder how many Members realise the extent of domestic abuse in this country. Let me give some figures. One in four women in Britain are abused in some form or another. More particularly, one in nine suffer physical abuse on a regular basis, and, worse, every week two women are killed as a result of such abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06101834000163">When I first discovered those figures, I was absolutely horrified. That happened as a result of my involvement with the Centre for Social Justice. I had discussions with Sandra Horley of Refuge, who explained the full extent of such abuse to me. I pay tribute to Refuge for the remarkable work that it does in helping those who have been, or are being, abused, and in particular to Sandra Horley, the chief executive, whose energy and commitment is phenomenal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06101834000164">I urge the Government to think positively about including an offence of liability for suicide in any new legislation, and also carefully to consider expanding the definition of diminished responsibility so that it includes a proper recognition of psychological injury. That would allow the courts properly to take account of a broader range of psychological impacts on victims of abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06101834000165">Research undertaken in the UK and abroad demonstrates that there is a causal link between attempted or completed suicide and concurrent experience of domestic violence. In 2000, UK statistics showed that between 30 and 40 per cent. of female suicides were committed by those who had been subjected to domestic violence. In the United States, research has shown that there is a temporal connection between suicide attempts and hospital treatment for injuries resulting from domestic violence. Importantly, this research went on to show that, of the victims of domestic violence who had attempted suicide, nearly 70 per cent. had done so within six months of hospital treatment, and, staggeringly, that nearly 40 per cent. had done so on the same day, after discharge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06101834000166">Let me illustrate all this by outlining the recent case of Mrs. Gurjit Dhaliwal, who hanged herself at the family home in Southall, west London, on 22 February 2005. Mrs. Dhaliwal&#146;s brother, Nav Jagpal&#151;I understand that he is here today&#151;said that he and his family had watched helplessly while his sister had suffered abuse over a sustained period, going back to 1979. Mrs. Dhaliwal had temporarily left her husband on a number of occasions because of the abuse; however, each time she returned. When the police found her after the suicide, they noticed that she had fresh cuts to her forehead, and they also discovered on searching the house a journal that she had kept over the last five months of her life, in which she harrowingly alleged physical and emotional abuse  <br>

by her husband. In fact, Mr. Dhaliwal even admitted on questioning that he had hit her on the evening that she died. Because of that admission, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to proceed against Mr. Dhaliwal on a charge of manslaughter, on the basis that this behaviour caused his wife to kill herself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06101834000167">It might assist the House if I try to explain some of the incredible twists and turns necessary under existing English law in trying to prosecute this case. There are various routes to achieving a verdict of manslaughter. In this case, the CPS tried to prove that the defendant had done something &#147;unlawful&#148; and &#147;dangerous&#148; that had caused Mrs Dhaliwal&#146;s death. However, as a foundation for such a charge of an unlawful act in English law, a prosecution has ultimately to prove that the act or those acts caused, or contributed significantly to causing, the death of the deceased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06101834000168">To do that, the prosecution had to use a definition established in an Act of Parliament passed in 1861, together with more recent case law equating &#147;psychiatric injury&#148; with bodily harm, the proposition being that Mrs. Dhaliwal had suffered psychiatric injury as a result of this pattern of domestic violence, and that that amounted to bodily harm in the meaning of the legislation&#151;a complicated scenario. Interestingly, on the evidence of a number of experts, who disagreed throughout the case, the court had to rule that Mrs. Dhaliwal had suffered psychological injury, but because that fell short of &#147;psychiatric injury&#148;, it did not amount to the bodily harm definition necessary according to the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06101834000169">Let me quote what the Court of Appeal judge, Judge Roberts QC, said in summing up:</p>
<a name="61018-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="06101834000376"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is very hard not to see some connection between the incident of violence which appears to have taken place shortly before and her death.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06101834000170">However, it was ruled that under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, it was not possible to stretch the definition of psychological injury so that it could count as bodily harm. Recognising the problem, the Court of Appeal said that it would be more satisfactory if the law provided a less convoluted route in a manslaughter conviction in cases of this kind. The following is the most apposite quote from the judge:</p>
<a name="61018-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="06101834000377"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I would have thought there was some force in the argument that the &#145;last straw&#146; played a significant part in causing her death&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06101834000171">I would add that in fact, that is common sense. Surely there is hardly anybody in this Chamber or among the general public who has not long believed that there are often connections between suicide and things that have gone on before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06101834000172">Refuge&#146;s recent experience of supporting Mr. Nav Jagpal in the case of his sister, Mrs. Dhaliwal, and of other cases, has led it to believe that the law as it stands offers little or no justice to such women, or to the families whom they leave behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06101834000173">I know what the House will say. Many will say that hard cases make bad laws, but I am not trying to persuade the House or the Government to change the law simply because of one case. It is not an isolated case. I offer up this case because it is such a high-profile example of what Refuge and many other campaigners believe is a failure of natural justice. It is absurd to have to rely on an Act that was passed in 1861, before psychiatry was even born and before the link between physical and mental trauma was fully appreciated. That  <br>

position is supported by a number of national newspapers, including <i> The Sun </i>and <i> The Times</i>, which featured articles on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06101834000174">Surely the law should recognise that there are some assaults that, taken in isolation, may not appear to be life threatening, but which, when combined with a pattern of behaviour over a period of time, could result directly in the victim taking their own life. Abuse is not just about the physical effect. Someone who is regularly attacked suffers psychological problems, and that psychological damage can ultimately be more harmful than the individual and often isolated instances of physical abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06101834000175">I know that it is tempting for someone listening to this speech to say that they do not understand what the problem is, and that someone being abused should just leave. I suppose that in a simplistic and perfect world that would be the case every time, but I am afraid that the world is not that simple, and the situation is much more complex than that. Far too many victims of abuse make qualified decisions to stay with their abuser because they cannot leave. Perhaps the fear of leaving their children behind is part of that, or the fear of having no one to turn to and no place to go, or the absence of any money. Perhaps most of all, there is the fear that should they fail to get away cleanly, the abuse that they will suffer on their return will be much greater.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06101834000176">Domestic violence is a major problem&#151;in some cases, possibly because of changes to the way in which people live today, with more single women bringing up children on their own. However, domestic abuse is also  <br>

found in what appear to be some of the most stable households. The key point that we should all admit and accept is that we must never make any excuse for the abuser. Abusers have no excuse. Their abuse is their responsibility, and they should face the consequences of that abuse. That is why I ask the Government to help us and the House genuinely to consider this motion for a new law of liability for suicide. We should not have to watch as any further cases collapse because the abuser&#146;s victim is dead and thus unable to testify. After all, even in financial terms, domestic violence is estimated to cost the country at least &#163;23 billion a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para30"><a name="06101834000194">One of the historical roles of the House has always been to attempt to protect the general social interest against specific actions of private interests. The Bill is an attempt to do that, but with a light touch. It is clear that corporations have become increasingly important actors both inside the United Kingdom and on a global scale. Many of the world&#146;s largest companies are absolutely enormous. The fact that Wal-Mart, the world&#146;s biggest corporation, is larger than 150 nation states shows the size of the private interests that are emerging. It is for nation states and national Parliaments to reflect on private power and its consequences and to attempt, albeit in a way that is not too burdensome, to protect the social interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para31"><a name="06101834000195">I noted that the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) claimed in the House yesterday that corporate social responsibility, which is the name that we give to the attempt to encourage companies to behave more responsibly, is now taken more or less seriously by all the larger companies based in this country. That was a sweeping and&#151;some might say&#151;complacent statement, given that there are companies whose actions still cause problems both in the United Kingdom and abroad. For example, I draw the House&#146;s attention to the UK-based mining giant, Anglo American. A recent report indicated that poor communities in Ghana were seriously afflicted by environmental pollution that was a by-product of the company&#146;s operations. The water supply was poisoned and the farming land was degraded, so the local people could not carry out their traditional pursuits of fishing and farming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para32"><a name="06101834000196">I do not want to give the impression that I am vilifying the whole of the UK corporate sector, but we must be honest in the House about the fact that, unfortunately, there are widespread examples of such actions. For example, it is said that Shell is in breach of statutes in the Niger delta by flaring off the by-products of its activities, which produces carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that damage the environment. It is suggested that Shell is producing as much pollution through its activities in the Niger delta as the rest of west Africa. It is also said that Tesco is using unfortunate techniques in relation to female workers in South Africa. The list goes on, so I do not need to strengthen my point. We should simply reflect on the fact that private power cannot be left totally unaccountable in this modern world, and that is the context of our debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="61018-0004.htm_para33"><a name="06101834000197">The Conservative party has been seen to represent the narrow class base of shareholder interest, but the right hon.

He placed an advert in the newspapers in which he said that it was his business not to stand up for big business,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para1"><a name="06101834000199">The right hon. Member for Witney said in a speech on 9 May:</p>
<a name="61018-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="06101834000382"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I&#146;ve never believed that we can leave everything to market forces&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para2"><a name="06101834000200">He was quoted in <i> The Sunday Times</i> on 7 May 2005 as saying that the regulation of companies</p>
<a name="61018-0005.htm_brev2"><a name="06101834000383"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;clearly has an important role in ensuring competition and setting minimum acceptable standards&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para3"><a name="06101834000201">It was therefore assumed that the Conservatives would join in a consensus on light-touch regulation of business. That is precisely the type of regulatory framework that the Bill&#151;the largest ever to have come before the House&#151;would incorporate into law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para4"><a name="06101834000202">At the centre of the Bill is the concept of enlightened shareholder value. Again, I should have thought that there would be a consensus across the House that if the aim is to ensure that the corporate sector operates in a socially responsible fashion, enlightened shareholder value could be at the core of any legislative framework that we introduce. I should have thought that it would be apparent to everyone that if shareholders are to have the capacity to act in an enlightened way, information, particularly information on the way in which the company is being managed by its directors, is key. That brings us to the heart of the provisions: the business review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para5"><a name="06101834000203">The Bill as a whole is intellectually coherent. It proposes the concept of enlightened shareholder value, and an instrument&#151;the business review&#151;that will enable shareholders to act in ways that secure the best interests of the company, applying a definition that goes beyond narrow financial considerations, and encompasses the environment, both social and ecological, in which the company operates. I would argue that the business review is the core of the Bill&#146;s intellectual underpinning. The Bill is a good measure, containing much that is to be welcomed. However, it seems to me&#151;this is why I proposed new clause 1&#151;that some of the detailed provisions on the business review could be extended. I note that the Government have been persuaded to table an amendment to new clause 1, to which I shall refer shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para6"><a name="06101834000204">The business review requirement might be extended in relation to those categories of company that will be required to produce a review. There must always be boundaries around any legislation, and it is for the House to define where those boundaries fall. The Bill therefore states which classes of company should produce business reviews. The Government have drawn the boundary around larger companies&#151;by definition, those that are listed on the stock exchange. That will cover about 1,300 companies, which are among the largest in the UK. It is welcome that the Government have done that, but there are 4 million companies in the UK, and many are larger and have a greater impact on life in the UK and in the rest of the world than the companies that fall within that category.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para7"><a name="06101834000205">In new clause 1, I propose a modest&#151;I might even say timid&#151;extension to the category of companies that will be required to produce a business review.</p>

requirement, as would Sainsbury. Asda, however, as a subsidiary of Wal-Mart, is not quoted on the stock exchange and is not covered by that requirement. New clause 1 is an attempt to correct that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="06101834000207"><a name="61018-0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="06101834000517"><b>Jon Trickett:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right. Asda is part of the Wal-Mart group, which, it is alleged, employs teams based at its headquarters in the United States to break trade unions. Such activities cannot be justified. We have seen little of that in the United Kingdom, but it is part of Wal-Mart&#146;s corporate strategy. Even more worrying is the allegation that the Wal-Mart group of companies receives supplies from thousands of factories in the People&#146;s Republic of China that pay workers 13 cents an hour, when the minimum wage in China is 31 cents an hour. It is probable that many of those commodities are entering the United Kingdom via Asda. It has been put to me that, as part of an American corporation, Asda cannot be covered by the legislation, but I have checked and found that Asda&#146;s corporate headquarters remain registered in the United Kingdom. I suggest to the Minister that Asda may well be covered by UK legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para8"><a name="06101834000208">As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) has illustrated, many companies that have a huge impact on our social and ecological environment will be excluded from the Bill. This morning, I obtained a list of the top 10 private companies. John Lewis Partnership is owned by its employees. It is a model company that reports regularly on its social impact, but although it employs 63,000 people in the UK and has a turnover of &#163;5 billion, the company will not be required to report under the Bill if new clause 1 is not added. If I was in charge of Tesco or another retailer and I was told that my company, because it is listed, will have to report, but my competitors&#151;John Lewis Partnership or Asda&#151;will not, because they are private companies or wholly owned subsidiaries, I would say that the playing field is not level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para9"><a name="06101834000209">No logical intellectual case can be made for excluding larger private companies or subsidiaries that are registered in the UK. Littlewoods, which has 29,000 employees, will be excluded, as will another private company, John Swire and Sons, which has 76,000 employees. The case for requiring those companies to produce a business review is overwhelming. I understand that the Government had to draw a boundary somewhere, but I believe that we could extend the requirement beyond the 1,300 listed companies. The new clause would do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para10"><a name="06101834000210">In new clause 1, I suggest that medium-sized companies should also be included. Why should such companies be excluded? A medium-sized company is, by definition, quite a large operation: it may have a turnover of tens of millions of pounds and 250 or more employees. Such companies are significant players. I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s explanation of why the boundary was drawn where it was. If the Government accept new clause 1, the number of companies covered by the requirement to produce business reviews will increase from 1,300 to 36,000. That is a modest extension, given the fact that there are 4 million companies in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para11"><a name="06101834000211">The new clause would also correct some of the anomalies that will be thrown up by the Bill. We have discussed the retail sector and the anomaly that some retailers will  <br>

have to produce business reviews but other, perhaps larger, companies will not. It is anomalous that Virgin will not have to produce a business review. The company claims to be environmentally sound&#151;that is what Richard Branson regularly tells us and it is part of the image that he projects for his company, and I have no reason to doubt it. However, Virgin will not have to produce a business review, whereas British Airways will. How can it be right to have such an uneven playing field for the two companies, simply because of the definition set out in the Bill? Another excluded group of companies consists of those listed on the alternative investment market. Many companies with an AIM listing have a significant impact on our society and on the environment. It cannot be right that companies listed on the London stock exchange will have to produce a business review, but those on AIM will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para12"><a name="06101834000212">The second proposal in new clause 1 deals with supplier issues. There will probably be further debate about that, because the Minister has tabled her own amendment. I notice the expressions of what I regard as phoney outrage by the CBI in this morning&#146;s newspapers. That is unfortunate because the proposal is modest. If a corporation is to produce a business review that comments on those aspects of its activities that have an impact on the rest of society and on the environment, to exclude the supply chain would vastly diminish the amount of reporting required of the company. We are strongly in favour of the supply chain being included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para13"><a name="06101834000213">It is often said that some of the supermarkets operating in the UK, which are increasingly dominant on the high street and elsewhere, use methods that have an oppressive effect on the agricultural sector in the UK and beyond. It is regularly argued that workers are being brought in from eastern Europe to produce agricultural products&#151;strawberries, potatoes and so on&#151;under the most appalling conditions. They are employed not by Asda, Tesco or other supermarkets directly, but by suppliers. If the supply chain were brought within the remit of the Bill, it is arguable that horrific arrangements such as that of the cockle pickers and the gangmasters would be exposed at a much earlier stage, rather than in the tragic way in which that situation emerged. Supply issues are important, and it is good to see that the Government have reflected on the matter.</p>

 I strongly support any effort to ensure that supplier relationships are incorporated in the Bill. Can the hon. Gentleman expand on the challenges that that presents?

supply chain, often smaller companies living hand to mouth. Anyone who, like me, seems unable to sleep the night through and listens to &#147;Farming Today&#148;, an excellent programme at 5.45 am on the BBC, will regularly hear farmers speaking anonymously. I never thought I would be an advocate for the farming community, but it is interesting to hear people further down the supply chain objecting to the techniques being used by the retail sector&#151;by the large supermarkets&#151;to drive down the conditions in which their suppliers are working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para14"><a name="06101834000216">We know that many companies are moving their production overseas. Several clothing factories have closed in my constituency. The company that owned the factory remains and continues to supply retailers, but the production has moved overseas, largely to take advantage of what the company would regard as favourable labour conditions overseas, which probably means poverty wages and extremely poor contractual standards in respect of employment law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para15"><a name="06101834000217">If we were to secure a more balanced relationship in the supply chain, with longer-term relationships and more balanced ones too, that would benefit not only the rest of society and the work force, but the larger companies, which would reveal the suppliers of materials to them. In the long term business should operate through secure relationships down the supply chain. That would obviously create a good business environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para16"><a name="06101834000218">I said earlier that the cries of outrage in many of the newspapers this morning sounded somewhat phoney. I notice that the much lamented operating and financial review, which some months ago got lost somewhere along the line, included supply chain issues. Many companies that belong to the CBI and are part of the corporate world had already begun to include supply chain issues&#151;stronger issues than my right hon. Friend the Minister is proposing. The CBI should not be expressing outrage at such a modest proposal. Many in the corporate sector had already adapted to it, and it would create more harmonious economic relationships down the supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para17"><a name="06101834000219">There is a third issue in the new clause&#151;materiality, which I shall try to explain. The business review requires directors to report to shareholders on matters that are directly material to the company&#146;s narrow financial health. It is accepted that companies seek to maximise the return to their shareholders, and that that is how the system works. However, it is possible to take a slightly longer-term view than the return of profit in the here and now. A company&#146;s actions in the medium to longer term could be damaging to the company itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para18"><a name="06101834000220">An example is oil production in the Niger delta, which I mentioned a few moments ago. In the end, if the company continues to break Nigerian law, damage the local environment and exploit local people, it will not be in the company&#146;s interests. Eventually, Nigeria will turn against the company. New clause 1 suggests a more relaxed version of materiality&#151;what is material to the company&#146;s operation&#151;than the version in the Bill. It will be interesting to hear the Government&#146;s arguments for suggesting such a narrow definition, rather than a slightly wider one.</p>

primary school when the operating and financial review was first developed and work on the Bill started, but we have finally reached the stage where we have a business review in the Bill, which Conservative Members support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para25"><a name="06101834000232">We recognise the importance of the role of businesses in creating jobs and prosperity, but we also recognise the broader impact of businesses not only on the environment but on the local and international communities in which they operate. There is no inherent contradiction between companies striving for long-term financial success and demonstrating strong corporate responsibility. In fact, the Minister herself correctly described those two issues as being interlinked and interwoven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para26"><a name="06101834000233">At the heart of any successful company is an in-depth understanding of what its customers want and value. Perhaps more than at any time in the past, customers place a value not just on what they are purchasing from companies, but on the way in which companies have carried out their business in order to provide those products or services. Companies can therefore be at the forefront of the push to tackle environmental and ethical issues. They do not have to be at the back of that argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para27"><a name="06101834000234">The business review as set out in the Bill will be an important part of that developing corporate social responsibility agenda. As we approach the Queen&#146;s Speech, which Conservative Members very much hope will contain a climate change Bill, it is possible to see the emergence of a real corporate social responsibility reporting framework in the UK. The business review could play a vital role in that, and we certainly hope that it does, but new business legislation often involves additional costs and burdens on those businesses that it affects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="61018-0005.htm_para28"><a name="06101834000235">The Opposition recognise the importance of establishing for the first time a formal narrative of a company&#146;s development risks and uncertainties and the wider impact of its relationship with the environment, its employees and the community. However, those of us who have worked in business&#151;I should declare that I am a chartered accountant&#151;also know how careful Government need to be before adding any unnecessary burden on business. As the Minister said on Second Reading, we should ensure that the new law is as clear, simple and modern as possible, that it is fit for today&#146;s business purposes, and that it does the maximum possible to get rid of any unnecessary burdens of regulation.</p>

 Throughout the Bill, the Government have been clear about what the business review is intended to do, and it is to be a narrative for the members of the company. I am sure that the Minister will want to deal with whether the Bill should have a much wider application to any company that is operating within UK jurisdiction. We need to strike the right balance with this legislation. That has been difficult to achieve and later we will debate whether we have achieved it. That has obviously partly been because it fits so clearly into a broader and important debate on the environment, but also because company law is necessarily limited in the extent to which it can be used as a vehicle to address such concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para0"><a name="06101834000240">I fully recognise the concerns that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) raised, but the question is what is the best way to address them. I agree with Lord Sainsbury and many others both from the Lords and in this place, including Ministers and Opposition Members, that company law is one way to pursue the need for companies to review more carefully the effect of their operations on the environment, but it is not the only route by which that can take place, so we need to be careful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para1"><a name="06101834000241">As the Minister said, company law is not the best vehicle for addressing wider social and environmental concerns.

I am following the logic of what the hon. Lady describes. Bearing it in mind that Conservatives appear to support the Government on this issue with not quite the same enthusiasm as they supported military action in Iraq, but just a little less than that, which aspects of the relationship between supermarkets and suppliers does she feel will be best served by elements within the Bill? Given that she wants to avoid unnecessary burdens on businesses, does she accept that one of the biggest burdens on the many suppliers in the supply chain, particularly to supermarkets, is their relationship with the supermarket, and that it is that burden that they need to have lifted and made more transparent?</p>

 We will come to that, but I was not aware that this was a Bill solely structured to deal with supermarkets. We need a Bill that will work for the whole of our business environment, not just one sector in it. There is a wealth of difference between measuring directors&#146; effectiveness in performing their duties, which is what the narrative is there to do, and taking steps to change company culture.</p>

In fact, it has had eight years of debate, with much money being wasted by companies on the operating and financial review preparation, which was subsequently dumped by the Government. The Opposition believe that balance has been achieved, which is why we support the business review in the Bill.</p>

 We are in danger of making the business review far too prescriptive, particularly given that we know that more environmental legislation is likely to be enacted. What is needed is a narrative that has a good enough framework for the outcomes that we want, which includes information for members on environmental issues and the impact on people, employees and communities. However, it should not be so prescriptive that it closes down the debate and potentially gives directors the chance not to disclose something, because it is not on the list that they have been given. I have no doubt that companies that care about corporate social responsibility reporting will want to give a full and useful report in the business narrative, which will allow members to see which companies take that responsibility seriously.

What specific information does the Minister hope to elucidate from directors regarding corporate social responsibility that she did not believe would be disclosed in the business review as it stands? Whatever that information, how has she reached the conclusion that the value of that information outweighs the impact on our economy? The Minister seems to have made this decision with all too little understanding of its real costs and benefits. The best decisions are generally taken with facts and data, but this one was taken so late in the day that there cannot possibly have been a robust assessment of the reasonableness of the amendment or the impact of the decision on our economy and its businesses. If the Minister will not consult business about the impact of the amendment, I can assure her that we will. In betraying the sensible arguments made to support the business review made not only by herself previously but by Lord Sainsbury and by her boss, the Secretary of State, she has done British business, and all those who work for it, a true disservice.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="06101834000389"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;information about persons with whom the company has contractual or other arrangements which are essential to the business of the company.&#148;</p>

A whole host of arrangements could be deemed essential&#151;from suppliers to utility, IT and telephony providers, from leasing arrangements for buildings to agreements with local authorities. Do the Government intend that the amendment be so widely couched? Presumably, it would even include financing from banks or arrangements with auditors or the Inland Revenue that are vital for the company&#146;s operation. The term, &#147;contractual arrangements&#148;, requires clarification. It could even be considered to cover customers. For example, Homebase has its &#147;Spend and Save&#148; scheme, with 4 million cardholders collectively accounting for 40 per cent. of its sales. That arrangement is clearly essential to Homebase, so would it need to be disclosed in the business review? If so, I do not see how that would further the aim of the business review, which I understood was intended to put in place, for the first time, a robust corporate social responsibility framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para12"><a name="06101834000273">Will the Minister provide some guidance on the type of information that the Government are trying to bring to the surface? Is it names and addresses? Is it length of contracts, assuming that it is the supplier relationship that the Government are driving at? What is intended to be disclosed by directors? How will members judge whether enough has been disclosed? If it is largely environmental information that is required by members so that they can assess whether the company in which they hold shares has behaved ethically, would not that be part of the existing &#147;environmental matters&#148; narrative?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06101834000274">Based on what was reported in the papers today and yesterday, it seems that the amendment is aimed at the supplier side of the business, but that is not how it is phrased. That is worrying for business, and for us. Surely important supplier relationships that had an effect on the company&#146;s environmental impact, or an effect in relation to the local community, would be included in the &#147;environmental matters&#148; or &#147;social and community issues&#148; aspect of the report, so why introduce the amendment at this late stage? The business review as structured already provides a mechanism for catching such important aspects of business operations, but the Government, in tabling the amendment, are casting doubt on that. As a result, they are, at the very last moment, managing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>

 We cannot support new clause 2, because it would relegate the business review to a tick-box exercise, with the unacceptably high risk that it would be of poor quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06101834000278">Worst of all, the amendment could put some companies at risk, because the information that they are required to disclose, while having no relevance whatsoever to corporate social responsibility reporting, may give out vital commercial information. I am surprised about that, given the example of Huntingdon Life Sciences. Companies working with or supplying that company, and its customers, have been targeted through no fault of their own having carried out perfectly legal operations. Other companies will be worried by the danger in which the amendment puts them. That potentially negative impact cannot be in the interests of the members of the company for whom the report is ultimately intended, nor in the interests of the company&#146;s employees. Surely that is not what the Government intend. Leaving aside the atrocious way in which they have introduced the amendment, even worse is how it weakens the business review by detracting from its focus on corporate social responsibility and its main function as a report to the members of the company so that it becomes a much broader report for a much broader audience. Until now, the Minister had always said that that was a dangerous road to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06101834000279">Let me turn to the issues raised by the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett). I fully appreciate what hon. Members are trying to achieve in new clauses 1, 2 and 75, but I have some concerns. Widening the purpose of the business review to expand its remit so that it is not only for existing members but for potential investors and customers would weaken, not strengthen, it. The review is designed to be a core narrative on the company, which may include a warts and all assessment by directors in which they consider difficult challenges that lie ahead. Many companies are in industries which, by their nature, have a big impact on the environment&#151;for example, aircraft operators. Surely the most valuable business review for members will be one in which directors can set out not only their successes but their failures and future challenges regarding corporate social responsibility. It is vital to cover aspects where things are not going well if we are to see an overall improvement in this field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="61018-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06101834000280">The danger of widening the business review&#146;s purpose from being a narrative for members to one for potential investors and customers is that it will stop being a narrative and start to become a sales brochure in which, like it or not, positives will be accentuated and negatives may risk being downplayed. Directors may ultimately face a conflict of interest between producing the best business review for their members and the best business review for a broader audience. The review exists to enable members to hold directors to account. It is a powerful tool and we should not weaken it, which amendment No.821 and the new clause risk doing.</p>

 If such a requirement does not help to achieve the Bill&#146;s objective&#151;I do not believe that it does&#151;we should not include it. As someone who was involved in the audit profession, I know that, in the US, a tick-box mentality prevails and has led to a proscriptive audit approach, whereas the UK&#146;s audit approach continues to be based on the substance of transactions, and auditors judging what is true and fair. The latter is a much stronger framework and I believe that we can be satisfied with the UK corporate environment and corporate governance when compared with the position in which US corporate governance has sometimes found itself in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para0"><a name="06101834000283">Defining who would constitute a potential investor or customer in practical terms is such a broad concept as to be impossible to tie down meaningfully. In the case of a highly diversified company or a company that sells a wide product range, potential investors could have a variety of priorities that they wanted to highlight in a business review, and a vastly differing range of understanding of the company. Companies with a huge product range could have so many products that almost anyone could be classed as a potential customer. That is unworkable in the context of the business review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para1"><a name="06101834000284">Perhaps one of the most fundamental changes that the new clause proposes is the requirement for medium-sized companies to complete a full business review. Conservative Members believe that that would be excessively onerous, especially taken with new clause 2 and new clause 75, which deals with reporting standards and auditing the business review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para2"><a name="06101834000285">The Government estimated that the operating and financial review audit would cost business &#163;33 million. I am concerned that formalising reporting standards, as new clause 2 proposes, and requiring an audit of the business review, as new clause 75 proposes, would risk transforming the business review exercise into nothing more than a tick-box approach, whereby the quality of the substance of the business review took second place to ticking all the boxes of a reporting standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para3"><a name="06101834000286">Clause 510 provides that auditors must review whether the directors&#146; report is consistent with the accounts as a whole. The Bill therefore already contains a safeguard to ensure overall consistency. I am sure that hon. Members know that the Accounting Standards Board had prepared a robust reporting standard to use alongside the OFR. Once the OFR was amended and downgraded to a business review, the ASB similarly downgraded the reporting standard to a reporting statement. Nevertheless, it still provides clear best practice guidance to directors and their auditors on the expected content and quality of the report and can therefore provide some quality assurance in the business review narrative.</p>

and Industry, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#151;I know that because I was there&#151;and the business and investment community. However, last December, the Chancellor suddenly announced at a CBI dinner that he was shelving the OFR legislation. There was no consultation about the abrupt U-turn and the reasons that were given at the time to justify it do not bear examination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para10"><a name="06101834000296">It was argued that the statutory OFR was a prime example of gold-plating&#151;the normal argument that Whitehall and the CBI use&#151;EU legislation. The Chancellor said that it went beyond the requirements of the 2003 accounts modernisation directive. However, the OFR proposals predated the EU legislation by several years. Indeed, the OFR package was amended in 2004, but that was simply to ensure that it complied with the EU directive, not to enable it to go beyond it. Nor was the sudden shelving of the OFR legislation universally welcomed by industry. One had only to look at the <i> Financial Times</i> during that period to see a letter of protest from the Institute of Directors, no less. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06101834000297">It is highly relevant that, more recently, top executives from among the 14 largest FTSE companies&#151;the list reads like a roll-call of the senior ranks of British industry&#151;headed a delegation to the Prime Minister to demand that the Government regulate against climate change. I was delighted&#151;if slightly surprised&#151;by that. It showed, in contrast to the rather curmudgeonly remarks of the hon. Member for Putney about the attitude of British business, that those attitudes are beginning to change&#151;and not before time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para12"><a name="06101834000298">I suspect that that is the reason the Government are now&#151;in another excellent development&#151;considering producing a climate change Bill in the next Session. I very much welcome that, as someone who&#151;along with the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)&#151;is sponsoring a climate change Bill before Parliament that will require an annual 3 per cent. cut in greenhouse gas emissions in order to achieve what the scientists say is necessary to stabilise climate change, namely a 60 per cent. reduction in those emissions by 2050.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para13"><a name="06101834000299">For the purposes of this debate, the key point&#151;which we recognise in our Bill and I hope that the Government will recognise in their climate change Bill if it is forthcoming&#151;is that, in order to meet the unquestionably demanding targets, it is necessary to make regular measurements, sector by sector. That includes transportation, industry and the domestic sector. The measurements must also be made on a company-by-company basis. They must ascertain whether the targets are being met and, if they are not, determine what remedial action needs to be taken to get back on track. That is why the business review, as it is set out in the new clauses as a replacement for the lamented OFR, is absolutely essential.</p>

establishment of reporting in relation to carbon allowances. Would the Minister for Industry and the Regions like to touch on that letter when she responds to the debate, and tell the House how those reports can be incorporated? That matter certainly seems to be addressed in new clause 1.</p>

 I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will respond to my hon. Friend&#146;s request. The members of the Aldersgate Group, like others in the senior ranks of British industry, realise that that is the direction in which the international economy is going, and that, if we are to be smart, we need to be in there at an early stage, because, unquestionably, there will be a requirement to produce such a review in due course. This is not only a matter of environmental sensitivity but a good business move in relation to the bottom line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para14"><a name="06101834000302">The method adopted by the EU emissions trading system under the Kyoto protocol, which is highly relevant to the debate, is the national allocation plan. This requires each industry to reduce its emissions to a fixed lower level within a given time scale. The relevance of that is that the new clauses provide the framework by which those reductions can be achieved in two important ways. I am at one with my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth in strongly requesting the Government to reconsider their position on this. First, the national allocation plan, to which we have signed up, applies to all large and medium-sized public and private companies&#151;some 36,000 in all. That is still fewer than 1 per cent. of all companies, but it is significantly more than the 1,300 publicly listed companies covered by the Bill as it is drafted. The Aldersgate Group and the 14 key representatives of the big companies who went to see the Prime Minister are all concerned about the need for a level playing field. They do not want to be disadvantaged, and they therefore expect there to be a general requirement for the whole of business, including large private equity firms and foreign-owned private subsidiaries. The new clauses cover such businesses, but the Bill does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para15"><a name="06101834000303">Secondly, the new clauses would introduce a mandatory reporting standard. I strongly suggest that that is absolutely essential, because we have repeatedly tried to make voluntary codes of practice work. As a former Minister for the Environment, I speak with some anguish about this. We introduced a number of voluntary codes, but they were honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Voluntary codes of practice will never be observed, other than by a relatively small number of scrupulous and conscientious companies. They will certainly not be universally observed. If we want to establish a level playing field, the code of practice must be mandatory and universal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para16"><a name="06101834000304">There is also the question of placing burdens on business. We have only to open the papers today to see the CBI repeating its usual mantra. Even the hon. Member for Putney could not resist buzzing around it. Of course there is an initial outlay involved in meeting the proposals. The truth is, however, that having spent that relatively small sum, companies will start to measure their energy efficiency, their transport impacts, their waste generation, their water consumption and their  <br>

greenhouse gas emissions. They will then find, perhaps to their surprise, that once they have measured the waste and inefficiency that they were inadvertently generating, they will be able to make disproportionately larger savings. That is the key point: they will get a far bigger return for their initial outlay if they are required to assess the environmental impact of their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para17"><a name="06101834000305">Proof of that can be seen in the fact that mandatory social and environmental reporting is already being pursued in various forms in other successful competitor countries to our own, including the United States, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. I must underline strongly that sustainability is the friend of competitiveness. It is not a burden on it. For all those reasons, I hope that the Government will reconsider their position and accept new clauses 1 and 2. This would result in a win-win situation, not only for the environment&#151;important though that is&#151;but for the bottom line.</p>

That is what new clauses 1, 2 and 75, as well as our amendment (a) to new clause 1, are about. The business review is too narrow in a variety of ways, and the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton mentioned them all. In particular, it covers too few companies for the purposes for which we think it should be created. It does not cover the supply chain issue, although the Government have rightly introduced a proposal to correct that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para21"><a name="06101834000316">Most important for us is the fact that the new business review fails to have proper audit requirements. There is a general requirement of audit, as the hon. Member for Putney mentioned, but what is not contained in the business review, which was contained in the original OFR, is a requirement for auditors to report on matters that come to their attention that are inconsistent with what is in the business review. The wording that we have used in new clause 75 is precisely that which was in the original OFR regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="61018-0007.htm_para22"><a name="06101834000317">I suppose that it is fair to say that our starting point, and our reason for supporting new clauses 1, 2 and 75, is perhaps rather different from that of the Government and the Conservative party. We are interested not just in the risks that the company faces, from loss of reputation through to introducing policies that are environmentally unfriendly or socially irresponsible, and unwelcome&#151;from its point of view&#151;regulatory activity, but in helping to create a market for ethical investment and ethical consumption. That precise point is where we differ from the other parties, because that is our first concern as to what the business review should contain and how it should work.</p>

 Yes, I was coming to the size of the market. Ethical investment has probably got much further than ethical consumption, but even ethical investment is still not fully developed. Last year, ethical investment went through the &#163;10 billion barrier for the first time. That sounds like a lot of money, especially compared with gross household savings, which are about   <br>

&#163;40 billion. However, a lot of the funds moving into ethical investment are moving from existing investment funds, so the percentage of new investment&#151;new saving going into ethical investment&#151;is rather less than the quarter it appears to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para0"><a name="06101834000320">On the ethical consumption side, matters are far less well developed than that. A report by Co-operative Financial Services found that a third of UK consumers claim to be concerned about ethical consumption, yet only about 3 per cent. of the UK market for goods and services is clearly ethical in its production methods and aims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para1"><a name="06101834000321">We believe that ethical investment and ethical consumption have great power. They have the potential to change the world. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) talked about ending capitalism. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches take the traditional Keynesian view that our job is to make capitalism work for better ends. As Keynes said, eventually he knew which side of the barricades he would be on, but nevertheless capitalism has to be reformed if it is to be worth continuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para2"><a name="06101834000322">One problem, as we see it, is ethical consumers and ethical investors finding out whether the information out there about the behaviour of particular companies is believable, accurate and true. We believe that an expanded business review, especially with an audit requirement, would help those customers and investors to find out where their ethical pounds would be best placed. In that process, audit is crucial. That, again, is where we differ very strongly from the hon. Member for Putney.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06101834000323">Our view is that, without proper audit, the business review will turn into a marketing tool. Already, a large number of companies give the impression that they are environmentally and socially responsible, but not all their claims can be taken absolutely at face value. All too often, companies already do precisely what the hon. Lady said they would do if the audit requirement was introduced. They highlight isolated examples of good practice, but fail to mention the full picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06101834000324">Our view is that there is a threat in current unaudited practice to the whole ethical investment and consumption market. It would be a great shame&#151;even a disaster&#151;if corporate attempts to &#147;greenwash&#148; operations led to public distrust and cynicism about the process of ethical investment and consumption. The auditing of claims made in business review reports would help to concentrate the minds of those who write them and increase the trustworthiness of the information that they give.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06101834000325">As the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06101834000326">If the opportunity arises, we would like to press new clause 75 to a vote. It is independent of the success of new clauses 1 and 2. Even if those new clauses are not accepted today, although we hope they are, it will remain true that the audit requirement in the original OFR should be put back in place in the business review that the Government, at this stage, want to establish.</p>

 I wish to speak to new clause 2, which completes the circle and complements new clause 1, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett). Our new clauses combined have the backing of more than 50 Labour Members and I think that I am correct in saying that they have sizeable support among Liberal Democrat and nationalist Members. More importantly, they have the support of the Trade Justice Movement and the Corporate Responsibility Coalition, which, I am told, together represent more than 130 civil society organisations. I pay great tribute to those organisations for the campaign that they conducted across the country. I do not wish to sound pompous, but I hope that most right-minded members of the British public support the new clauses, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06101834000328">New clause 2 is rather like me and my politics: it is modest, thoughtful and rational. It is linked to this timely Bill, which is the biggest in parliamentary history&#151;it has more than 1,200 clauses and was eight years in the making. The Bill goes a long way towards setting reasonable standards on corporate social responsibility, which the country, the environment and the world desperately need. I sincerely congratulate the Government on their efforts to produce forward-thinking legislation. Some Members, and perhaps some exhausted Clerks and Officers of the House, may question the necessity for further amendments or new clauses to a colossal Bill, so I shall explain why we introduced our new clauses. I always try to keep my contributions brief and incisive, and I shall endeavour to do so today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06101834000329">The right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), who spoke on behalf of the Opposition in Standing Committee, have both praised BP&#146;s environmental record, so the company provides a relevant case study. BP was praised for taking corporate social responsibility very seriously, but that is qualified by the fact that the company spends a significant amount of money on selling its CSR reputation. That is part of a much wider problem. All too often, companies spend vast sums of money projecting a positive image of themselves as green or ethical organisations&#151;it is obviously not only political parties that do so&#151;and do not spend enough money or time on the real issues that we aim to deal with under the Bill. Those are issues of shaping, guiding and ultimately changing the behaviour of the transnational companies whose activities have an extremely serious impact on our environment, climate and communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06101834000330">Hon. Members on both sides of the House regularly&#151;and rightly&#151;voice concerns about climate change and our environment, and several Members have already alluded to the subject. For many people, that is the central challenge of our times, and that belief is shared by the wider public. To refer to my case study, in the past financial year, only 5 per cent. of BP&#146;s investment went into alternative energy. By comparison, 72 per cent. went into fossil fuels. That puts it only slightly ahead of competitors such as Shell. As one of Shell&#146;s shareholders, and as a representative of a party that is going green, the hon. Member for Huntingdon may wish to raise that with BP&#146;s directors at an appropriate time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06101834000331">Regrettably, BP has been associated with a range of what can only be classed as negative environmental impacts and human rights abuses, from the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline to the Alaskan oil spill. This summer in Texas, the Rev. Jesse Jackson led protests against BP over price-fixing, employment discrimination and health and safety violations, following the Texas City explosion. In fact, BP has one of the worst records for health and safety in the US oil refinery sector. Moving down the continent, in July it settled a court case with a group of Colombian farmers who were forced off their land by paramilitaries so that BP could build a pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06101834000332">By way of comparison&#151;I want to be even-handed&#151;Shell&#146;s corporate social responsibility record causes equal consternation. Shell, too, is a big spender on the generation of positive PR, but it is less energetic in making attempts to moderate the negative impact of its commercial activities in the countries and communities in which it operates. For instance, the exposure of Shell workers to toxic pesticides in Brazil has resulted in severe medical problems for the work force. Shell has been forced to take steps to protect workers, but it still will not guarantee treatment for conditions that have developed as a result of that toxic exposure. Its joint venture in Port Arthur emits massive quantities of toxins known to damage human cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Some 80 per cent. of Port Arthur&#146;s residents suffer from heart conditions and respiratory problems, whereas the regional rate is 30 per cent. among people who do not live near an oil refinery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06101834000333">Those are negative examples from just two companies. They have been sourced and exposed through local legal challenges to the companies in question, and thanks to the endeavours of environmental NGOs. Of course, we cannot make meaningful, objective comparisons between companies such as BP and Shell because neither is forced to report on their activities in a manner that conforms to a level, comprehensive standard that can be easily understood by everyone. That is the crux of my argument. The examples that I have given show how irresponsible behaviour can damage the long-term interests of the company, its customers and shareholders. Companies must understand those factors if they, in turn, are to understand their position and its risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para13"><a name="06101834000334">A central plank of the Bill is that, through reporting obligations, shareholders and investors can vote with their wallets and choose not to invest in unethical or environmentally irresponsible companies. Self-evidently, that is worth while only if companies are forced to publish things that they do not want to publish. At present, I understand that there are up to six sets of voluntary reporting guidelines that companies can consult for an indication of what non-financial information to include in their reports. That is exactly why we need a common, mandatory and auditable standard of environmental and social reporting, so that we can cut through the spin and make a judgment on the substance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para14"><a name="06101834000335">To some extent, what the Bill overlooks&#151;and what Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition fundamentally misunderstand when they talk about CSR being a unique selling point&#151;is that CSR is what companies do, not what they represent, report or claim to have done. It is not about what they  <br>

say, but about what they do. New clause 2 would allow customers and shareholders to judge the situation objectively. If it was accepted, it would require reporting standards in business reviews to be set by a relevant body, and compliance with those standards would mean compliance with the requirements of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06101834000336">The lack of a reporting standard is perhaps the most glaring gap in the Bill. The original operating and financial review regulations were accompanied by such a standard, issued by the Accounting Standards Board, to provide companies with guidance on what information they should include. The standard was intended to be a clear template, setting out the types of key performance indicator that could be used by companies to ensure that they complied with the law. The new clause would introduce similar mandatory standards for the business review. That is an issue of major importance for the Corporate Responsibility Coalition, the Trade Justice Movement and the many Labour Members who believe that mandatory guidance is essential to ensure that the information in business reviews is meaningful and comparable across companies, down the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para16"><a name="06101834000337">Standards help to reduce businesses&#146; compliance costs, and they have been called for by a number of other stakeholders in the debate, including the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Without such a provision, it will be the responsibility of the directors of each company to determine the content of the business review and what indicators to use. That would make it impossible to compare one company with another, or the same company&#146;s performance year on year. Shareholders would not be able to assess how their company is performing compared with its competitors, or whether its performance is improving over time&#151;I would have thought that that was self-evident. Without being able to do so, it will be difficult to judge how directors have performed their duties. The absence of reporting standards thus undermines the whole concept of enlightened shareholder value as enshrined in the heart of the Bill. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06101834000338">It would also be useful for directors to have a clear benchmark and a model to follow, so that they can be confident that they are compliant with the law rather than competing models, which can result in confusion. The new clause, tabled by me and about 50 other Members, allows reasonable latitude in framing the reporting standard, which should address concerns that too strict a reporting standard will place too heavy a burden on businesses and could deter business growth&#151;an argument we hear a great deal. As we have seen with other European nations, such as Sweden and Denmark, that is patently not the case. Allowing complete freedom to directors to decide how they report goes too far in a direction that, in my view, is wrong, and undermines the entire concept of reporting and its role in delivering enlightened shareholder value. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="61018-0008.htm_para18"><a name="06101834000339">This is an historic opportunity to make a decent Bill better, at a time when the ramifications of its details have never been more important in Britain and, I would argue, throughout the world.

Will she seriously consider, mindful of the Bill as it currently stands, how companies could be encouraged to comply with the suggested voluntary guidance? Statutory standards would, of course, present consequences to companies who fail to adhere to them. Is not a voluntary code by definition rather toothless, unless there is at least some level of supported implementation? Does she actively recommend to companies full compliance with any voluntary guidance? How robust does she expect her outstanding powers of persuasion to be?

When we consider that the joint stock corporation, as it used to be called, or limited liability company has been around for 200 years, this Bill and these amendments make a small, modest step towards restoring the balance of power with regard to the rights and responsibilities&#151;to use the well-worn new Labour phrase&#151;of corporations. For too long, companies have operated in a privileged twilight world beyond the reach of accountability. We have heard a lot of debate about veils recently. This Bill and the amendments are about lifting the corporate veil and providing not just shareholders, but for society as a whole&#151;employees, communities and campaign groups&#151;with reliable, up-to-date, accessible information about corporate responsibility and the impact of companies on society. </p>

In terms of the broader context of the Bill and these amendments, it is therefore essential that we hold companies that have such an impact on our society and the world as a whole to account for their actions. After all, many of the ills faced by society today, whether environmental degradation or social injustice and inequality, do not stem from governmental action or inaction but from corporate  <br>

I am in good company here, because Adam Smith was against the whole notion of providing shareholders with a get-out clause. In this case, therefore, the hon.

The new clause has good intentions, but in practice it embodies the principle &#147;Think bureaucratic first&#148;.

I suggest that bureaucratic regulation often fails to achieve the desired outcome. There can be perverse, unintended consequences. What enlightened shareholder value does is allow more citizen engagement in how companies operate. Those of us who care about issues such as sustainable development and fair trade, and wish to combat exploitation, surely want an environment in which the citizen campaigner is complemented by the citizen consumer. We can now go into a shop and see half a dozen different fairly traded coffees, which was not the case a few years ago. We also want the citizen shareholder to have an impact. What we want is not a tick-box environment, but intelligent engagement by companies. That is where I agree with the hon. Member for Putney. The Bill retains &#147;true and fair&#148; as the accountancy standard, for instance, which is extremely important.</p>

Surely there are lessons to be learned from our success in recent years in encouraging small companies to promote entrepreneurship.</p>

Moreover, there is nothing to prevent companies from reporting in a way that is not required by law if that proves useful to shareholders for reasons of transparency. It would be good for their reputations, demonstrating that they were working responsibly.</p>

Although in my view the amount of time allocated to Report could and should have been greater, some shameful remarks were made by Conservative Members who had not had the benefit of experiencing the Committee stage. I find myself in the unusual position of defending a Minister by seeking to put the record straight. The Minister did consult, and she did accommodate helpful suggestions and proposals from Liberal Democrats, Labour Members and those in other parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="61018-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06101860000020">Even the Minister, however, has been unable to accommodate the wish of both Labour and Opposition Members to retain the operating and financial review. It was certainly not her fault that her boss-to-be, the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;in a moment of madness, and apparently without consultation with any of his parliamentary colleagues&#151;made a rash promise last November which he thought would appease big business. I refer to his promise to scrap the OFR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="61018-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06101860000021">The Chancellor thought that he would please business. In fact, he has angered many first-class businesses that had already begun to incorporate the requirements of the OFR in their business reporting. A report in today&#146;s <i> Times </i>estimates that just under 50 per cent. of top UK companies have done so. I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) that the OFR is a waste of time, and apparently those companies do not agree with her either. Meanwhile, we are left with the somewhat weakened imitation that is the business review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61018-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06101860000024">Our amendment to new clause 1 is designed to widen the scope of the review to accommodate ethical investors&#151;that growing band of individuals who base their investment decisions at least partially on the ethical behaviour of the company. That is hugely important. Clearly, that type of investor cannot make informed decisions if the information is not there; they cannot make them based on pious words or spin. New clause 75 gives auditors the power to check the accuracy of the report and provides for a duty to report any anomalies, specifically with regard to the contents of the business review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="61018-0009.htm_para12"><a name="06101860000025">That requirement will provide two things of great value to companies.

seeking to ingratiate himself with business by appearing to be a man keen to reduce regulation and reduce costs. He should know about costs, Mr. Deputy Speaker. British Chambers of Commerce has estimated the cumulative cost to business of implementing new Government regulations since this Government came to power at &#163;50 billion. The cost of implementing these proposals, over and above the existing regulatory impact assessment, is only an additional &#163;30 million. If the Government were to approve an extension to all large private companies, the cost would be an additional &#163;144 million. I am sure hon.

 I shall speak briefly in support of new clauses 1 and 2, but I also want to speak to some other amendments tabled by myself and my hon. Friends. They further the same principle of keeping companies accountable by reporting&#151;in other words, by asking them to say what they have done in certain areas. The sort of reporting envisaged in amendments Nos. 801 and 820, which we are proposing, cannot be subject to the usual Tory accusation that while companies spend millions on public relations, telling us what they have done, any expenditure on reporting to tell us what they have done is likely to put people out of work and cause companies to flee to some other jurisdiction. The amendments escape that criticism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61018-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06101860000031">Amendment No. 801 tackles a basic issue, on which I would have hoped the Department of Trade and Industry had collaborated with the Inland Revenue and Treasury, as they both want to restrict the use of transfer pricing to launder profits into other jurisdictions either for avoiding tax or for money-laundering purposes. It is an important fact that FTSE 100 companies have 1,500 subsidiaries through which profits can be laundered. Indeed, 60 per cent. of world trade goes through multinationals. Bearing that in mind, something has to be done about transfer pricing, and amendment No. 801 actually does it.</p>

UNESCO has also had some inquiries. From tax inquiries and congressional hearings in the US, it has emerged that the more flagrant examples of transfer pricing include, for instance, importing plastic buckets from the Czech Republic at $972 each, fence posts from Canada at $1,800 each and a kilo of toilet paper from China at $4,121.

launder money out of one jurisdiction into another. Lower prices, going the other way, include prefabricated buildings to Trinidad at $1.20 per building and bulldozers to Venezuela at $387. In that way, tax obligations in one jurisdiction can be avoided and money can be laundered through to another jurisdiction, so it is important that we know what is going on.</p>

They are already tackling royalty payments by IBM, and Vodafone is currently locked in a transfer pricing discussion. We should get companies to declare what transfer pricing policies they are using and to report at constant market prices so that we know what is being done. It is public information and not a great burden on companies. Indeed, Henderson Global Investors, one of the largest institutional investors, has openly called for transfer pricing disclosures so that investors can know where the money is coming from, what is happening to it, where the profits are being generated and where tax has been paid. As I say, it is an important piece of investor information.</p>

 The next group will have to be voted on at 3 pm as well, and the principle is exactly the same&#151;the publication of information by companies so that markets and the authorities know what is going on. That applies to amendment No. 820, which deals with the publication of the highest and lowest annual earnings by employees, the number of UK-based workers and the gap between male and female earnings. All the years of pressure to equal up pay and to take action against low pay have not succeeded to the extent that is socially necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61018-0009.htm_para19"><a name="06101860000038">If we require companies to report on what they are doing, it may well prove a way of bringing pressure to bear on them in the face of a glaring scandal. There are massively high pay levels at the top in comparison with exploitation and low wages at the bottom. Between 1997 and 2004, the average FTSE 100 chief executive&#146;s total annual pay rose by 80 per cent. to &#163;1.7 million. Pay at the bottom did not increase in anything like the same way, so the gaps are becoming ever more glaring. The only way to deal with the problem is to let people know what is going on and for companies to report on what they are doing. If companies want their enterprises to be run as a body, co-operating in order to advance the company and achieve greater shareholder value, they should be proud of their pay record and proud of what they are doing to provide incentives for their lowest-paid workers, particularly women.</p>

Massive public relations campaigns are taking place and millions of dollars are being spent in America on publishing that information, yet the Conservative Opposition in this country are niggling that any further obligations on companies will bring them crashing down around our ears, sending them into tax havens overseas and causing them to fire large numbers of workers. Those are ridiculous accusations to launch against what amounts to a simple principle of social justice and open government&#151;that companies should be open and should be required to publish information, as Government Departments, public authorities and everybody else in our democracy has to. They are part of the fabric of society, and they must maintain their responsibilities to the fabric of society.

As our leading British companies and businesses recognise, businesses will prosper best, will be sustainable for the longer term and will grow faster when they act in an enlightened way. Businesses do not operate in a vacuum; they operate within communities and as part of society. All responsible businesses recognise what they do and how they do it impacts on the community in which they operate and more widely in society. All responsible businesses take account of the economic, social, environmental and human rights implications and impacts of what they achieve. By improving the way in which companies report on their activities and by enhancing the transparency of that reporting, the clause will make it easier for shareholders to hold directors to account.</p>

Friend the Member for Hemsworth. All companies, except small companies, will have to prepare a business review. Most companies, such as the Virgins and the Asdas, will choose of their own volition to incorporate many of the issues that we are debating when they prepare that review. However, we have exempted large private companies from having to comply with the fifth element of clause 423 for a particular reason&#151;because there is a difference between the position of a private company and a public company. A quoted company has dispersed shareholders and operates in a regulated market for its shares, and we believe that that requires a greater degree of statutory underpinning for transparency and scrutiny than for companies that are privately held. However, all companies, including Thames Water, will have to report with a business review.</p>

It was in response to the representations that we had from all stakeholders that we brought forward the amendment to the business review. Of course I will meet, as I always do, the business representatives who may be concerned about this, but our slight amendment just reflects what was in the original company law review.</p>

It remains the directors&#146; judgment to decide what is relevant in the supply chain for them to report on. Nothing is changed by the amendment. It does not require companies to list their suppliers and it is not about miles and miles of paperwork.

We have not gone down the road of giving standards a statutory underpinning, because we think that new clause 2 would encourage a box-ticking culture rather than encourage directors to think about the issues on which they are reporting.

I will closely monitor implementation of the clause in practice to make sure that it leads companies to provide meaningful and useful narrative reporting on issues relevant to the particular company. Specifically, I will ask my officials to conduct an assessment of whether our provisions are working in the way that we hope two years after the implementation of the business review provisions of the Bill. We will consult business, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders as part of that process, and it will be open to us to return to the issue if the law does not work in the way we intend. We have the power in the Bill to add to the contents of the business review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="61018-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06101860000054">Finally, it is important to say to those who have been pressing for more movement on the review that I have seen the corporate social responsibility agenda develop over time. Provisions that are controversial today but are adopted by some, become widespread tomorrow. It is an evolving agenda as there is greater acceptance of the wider responsibilities of a company. I believe that companies will change and that their role in the community will change. It is on that basis that I ask hon. Members not to press their new clauses and amendments.</p>

The initial Bill that was presented in the House of Lords contained little on the matter. However, after several thousand shareholders in GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical group, started to receive threatening letters from animal rights terrorists, Lord Sainsbury, on direct orders from above and urged on by a chorus of vocal peers, suddenly promised on Report to reconsider the Government&#146;s position before Third Reading in the Lords, when amendments were indeed tabled and slipped into the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06101860001105">In any event, this is about more than protecting companies that practice animal testing, although that is the matter on which I have direct experience, as I explained to the hon. Gentleman. This is about the kind of environment that we offer for people who invest in business in this country. Just as the protection of the person must be a priority for the Government, the protection of companies and their shareholders must also be a priority. Without that protection, business will simply pick up and go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06101860001106">I point out, with some irony, that several speakers in the Lords debate and several journalists have made out that the GSK letter incident was a new and dangerous development. That was not the case. Attacks on shareholders have become an established theme of anti-corporate activism. Although direct action, sometimes slipping into terrorist activity, is emanating from animal rights activists today, the same methods could be used tomorrow by other groups. If drug manufacturers, animal testing companies and furriers are affected now, meat importers, road builders, handbag manufacturers, furniture makers or mining companies could be affected tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06101860001107">I emphasise the fact that countering criminal activity using shareholders&#146; registers goes much further than dealing with extremists. Another significant example of such activity is the growth of foreign-based so-called boiler rooms. They harvest the personal details of individuals from members&#146; registers and approach those shareholders to try to persuade them to buy investments that are often worthless, regularly by implying that there is a connection with the company concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06101860001108">A court case recently revealed that fraudsters had been using registers to steal shares from overseas investors. The <i> Financial Times </i>reported in May that the company secretary of Balfour Beatty wrote to the company&#146;s 20,000 shareholders after receiving a significant number of complaints. I received a separate letter from Balfour Beatty that outlined the company&#146;s concerns about the situation. Diageo wrote to 110,000 shareholders after similar calls were made to its members.</p>

 I have a great deal of sympathy with the point that my hon. Friend is making, but I have a reservation about new clause 16. As far as I can tell, if the Secretary of State decided to grant the request of the applicant, there would be no process whereby his decision could be reviewed, say by judicial review. Does my hon.

is speaking rather more widely than to just new clauses 16 and 17 because he is addressing amendment No. 383. That amendment would make the new clauses redundant because it would confer on any shareholder the right to remove his name from the share register that is made publicly available.</p>

<p><a name="st_o178"><a name="06101860001112"><a name="61018-0011.htm_spnew8"><a name="06101860003966"><b>Mr. Djanogly:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman pre-empts me because I have some way to go before I get on to amendment No. 383. The amendment was proposed by an outside body as an alternative suggestion. I thought that it was worth tabling the amendment so that we could hear the Minister&#146;s response to it, given that it is a sensible suggestion. However, it does not tally with our approach in the new clauses, which I will support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06101860001113">I thank the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators for the action that it is taking on boiler rooms. The institute recently announced that it had produced a warning notice to be used by companies to raise awareness of boiler rooms. The notice can be distributed to shareholders with other mailings or via websites. We feel that that is a positive move against operators of boiler rooms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06101860001114">We need to appreciate that many, if not most, of the companies affected by the problem are far from large companies such as GSK. They are usually small family businesses for which a civil injunction costing thousands of pounds against illegality or terror would often be unaffordable. More to the point, such companies are saying, &#147;Is it not for the Government to defend us against terrorist activity, rather than our having to pay for an injunction?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06101860001115">Where do shareholders fit into all this? I have tried to explain that the debate is multifaceted and highly interconnected. Activists will often look for weak points&#151;the points at which with the minimum number of people they can inflict the maximum damage, be that to property, people or the company&#146;s economic prospects. Many companies will fold under such a concerted and multi-directional attack, but some companies that believe in what they are doing and refuse to be scared by intimidation will trade on&#151;companies such as HLS and Montpelier, the company that is building the Oxford laboratories. In both those cases, the crisis was sparked by terrorists attacking the companies&#146; shareholders via the register of members. At that point, HLS, unable to survive as a company registered in this country because of the hate mail and death threats being sent to its shareholders, repatriated itself to Maryland, USA, and relisted on the US NASDAQ exchange. Why Maryland? Because in that state only holders of 5 per cent. or more of a company&#146;s shares have to be disclosed, and then only to other shareholders. We are not advocating that approach for the United Kingdom, but the case does show what will happen if we do not get on top of the problem: other companies will leave the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para16"><a name="06101860001116">To amplify the importance of the issue, let us examine the case of Montpelier in Oxford. The company bravely resisted the attacks of the terrorists, but finally stopped work when its shareholders started to be threatened and attacked. As a relatively small listed company, its share price was directly affected by that activity, so a direct link could be made between access to a register of members and impending disaster for the company. Roughly the same tactics were used in  <br>

the terrorist attack on GSK shareholders as in the HLS and Montpelier cases. The letters to GSK shareholders stated:</p>

We are therefore giving you this opportunity to sell your shares in GlaxoSmithKline. If you have any doubts over the effectiveness of this action then keep a close eye on the GSK share price and watch it plummet.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06101860001118">If we do not get on top of this problem, we will see many more Huntingdon Life Sciences&#151;many more companies repatriating. We can have whatever tax regime we like; if a company&#146;s shareholders are going to be attacked physically, the company will be forced to consider moving. To put the pharmaceutical sector alone into perspective, it contributes more than &#163;6.5 billion a year to Britain&#146;s GDP and &#163;12 billion in exports, and employs 80,000 people directly and 250,000 indirectly. The issue is a serious one for this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06101860001119">I have attempted to explain the need to protect shareholders&#146; details, so how should we now proceed? My first point is that, as things stand, a coach and horses can be driven through the Bill&#146;s provisions, because, in addition to the current register of members being accessible, copies of the register of members as at the return date need to be filed annually with the annual return, which is a publicly accessible document. In Committee in the Lords, Ministers said that they would consider introducing regulations to change that requirement, but why not simply add the relevant provisions to the Bill? We tabled an amendment for that purpose, which we hope to move when&#151;or if&#151;we reach part 25, which deals with annual returns, in the latter part of tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06101860001120">Since that time, there has been Government confusion on the issue. In Committee, the Minister for Industry and the Regions suggested that our proposal on annual returns was too restrictive, but the Secretary of State has said that he intends to use regulations to ensure that a company need supply only details of shareholdings of 5 per cent. or more in its annual return. I shall be grateful if the Solicitor-General makes clear the Government&#146;s intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="61018-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06101860001121">The formula chosen by the Government is for the company to initiate an application to the court if it objects to a request to see the register. One problem that we have identified is that, although it may be possible for a large company to instruct lawyers&#151;probably solicitors and barristers&#151;to take the matter to court within five days to comply with the Bill&#146;s provisions, although it would probably be pushed to do so, it would be unrealistic to expect a smaller company to keep to such a tight and inconvenient timetable. That is why we tabled amendment No. 384, which would increase from five days to 15 the period in which a request that a person be deemed unsuitable to receive the register must be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06101860001122">In Committee, the Minister&#146;s response was that a company of any size should be aware of a suspect application straight away, and that if company directors were given too long, there would be a risk of abuse on the part of the company. However, in its brief of 2 October, the Confederation of British Industry stated that it did not regard an extension of the period as an invitation to abuse the application process, but as  <br>

an opportunity for companies to consider whether requests were for a proper purpose or not, to take advice, and to respond appropriately. We continue to support the CBI&#146;s view, and that is another reason why we tabled amendment No. 384.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06101860001123">The Government intend to provide that people have to identify the purpose for which the information is to be used. We tabled a probing amendment in Committee stating that that information should be precise. For example, what if the reason given is that the applicant wants &#147;to inform shareholders of an important matter for themselves, the company, humanity, or the environment&#148; without stating that he or she intends to ask shareholders to sell their shares as a protest? As hon. Members can see, this could be a complicated matter. In Committee, the Minister did not accept that our proposed amendment would add much to the definition of proper purpose, but we think that it would be helpful if the Government at least issued some guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06101860001124">A further approach, which we see as being complementary to the Government&#146;s approach, is to provide companies and individuals with the right to apply to the court to close the register if the availability of the register creates, or is likely to create, a serious risk that a member of the company or connected parties will be subject to violence or intimidation. In other words, not all companies would be thrown into the same basket. Some companies or individuals may be at such risk or under such pressure that they should be treated on a stand-alone basis. The provisions could be tacked on to the existing provisions as a further level of protection, which might be more realistic, more accessible and certainly cheaper for smaller companies that need protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06101860001125">Furthermore, the existing clause works only for a company to seek protection in respect of all its members. It does not provide for an individual member to seek to protect his or her details. We therefore tabled new clause 17 to allow for that. The theme of individual rights to allow people to protect themselves, rather than relying on the company to seek protection for them, has also been taken up by the CBI. Our final amendment, No. 383, as I mentioned earlier, was proposed by the CBI for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06101860001126">The amendment is complementary to the issue of directors&#146; home addresses and allows for the home address of a registered shareholder in a listed company or a company traded on a regulated market not to be disclosed if the shareholder does not wish it. In short, the shareholder has a legal right to require that his home address be omitted from the register of members which the company may be asked to supply to a third party, and from the public register of shareholders maintained at Companies House. In the past, the Government have told us that that is unnecessary because shareholders can use nominees. In practice, many smaller shareholders will not do that, so we see the CBI&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06101860001127">In Committee the Liberal Democrats provided a further option, which we thought was worthy of consideration. Their amendment provided for a company, by members&#146; resolution, to stop inspections of the register of members, on the basis that it agrees to pass on lawful communications. Although we thought that was a step too far in terms of restricting access to the  <br>

register, we can see the importance of the second strand of the Liberal Democrat amendment. If the register is closed, the company must take on the responsibility of passing on communications. We therefore tabled new clause 16, reflecting our joint proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06101860001128">The Minister dismissed our comments on this point in Committee as &#147;very wide ranging&#148;. She was concerned that we were restricting long-held principles on public access to the register of members. That is not the case. All we are doing is allowing a court in extremis to protect the small minority of companies whose details are highly sensitive, for whatever reason. That would never be an everyday occurrence and a court decision to close the register would be taken only on a company by company basis and, I imagine, very carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06101860001129">Amendment No. 683 tabled by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) deals with initial shareholders. I believe that is covered by the Bill as drafted, although the Minister may wish to elaborate on the point. With reference to amendment No. 358, the register is a register of legal owners. We have supported the concept of giving rights, votes and information in particular to beneficial owners of shares. We were delighted to see the Government move on the matter. However, we see no reason to change the underlying nature of ownership split between legal and beneficial owners. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s views.</p>

 I shall speak briefly against new clauses 16 and 17 and amendment No. 383.

Essentially, they have to do with regulation, law enforcement and the shareholder protection regime in the UK. However, I shall have to repeat some of the arguments, as the Conservatives clearly have not listened. I shall pay a compliment to the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth).

But the police have not been beating a path to my door saying that a clause such as this is essential to help them to prosecute the perpetrators. More fundamentally and importantly, investors, the Association of British Insurers, the British pension funds, City banks and the stock exchange are also not clamouring for clauses such as this in the Companies Act because they are aware of the wider consequences for shareholder protection and company regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06101860001133">The reason for that is that new clauses 16 and 17 are drawn extremely widely. Amendment No. 383 institutes an absolute right to shareholder secrecy, and I note the comments of the hon. Member for Huntingdon on my intervention that he will not put that to a vote later. Like him, I do not take that amendment very seriously, but even the new clauses are drawn extremely widely. The test is that the company has to show that its members or their families run the risk of being subject to violence and intimidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06101860001134">In Committee, I gave an example from my days as an investigative journalist when I pursued a bank director in Russia whom I considered to be a dodgy stockbroker. He was pursuing various deals in Moscow, which in those days during liberalisation was the equivalent of the wild east. Because he had a grudge against a number of other people whom he came up against in negotiations, he let it be known that one particular director of a Dutch bank was the blocking point to a big deal with Gazprom. The Dutch bank director&#146;s house in Moscow was subsequently set on fire when his family was in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06101860001135">In such circumstances, a major bank might come to the Secretary of State and say that it operates in Russia or in a lawless country and that there is a severe danger that if the identities and addresses of not only their employees but their shareholders are disclosed, they may be subject to the risk of violence and intimidation. The companies that are most difficult to regulate and enforce laws against, and funnily enough that are most regularly involved in fraud, are the very same companies that operate offshore. They are usually small companies, operating in dangerous environments. To institute a right on their behalf of secrecy of membership would make regulation and shareholder protection much more difficult.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman made a number of important comments in Committee, which have influenced thinking on both sides of the House. However, his point that the police and investigative journalists would be excluded has been taken into account in the drafting of new clause 16, which is very different from the provision that we discussed in Committee. New clause 16(5) would allow the Secretary of State to prescribe circumstances in which the information would be given to, for example, the authorities. The hon.

 I take the hon.

If a company were to tell them that there was serious risk of violence and they said, &#147;I do not believe it&#148;, if the violence were to occur, then the Secretary of State would be damned. Equally, if they were to grant an order and the company turned out to be fraudulent, they would be damned again.</p>

 The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) has described the circumstances that have given rise to new clauses 16 and 17. I agree with other hon.

Clauses 117 and 118 go a long way towards protecting shareholders in the circumstances of violence and intimidation that have been described. The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), who has made several important contributions to the debate, exaggerates rather when he says that this extra bit of protection is a fundamental threat, but the existing clauses are not. In fact, the distance between what the Government propose and what the new clause proposes is very small.</p>

 I was going to come that later, but we may as well deal with it now. The hon. Gentleman refuted his own point as he made it. He said that the Secretary of State will face two possible errors, both of which would be equally embarrassing. His conclusion that they would always err on the side of caution was not shown by his remarks, because that would be true only if the error in one direction was more embarrassing than that in the other direction.</p>

 The problem with clause 117 is that the court must know what are the motives of the person seeking the inspection, yet they would often have a covert motive that would not be known to the court.</p>

 I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his comment. That is a significant problem with the way in which clause 117 is drafted&#151;namely, in terms of purposes. As he says, it is often difficult for courts to have access to the purposes of individuals. Subsection (4) makes use of that concept when it refers to</p>
<a name="61018-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="06101860002870"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;requests made for a similar purpose&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06101860001159">The other problem is that clause 117(4) says that the court</p>
<a name="61018-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="06101860002871"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;may direct that the company is not to comply with any such request.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61018-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06101860001160">That means that the company could be subject to continued harassment in the courts whereby people could make a new request saying that it is not for similar purposes and is therefore not such a request. Even if the court had made an order under clause 117(4), the company, especially in the case of a small business or a business without much in the way of resources, could come under great pressure from organised campaigners working on behalf of people whose purposes were probably nefarious. There is therefore a problem with the protection that clause 117(4) provides. That leads to the question of what other protection might be offered in such circumstances.</p>

 I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is an expert in law and I am sure that that applies to company law, too.

review. That is not the full system of independent review that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) mentioned; nevertheless it is an important safeguard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06101860001166">Let me outline what makes the new clause much narrower than the proposal that was made in Committee and therefore acceptable. First, it would provide for the Secretary of State to prescribe circumstances in which, despite the closure of the register, information could be given out. That is an important difference between the proposal that was made in Committee and the new clause. As I said earlier, it deals with the problem of investigative authorities, perhaps even investigative journalists, being locked out of proper investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06101860001167">Secondly, the new clause includes an important element of our original proposal. The closure of the register should not prevent people from getting legitimate, lawful information to shareholders. The purpose is to prevent the violent intimidation of shareholders, not stop information getting to them. We proposed that a company that wished to invoke the new procedure should undertake, at a reasonable fee, to direct to its shareholders any information sent to it for them. The new clause maintains the right balance. Often, there are legitimate campaigns, even in industrial relations, and it is important that people get information to shareholders, perhaps over directors&#146; heads. An important point about openness and transparency was made in Committee. The new clause preserves at least the essence of the proposal that was made in Committee.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman direct me to where the new clause would safeguard openness and transparency in circumstances in which the company constituted the block and had thus taken advantage of the measure to keep members secret? Secondly, will he direct me to provisions in new clauses 16 and 17 for a right of appeal against the Secretary of State&#146;s decision?</p>

 On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, there is no right of appeal but there is always a right of judicial review. To answer his first point, I would draw his attention to subsections (7), (8) and (9), which provide for a system to be set up by which a company has to pass on information subject to the charging of a reasonable fee, and which determine that failure to do so is a crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06101860001170">It is ironic that some of us have been worried about the extent to which the Bill uses criminal penalties. It is perhaps a legitimate criticism of the Bill that it seems to go first to the criminal law, rather than using it as a last resort. Having listened to the views of the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme and others, however, I believe that it would be justified, if there were a serious risk that the provision would not be complied with, to back that right with a criminal penalty. The hon. Gentleman is right to think that there might be a connection between closing a register and not wanting information to be passed on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06101860001171">The proposal in new clause 16 is worth while, but it will not be used very often.

pressure on the Secretary of State, but I disagree. I think that this is just the kind of decision that Secretaries of State are employed to make, and I am sure that if they did not do it very well, their decisions would be subject to judicial review and perhaps also to the scrutiny of the House.</p>

 I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument with care, but I am still not sure why he takes the view that the decision should be made not by the courts&#151;as set out in clause 117&#151;but by the Secretary of State, with the safeguard of having the courts in the background. What is the point of this? I cannot follow the nub of his argument as to why the Secretary of State should make this decision, rather than the court.</p>

 Perhaps the difference is that, under clause 117, the test is that of proper purpose, whereas under new clause 16, the question is one of risk. The two do not necessarily overlap.</p>

 That is absolutely correct. They are different concepts in terms of what has to be found, although either the Secretary of State or a judge could find in either instance. It is a close judgment between whether the Secretary of State or a court should do this. I have a preference for the Secretary of State, because the kind of circumstances that are likely to arise are so varied that the Secretary of State would be in a better position to judge all the different circumstances. He would also be in a slightly better position to gather all the evidence. If, however, one were to take the view that a court would be in a better position to gather the evidence and to take advice, one could establish the same system using a court. The question would then be: would the Government and the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme accept the new clause on those terms?</p>

 The question does not really apply, because the new clause does not say that. These are the new clauses that we shall be asked to vote on later. I find it odd that the proponents of smaller government on the Conservative Benches, and the Liberal Democrats, who are proponents of more devolved government, should believe that this is the kind of decision that should be taken by the Secretary of State, day in, day out, rather than by a court, where the case could be put in far more detail.</p>

 These decisions would not be taken day in, day out. One of the important aspects of the proposal is that it would be used only rarely and sparingly. There are also policy matters behind the proposal, as has been revealed in the debate. As I have said, it is a close judgment as to whether a court or the Secretary of State should make these decisions, but on the whole, I believe that the Secretary of State is in a better position to make them, subject to judicial review.  <br>

check people&#146;s credit or even check their existence. Because the electoral roll could be used in that fashion, should we not publish it? We cannot negate a fundamental principle of shareholder democracy to avert the action of a few people, which is wrong and which can be prosecuted through other means.</p>

That is what gives this corporate body that we have introduced an identity. For instance, my amendment No. 758 would stop the use of nominee names. Shareholders in Huntingdon Life Sciences could have used nominee names if they did not want their names to be known, but I would stop that practice entirely, because if people use nominee names, what is the use of a register?</p>

Let&#146;s keep our registers secret so that no one knows who is investing in us.&#148; That principle would apply not only to Huntingdon Life Sciences, but to the arms trade or the tobacco industry. It could be very wide ranging, and any company in an industry that is subject to public criticism could designate itself as doing something shady, so that it has to hide its operations. If we had legalised brothels, as in New Zealand, the companies running those brothels, which might indeed be indulging in nefarious activities, would want to hide in the same way.</p>

That is a big job when the company is a multinational or a bank with thousands, or possibly millions, of shareholders. It is an enormous job for shareholders to organise themselves against directors, given the weight and strength that directors have as a result of all their proxy votes, which they accumulate and use, ad lib, to crush the emergence of any shareholder opinion. That is an impossible job unless the names of the shareholders are published.</p>

If I were running such a company, and the new clauses were added to the Bill tonight, the first thing that I would do is apply under the scheme. I would say, &#147;My company operates in a former Soviet republic where violence and torture go on all the time.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who was of course in the investigative journalism trade&#151;and a very good trade it is, too. I was in the electronic media, so we did not do any investigation.

We cannot accept either of the new clauses, because under new clause 17 the onus on companies is replaced by an onus on shareholders to say, &#147;I am investing in something murky, please do not disclose my name.&#148; That does not apply only to people who want to hide from possible persecution. The ability to remain anonymous, which would be checked by my amendment No. 758, is also used by tax evaders, money launderers and criminals. Will they, too, on the same principle, have the ability to hide? Or will they put all their money in Huntingdon Life Sciences and then hide themselves?</p>

 My hon. Friend talks of criminals and fraudsters. The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) says that applications made under the new clauses would be scarce, but he tends to underestimate the ingenuity of fraudsters. If I were a fraudster, given this provision and certain precedents that may be set by decisions taken by the Secretary of State, I would wish to put my company in the position where I could claim that my shareholders were subject to the risk of violence and intimidation. For instance, I might have two people in an office putting drops in a rabbit&#146;s eyes, or I might set up a small subsidiary in a violent place. I could therefore close my shareholder register and prevent legitimate investigation of the various connections that my company has, if they are unsavoury.</p>

somebody is to be responsible, the legal personality created for the convenience of business must be rooted in identifiable shareholders whose names are known and whose interests can be investigated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06101860001196">Amendment No. 683 is an effort to control the big trade in companies bought off the shelf. The technique is widely used by money launderers. Money laundering would be extremely difficult were it not for accountancy firms having the ability to set up shell companies in that way. I wrote an article about a money laundering racket by AGIP some years ago, in which Grant Thornton established shell companies in Jersey to launder money from that interest. It goes on all the time. Enron used it spectacularly on an enormous scale. If we are to deal with that issue, we need to know who the beneficial owners are, who is setting up the company and who is answerable. Currently, there is no requirement for third party agents such as accountancy firms who submit company formation papers to Companies House to collect and verify the ownership information for the company. Therefore, owners can conceal their identities and carry on their nefarious business. The principle of full openness, for which I am speaking, should therefore be extended to cover such shell companies. We should maintain that principle, not infringe it.</p>

 I shall confine myself to new clauses 16 and 17, and largely to new clause 16. I acknowledge that my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) has a serious point and is right to put forward the new clause. In its present form, it is not satisfactory and needs adjustment, but I understand and agree with the general motive that lies behind it. The Government are right that clause 117 goes some way to address the problem, and they are to be congratulated on having put it into the Bill. There are at least three problems with clause 117, however, which cause me to think that an additional provision, along the lines of that put forward by my hon. Friend, is necessary.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_14"><a name="61018-0013.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="06101860002908"><h5 align="left">4.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06101860001197">The first problem with clause 117 is the proving of motive. Motive is often difficult to prove. In this instance, it is likely to be particularly difficult to prove and the courts may therefore be unable to determine what it is. A second, and quite different, problem is that even when it is possible to have an idea of the motive, it may not be so easy to show that it is not a proper motive. That takes me to my third point: what is a proper motive, or an improper motive? I can understand why the Government have not sought to define &#147;proper purpose&#148;, but the phrase is pretty opaque, and an opaque phrase is not likely to be a terribly valuable safeguard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="61018-0013.htm_para16"><a name="06101860001198">Clause 117 is directed primarily at motive, while new clause 16 is directed primarily at consequence. They are not the same. A person may have a perfectly proper motive for finding out addresses, but if those addresses fell into the hands of a third party who was not so properly motivated, that might well constitute a serious risk. There is not the necessary overlap between clause 117, which is directed at motive, and new clause 16, which is directed at consequence&#151;as, indeed, is new clause 17.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para0"><a name="06101860001199">I think that there is room for something similar to what my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton has suggested in the new clauses, but I cannot support him all the way. I agree with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) about the desirability of transparency and openness, and I well understand what was said by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) about investigative journalism. Those points are well founded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06101860001200">I suggest something along these lines. First, along with the test of risk&#151;and I have no particular objection to the Secretary of State exercising that power&#151;there should be a test of proportionality and of public interest, which should apply in the first-instance test, the application to the Secretary of State. Secondly, there should be some mechanism, over and above judicial review, whereby the Secretary of State&#146;s decision could be reviewed in a court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06101860001201">Let me make two points about that. First, the test of proportionality and public interest should be a test to which the appellate tribunal should be specifically directed. Secondly, the right to make an application to the appellate court should be open to third parties who feel aggrieved by it, such as the press. There is a precedent of a kind. As you will doubtless know, Madam Deputy Speaker, judges in criminal courts can make orders restricting the publicity given to parties to the proceedings. In those circumstances, third parties have a right to apply to the court for a change in the order. I have something rather similar in mind. If a third party felt that the order was unduly restrictive, that third party&#151;although not party to the application to the Secretary of State&#151;would have the right to lodge an appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06101860001202">Finally, I would enlarge the subsection dealing with prescribed circumstances to include classes of person and organisation. &#147;Circumstances&#148; is a fairly narrowly defined word. I should like the definition to be widened so that the information could be given to persons and organisations specified by the Secretary of State and/or the court on appeal.</p>

I also commend what was said by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). There is a balance to be struck. On the one hand, there is the legitimate right of the public to know who the registered shareholders are. That relates to the veil of corporate liability that forms part of the history of company law. All that is fine and rightly understood, and we are all in favour of making everything as translucent and transparent as possible. The other side of the balance, as the Government recognise, is that we live in dangerous times. There are legitimate companies carrying out their business, yet their people are being threatened for no good reason.</p>

What I do know is that the provision represents an effort in a very difficult area to meet the genuine concerns of people who are desperately worried about terrorism from animal rights protesters, for example. I share that concern, but no doubt the Solicitor-General will advise us in due course that there will be some form of review of the court&#146;s decision along the usual lines. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I believe that he confirms that.</p>

It is an imperfect appellate procedure. I defer to the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham on the points that he made, but the judicial review procedure would look into the reasonableness of how the decision was reached&#151;the Wednesbury principles and so forth&#151;rather than the quality of the judgment.

democracy. Indeed, some of the other amendments that they have put forward could have a profound effect on our company law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para18"><a name="06101860001221">New clause 16 would remove the essential underpinning of shareholder democracy. If a company were to have a &#147;confidentiality order&#148; under the new clause, all external communications to its members would be required to be &#147;passed on&#148; only by the company. How, and how quickly, is not specified, but speed is crucial if support is being sought, for example, for a resolution opposing one already tabled. How is someone seeking to convey a lawful message ever to know whether the company has complied with the request to pass the message to its members if he does not have the means to contact them? The enforcement mechanisms in subsections (9) to (12), and therefore the underlying obligation to pass on lawful messages, are worth nothing if a company&#146;s failure to pass on those messages is undetectable, and there is nothing in the new clause to show how it could be. However, under clause 117, courts could deal with that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06101860001222">The new clauses do not substantially add to protection that can be achieved under clause 117 and that can be done be much more effectively by using the courts. The clause provides that, when a court directs a company not to comply with a request for access to its register of members, it may direct the company not to comply with similar requests. In other words, if it becomes clear that a company&#146;s register of members has become the target of animal rights extremists or fraudsters, it should be possible for the court to make an order in terms that permit it to refuse requests for access that appear to emanate from similar sources. That makes unnecessary the provision in new clause 16 for company confidentiality orders, unless there is some fundamental view that that has to be done via the Secretary of State in a particular way, rather than in the courts.</p>

 What I am saying is that, under clause 117, the court can enable&#151;order, in fact&#151;a company not to provide information requested. So the company will be in a position to make such order as it believes is appropriate when an application is made.

Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)? One could enlarge the test in clause 117(3) so that the court could make an order where the</p>
<a name="61018-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="06101860002875"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;copy is not sought for a proper purpose&#148;,</p>

So one could build into clause 117 some of the concepts put forward by my hon. Friend, but have the policing done by the courts.</p>

 Let me explain the point that I am trying to put to the Solicitor-General. There is a difference, and no necessary overlap, between not having a proper motive&#151;that covers motive&#151;and consequences. I think that one could get evil consequences in terms of risk, even if the application was made for a proper motive. So I think that the two tests should perhaps be incorporated into clause 117.</p>

 Let me consider for another time the idea put forward by the right hon. and leaned Gentleman. I do not dismiss it; it is a sensible suggestion. If we were currently in Committee, we might have had the opportunity to look into it in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06101860001232">New clause 17 provides that an individual member may apply for a confidentiality order so that particulars of his name and usual or business address are not publicly available. Everything that I have said about new clause 16 applies to new clause 17 as well. Transparency about membership is one of the conditions that a company and its members must observe in return for the privileges that come with incorporation. It would be fundamentally wrong for it to be possible for any individual to hide the extent of his control of a company. That said, we intend to use the power in clause 861 to reduce the information about members that companies with share capital have to send to Companies House each year as part of their annual return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="61018-0014.htm_para24"><a name="06101860001233">Subject to consultation, our intention in respect of public companies&#151;the hon. Member for Huntingdon asked me to make a point of this&#151;is to exempt them from the obligation to supply any details of those who hold less than 5 per cent. of any class of the company&#146;s shares, and for private companies not to require the addresses of their members. That is a practical way of ensuring that the protection provided to registers of members by clause 117 is not subverted by the availability of this information from Companies House. By way of contrast, new clause 17 is in our view wholly incompatible with the concept of a public record.</p>

That is not a vague concept; it gives some discretion to the courts, but it is not so vague that a court will be unable to identify that an improper purpose relates to, for example, animal rights terrorism or to an attempt somehow to damage the company in question.

In my view, clause 117 gets the balance right.</p>

a whole lot easier than applying for an individual member&#146;s confidentiality order as suggested in the amendment. The Bill provides that a court may relieve a company from the obligation to allow access to its register if the court is satisfied that the access is not sought for a proper purpose. We consider that that strikes a balance between, on the one hand, protecting members from attempts to harass or defraud them, and, on the other hand, the right of the public and members to know who owns a company and to contact them.

Fifteen days is too long a period to allow in all cases where a company is considering a request for access to the register. Let us suppose that a shareholder is trying to contact other members about a resolution that has already been tabled for a general meeting that has been called&#151;particularly an extraordinary general meeting on 14 days&#146; notice. In such a case, giving the company 15 days to process the request enables the management to frustrate the shareholder&#146;s purposes without even having to justify themselves in court. Moreover, the difficulties of assessing requests for access can be overstated. At the risk of generalising, I suspect that the assessment process will rarely involve detailed research or analysis. A request will either look suspect, or it will not. In our view, five days&#151;remember, that is five working days&#151;will be enough.</p>

It proposes that companies&#146; registers of members should include details of not just the registered members, notably the legal owners of shares in companies limited by shares, but the holders of any underlying economic interests in the company that may stand behind its registered members. In other words, it would lead to a register not just of legal entitlements, but any related beneficial interests. I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) that we would not be prepared to accept such a huge change at this stage. It would represent a huge change not only in company law, but to the way in which all sorts of perfectly legitimate businesses are run.</p>

It would also probably fail to achieve many of its objectives, even if it did not simply prove to be unworkable. The first question is how on earth one would enforce a universal requirement to disclose beneficial interests in companies. A company will generally be unaware of the identity, or even existence, of those who hold such interests. Even the registered member may not have all the information if he is only the first link in a chain of intermediaries between the company and those with the underlying economic interest in its shares. If the requirement is unenforceable, it is likely that any criminal elements that might benefit from the limitations of the existing system will also be able to find a way round the proposed new system.</p>

investors, companies and the financial services sector because of the capturing and processing of all the additional information required, without, I regret to say, delivering any benefits commensurate with those costs. If I give a single example of which my hon. Friend might not have thought that is taken from an everyday situation, it might illustrate the complexities involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="61018-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06101860001255">People who live in flats often have a share in the company that owns the flats. They also often have mortgages, and it is common for the lender to be in a position to require the resident of a flat&#146;s share to be transferred to the lender. That gives the lender a beneficial interest in the share. The amendment would require the register to identify the lender&#146;s beneficial interest and to update that information every time the resident switched to a different lender, as often happens, or whenever the lender was taken over by another institution, which also often happens. None of that would serve any especially useful purpose. Okay, we could deal with that problem by way of a further amendment to exclude such situations, but the example shows us the sort of unforeseen consequences that might arise from the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="61018-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06101860001256">Finally, it is worth pointing out that there are already powerful statutory mechanisms, at least for public companies, that enable companies to get to the bottom of who might be behind their registered members. These will shortly be supplemented by further measures under the transparency obligations directive. When such mechanisms are used, there is provision for records to be kept of the beneficial owners whose interests have been identified and for those records to be disclosed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="61018-0015.htm_para8"><a name="06101860001257">My hon. Friend also spoke to amendment No. 683. Clauses 10 and 11 contain powers that enable the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations made under the Bill the types of identity information that must be provided in the statements that are to be included in the application for registration, which are the statement of capital and initial shareholding that is required when a company is to be formed as limited by shares and the statement of guarantee that is required when a company is to be formed as limited by guarantee. Given those circumstances, I think that the amendment is unnecessary, because we will achieve the result that my hon. Friend wants, albeit by a different route. We are not especially attracted by the particular wording of the amendment, although I appreciate that that could be altered. However, I hope that my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61018-0016.htm_para18"><a name="06101860001804">I should also like to put it on record that this is the first time that I have had the opportunity to address the House from the Front Bench. It is an honour and a privilege to be able to debate several key aspects of this very important Bill on behalf of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition. My only regret is that the timetabling means that we do not have as much time as we would like to debate some of the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61018-0016.htm_para19"><a name="06101860001805">The amendments relate to parts 12 and 13 and the continuing position of company secretaries within the corporate environment. Before speaking to our amendments, I want to say how much we welcome the about-turn that the Government have made on this issue. The amendments tabled by the Government give proper statutory recognition to company secretaries in private companies. Conservative Members have argued steadfastly that the company secretary performs a crucial role in ensuring good corporate governance and legal compliance, as well as fulfilling several important administrative tasks within the company. Secretaries are also officers of the company with the legal liabilities that that brings with it, and have a recognised ability to sign documents on behalf of the company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="61018-0016.htm_para20"><a name="06101860001806">Until now, the Government have said that there is no need to recognise private company secretaries in the Bill. While they implemented greater flexibility on the need for private companies to have a secretary, they argued quite forcefully that there was no need to keep any records of such persons if the secretary was appointed by a private company, or for third parties to have any automatic ability to check whether somebody  <br>

was a company secretary. The Government said that if the secretary was appointed and there was a need for such a secretary to sign documents on behalf of the company, they would have to be appointed as an authorised signatory under part 13. During our debate in Standing Committee, the Solicitor-General did not appear to have any concerns about the approach that was being taken, telling me:</p>

As we said in Committee, clause 380 was included in the Bill at the express request of companies that felt strongly that they should be able to provide facilities for their work force through a trade union without it being deemed political funding.</p>

In the latter case, there is no danger of such funds being redirected to political parties, because the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 prevents trade unions from making payments to political parties, except through their political fund. That Act also prohibits trade unions from redirecting money received from third parties into the political fund unless the money is given as a contribution to the political fund.

have taken on board the request of both Opposition parties that we should make that clear in the Bill to ensure that it is not a possibility in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06101860001835">New clauses 81 and 82 and amendments Nos. 708 to 710 address an issue that was raised by the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) in Committee. Under clause 376, the directors of a subsidiary company and the directors of its &#147;relevant holding company&#148; may be liable if an unauthorised donation is made by a subsidiary. Clause 377 recognises the possibility that neither the holding company nor the subsidiary may bring an action against the directors who are liable in respect of the unauthorised donation. It therefore allows shareholders to bring legal proceedings to enforce that liability. In such cases, we agree that shareholders of both the subsidiary and the holding company should be able to bring those proceedings. That is particularly important if the directors of the holding company are effectively the shareholders of the subsidiary&#151;for example, if it were a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06101860001836">As drafted, the clause would allow only shareholders of the subsidiary to bring proceedings, even against directors of the holding company. As I have explained, we do not think that that would work in practice, and these amendments address the problem by giving the right to bring proceedings to shareholders of the subsidiary and shareholders of the holding company. That will ensure that the directors of the holding company can be held to account by their shareholders if they use subsidiaries that they control to make unauthorised donations.</p>

 I shall speak mainly to new clause 76 on corporate expenditure on lobbying. We do not know the exact extent of corporate lobbying in the UK, but we can get some idea of it from the fact that expenditures on public affairs have risen rapidly over the past 20 or 30 years. In the 1980s and 1990s, leading agencies were growing at between 20 and 40 per cent. a year, and according to a study done in 2000 by Miller and Dinan, in the last two decades of the 20th century, expenditure on public relations rose thirty-onefold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06101860001841">We do not know exactly how much of that expenditure was directed at lobbying Government on Government relations, as it is called, but as Miller and Dinan point out in its study, it is hardly a coincidence that that massive growth in expenditure coincided with the era of massive privatisations and deregulation of the financial services industry. Lobbying is now a very big business.</p>

A particular company&#151;I have checked its website&#151;gives these examples of its work: changing Government policy on payouts to Railtrack shareholders, changing telecommunications policy, defending the interests of companies involved in the private finance initiative, winning political approval for a takeover bid and getting changes in the Financial Services and Markets Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para6"><a name="06101860001843">Whatever one thinks about those issues, one way or the other, one thing about them that cannot be doubted is that they are political. Corporate lobbying is an intervention in the political process, just as much as, and in some ways more than, giving money to a political party or a political campaign, yet the law controlling corporate political activity, which is in the Bill, covers only activity connected with elections or referendums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06101860001844">Lobbying is not just about issues that concern individual companies; it reaches the most important issues. During the past few weeks, there has been some controversy about the activities of certain oil companies&#151;ExxonMobil in particular, and its alleged funding of climate change denial. That is an attempt to shift public policy in a way that favours the short-term interest of a company at the expense of everyone in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06101860001845">The growth of lobbying over the last generation brings into question the type of democracy we are. Sometimes, even when discussing the Bill, the Government, and even the Opposition, have given the impression that the purpose of government is not to put forward and defend a certain view of the public interest, but is instead merely to navigate a path between clashing special interests. Earlier today, the Minister said something to the Conservative Opposition that I think implied that she feels that this is a problem in relation to how parts of the Bill have been handled&#151;we have spent too much time working through what various lobby groups are saying and not enough on what we ourselves think.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06101860001846">Lobbying is creating a form of corporatism in which rich and powerful bodies reinforce their power and wealth by seizing control of the access to Government and excluding others. As the membership of political parties falls, and as in many parties the influence of members on the policies of those parties has declined, the space left behind in the political system has been occupied by corporate lobbyists. The result is that politics is becoming a closed circle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para10"><a name="06101860001847">In addition, lobbying is economically harmful. Most of the massive expenditures made on Government relations are aimed simply at redistributing wealth, usually from the poor to the rich. The aim is not to increase the productive capacity of the company or the country, but simply to shift wealth from one group to another. It is, in the jargon of economists, an example of non-productive rent-seeking. The resources devoted to lobbying would, in economic terms, be much better spent on developing new products, and on selling and marketing. Resources devoted to lobbying are, in economic terms, mainly waste.</p>

start of an important debate. The new clause would oblige companies to report on their expenditure on lobbying, once it exceeded a certain limit set by the Secretary of State, and to obtain shareholder approval for lobbying expenditure above that limit, in a way that is equivalent to the regime that applies to political donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06101860001849">In Standing Committee, there were various objections to our proposal. One was that companies would have to report trivial expenses, such as the cost of a cup of coffee with a Minister or a taxi to Parliament. We dealt with that in the new clause by allowing the Secretary of State to set a minimum limit. The objection was made that the measure would inhibit the flow of information from companies to the Government, or Parliament. To deal with that, we have given the Secretary of State power to exempt expenditure on meeting governmental or parliamentary requests for information. Outside the Committee, it was suggested that there was a gap in our proposal, because it did not deal with overseas companies operating in this country, and we plugged that gap by making it clear that it does apply to them. Such companies already have to register and report their activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06101860001850">The object of new clause 76 is to bring more transparency to the world of lobbying, but it is of help to shareholders, too. As the Minister said, one of the reasons that political donations need shareholder approval is that directors&#146; political enthusiasms can adversely affect a company&#146;s reputation. The same is potentially true of lobbying. One might expect shareholders to be more in favour of lobbying in their company&#146;s interests than in favour of political donations, but they, too, might wonder whether managerial effort would be better spent on promoting and developing the company&#146;s products than on lobbying Government. They, too, might wonder about the effects on a company&#146;s reputation if it was found to have lobbied in a way that was enormously unpopular&#151;for example, on the subject of climate change. The topic is important and, if the opportunity arises, I should like to press my new clause to a Division. I realise that its chances of success are slim, if Standing Committee was anything to go by, but I hope that it will be the start of a serious debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06101860001851">I shall not press our other amendment in the group, amendment No. 687, to a Division. It is a drafting amendment, but an important one, and I hope that the Government understand the point behind it. It would amend clause 372, which is about the circumstances in which a company may make a political donation. Under the clause, a company must obtain a resolution of members. Subsection (3) is about what happens in a wholly owned subsidiary company but, obviously, in such companies, it is pointless to require a resolution of the shareholders separately from a resolution of the parent company, because they are one and the same thing. Clause 372(3) aims to prevent the requirement for two resolutions if one of them is pointless. Unfortunately, the wording of the provision it is not entirely clear:</p>
<a name="61018-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="06101860002880"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No resolution is required on the part of a company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06101860001852">before it can make a donation. There therefore appears to be an enormous loophole, and all one need do to avoid making a resolution in the form required by the law is set up a wholly owned subsidiary. I hope that that is not the intention and amendment No. 687 aims to put into legislation what we all believe should be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06101860001853">I conclude by thanking the Minister for closing the loophole on trade union political funds that we brought to her attention in Committee. I accept that it is unlikely that that loophole has been used, but it could be used in future, so I welcome the fact that the Government have taken the opportunity to close it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o256"><a name="06101860001854"><a name="61018-0017.htm_spnew3"><a name="06101860004556"><b>James Brokenshire:</b>
 I wish to look at the treatment of trade unions in the Bill. At the end of our debate in Committee, the relevant provision said that unions were not political organisations, which, as we all know, is a legal fiction. The recent document published by the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation on party funding made it clear that</p>
<a name="61018-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="06101860002881"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;unions are an inseparable part of the Labour party.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06101860001855">Union votes account for a third of the votes for the next Labour leader. The unions make Labour party policy through the national policy forum, and they exercise a 50 per cent. block vote on policy motions debated at the Labour party conference. How best should we address the political position of trade unions in the Bill? As the Minister said, the Government clearly listened to the debate in Committee, particularly the points made by Conservative Members, and have moved the debate forward by tabling Government new clause 83. Under subsection (1), a company does not have to submit to the approvals process prescribed in the Bill if a donation, other than a contribution to a union&#146;s political fund, is made to a trade union. Financial support from companies for trade unions to facilitate training, educational development, employee counselling and other important aspects of unions&#146; work to promote good employment relations in the workplace would fall outside the approval requirements. That is of particular concern to many companies&#151;indeed, that concern largely drove the inclusion of clause 372 at the outset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para18"><a name="06101860001856">Subsection (2) makes it clear that the qualification&#151;I have termed it a legal fiction&#151;that a union is not a political organisation applies only in connection with political expenditure in clause 371. In other words, a company can promote or publicise a trade union&#146;s activities without the need to seek shareholder consent. That is entirely appropriate in the context of fostering positive employee relations and ensuring that employees have access to advice and guidance in the event of a dispute or a safety issue. It is worth putting on the record the fact that trade unions&#146; political activities are framed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which incorporates provisions on the establishment and maintenance of the political fund and the uses to which the fund can be applied. Section 72 makes provision for the contribution of funds to political parties, as well as the distribution of materials relating to the promotion of political parties or candidates. The political fund can be used by the union only for political purposes, but I expressed anxiety about it in Committee, and I remain slightly concerned about the proposal on displacement. If a company made a donation to a trade union for non-political purposes, could it be used to free up, displace or transfer resources to the political fund for a political application? We debated the issue in Committee, and the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) highlighted advice from the TUC on actions taken by a union that could endanger its independence for the purposes of the 1992 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06101860001857">The Minister kindly wrote to me on 24 July 2006, enclosing a copy of the briefing note, for which I am grateful. It would be helpful, however, if the Minister were to respond to the following points when she sums up. First, has she obtained legal advice confirming that a transfer of funds from an employer to a union, which either displaces or frees up other resources in the general fund, which are then transferred to the political fund, would be a breach of the independence requirements of the 1992 Act, as per the advice given by the TUC in its briefing note? Secondly, does she construe the wording in new clause 83,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06101860001858">to encompass direct and indirect contributions, where the purpose of the contribution was clear or where it might not be clear from the contribution that it was so intended but it had that effect indirectly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06101860001859">Amendment Nos. 376 and 377 develop a slightly different point&#151;the equivalence between the treatment of companies and trade unions in terms of the approval process for sanctioning political donations or expenditure. Under clause 371, companies are required to pass a shareholder resolution at least every four years. Under the 1992 Act, however, political fund ballots are only required every 10 years. The Government have argued clearly that there is a need to ensure, in the context of companies, that protections are afforded to shareholders in relation to the use of company funds for political purposes. Similar arguments also apply to trade unions. In the consultation document, &#147;Review of the Employment Relations Act 1999&#148;, the Government responded to calls for a review of the requirement for political fund ballots:</p>
<a name="61018-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="06101860002883"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government understands the case for reform. However, these ballots serve an important democratic function and ensure that union members can at regular intervals collectively authorise their union&#146;s involvement in political activities.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para22"><a name="06101860001860">In that context, the purpose behind each of the constructs seems to have a broad equivalence. If a company is required to seek shareholder approval every four years, surely it is appropriate for a trade union to be treated in the same way. The Bill cannot, by its nature, amend the underlying trade union legislation, so the amendments seek to highlight that important point in the context of company donations only. Back in 1994&#151;this was reflected in the Labour party&#146;s manifesto&#151;the Prime Minister said in an interview with <i> The Independent</i>:</p>
<a name="61018-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="06101860002884"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In my view trade unions are an important part of our democracy&#151;but fairness, not favours, is the way we are going to run things.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para23"><a name="06101860001861">Fairness is what we are seeking in the amendments, and I hope that the Minister will consider that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="61018-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06101860001862">With regard to new clause 76 tabled by the Liberal Democrats, I recognise the concern about lobbying expressed by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), and we debated in Committee whether undue influence is a factor. To resolve the matter by putting restrictions on the company seems particularly harsh, however, given that some lobbying informs political debates, as Members on both sides of the House would recognise. Obviously, if the issue relates to political expenditure and attempts to change or to influence the way that people vote, it would be caught by the existing provisions relating to political expenditure in the Bill.</p>

 I think the point made in Committee was that the term &#147;political expenditure&#148; could be construed more widely, beyond the narrow confines of an election campaign. Something that was supportive to either an Opposition or a Government could be captured by the definition.</p>

 Is not the problem with the Liberal Democrat proposal that it arises from a very narrow view of what constitutes lobbying? If, for example, a European Union Government decided to try to pass internally a law that would damage British companies, the first to know about it would be the British companies. It would be important, for the sake of both their employees and their products, for them to lobby the foreign Government, the European Commission and Ministers at home in order to protect their business. Much lobbying is of that kind. We must not fall into the belief that it is always&#151;as it sometimes is&#151;an unsuitable activity.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Lobbying does instruct, and can inform, the way in which we govern. To assume that all of it is bad is a very simplistic approach. To be fair to the hon.

 The hon.

sure that there is an easy answer to it. No doubt the hon.

In the end, we have to reach a balanced view and make a judgment on it. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman and I disagree. We have already had the debate twice and no doubt we will have it again, but I believe that lobbying has a very important part to play in a vibrant, good democratic structure.

 Despite the number of Government amendments and new clauses, I can assure you that I will be brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker. These are all designed to help to improve the operation of the resolutions and meetings provisions in part 14 and related provisions. I will take Members through some of the key points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para0"><a name="06101860002256">Government new clause 13 and Government amendment No. 301 respond to concerns raised by the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) in Committee about the admissibility of votes. Clause 294 is replaced with a new clause to preserve the right of a company to require objections to votes to be made in accordance with procedures in the articles. We took the point that the old clause was too ambitious so we are just preserving the current law. If an objection is overruled, the decision will be final, except in the case of fraud and certain other kinds of misconduct detailed in case law, where a court may intervene.</p>

 As the Minister implied, we are considering something of a hotch-potch of new provisions to finish off the day. Just in case we end up with a problem with time, I shall start by speaking to amendment No. 355, which we believe to be the most important element of the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06101860002260">Amendment No. 355 originated from the Law Society. It would enable a company to make provision in its articles on the passing of unanimous written resolutions that were not subject to the procedures laid down in chapter 2 of part 14. The provisions in chapter 2 are less flexible than those in section 381C of the Companies Act 1985, which permits a company&#146;s articles to make provision for written resolutions to be passed pursuant to the articles as an alternative to following the statutory procedure. The amendment would preserve that flexibility when the written resolution is agreed unanimously by members. That reflects a principle of common law, as expounded in the case of re Duomatic, 1969, which hon. Members will remember was mentioned in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06101860002261">Such flexibility was incorporated in clause D18 in the White Paper of March 2005. Subsection (2) provided:</p>
<a name="61018-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="06101860002886"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This section does not affect any power of a company to make provision in its articles for its members to pass resolutions without a meeting other than in accordance with this Chapter.&#147;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06101860002262">We think that the flexibility needs to be retained, but only for written resolutions that are passed unanimously. We do not consider that clause 288(3) achieves that flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06101860002263">Such flexibility is needed for not only private companies, but public companies that cannot avail themselves of the statutory written resolution procedure that exists in the Bill. It is not uncommon for newly incorporated public companies to pass written resolutions pursuant to a provision of their articles, and if that ceased to be possible it would create extra work and cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06101860002264">Two examples come to mind in relation to the provision. First, following the formation of a public company, it is common to adopt new articles. That can be done by a written resolution pursuant to regulation 53 of table A when that is incorporated in the articles of a company on its formation. Secondly, when a public company is a wholly owned subsidiary of another company, it is common to pass written resolutions in accordance with the outcomes. However, the Bill does not allow that practice to continue. The consequence will be that a resolution of a public company will require a meeting of members in all circumstances. That would involve additional expense, but it would give no benefit in the circumstances that I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06101860002265">We welcome Government amendment No. 301 and new clause 13. We tabled amendments to clause 294 in Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) expressed his justifiable concerns about the effect of the clause as drafted. It allowed that if a person was not entitled to vote, but did so, and if the articles of association of that company provided a mechanism for objecting to an improper vote, and if an objection was made and rejected, or if no objection was made in the relevant time period, the unauthorised voter would be deemed to have been entitled to vote. My hon. Friend stated that that would unfairly prejudice shareholders who could not challenge a decision that was irrational, unreasonable or even unlawful. The Government amendments return us to the existing common-law position. If the result of a poll is declared, a court should now be able to question it, rather than having no power to change it. That is sensible and to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06101860002266">New clause 14 is the Government&#146;s welcome response to amendments that we tabled in Committee. Currently, companies insert into their articles a provision that when giving a notice period for meetings, no account will be taken of the day of sending of the notice, or the following day, or the date of the meeting itself. However, that can be drafted as two extra days or three extra days, which can cause confusion. In the worst instances, circulars have been sent out illegally to members, causing great embarrassment to all concerned. The point might be slightly technical and one that only practitioners and company secretaries will be happy to see made, but we thank the Government for reconsidering that grey area, which we highlighted, tabling new clause 14 and thus providing clarity to all concerned.</p>

the shareholder nominates. No one is forcing shareholders to support the chairman in order to cast their vote; it is simply convenient for many shareholders. For that reason, we cannot support the amendment. The amendment stands in the name of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) as well, so perhaps he will speak to it in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06101860002268">Amendments Nos. 348 and 349 would reserve the original position in the Bill, such that an AGM of a public company will be capable of being called on short notice where all shareholders consent. That will make public company AGMs&#151;mainly where there is a handful of shareholders&#151;provide the formality that shareholders normally require. It is a deregulatory measure and, as such, we support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06101860002269">The purpose of amendment No. 418 is to clarify how a company should notify its members of the publication on a website of the notice of the meeting. Clause 316 makes provision in that respect, and subsection (2) states that the company has a duty to notify its members of the existence of the notice on its website, but it is not made clear how such notification is to be given. We agree with the Law Society that it is important that companies notify their members directly when they have published a notice. How that should be effected requires clarification. We would be concerned if it was sufficient merely to put the notice of the meeting on the website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06101860002270">Amendment No. 419 is a probing amendment that we received from the Investment Management Association. In a previous debate, it was said that now is not the time to be proposing probing amendments, but I am sure that the Minister will forgive us on this occasion, given the nature of the Bill and the way in which everything seems to be crammed in at the last minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06101860002271">Under regulation 46 of table A to the Companies (Tables A to F) Regulations 1985, a resolution voted on at a company meeting is decided on a show of hands&#151;one vote per member for each shareholder actually present or represented in the case or a corporate shareholder, but not proxies unless the articles so provide&#151;unless a poll is called. Common law clarified the chairman&#146;s duty to</p>
<a name="61018-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="06101860002887"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ascertain the true sense of the meeting&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06101860002272">If the chairman as proxy is aware that if a poll was called the outcome would be different from that reached on a show of hands, he has a duty to demand a poll, if he is able to do so under the company&#146;s articles of association. Guidance from the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators re-emphasises that duty.</p>
<a name="06101860002865">
<p>We were therefore concerned to learn that at the AGM in July of GoshawK Insurance Holdings, the reinsurer, an advisory resolution on the remuneration of the chairman was decided on a show of hands when a poll would have defeated it. We understand that GoshawK&#146;s lawyers had advised that, because votes on remuneration are advisory and not binding on the company&#151;that is certainly the case in relation to the combined code&#151;the chairman was not obliged to call a poll. It is considered important by the Investment Management Association that the law in this area is clarified, and the Bill is an opportunity to do that. It would be helpful if the Minister set out the Government&#146;s position in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06101860002273">Amendment No. 420 deals with the related issue of votes at general meetings. On the question whether a chairman should be forced to call a poll, transparency would be a key issue. To that end, the amendment suggests that the chairman announce the number of proxy votes before the resolution is put, rather than after the resolution is put, as is usually the case with listed companies. In that way, members will know to call a poll in the usual way. Such transparency would make the IMA amendment unnecessary. The provision may be more suited to the compliant code for listed companies, but I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views and whether she will look into the matter in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para17"><a name="06101860002274">Finally, on amendment No. 421, which would remove clauses 349 to 352, the CBI&#146;s updated view is rather blunt. It believes that the provisions dealing with independent reports on a poll are</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06101860002277">The debate relates to clauses 349 and 350, which provide a mechanism for shareholders representing not less than 5 per cent. of the voting capital of a quoted company to demand an independent report on any poll taken or to be taken at a general meeting of the company. The request must be made no later than within one week of the poll being taken, and the directors must appoint an independent assessor within one week of the requirement to prepare a report for the company on the poll or polls.</p>

The Government has provided no evidence of any abuse it is trying to redress. They will place increased costs and burdens on companies for no discernable gain. In addition, in spite of the statement that an adverse report on a poll will not affect the validity of a decision, it is likely that companies would delay the implementation of the decision until the time for a challenge has expired. In the case of decisions taken at EGMs this could have a seriously detrimental effect on companies&#146; ability to complete major transactions and would undermine the competitiveness of UK companies.</p>
</ul><a name="61018-0019.htm_brev5"><a name="06101860002891"><ul><p class="tabletext">The procedure of calling for an independent report would be open to serious abuse from those who were opposed to a transaction, but knew that they would be defeated on a poll.

It has been pointed out to us that companies may seek to wait a week before implementing a change, for fear that a demand for some sort of report may be required. If that were the case, it would impose a considerable cost and burden on companies. In that regard, we could have a situation where companies are making a share offering and the  <br>

longer that the share offering waits to be completed, the more the company may be required to pay in subscription costs or placement charges to agents or underwriters. That could increase the costs associated with companies&#146; placement of new shares, which is not desirable.</p>

What will be the sanction if a report is received that is unfavourable and says that something has not been done appropriately? As we have already discussed, the chairman&#146;s ruling in relation to a particular matter is fairly conclusive, in much the same way as Mr. Speaker&#146;s decision is conclusive. If a report is called for, there may be some further delay to enable it to be undertaken. If a report is called for after the general meeting has taken place, it may be difficult for the expert who has been appointed to provide the report to assess it and conclude whether matters were conducted appropriately.</p>

 I was interested in the speech of the hon.

That is what everybody has been waiting to hear and what the hon. Gentleman failed to tell us. We will not have such a clear answer from the Liberals, because they will be saying that they will vote for it and against it, in their usual way.</p>

Gentleman cast on it to give some substance to his speech. This is an issue of shareholder democracy. There are three ways of managing and regulating corporations and bringing them under some degree of accountability so that they fulfil the corporate purposes that we would like. One is openness in reporting, which we have argued for in previous amendments. The second is effective regulation of the kind that the Securities and Exchange Commission offers in the United States, and which we should offer here, and for which I will continue, as will my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), to push. The third is shareholder democracy.</p>

It is a steamroller driving over and crushing shareholder democracy. The enormous power of the proxy is used to suppress discontent; to force through higher rewards for the people at the top of the company&#151;the increasing shower of money that is falling on them; and to prevent the shareholders asserting any power in the company, where, even when things are going wrong, it is very difficult for the shareholders to do anything about it.</p>

 Amendment No. 355 raises a difficult point that we have considered in correspondence with the Law Society, as hon. Members know. The procedure for written resolutions in the Bill is very different from that of the 1985 Act. Unanimity is no longer required. This is a very significant measure of deregulation. However, because unanimity is not required, certain procedural safeguards are not needed in the context of unanimous procedures. The argument behind the amendment is that companies with written resolution procedures in their articles, whether public or private, should be able to evade those procedural requirements, if the articles require unanimity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61018-0019.htm_para29"><a name="06101860002288">That is superficially attractive, but we believe that it is wrong in principle. First, for a number of resolutions in the Bill, there is a particular procedure to be followed, and we do not want those procedures to be avoided because of provisions that companies may have in their articles. Secondly, for public companies certain decisions need to be taken in a meeting rather than by written resolution, because of the second company law directive. In essence, the amendment is about avoiding statutory procedural requirements, but we do not think that the procedural requirements imposed by the written resolution clauses are onerous. There is nothing in the Bill that stops non-statutory resolutions from being passed in whatever way the articles envisage. If the articles require members&#146; agreement, there is no need to comply with the statutory procedures.</p>

I hope that he has picked up that the Bill includes a range of clauses to strengthen shareholder engagement. Indeed, I expect that we will debate institutional shareholder voting tomorrow. However, amendment No. 682 is not right, because it would prevent a director from acting as a proxy. In an ideal world, we might wish that all shareholders would attend general meetings, but that will not always happen. If shareholders want to appoint somebody in their stead, be it a director to act as a proxy or be it somebody else, they should be free to appoint somebody to represent them and to vote on their behalf. It is better for them to have a say in a particular thing rather than not including that power in the Bill. My hon. Friend&#146;s amendment would make it more difficult for members to exercise their votes.</p>

 Would it not be extremely damaging if that amendment were to get through? It would mean that even if people are perfectly happy with how a company is being run, a very small number of people who decide arbitrarily to turn up at a meeting might make decisions, which would be very serious for other members of the company, who would not have the means to ensure that their voice was heard.</p>

 I do not take that point, because any system would try to ensure that every shareholder has the right to engage in deliberations around resolutions that a company might take. Indirect shareholders, who may hold shares through pension funds or mechanisms such as personal equity plans, should have those rights, which is a point addressed elsewhere in the Bill. The extent to which their views will influence the ultimate decision of the company depends on the extent of their shareholding. We want to extend shareholder engagement, and it is important to do so through indirect shareholder engagement, particularly because more than half of shares are held indirectly.</p>

First, they express concern about the impact of a delay between the meeting and the completion of the independent report on the poll. In my view, that is overstated. The report is not intended to delay company action arising from the meeting. It cannot in itself undo resolutions passed or rejected at a meeting&#151;its purpose is to satisfy shareholders about the accuracy and integrity of the polling process.</p>

in the company&#146;s voting processes. It is not entirely fail-safe, but this level of accountability to shareholders should ensure proper practice in the exercise of polls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="61018-0020.htm_para4"><a name="06101860002298">Thirdly, Conservative Members raise the regulatory and cost burdens. The provisions are entirely consistent with our deregulation and better regulation agenda. They empower shareholders with an additional tool by which to hold directors to account. The provisions apply only to quoted companies&#151;around 1,300 or 1,400 in all. Shareholders of companies with good, transparent voting processes in place are less likely to ask for independent reports.</p>

 If they are not used, the objection to them will never become reality, but they remain a tool that could be used. The hon. Gentleman should accept the existence of this mechanism, which will ensure that the conduct of directors in pursuing issues is above board and in order. If it is not, shareholders can employ the mechanism, should they so desire, to ensure that they are properly dealt with. We have put this measure in place to ensure much better shareholder engagement in the processes of a company undertaking its business. I am rather surprised that Conservative Members feel that they have to come back to this time and again and at the final hurdle say, &#147;Actually, we do not think this provision is going to be used at all, so why are you putting it into the Bill?&#148; That is a rather weak argument against a measure that will ensure that shareholders have the rights that we wish them to have in engaging in a proper way. If those rights are ever challenged, they can take advantage of the provisions in this part of the Bill. I ask hon. Members to reject amendment No. 421.</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to present a petition initiated by my constituent, Mrs. Maureen Dunleavy. My constituents do not want to stop the safe and legal riding of mini motos, but they want the dangerous and illegal riding of them to end. They do not want local residents to be at risk on pavements, or to be kept up late at night by the noise. They want the police to take firm action, using the powers that they already have, to curb the high-speed riders. I commend the petition of the people of Irlam and Cadishead, signed by more than 300 residents, to the House. It declares:</p>

 I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for granting this Adjournment debate, which is not only appreciated by Labour Members but, I am sure, by the workers at Peugeot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06101860002820">This is the second Adjournment debate that we have had on this matter, as there are really two issues. There is the general issue of manufacturing in the west midlands, and I am sure that some of my colleagues know exactly what I am talking about. Not too long ago, there was the Rover issue. More locally, the Standard motor car company has been an issue over the years. Then we had problems with Jaguar about 18 months ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06101860002821">Some months ago, we heard the announcement that Peugeot would close its plant next summer. Last week, however, it was announced that the plant will close in January. If we look at that company&#146;s record, we see that it has played ducks and drakes with the labour force and, to a certain extent, one could argue, with the Government at times. Over the past two years, I know that Ministers have had great difficulty in getting answers from the company about its long-term plans in relation to the Coventry plant in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06101860002822">There is therefore nothing new about the way in which the company does it business, but I thought that it was brutal, callous and, to say the least, totally insensitive to announce that the workers at Peugeot will lose their jobs just after Christmas. Someone&#151;not me, but a former Prime Minister&#151;once said that that was one of the unacceptable faces of capitalism, which sums the position up adequately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para5"><a name="06101860002823">I want to raise one or two issues. First, publicity has suggested that Peugeot originally bought the site for &#163;1. Were any inducements or sweeteners used on that occasion? The Minister might not be able to answer that tonight, but I would be grateful if she looked into it. Secondly, what amount of grants, not just nationally but on a European level, have been paid to the company over the years? What conditions were attached to the grants? Those are important points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06101860002824">The reason the company has given for its recent announcement is that a quarter of the labour force have left. By that logic, three quarters remain who want to keep their jobs. We also know that it is a profitable company, so it is a strange logic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06101860002825">Another aspect of the company&#146;s argument that has changed&#151;again, one cannot rely on anything it says&#151;is that it had proposals for eastern Europe. We have now found out that it has cut back on those proposals. It has also announced redundancies in France and Spain. The evidence suggests that the company has been secretive over the past three or four years and, at worst, that it has played ducks and drakes with the labour force, not only in this country but in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06101860002826">I want to thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for visiting Coventry some weeks ago. She discussed with us how we could start to replace some of the industries that we are losing, certainly in the Coventry  <br>

area. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) will agree that the meeting was useful. She banged heads together and got some movement on the new medical technological park that will be located at Ansty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06101860002827">We want to thank the Minister for something else. We made representations to her about employment, which, as I am sure she knows, is a complex issue, certainly in Coventry. We were very concerned about Jaguar, and about what would happen if assisted area status was withdrawn. The Whitley site employs 3,000 or 4,000 people, and there are proposals for further developments. We raised the issue of the Peugeot site itself, and also the way in which Rolls-Royce might be affected. I am pleased to say that we secured some positive movement, which many people, especially the trade unions, will appreciate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06101860002828">What is also appreciated is that, when the story broke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer offered us a quick meeting, along with the unions. The unions&#146; problem at the time was that they could not persuade representatives of the company to sit down and talk about alternative proposals. As a result of the Chancellor&#146;s intervention we got talks going, although they did not work out in the way that we wanted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06101860002829">We have had major debates about the west midlands economy. There have been indications that Ministers are considering a new industrial strategy for the west midlands. As I said earlier, they are enthusiastic about the new medical and technological park. While on the one hand we are losing jobs, on the other there are some positive signs. Nevertheless, we see it as our job to put pressure on Ministers to ensure that manufacturing jobs start to be replaced. According to various reports, there is a drift to the service industries in the west midlands. We want to see a halt to that, and more of a balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06101860002830">There are pockets of social deprivation in some parts of the west midlands. Not everything is rosy. Some good things are happening, but training and skills are needed to end that social deprivation. I know that the Government are investing in those. The west midlands is famous for research and development. The Chancellor has made extra money available, but we must keep up the momentum. The more research and development money we can put into the universities of the west midlands, the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06101860002831">I am sure the Minister knows that we have taken a great interest in RAF Cosford. Welsh Members have been lobbying hard, but we think we have much more to offer in the west midlands. We have a number of first-class universities, and a good many skills. We want to retain those skills at Cosford and we also know that the creation of a further 2,000 or 3,000 manufacturing jobs is a possibility. All in all there are some positive signs, but we must not be complacent. We must continue to push as hard as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06101860002832">Thank you very much for granting me this debate, Mr. Speaker. I hope that the Minister will respond to the points I have made, some of which are very serious. I am sure that it will help those affected in Coventry if she can provide some answers&#151;although we cannot help them completely, because they will have a very bad Christmas: they are going to lose their jobs.</p>

 I echo the thanks of my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham)&#151;whom we all congratulate&#151;to you, Mr. Speaker, for your kindness in granting us this debate. The presence of a good-sized group of distinguished hon. Friends from the region shows that, although the issue has been around for a long time, it is still of intense and topical interest to us all. We look forward to hearing from my right hon. Friend the Minister shortly. We are also pleased to see our hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), the Solicitor-General, who&#151;apart from his ministerial responsibilities in the Cabinet&#151;shares our local interest. As a Minister and as a Member of Parliament, he has always taken a particular interest in employment matters in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06101860002834">My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South dealt with the issue very fully. He described the company&#146;s behaviour as brutal, callous and insensitive, and I have to say that, unfortunately, that is how it is viewed by most employees at the plant&#151;or, at least, those who are still there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06101860002835">It is particularly apposite that the Minister is replying tonight, as she knows from her recent visits to Coventry some of the problems that we face, as well as some of the great opportunities that we are seeking to seize. In other words, we are not being negative about the matter, though there are important points about Peugeot to be made. As a city, an area and a region, we are seeking to forge ahead and it is appropriate to tell the Minister how well she has done in bringing a new impetus to the development of the Ansty site in Coventry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06101860002836">I wish to raise two specific points that arise from my what my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South said. First, there is the matter of the &#163;5 million that the company alleges it has put into the relief of hardship cause after its decision&#151;a decision that came out of the blue and contradicted many previous undertakings. The availability of the &#163;5 million became one of the great hopes of people involved. I am not sure that the Minister can answer this evening&#151;what she says will be transmitted to the company in any event&#151;but people need to know whether it is real money or whether it amounts just to the 20,000 man-hours claimed today to be at the disposal of employees by way of advice. If the latter, it is a scam and it is silly of the company to pretend in this way. It devalues its undertakings and, frankly, shows the company to be precisely what it is: insincere and unreal. It would have been far better not to have made the remark and not to have given the undertaking in the first place. We seek clarification on that point. It is not too late: the company could still make some contribution of real money, which would be appropriate in many deserving cases that could be identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06101860002837">My second point relates to the sudden announcement that the closure date is being brought forward from July next year to December this year. The unfortunate incidence of the timing has already been highlighted. It seems to me to reflect once again the insensitivity of the company. Many trade unions and employees have told me that they made plans to stay until July next year on the very clear understanding that they had a firm, legally binding commitment from the company to continue their employment up to that date. I do not know the details,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Oct 2006">

have not seen any paperwork and do not know what undertakings&#151;verbal or otherwise&#151;were given. The unfortunate employees, however, now feel that they have been treated unjustifiably, unfairly and contrary to every undertaking that the company had given. I cannot comment further, but I put those two specific points to the Minister and look forward to her transmitting them. If she cannot answer tonight, I hope that in due course the company will hear and reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06101860002838">My last point is a more general one for the Minister to consider. In this age of global competition, a company can sometimes buy land or other assets in advantageous circumstances at a knock-down price&#151;Longbridge is a good example in many ways&#151;or it can be given grants or inducements to take on a particular set of circumstances, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South mentioned. Well meaning though a company may be, those circumstances represent a concession in kind of a very considerable magnitude. There must be a system of clawback and I believe that there is such a system in respect of regional grants. I do not think that they have ever been employed, but the Government must toughen their whole stance. In an increasingly mobile world, in terms of employment and capital, the Government must be prepared to face up to these companies, tell them what the terms are and insist that they be respected. It must not be a one-way street. </p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) on securing the debate and I thank both him and you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to contribute briefly to it. There is a broad measure of agreement on this. Points about Peugeot can be made on which I know MPs and councillors across the political spectrum feel very strongly. I hope that the Minister accepts that feeling on this matter is equally strong across the political spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06101860002840">The reason is, as hon. Members have already said, that this company has cut the ground from under the work force in Peugeot not once or twice, but three times. It has done so, first, by indicating that the successor model to the Peugeot 206 would not be built at the Ryton plant; secondly, by announcing that the closure of the plant would take place in July 2007; and thirdly, as has been said, by bringing that date forward to January of next year. The company has obligations to its work force that it must honour, and, as the Minister may know, 450 members of the work force still do not have a job or further training to go on to. I hope that she will be able to put what pressure she can on Peugeot to honour those obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06101860002841">I have only one complaint about this Adjournment debate. Its title is erroneous. The Peugeot plant that we are discussing is not in Coventry, but in Warwickshire and in my constituency. I do not make that point purely for the sake of geographical accuracy. I accept that the hon. Gentlemen who have spoken and the other Members in the Chamber have a legitimate constituency interest in what is happening, but I raise the point because the Government and the Minister are also engaged in a review of assisted area status. Warwickshire is unlikely to receive assisted area status under the new regime, and that will present a particular problem when the 143-acre site that constitutes the Ryton factory ceases to be a  <br>

He will know&#151;I have told him before&#151;that we offered &#163;14.4 million to develop the new 207, but that project did not proceed. There was a grant about five years ago to support the introduction of an additional shift when demand for the 206 was at its peak and Peugeot has also participated in a number of research and development projects that have received grants from Government. However, it has not received grant funding directly provided to other partners in a joint project.</p>

We have discussed that point with Peugeot and the company has given us a firm assurance and commitment that the &#163;5 million is real money and that it has gone into funding the resource centre. It has also said to us that it will allocate more money if that is required for the resource centre.</p>

Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said, there are 450 workers and their families for whom we must all work hard to try to secure alternative employment, or training that could lead to other jobs. But I also want to express optimism, because there are good things happening in the car industry and manufacturing in the west midlands. I deliberately chose the west midlands as the first area to visit on my tour of the regions because of my interest in, and commitment to, the manufacturing sector, and because manufacturing is so important to that region. It is the largest sector and employer in the west midlands and it still constitutes 23 per cent. of gross value added in the area. So it is important, and we need to build on it through investment in innovation and research and development, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South said, using all the levers that we have to ensure the continuation of a strong and modern manufacturing sector.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="06101860002851"><a name="61018-0021.htm_spnew5"><a name="06101860005427"><b>Jeremy Wright:</b>
 I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way and I accept that she is as keen as I am to bring back manufacturing jobs to the area, and preferably to the site in question. She will accept that all those involved want Ryton to be a productive site in terms of employment. But on the question of assisted area status, which I raised earlier, is there any way in which she can help those trying to market the site to make it more attractive as an employment opportunity?</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="06101860002852"><a name="61018-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="06101860005428"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman has got it wrong, because assisted area status is only one lever. One reason the area could not be considered for such status was the improvement in gross domestic product and the reduction in unemployment that it has enjoyed. However, and as I have said to the many Members who have expressed concern about the loss of assisted area status, in the round, such status provided about &#163;200 million-worth of investment last year, and it provides eligibility for investment and state aid. Last year, the regional development agency spent some &#163;2.2 billion to &#163;2.3 billion. So this Government are choosing to invest a lot of resources&#151;we go not for tax cuts, but for real investment in jobs and people. A lot of money is available and I hope that Advantage West Midlands, working with local MPs and with us, can put it to good use in the area and bring back that site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="61018-0021.htm_para28"><a name="06101860002853">One reason I visited the west midlands was to address the issues faced by another site&#151;the old Marconi site, which has been mothballed for far too long. I wanted to ensure that we can work through the planning difficulties and those arising from the involvement of many different authorities, so that we can release the site and enable it to become productive and to provide jobs and manufacturing input.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way, for dealing with manufacturing issues in the west midlands, and for recognising how key manufacturing is to our vital industries and the huge knowledge base that we possess. In order to continue to develop the different types of manufacturing, will she form a task force involving all the regional partners, including the trade unions? Given that her Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher), is, like me, a member of Amicus, I am sure that my right hon. Friend will continue to work with the trade unions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o291"><a name="06101860002855"><a name="61018-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="06101860005430"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 We will certainly make every effort that we can, working through the existing task force. During my time in the west midlands I visited my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency and opened Morsons, which is a new specialist aerospace engineering consultancy that will provide 200 high-quality engineering jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para0"><a name="06101860002856">BMW will make the engine for the Mini at Hamms Hall, in the constituency of the Solicitor-General. That is 250 jobs. When I was up in the west midlands, I announced the opening of a new nanotechnology centre, which will also make an important contribution to the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para1"><a name="06101860002857">I feel optimistic about manufacturing. We have to get the policies right, make sure that we improve our productivity, and invest in research, development and innovation. We have to build on the strengths of the west midlands, which is at the heart of manufacturing industry. I also feel optimistic about the automotive industry. It gets such an undeserved bad press. We are producing more cars in the UK today than at any time through the &#146;80s. One has to look back to the &#146;70s. Production is about &#163;1.6 million. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Sorry, I meant 1.6 million cars, not pounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para2"><a name="06101860002858">A couple of weeks ago, the Chancellor launched the new Mini, which will have a British-made engine. The new Nissan is not only made in Britain, but designed and developed here too. Sales of the new Civic are so strong that Honda has announced a major expansion in Swindon, which will create 700 jobs. There are 2,600 companies active in the automotive components sector. They contribute &#163;4.8 billion added value and employ 132,000 people. I have just come back from a tour to Japan, Korea and China. I talked to people at the Japanese car companies and they see the UK as the place of choice in which to invest to create cars for the European market. Our job is to encourage them to continue to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para3"><a name="06101860002859">Of course, we regret the closure at Ryton and we wish that it had never happened. It is true that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South said, Peugeot is cutting jobs across the whole of its business: 2,300 in the UK, but 7,200 in France and 400 in Madrid. It did bring forward the closure&#151;it kept us closely involved&#151;in part because more people were choosing to leave earlier and production became more difficult. We have to look forward and work to ensure that all those without a job find one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para4"><a name="06101860002860">I have already heard a lot of good stories involving people who have found alternative employment. Chris Parker, who is 48, has found alternative employment within PSA Peugeot Citroen. That is an internal redeployment. A number of people are now working at Cummins, for example. I know that it is 30 or 40 miles away, but it is a good company that provides good industrial jobs. Danny Evans, aged 31, who had been with Peugeot for seven years, has moved there. Peter Millington, aged 46, who had been with Peugeot for 16 years, has also moved there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06101860002861">There are 6,000 vacancies notified to the resource centre. I looked through the list and the quality of those job opportunities is striking. The list includes vacancies at BMW, Unipart, Perkins, and Hutchinson Ports. There are more than 100 vacancies at other PSA operations in the Coventry area, including at a new headquarters building in the Stoke area. The list also includes some vacancies in Dagenham, which everybody is welcome to. The engine centre is expanding its work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="61018-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06101860002862">I congratulate hon. Members and I will work with them and other stakeholders in the area to ensure that we put in place strong, continuing modern manufacturing that is sustainable over the longer term. I do not in any way underestimate the impact&#151;the damage&#151;that closures of this nature have not just on the work force, but on the local economy. We have worked closely with Peugeot and with the local partnership, which I commend, through the resource centre so that we can provide a quick response to support those who are affected. We will continue to work with the partnership to help all workers who require assistance in finding employment and we will continue to work with Peugeot and others as they develop their remaining business activities in the UK.</p>
