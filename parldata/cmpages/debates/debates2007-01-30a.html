With the rapid expansion of Milton Keynes, they are even less likely to get a seat in future. However, there is one thing that the Minister can do for me. Virgin trains stop to drop off passengers at Milton Keynes during rush hour, but not to pick them up. That is frustrating for commuters, when there are empty seats and it is the last stop before Euston. Please will the Minister look into that matter?</p>

Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), who for many years has campaigned for that extra investment.

We are desperate for more capacity on the service, but one of the problems in providing that capacity is the franchise fee that One Railway pays each year to the Department for Transport, which is &#163;50 million.

I have made that point not solely to the House, but directly to the management at First Great Western. I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris), the Minister with responsibility for rail, has done so too. We have raised concerns on behalf of passengers not simply in Slough, but further west in Bristol. I am glad to say that First Great Western has recently apologised publicly to its passengers. Its challenge is to take the remedial steps necessary to ensure that the new rolling stock, which should already have been available to passengers, is made available.

In the past few weeks, overcrowding has led to passengers fainting on trains; we have seen commuter rebellions and newspaper campaigns about the raw deal that passengers are getting; and last week, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris), and my office received a letter from a lady in Scotland whose daughter had to stand from Kirkcaldy, the Secretary of State&#146;s spiritual home, all the way to London&#151;a five-hour journey. The Secretary of State has promised us another White Paper. When will the Government actually start doing something to fulfil some of their promises in their 10-year plan on tackling overcrowding?</p>

Gentleman is right to acknowledge that there is genuine public concern about capacity. There has been a significant uplift in the number of people using our railways in recent years. He challenges me to name some of the improvements that have already been brought about as a result of investment. Southern Railways&#146; new trains programme represents the biggest single procurement of commuter trains in 40 years, and some 1,700 old slam-door trains have been replaced by 225 new rail vehicles. The west coast main line delivers 12-car suburban services on the southern end of the route and there is scope for growth in future years. For Chiltern, the delivery of the Evergreen 2 allows more trains to operate into Marylebone. Although there is genuine public concern, it is difficult for the Conservative party to be a credible articulator of that concern when it seems to be saying simultaneously that it wants lower fares and taxes and higher investment. That simply does not add up.</p>

However, if I were in his position, I would be asking myself why, although I was spending so much money, the situation for many passengers was still so bad. How will he cope with the official forecasts of more than 30 per cent. growth in passenger numbers in the next seven years? If we already have an overcrowding crisis on our railways, where are those passengers going to travel?</p>

There are two sources of funding available to address the capacity challenges that we face. In terms of public resources, there is the contribution from the fare payer and the contribution from the taxpayer. It is necessary to find the appropriate balance. In recent years, the net contribution from the taxpayer increased significantly, but we will continue to address the matter and we will bring forward further proposals this summer.</p>

The straightforward answer to that is to ensure that there is sustained investment. Many people forget that back in the days of British Rail there was annual budgeting, whereas we are now looking at year-on-year budgeting, which can make a significant contribution.

They might not, however, like some of what they see on television with regard to how the political process works, and I have sympathy with them on that. Members of this House must work very hard in engaging with young people on the issues that are important to them and in finding ways in which they can express their opinions and get them heard. In my constituency, the London borough of Lewisham has an elected young mayor who has a budget from the council which is used to involve young people between the ages of 11 and 17 in the electoral process.

There are a variety of ways in which we can continue to involve young people in the political process both locally and nationally, but I am sure that the debate on whether we reduce the voting age to 16 will continue for some time to come.</p>

<p><a name="st_o118"><a name="07013046000174"><a name="70130-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="07013046000619"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell):</b> With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the recommendations of the independent casino advisory panel. The panel has today published its report, and I would like to thank Professor Crow and his colleagues for their work. Before I turn to the recommendations, I would like to remind the House of the context in which we are allowing these new types of casinos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07013046000175">Gambling is on the increase. People want to gamble, and technology allows many new forms of gambling. Existing regulation is inadequate and leaves people exposed to risk, so, through the Gambling Act 2005, we have placed the protection of children and other vulnerable people at the heart of gambling regulation for the first time. Yet if I believed everything that I read in the newspapers about that Act, I would never have introduced it. So let me be very clear: Las Vegas is not coming to Great Britain. British casinos will be subject to new controls, which will be the strictest in the world. For example, Las Vegas-style tricks of the trade will not be allowed. There will be no free alcohol to induce more gambling, and no pumped oxygen to keep players awake<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> I do not know whether you are considering providing it for Conservative Members, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07013046000176">It will be a criminal offence to permit a child to enter a casino or the gambling area of a regional casino. All casinos will be required to have staff who are trained to spot the signs of problem gambling and intervene where necessary&#151;if they do not, they risk losing their licence. It was safe in the knowledge of those protections that we took the decision, in response to demand from local authorities, to allow a limited number of new casinos. Some 68 local authorities, representing all the main political parties, subsequently made applications to the panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07013046000177">The Act allows 17 casinos in total, one regional, eight large and eight small. Because the new casinos will be different from those we have seen before, we have listened carefully to the concerns of Members of Parliament and their constituents. We thought that it was right to be cautious. I could probably say this in 50 different languages, but the message would be the same: we cannot and will not even consider allowing further casinos until a proper evaluation over time has been made of the social and economic effects of the 17 casinos<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

so that proper assessment of changes in the pattern of gambling can be made. The assessment process will be in place in good time for the opening of the first new casino.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07013046000181">The assessment will not be complete until at least three years after the award of the first licence, and it will be in addition to the prevalence studies of patterns of gambling, which we are undertaking every three years from 2007. The benchmark prevalence study is currently under way to establish how many people gamble and what proportion of them have problems with their gambling. The findings will be published this autumn, when the Gambling Act 2005 takes effect. The findings of the next prevalence study will not be published until autumn 2010. I therefore wish to make it crystal clear to the House that those safeguards preclude any consideration of further casinos for the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07013046000182">I am required by the Act to make an order identifying the local authorities where the 17 new casinos should go. So, in October last year I established the casino advisory panel, under Professor Stephen Crow. The primary consideration for the panel throughout has been to ensure that the areas facilitate the best possible test of social impact. Subject to that consideration, I also asked the panel to include areas in need of regeneration, which would benefit&#151;in terms of new jobs&#151;from a new casino, and to ensure that those areas selected are willing to license a new casino.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07013046000183">The panel has been operating entirely independently of the Government, and I would like to place on the record my appreciation for the rigour and professionalism that Professor Crow and his colleagues have brought to the process. It has been an open and transparent process throughout, and the views of local people have been taken into account at every stage, as the panel has visited different local authorities around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07013046000184">The panel asked local authorities to include their evidence of local consultation. Local people were invited to participate in the examinations in public that were held in the seven short-listed areas for the regional casino. During the process, a number of areas, including Brent, Canterbury, Dartford, Thurrock and Woking, withdrew their applications to the panel in response to local opinion, which is evidence of the Act working as it should. A number of local authorities, such as Hackney, St. Albans and Slough, have also taken advantage of new powers we put in the Act and resolved not to licences any casinos in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07013046000185">After 16 months of consultation, and having considered all the evidence available, the panel has recommended today that the following authorities should be entitled to issue a small casino premises licence: Bath and North East Somerset, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lindsey, Luton, Scarborough, Swansea, Torbay and Wolverhampton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07013046000186">The panel also recommends that the following local authorities should be entitled to issue a large casino premises licence: Great Yarmouth, Kingston-upon-Hull, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Newham, Solihull and Southampton. In addition, it recommends that Manchester should be entitled to issue the one regional casino premises licence permitted by the 2005  <br>

Because I am conscious of the need to maintain the integrity of the independent process that we have established, it is only fair to all the applicants that I should take the time to consider the report&#146;s contents carefully. Moreover, I am also required by the Gambling Act 2005 to consult both Scottish and Welsh Ministers. I am therefore announcing today that, following the consultation with the devolved Administrations, I am minded to return to this House at the earliest opportunity with an order that will enable Parliament to consider the panel&#146;s recommendations and to vote on them. The order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and the debate will be held on the Floor of the House, as agreed with my right hon. Friend the Chief Whip. That means that Parliament, rightly, will determine the outcome of the process.</p>

Members and others have about it, and about casinos. However, I have always sought to ensure that the Government proceed cautiously on this matter, with the strongest possible safeguards in place and on the basis of the best evidence of public protection in the face of what is, undeniably, rising public demand. That is what is we have done.</p>

No doubt the Chancellor is licking his lips at the prospect of tax revenues on the scale now evident in Australia. The Government&#146;s handling of the liberalisation of gambling has been undermined by charges of privileged access and influence for overseas casino operators. As a result, despite today&#146;s verdict from the casino advisory panel, many questions remain.</p>

Was that her intention? Did she anticipate such a rush for licences? Can she assure us that on no account will those casinos be allowed to trade up their licences and, as a result, bring &#163;1 million jackpot machines to towns throughout the country?</p>

That is an unprecedented change and the Government will rightly be judged on its consequences on society. The Secretary of State may make statements about Las Vegas not coming to Britain or about oxygen and free drinks, but there will be alcohol and we will see unprecedented gambling in the UK. She claims that no children will be allowed into casinos, yet as she knows, she rejected the call for ID checks on entry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70130-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07013046000207">Let me finish by saying that although the hon. Gentleman talks about the consents awarded before the 1968 Gaming Board licences were terminated in April last year, 13 of those applications have already been turned down by the licensing magistrates. At this stage of his Opposition career, the hon. Gentleman should know that licences&#151;some have not even been considered yet&#151;do not inevitably translate into casinos, as it is a long process. Consents depend on the support of the local authority and local people. This has been a period of great change and the people of this country would be at risk without the new Gambling Act 2005, not because of it.</p>

My constituents will also be grateful for her words today when she made it clear that there will be tight controls in respect of criminality and problem gambling.

Although the planning is some way off, we expect that the regional casino will be part of a much bigger complex and development. It will not be possible for children to use the same entrance to go a swimming pool or library as people use to go into the casino. Such separation is part of the way that we give effect to the regime to separate children and gambling.</p>

The choice of Manchester heralds the arrival of doorstep gambling across the UK&#146;s towns and cities tomorrow, with many people encouraged to gamble more than they can afford or their families can afford. Can the right hon. Lady not recognise, even at this late stage, the superior claim of places such as Blackpool as a resort destination casino, which would be an added boost to tourism? If she cannot do that, can she recognise the deep social change that her plans are unveiling today, and offer Labour Members a free vote when the measure comes before the House?</p>

On the point about deep social change, that social change is going on anyway. Every single television and mobile phone, as well as the internet, offer opportunities for gambling which were not available even five years ago. The Government are committed to public protection through legislation that protects the vulnerable, but we recognise that millions of people want to gamble as a legitimate leisure pursuit and should be allowed to do so. That is why we have presented the proposals. It is slightly disingenuous of the hon.

The city council, working in partnership with this Government and previous Governments and using the Commonwealth games as a launch pad, has regenerated much of the area.

Donohoe (Central Ayrshire) (Lab):</b> I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 24, to discuss a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,</p>
<a name="70130-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07013046000460"><ul><p class="tabletext">the shutting down of the Ayrshire plants of Simclar in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark) and, as important, the decimation of the electronics industry in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07013046000269">I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to raise the issue today. Closing the two plants in north Ayrshire has been a body blow to the local area&#146;s employment. We can be sure that it will immediately cost some 500 jobs, and some commentators have estimated that the real effect will raise that figure to 1,000 or even more. That is the equivalent of the loss of 4,000 jobs in Glasgow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07013046000270">The subject is far from being a local issue. I feel duty bound to point out that it is simply the latest in a line of crushing announcements about the Scottish electronics and manufacturing industry. In recent weeks, the closure of a company in Dundee was announced. Closures have also been announced in places as diverse as Edinburgh, South and Inverclyde. It is a tragedy for such events to happen in silicon glen. The unemployment that that will create is surely important nationally. However, the paramount issue is that common causes are at work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07013046000271">Scotland&#146;s&#151;and, indeed, the United Kingdom&#146;s&#151;ability to remain competitive in the global market is surely a salient issue that needs to be addressed. The jobs that are to be axed immediately by the company will reputedly be transferred to a location in south America. This latest catastrophe should be the signal not only for action in Ayrshire but for a full debate on the prospects for similar businesses across the whole of the United Kingdom. It is our duty to review the environment that we provide for this crucial sector of business, and to act accordingly or face similar repetitions until there is little left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07013046000272">As a result of this closure in my constituency, some 420 skilled men and women will be looking for work, with limited options at their disposal and little hope of finding employment in a similar or even related field anywhere in the United Kingdom. Many questions surrounding the closure of Simclar need to be answered, and I believe that the House should have the opportunity to question Ministers on this subject at the earliest possible time.</p>

Today, under Standing Order No. 151, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments drew the special attention of the House to the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006. It took the unusual step of reporting the instrument for defective drafting in no fewer than five areas. A convention of the House is that debates on statutory instruments that are prayed against are not held until after the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has considered the regulation. However, the Government held a debate on this instrument prior to that consideration, thereby denying hon. Members full information before deciding on this important legislation. I know that you strongly protect the rights of hon. Members from unfair practices by the Executive. Are you satisfied with the Government&#146;s action in this matter?</p>

At the moment, there are no regulations on this issue, either published or before the House. Decisions are being issued in the media, and indications are being given that no exceptions could possibly be made, despite the fact that, under section 81 of the Equality Act 2006, there is no limit to the amount of exceptions that could be made in the circumstances. Furthermore, there was no mention of adoption agencies in the Bill, and nor were there any Divisions on amendments. Nor has the matter been thoroughly discussed in the way that is required. I suggest that the way in which this matter is being conducted is bringing the House into disrepute, and I would be grateful for your opinion.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07013046000281">I have been waging a campaign on this issue in the House for about a year, in order to get our society and our Government to address much more effectively, efficiently and comprehensively the effects of climate change. Those effects include coastal erosion, higher sea levels and waves, coastal flooding from the sea, flash floods, inland flooding from heavy winter rain, increasing numbers of homes at risk of flooding, more rats, diseases such as malaria, skin cancer and heatstroke, disruption to wildlife, new predators, crop failures and drought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07013046000282">Adapting to the effects of climate change should include measures such as: improving sea defences; raising riverbanks; building bigger storm sewers, especially in urban areas; pest control of, for example, rats; NHS training to diagnose and treat tropical diseases with which this country has not hitherto been familiar; public education to avoid heatstroke and over-exposure to the sun; green corridors for wildlife, which will often move north; lessening markedly the leaks from water pipes; new reservoirs; and new rules on planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07013046000283">We have known about greenhouse gases and their consequent climate change effects for several decades. Even nowadays, almost all the debate about climate change, both within Parliament and outside, is about addressing the causes&#151;emissions. The Government have done well domestically and shown real leadership internationally in relation to the causes of climate change, but limiting global emissions is not within the control of any UK Government. Conversely, limiting the effects of climate change in the UK is wholly within the control of the UK Government. Public debate and action, however, has centred on one half of the problem&#151;the causes&#151;which is not within our national control, while it has almost wholly neglected the other half of the problem, namely, the effects, which is within our national control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07013046000284">The Government have belatedly started to address the effects of climate change, and I salute the work of the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment. However, much more needs to be done, much more quickly. The effects of climate change are already upon us and will only get worse: we need only look outside. Dealing with the effects of climate change will require significant resources. As the Stern report showed us, however, a stitch in time will save nine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70130-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07013046000285">Dealing with the effects of climate change will also require cross-departmental co-operation and efforts in many Departments. The Bill, if passed, would simply require annual monitoring and reports to Parliament, so that we can all see what steps have been taken across government, and what steps have not been taken, to address the almost unspoken half of the climate change equation&#151;effects.</p>

We fully understand her right to do that, we support the decision that she made, and it is not for us to inquire into such a personal decision; but her decision did reveal&#151;and this is a matter of legitimate public debate&#151;the gap between the Government&#146;s official claims about the state of special education provision in our mainstream schools and the reality of the tough decisions that parents across the country must face.</p>

That very point about inclusion in mainstream provision not necessarily equating with real inclusion was powerfully brought out in an excellent report by John MacBeath for the National Union of Teachers. He said:</p>
<a name="70130-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07013046000463"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There was also frequent testimony to exclusion within the mainstream classroom. &#145;Just being in a mainstream class doesn&#146;t mean inclusion&#146;, argued one primary headteacher.&#148;</p>

It can be the case that provision in a special school targeted on children with special educational needs is the best foundation for enabling such children to participate and be included in mainstream society as they grow up. Of course we wish to achieve inclusion, but the key question is: what constitutes inclusion?</p>

It is a complex situation which the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech is not properly reflecting.</p>

It was a private school, catering for dyslexic boys. Because the boys attended a special school&#151;not a mainstream school&#151;with their peers, their performance improved enormously. Many of them said that they had been saved by going to that school, and many local authorities, including Labour ones, sent boys there.</p>

I have great respect for what he is doing in the Department for Education and Skills; he clearly recognises that there are problems due to the rate at which special schools are closing, which is why he has tried to produce guidance about slowing down the rate of closure. However, he may be wrong in doing that&#151;much as it pains me to say so&#151;because his warm words will not stop the closure of special schools, when the Government&#146;s policy framework and the legal requirements are still in place.

I want to make it clear that, contrary to the Opposition&#146;s claims, we absolutely do not have a policy of closing special schools. In fact, over the past six years, spending on maintained special schools has risen by about &#163;400 million to &#163;1.4 billion, improving the quality of provision in those schools. The proportion of pupils with statements who attend special schools has actually risen over the five years. Ninety new special schools have opened in the last two years alone. If we had an anti-special schools policy, clearly it would be failing&#151;and I would not have opened three new special schools in the west midlands in a week over the summer, or be looking forward to opening a new special school on the site of a mainstream campus in my constituency shortly, or the extension to another special school in my constituency in March.</p>

It is useful for us to have time to discuss such matters in detail. Notwithstanding the relatively brief debates that we had in the course of the Education and Inspections Bill, since our last major debate on the subject on the Floor of the House two significant reports have been published that have been highly critical of the Government&#146;s provision&#151;the Education and Skills Committee report and the Ofsted report on inclusion. Those reports follow hard on the heels of reports by Ofsted in 2004 and by the Audit Commission in 2002, which highlighted serious flaws in standards and access to provision for children with special educational needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07013046000424">I agree with much that is in the text of the motion. It touches on many of the issues that I shall raise in relation to the training of staff and the need for the Government to review their statementing process. However, as I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), I regret the framing of the debate, which is polarised between provision in mainstream schools or provision in special schools. By polarising the debate in that way, we are in danger of missing many of the more complex failings in the provision of education for children with special educational needs, which many parents come to discuss with me in my surgery. I often laugh at the fact that the hon. Gentleman has a habit of writing comments with which I agree, but when he speaks he has a tendency to talk me out of supporting him. I shall attempt to resist that urge today and be more conciliatory.</p>

mainstream school, with additional support; in a mainstream school with a specialist facility; in a mainstream or special school with additional part-time support at a unit elsewhere, such as the Hope Centre in my constituency; at a special school co-located with a mainstream school; or at a special school. Collaboration between mainstream and special schools is possible and desirable, albeit that it does not happen often enough. I therefore fear that the debate that we have had so far is rather a false one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07013046000427">The key issue, as highlighted by innumerable reports by Ofsted and the Audit Commission, is that of quality&#151;or a lack of it, or at least variations in it. Variations in quality exist between and within different types of school. Sadly, there is good and bad provision in mainstream and in special schools, and bad provision in either is unacceptable. For me, Ofsted&#146;s most damning statement about education for children with special needs concerned the low aspirations about, and poor understanding of, what constitutes good progress for children. Why should children with special needs be short-changed on standards and rigour? Critical to the success of children in all schools, whether mainstream or special, is the quality of teachers and the quality of leadership. The level of expertise and training is the key factor in standards in schools, regardless of type.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07013046000428">The Government failed to respond to many of the Select Committee&#146;s criticisms, but I am pleased that they at least responded to criticism about the training of the work force, as the Minister outlined. That is welcome, but I suspect that we have a long way to go. Last September, I spent a day shadowing teachers in Manor special school in my constituency, and one of the things that shocked me was the amount of time that senior management are required to give to training staff&#151;all staff, not only teachers&#151;who work within a special school setting. Many arrive with no prior knowledge of special educational needs. The burdens of headship are very great in any school, but greater still in a special school, where the leadership team are required to take such an enormous role in staff development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07013046000429">Many children with moderate or severe learning difficulties also have complex medical needs that a school must deal with effectively. For those children, as well as for many others with primarily physical disabilities, seamless working with the local health service is essential. It is therefore an issue of enormous concern that many local authorities find their joint working with the primary care trust pushed to breaking point as PCTs try to find any service that they can cut to cost-shunt on to councils in order to meet the impending deadline to clear their deficit. In my own local authority, since last September the PCT has, without any consultation, withdrawn speech and language therapy from 160 children and reduced occupational therapy provision to special and mainstream schools by 50 per cent. It now proposes to decommission music therapy for autistic children and mental health services for young people with a learning disability. There is a real danger that short-term cost cutting will have an impact that will last a generation, and I dare say that the situation is not unique to Brent. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07013046000430">Let me turn to inclusion. It should go without saying, although it has not been said enough so far,  <br>

that the key to good provision is that it is child-centred and focuses on the whole child and the family&#146;s wishes, not on the disability. A child with special educational needs is as unique as a child without special educational needs, and though two children may have very similar diagnoses or statements, they may require a very different type of educational setting in order to thrive. However, that approach is surely at odds with a policy objective clearly aimed at placing children in mainstream provision and reducing the number of places at special schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07013046000431">The Minister said that the Government do not have such a policy. However, the 2004 special educational needs strategy, &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148;, clearly states that the proportion of children educated in special schools should &#147;fall over time&#148; and that there should be a &#147;reduced reliance on statements&#148;. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 and the 2001 SEN code of practice outline a similar approach. If the Government have changed their policy, as the Minister claims, I wish that they would simply come clean and say so. As the Select Committee observed in its report, if they are saying that they play no role whatsoever as regards local authority reorganisation or decisions to close schools, that is surely an abdication of responsibility. The Government set the national framework. If they have changed their stance on inclusion and now favour&#151;as the Minister for Schools says&#151;a broad continuum of flexible provision, which I hope that most hon. Members welcome, they should make that clear to local authorities, which have to interpret the strategy on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07013046000432">I do not agree that education in a mainstream setting has failed so many children so badly. Education in mainstream schools, without the sort of expert support and high quality specialist teaching that Ofsted noted and to which I referred earlier, has done that. That failure to support inclusion leads to exclusion in an inclusive setting. Lack of teacher training and support led to the appalling mistreatment of, for example, Jade Chambers, who was restrained 45 times in six weeks. Such lack of training and expertise leads so many children with communication difficulties to go undiagnosed. The frustration of those children, which is inevitable if they do not receive appropriate support, leads far too many of them to develop the sort of behavioural problems that make exclusion inevitable, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70130-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07013046000433">Between 20 and 30 per cent. of children with autism are excluded from school for precisely the reasons that I outlined. We are failing those children badly. Lack of support, appropriate training and adequate leadership makes bullying children with SEN inevitable, as the Warnock report stated. That was possibly the most depressing statement in the report. It is a depressing admission of failure to say that it is inevitable for a child with SEN to be the victim of bullying.</p>

The root of the problem lies with the flawed statementing process and financial constraints on councils.

Parliament, I meet countless families in my surgery who are battling to get the help that they believe that their child badly needs. The lengthy, bureaucratic, highly adversarial process leads in many cases to a long-term fracturing of the relationship between the family and the local authority. That relationship is essential if they are to work together to get appropriate education and care for the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07013046000435">My party is considering reviewing our policies on the matter, but I am sympathetic to the arguments that the Select Committee and others made for a clear division between the body that advises on need and the body that provides the resources to meet the need. My sympathy for that derives mainly from my work in science policy before I was elected. Many of the crises that developed in scientific aspects of public policy began with a loss of confidence in expert advice because one cannot clearly delineate the point at which expert advice ends and political decision making starts. For expert advice to be credible, one needs to separate carefully fact, expert advice and policy based on that advice. One needs to be able to track an audit trail through all the stages involved in making a decision, with clear accountability lines at each point, to pick up on the Minister&#146;s point. For the same reason, I have always felt uncomfortable with the conflation of the roles in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of ruling on the efficacy of a treatment and determining its cost effectiveness. That problem causes much anxiety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07013046000436">We cannot continue with a process that allows local authorities to delay statementing for as long as possible or draft statements in imprecise language to lessen the expense on the authority. I understand the Minister&#146;s point that separating the roles may create a mismatch between those defining need and the budget that must pay for it. However, if we separated the roles, perhaps we could have an honest debate about how big the budget should be, instead of continuing with rationing based on the extent of parents&#146; motivation to fight the system. If the statement of need were separated from the payment of resources, we might be able to break the trap that leaves many children to begin the battle again every time they move house. That applies especially to families in temporary accommodation, who may move from one local authority to another, and looked-after children, who are especially vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07013046000437">That point brings me to the question of resources. Hon. Members will know that, in general, I support the delegation of funding from central Government to local government. However, the situation that we are discussing today is analogous to the commissioning of specialist services in the NHS, in that we need to find a practical and pragmatic way around the issue of hard-to-predict or rare and expensive cases. It plays havoc with the budget of a small local authority if a child requiring high levels of support moves into an area in the middle of a financial year. If we had a central pot from which to support such cases, the pressure on local authorities would be much more manageable. As I have said, my party is looking at these issues at the moment, and we will bring forward more detailed policies shortly. I only hope that the Government will do likewise.</p>

Ofsted was quite clear that there is good and bad provision in special schools. A moratorium would effectively make it impossible to close a school with poor facilities or poor standards, or to rebuild the school or move it to a unit co-located on a mainstream site. Nevertheless, we will support the Conservatives today because we support the substantive points raised in their motion and their call for the Government to review their provision for special educational needs, and perhaps also because we could not support the self-congratulatory and rather complacent amendment tabled by the Government. The Government&#146;s record on this issue is lamentable and their response to the Select Committee report was woeful. It is time that they responded properly.</p>

I am proud of the progress that has been made in the past 10 years, often with the support of Hon. Members on both sides of the House. Indeed, this is a subject about which the public are especially impatient with partisan point scoring, both because it is obviously an area in which personal and professional experience and ideas are not confined to party lines, and because effective policy demands co-operation between central Government and local education authorities, regardless of political complexion.</p>

A high proportion of special schools in Oxfordshire are co-located with mainstream schools, increasing the chances to mix. The number of tribunal cases is low, and has halved to 20 over the past four years. Contrary to the argument in the Opposition motion, in Oxfordshire there have been no special school closures under successive Administrations for decades. It is true that the excellent Ormerod school for physically disabled children is now technically closing, but its special circumstances illustrate an important and positive point&#151;it has had falling numbers because  <br>

parents and their children have chosen mainstream provision. However, it is being changed into a special needs base and will continue to admit physically disabled children while also taking on those with other needs&#151;notably related to communication and autism&#151;from whom demand is increasing. There was not a single objection to the change. I have also checked the numbers relating to special schools in the county. In April 1996 it was 916, and in April 2006 it was 915.6, which demonstrates a quite remarkable stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07013046000444">However, on important questions of special needs choice, availability and collaboration, there is one specific and pressing challenge facing pupils, parents and the local education authority in Oxfordshire on which I want to focus. Alone among English education authorities, Oxfordshire has no post-16 provision in special schools. Thirty years ago, the LEA decided to develop post-16 provision exclusively in further education colleges. I am not knocking the education provided in our FE colleges. Many students transfer successfully, and many parents and Ofsted are satisfied with their support. Equally, however, many parents, especially those whose children have more complex needs, are unhappy. Indeed, the time approaching transition is often a period of enormous anxiety, and it is easy to understand why. Special schools in the county have a good record of providing education in a particularly supportive environment, in which those who might find it difficult to make their way in mainstream surroundings develop the security and confidence to make the most of their abilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07013046000445">Two special schools inspected last autumn&#151;Ormerod and Frank Wise&#151;were assessed as outstanding. Two more&#151;Fitzwaryn and Northern House&#151;were also given top grades, and Iffley Mead special school in my constituency is good and improving. Indeed, I presented awards for the young enterprise business projects in central Oxfordshire on Saturday, and Iffley Mead school was one of the few state schools represented&#151;its project won an award. Yet, at the age of 16, Oxfordshire students have to leave these supportive schools, with their more sheltered provision, and move to the environment of an FE college. These colleges are often some distance from their homes, have more students, and have a social ambiance which, with the best will in the world, will not always be easy for a student with complex special needs. It is recognised that such colleges are not suitable for some students, but that means that their parents have to make the case not only for alternative provision, but for out-of-county provision. In general, Oxfordshire has one of the highest levels of provision for in-county SEN, yet nearly half of those who are educated out of county are post-16, at a cost &#163;1.4 million a year, because their needs cannot be met within the county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07013046000446">Parents campaigning for change in Oxfordshire have worked through a very effective voluntary organisation, Choice, which is committed to disabled young people post-16 being offered the same educational choices as those without disabilities. The county council and learning and skills council responded by commissioning a review by Dr. Matthew Griffiths. The review set out options for the future, and Choice conducted a consultation with parents, who overwhelmingly favoured special school-based provision.</p>

This is a step forward, and while there have been fears over whether responsibility would lie with the school or the college if something went wrong, the council has made a commitment that each pupil will have a document setting out their entitlement and the way in which parental concerns will be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07013046000449">What we really need, and what most parents want, is real choice for children to continue as a school student at a special school&#151;a choice that is available elsewhere but not in Oxfordshire. However, the county&#146;s proposals are a genuine attempt to make progress by opening up the school route without destabilising the FE provision. The financial implications of all that are that an extra &#163;150,000 will be required in the next financial year, rising to an additional &#163;1.1 million in 2010-11, even if only students with the most complex needs have places in special schools. It would be twice that amount if all special schools had the age range extended to 19. There are additional capital costs involved as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07013046000450">Because Oxfordshire is in a unique position in terms of provision, it has ended up in a uniquely disadvantageous position in relation to funding. No one is suggesting the Government have deliberately brought that about&#151;the situation is clearly a product of the very unusual trajectory that provision in Oxfordshire has taken. On the one hand, the county&#146;s grant from the Department for Education and Skills through the Learning and Skills Council is very low because it has historically spent less on post-16 special needs students, because they went through the FE route; on the other, the further education colleges only receive funding in line with colleges elsewhere, despite the fact that in Oxfordshire they are effectively providing special schools on their roll. As a result, county officers advise me, Learning and Skills Council funding for post-16 special needs in Oxfordshire is &#163;15 per head of the 16-to-19 population, compared with a national average of &#163;63 and an average of &#163;48 for our &#147;statistical neighbours&#148; among other shire counties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07013046000451">Therefore, there are crucial questions for Ministers to answer. As Oxfordshire grows special school post-16 provision into the system, will funding be increased to a fair level comparable with other areas? Will those who continue in FE, whether through choice or compulsion, get fair financial provision compared with their peers in other areas who are in schools? There are basic questions of equity that must be addressed. In November, I wrote to the Secretary of State to seek a meeting with an appropriate Minister on that matter, and I hope that in his reply my hon. Friend will tell me both that Oxfordshire&#146;s unique position is recognised and that he will be pleased to have an early meeting with me and other Oxfordshire MPs to examine those questions.</p>

That is why so much stress is involved in the whole statementing process. As I understand it, a remarkable 236,700 children in this country have statements&#151;2.9 per cent. of the total. Nearly 1.3 million children in this country with special educational needs do not have a statement, and nearly 6 per cent. of those who do have a statement are in mainstream education. As the Minister and most Members will know from their constituency surgeries, the whole process is long drawn out, hugely time-consuming and traumatic. The vast majority of those parents who come to my surgeries, month in and month out, to tell me about their children, paint a picture of their family being at an all-time low, totally stressed out at a vulnerable time, and faced with a wall of bureaucratic paperwork. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) pointed out, the process is often very daunting.</p>

We went to the local authority, and we did not receive the statement that we felt was appropriate. We then went to a tribunal. Even for two people with professional qualifications, that was a trying and exhausting experience. While that was taking place, I wondered all the time how many of my constituents would have coped, and do cope, in similar circumstances. Often, they do not cope at all.</p>

replaced by a special needs profile, which should be drawn up by independent, accredited profile assessors using objective criteria. The child in question would be allocated to one of approximately 12 levels of support, each of which would attract funding that would be provided by a national funding agency. Vitally, the child would then carry those funds to a mainstream or special needs school. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) feels strongly about that point.</p>

The LEA is not driven necessarily by the primacy of the needs of the children; it can also be driven by the cost implications of the statement. The extra intervention and help will always have a cost implication. That is why our proposal takes a great deal of pressure away from the LEA through the setting-up of a funding agency, and enables the child to take that funding stream with him or her to either a mainstream school or a special school.</p>

There is no question but that special schools do a superb job. I understand that they are six times less likely to be classed as inadequate, and yet they are three times more likely to close. North-West Norfolk has two special schools The Alderman Jackson school caters for children with special needs ranging from those who are seriously disabled and who require 24/7 attention day, in and day out, through to those who are still disabled and have serious special needs but on a more moderate scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07013068000012">Ethel Tipple school is in the same part of King&#146;s Lynn, not very far away. The pupils range from those with mild special educational needs to those with moderate SEN. Many have come from mainstream education: typically, they have been in mainstream education throughout their primary careers. When they move to secondary school, they find it difficult to keep up. They may end up being bullied, or distracting the class. The attention that they received as a result of their statements in primary school, in smaller classes where other children may have had less inclination to pick on them, enabled them to settle, but they find it difficult to settle in secondary education and consequently move to Ethel Tipple school, where some have been given back their confidence and self-esteem and, as a result, have returned to mainstream education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70130-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07013068000013">Our local education authority is now obeying the instructions of the Minister&#146;s Department and is merging the two schools. To be fair, there will be a brand spanking new school on the site of Ethel Tipple, but Alderman Jackson school will close. All the special-needs children, including those who are seriously disabled, will be taught in the same school. Of course I look forward to the new school opening in due course, but I think that the jury is out. We are moving into uncharted waters. The process of closing a school that was able to give hands-on attention to children with serious special needs and disabilities and moving them into a general special school will be fraught with problems. I hope and pray that it works, but obviously it will be a question of waiting and seeing what happens as we step into the unknown.</p>

I understand that 58 per cent. of children who have speech and language therapy written into their statements receive it. Time and again I meet parents in my constituency whose children have speech and language therapy written into their statements, but do not receive it. I recently met a group of North-West Norfolk parents from the spectrum group allied to the Norfolk branch of the National Autistic Society. There is mixed provision for their children, most of whom are on the autistic disorder spectrum. They range from children who are completely non-verbal to those with mild dyspraxia, mild dyslexia or mild autism.</p>

Tom is also six and also in mainstream education with a statement. He is articulatorily  <br>

A few months ago the primary care trust decided to keep a speech and language therapy position unfilled until the new financial year because of pressures on it. A letter that I have received from the county council explains that the problems caused by reconfiguration of the PCT have led to many difficulties. Another big problem is the extent to which the local education authority liaises with and talks to the PCT. There are lessons to be learnt. The good news is that the post is to be filled, but there will be a backlog&#151;a legacy&#151;of problems.</p>

Wherever parents may be, they want a speedy, highly professional diagnosis as early as possible: at nursery school, in the very earliest years. As for statements, we want the balance to be changed, and if there is to be an appeal process, let us make the darn thing fast.

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07013068000033">We must also look at costs. We have underrated that issue, and it has not been alluded to in the debate. The cost of failing to identify problems and of not providing proper provision must be considered. That leads to many children being excluded from school. The figures in that respect are very worrying; I think that I am right in saying that 27 per cent. of those excluded have special educational needs. Exclusion is expensive. Although it is expensive for a young person to get special provision within a particular framework, it also becomes expensive if that young person starts truanting or gets involved in crime. We should also consider the NEET category&#151;those who are not in education, employment or training. A high proportion of NEETs&#151;as high as 80 per cent. in some areas&#151;have a history of special educational needs. My Committee also conducted a prison education review last year. It showed that about half of the people in prison have a history of poor education, lack of education and special educational needs. Therefore, the cost to our economy and to society is great.</p>

If a Committee gets things right, it picks up a resonance, and we then report that resonance&#151;we write it down and tell the Government about it. We faced great difficulty in breaking through the usual suspects&#151;all the pressure groups and the people who want to abolish all special schools and those who do not want to close any.

Indeed, one Saturday afternoon I even went to Hampton Wick in the constituency of the hon.

I was told that in some cases that means that they have a child forever, and about what happens at 16 and 18 and when education runs out, and about what happens when there is no work or no special provision&#151;and about how the woman in such circumstances has often been deserted by her male partner, and she has to look after that child until he is 40 and then 50 and so on then until her own life is finished.</p>

We struggled; we fought with the school to keep him, and it played ball with us by keeping him there. Unfortunately, in the end neither Max nor the school could cope, so we moved him. We were lucky; we were able to move him to a specialist school. Over the next four years, he improved dramatically&#151;his self-confidence in particular improved&#151;and last year, when he was 13, we were able to bring him back into the mainstream.

Schools are shutting down, and there is a lack of qualified teachers to help children; there are even staff cuts. Last weekend, I met one of my constituents, Pauline Hicks, whose 9-year-old daughter, Darcey, is severely deaf. She showed me a letter that she had received from the speech and language therapy manager of Mid Essex primary care trust to the head teacher of her daughter&#146;s school that said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07013068000047">Because of a lack of resources there is now nowhere for her to take her daughter to receive the support that she needs. The problem is that, with the best will in the world, if the Government want to deliver on their objectives, they must put in the necessary resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07013068000048">Chapel Hill school in Braintree was in a very poor area. It went into special measures, and when it did so, I decided to become a school governor. Of the children attending Chapel Hill, 42 per cent. had some form of special educational needs, yet when I arrived there was not a single special educational needs teacher. We eventually found one who had had six weeks&#146; training, but it was too late. The school had to close and the children and the community were ultimately broken up&#151;in some families three children ended up going to three different schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07013068000049">Southview school, another excellent school in my constituency, has just built a beautiful new building, yet the Government have made its task of kitting it out more difficult by ending the excellent communication aids project. The problem is the lack of consistency in Government funding. There is no point in funding for one or two years; there must be consistency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07013068000050">However, the biggest challenge, as we heard from the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), is statementing.

It begins with &#147;Assessment&#148;, goes on to &#147;Bureaucracy&#148; and ends with &#147;Complexity&#148;. This is a big issue.</p>

Smith (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab):</b> I, too, am very pleased to be able to debate this topic, which is of critical importance to everybody in the Chamber today and to every Member of the House of Commons. It is acknowledged in all parts of the House that we still have some way to go on this issue. I agree completely with the Select Committee&#146;s conclusion that we need a review of statementing policy, and I hope that at some point, the Government will agree to conduct one more quickly than they have already promised to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para29"><a name="07013068000056">However, the issue is not just the statementing process; we must also acknowledge that there are sometimes problems with the implementation of statementing decisions. I, like many Members who have spoken today, will refer to the personal problems that I have experienced with the statementing process. My sister&#146;s little boy was unable to speak at all by the age of two, and by the age of three he was still living in a world of silence. The general practitioner, the health visitor and the nursery school staff would not believe that little Tom had a problem. In this case, the mother&#151;my sister&#151;knew that something was wrong, but all the professionals refused, up to the point of school entry, to do anything about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para30"><a name="07013068000057">In the end, a statement was arranged, and the question whether my little nephew was on the autistic spectrum was investigated. At one point, it looked as though he would be placed on that spectrum, but in the end, a statement was arrived at and the school put some support in place. However, the support and the statement were inadequate, and in the end, my sister had to go to a tribunal to get the situation sorted out. I was going to be a witness at that tribunal, but an advocacy service supplied by a charity from Hull sorted out the various issues before the tribunal took place. One point that has been overlooked today is that the tribunal process, adversarial as it is&#151;in fact, it is a sign of the failure of the system&#151;often resolves such issues. In the end, local authorities back down; they do not like tribunals. If a good advocate is available, the issues can be resolved. That bright little boy, who was trapped in that silent world, is here with us today. Because his mother was prepared to fight, he has got over his problems, is off the statement and is doing very well at school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70130-0011.htm_para31"><a name="07013068000058">The problem with the existing system is that, far too often, parents have to fight for the statement and its application, and to fight continually to keep that statement in place. I know of cases where the reviews of statements at the point of transition to the secondary level have led to a downgrading of the support that should be available to enable a child to be placed in the mainstream sector, rather than in the special school sector. When a parent is so desperate that they have to visit their MP&#146;s surgery to argue the case against a review ruling and to get things put right, we know that the system has gone wrong.</p>

Does the hon. Lady not accept that one of the endemic failings of the statementing process&#151;not in all authorities but in many, and of both major political complexions&#151;is the tendency to use words such as &#147;frequent&#148; and &#147;regular&#148;, which are gloriously unspecific? Christmas is regular, but it does come only once a year.</p>

<p><a name="st_o293"><a name="07013068000060"><a name="70130-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="07013068000775"><b>Ms Smith:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, I was about to say that it is important to distinguish in this debate between the Government&#146;s general policy approach to special educational needs and the specifics of how authorities are implementing SEN policy. The statement is at the heart of that process. We should always remember, in trying to evaluate how well we are doing in delivering the best possible services for children with special needs, that local authorities are responsible for developing SEN practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07013068000061">Government policy on SEN is clear; &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148; emphasised the continuing role of special schools and stressed the need for a flexible range of SEN provision, with special schools acting as centres of excellence for spreading good practice across all maintained education provision. That, to some extent, is why I do not understand the position of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) and her party, who say that they will vote with the Conservatives on the moratorium. Our policy is to encourage a broad continuum of provision, and anybody who disbelieves that will have to explain why Sheffield has been awarded substantial capital funding in the past five years to build five new special schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07013068000062">We are building those five new special schools because our previous provision, which was located in a particular part of Sheffield, was in the wrong place and that meant that children living in the far north of the city were travelling great distances to get to school. Anybody who has dealt with children with special needs knows that travel to school is one of the biggest and most difficult issues in terms of SEN policy. It takes some children in Sheffield an hour and a half to get to school in the morning. That is why we have to redevelop our provision, and why a moratorium would be disastrous for my city. As a result of it, we would not be able to close down the old schools and build new ones in the right places, in order to give our children the best possible chances in the education system. Moreover, three of the new schools will be close to mainstream provision, thereby making it easier to offer a really flexible range of learning opportunities for students. In many cases, a mix of mainstream and special provision is best. Even in the mainstream sector, my city is developing integrated resources and the usual mainstream provision for special needs students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07013068000063">On top of all this, the city&#146;s schools are expected to work together to deliver for SEN kids on an individual level. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) was the important one. If we get personalised learning right for SEN children, we get it right for all children. If we get learning right for children with dyslexia in state schools, we get it right for all children. I have taught English post-16, and I have taught people with dyslexia. If a person with dyslexia needs yellow paper  <br>

in order to read more easily, everybody in the class should have handouts on yellow paper. That improves outcomes for the dyslexic individual, and does nothing to harm the learning of all the other children in the class. It is not rocket science&#151;we can do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07013068000064">I am convinced that the Government have got the right strategic approach, but they also have a responsibility to ensure that local authorities and schools deliver the best possible learning opportunities for all children with SEN. There is no doubt that we have further work to do on that point. Too often parents complain that in the cases of non-statemented children&#151;the issue of dyslexia becomes more relevant here&#151;provision in mainstream schools is poorly developed and inconsistent in application. That is why the Government were right to respond by promising more effectively trained SENCOs; an entrenchment in schools of personalised learning, so that all children can be catered for; and more rigorous internal monitoring and evaluation by school of pupils&#146; progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07013068000065">Making it mandatory for SENCOs to be teachers is critical. There is no point in having teaching assistants as SENCOs in schools. Teaching assistants do a fantastic job, but being a SENCO is a job for a teaching professional. It is a key leadership role and the use of teachers in that role is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07013068000066">We will have to await the impact of the Government&#146;s measures in terms of improving the delivery of SEN education for children in the classroom, but what is certain is that parents are the key. They should be fully involved, and any decent school will fully involve parents in putting together the individual education plan for their child. Parents should be involved in monitoring and encouraging progress, but we also need to think afresh about how to strengthen even further the voices of parents with SEN children in the system. What does a parent do when the LEA refuses to believe that a school is doing something wrong? The parent goes to the governing body, which sides with the school. As a cabinet member for education in a local authority, I received letters from parents of children with special needs, complaining about schools. It happens in all authorities. I would demand that something be done and the officers would say, &#147;You are the LEA, so you have to defend the school.&#148; Incidentally, one good thing about the Education and Inspections Act 2006 is that it separates the schools from the local authorities and makes those authorities the champions of parents in terms of challenging schools to deliver for SEN children. However, we still need to do more and I challenge the Government to find new ways of breaking the cycle of powerlessness that parents experience when things go wrong in schools. They are the first ones to know, and we should always listen to them when they say that things are not right.</p>

As with most issues, the answer lies somewhere between the two poles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07013068000070">As the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) would no doubt agree, there are many children with special educational needs who most certainly should be in a mainstream school, including many children with physical disabilities, children with mild cerebral palsy who have good communication skills and cognitive ability, and children with very mild learning difficulties or mild Asperger&#146;s. For such children, inclusion in mainstream schools is very important and beneficial. It may mean that some adjustment is needed by the school, but it will be worth it to ensure that those children have access to a full curriculum and to the social benefits of being with a wide range of children, including being able to socialise with children who live in their neighbourhood, and all that goes with that, such as parties, sleepovers and weekend sporting activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07013068000071">However, there are other children whose needs are such that they require very specialised teaching, and providing that is not just about training, but about the experience gained in a career devoted to teaching children with particular problems and needs. In October I visited the Percy Hedley Foundation in Newcastle, a special school that educates children with severe cerebral palsy. It uses an advanced form of the Hungarian conductive method, which uses physical therapy to re-educate the brain to operate the muscles and limbs. There is a lot of one-to-one therapy by highly trained and dedicated teachers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07013068000072">Many children with cerebral palsy are intelligent, but their physical difficulties mean that they need that specialist education to help them to overcome those problems. Children who are permanently confined to a wheelchair when they start at the school can learn to walk. Children with no communication ability can be taught to use a computer with a switch operated by touching it with their cheek. No mainstream setting could give that sort of training, and therefore access to a full education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07013068000073">Which type of education is most appropriate must depend on the needs of the child and the wishes of the parents. The whole &#147;race to inclusion&#148; which occurred after the Warnock report of 1978 was a reaction to a legitimate problem. One of the great successes of the post-Warnock era has been the fact that disabled children are now integrated into a common educational framework. It has also led to an emphasis on the specific needs of the individual, rather than making assumptions based on medical diagnosis. But the problem with how that inclusion has been adopted in  <br>

practice is that it has become an end in itself, rather than being focused on the needs of individual children. Because of that, the inclusion movement risks discrediting the concept of inclusion. It is naive to believe that it is possible to teach all children with serious and profound learning difficulties in the same classes, learning the same lessons, as their mainstream peers. Some disabilities, such as more severe forms of autism, make communication and interaction almost impossible. Forcing such children to interact in a mainstream school with hundreds of people can be extremely damaging for them.</p>

<a name="70130-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="07013068000725"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Statutory assessment is a slow and unresponsive process...Most parents said they &#145;had to fight&#146; to have their child&#146;s needs formally assessed...This was often linked to a perception that the local authority was trying to control its expenditure.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07013068000085">It recommended that the</p>
<a name="70130-0012.htm_brev4"><a name="07013068000726"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Government should establish a high-level independent review to consider options for future reform&#151;engaging all key stakeholders.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07013068000086">The need for a review was also emphasised by the Education and Skills Committee in its report last year, which said:</p>
<a name="70130-0012.htm_brev5"><a name="07013068000727"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the SEN system is demonstrably no longer fit for purpose&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07013068000087">and found</p>
<a name="70130-0012.htm_brev6"><a name="07013068000728"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;significant problems with the current system of SEN provision and high levels of dissatisfaction amongst parents and teachers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07013068000088">The report went on to urge the Government to</p>
<a name="70130-0012.htm_brev7"><a name="07013068000729"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;consider a completely fresh look to SEN&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07013068000089">The Government&#146;s response to the report was disappointing. The hon. Member for Huddersfield summed up his Committee&#146;s view when he said that the Government&#146;s response was</p>
<a name="70130-0012.htm_brev8"><a name="07013068000730"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the most abrasive and challenging that I have ever read in any response to a Committee report since I have been Chairman.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 26 October 2006; Vol. 450, c. 492WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07013068000090">That is an awfully long time. By rejecting a review, the Government rejected one of the most fundamental and important findings of that entire Select Committee report. They are promising an Ofsted report in 2009, which means that two more years will be wasted, with little done in the interim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07013068000091">The Opposition seek only two things from the Government this afternoon, and if they deliver them they will have our full backing. The first is a moratorium on any more closures of special school places until a review has taken place. We do not want the stop-go process that the Minister for Schools  <br>

described but merely a pause, to ensure that we are going in the right direction. Our second requirement is a fundamental and immediate review of SEN provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para29"><a name="07013068000092">I hope that the Government will concede to these demands. By doing so, they can improve the education available to thousands of special needs children, and ease the burden on their parents just a little.</p>

Members of all parties today. We may differ in our opinions about policy, but we share a common ambition to improve the educational attainments of children with special educational needs and disabilities. We also want to improve their health, safety and well-being, and to increase the extent to which they are able to contribute to society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07013068000094">I pay tribute to the skill and dedication of the staff in our schools and early years settings, and of the professionals in the education, health and social care services. Working together, they do their best to ensure that children with SEN and disabilities are able to make the most of their time in education. I also pay tribute to the parents of children with SEN and disabilities; there are some such parents in the Chamber today. They know their children better than anyone else, and they sometimes feel that they have to battle to get them the support that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para31"><a name="07013068000095">It is worth taking stock and looking at the context of the Select Committee report. The Government have taken positive action as a result of it, although other initiatives&#151;some of them were mentioned at least tangentially in the debate, while others were not&#151;were under way already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para32"><a name="07013068000096">My hon. Friend the Minister for Schools was right to say that support and training for SEN is an integral part of introductory teacher training. We are also working with the Training and Development Agency on a programme worth &#163;1.1 million to ensure that people in the early stages of becoming teachers have opportunities to secure placements in special schools. We are also working to create an information portal so that they can share best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70130-0012.htm_para33"><a name="07013068000097">We are keen to do more to promote access to specialist support. My hon. Friend the Minister for Schools earlier mentioned the 15 new specialist schools that we will be creating. We are also keen to work with special schools, and to tap into the expertise of their staff, so that more outreach work with mainstream schools can be undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07013068000098">We want parents to enjoy better accountability and support&#151;a common theme in this debate&#151;and we will achieve that in part through the parent partnership services. They play a really important role: they can help parents who are unsure about whether their child has special needs, or assist them with the statementing process. In addition, they can provide support for parents who, believing that the school to which their child is being sent is not the best option, go through the special educational needs and disability tribunal  <br>

process. We want those services to remain at arm&#146;s length from local authorities, and we intend to beef them up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07013068000099">In addition, we are working with the National Autistic Society&#146;s autism working group, and many hon. Members will have attended the launch of the society&#146;s &#147;Make School Make Sense&#148; campaign. We are working closely with local government organisations, teaching groups and the NAS to prepare better resource packs for teachers so that they can identify children with autistic spectrum disorders and subsequently support them in the classroom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07013068000100">We are also doing a lot of work with statementing, and are introducing a new performance indicator for the full process. A performance indicator is already in place that requires a local authority to have a draft statement ready 18 weeks after a statement is first requested. The new indicator will set out a maximum end-to-end period of 26 weeks for the statementing process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07013068000103">The debate has not covered the amount of investment that the Government have made available. Ofsted has reported improvements since the publication in 2004 of &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148;, our long-term SEN strategy. For example, the percentage of children with SEN who do not achieve at least level 3 in maths at key stage 2 has fallen from 28 per cent. to 25 per cent. between 2003 and 2005. For English, the proportion of children with SEN who do not achieve at least level 3 has fallen from 31 per cent. to 27 per cent. That shows that the Government&#146;s policy is making a difference in terms of attainment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07013068000104">Those improvements reflect the increasing investment that the Government have made in provision for children with SEN. Local authorities&#146; indicative spending on SEN rose to &#163;4.5 billion in 2006-07. Of that total, &#163;1.3 billion is delegated to maintained special schools, and &#163;1.8 billion to mainstream schools. Budgets for special schools are rising by 23 per cent., from &#163;1.1 billion to &#163;1.3 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07013068000105">The hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) talked about statistics, and about the effect on parents of the statementing process. When considering the context, it is worth bearing in mind that of the 1.3 million children with special educational needs, only 3,215 have gone through the SENDIST&#151;special educational needs and disability tribunal&#151;appeal process, and only 332 did so on the grounds that they were not happy with their choice of school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70130-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07013068000106">In the short time available for my response, I hope that I have been able to get across the facts about the extra money and extra resources that we are putting in. We are making a difference for children with special educational needs, and as Ofsted says, the right time for a review will be 2009-10, when we can effectively measure the differences and changes that we have made. In the meantime, the moratorium that has been mentioned by many Members would result only in the scrapping of new developments and new schools, such as the facilities in Leicestershire and Oldham, so if that  <br>

I remind the House of the relevant facts. In 2001, the British Government were asked to consider applications for export licences for the sale to the Tanzanian Government of an air traffic control system. The system cost &#163;28 million and the heavily indebted Tanzanian Government took on more debt to secure it. The International Civil Aviation Organisation said that the system was</p>
<a name="70130-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="07013072000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not adequate and too expensive for civil purposes&#148;.</p>

The sale was opposed by leaders of Tanzanian civil society, who advised the Prime Minister that it was &#147;too expensive&#148; and &#147;murky&#148;. In Britain, a wide spectrum of international development organisations were completely opposed to the deal. Oxfam said that the deal was &#147;outrageous&#148; and</p>

The matter should cause us to pause and think carefully about how we interact with Governments in developing countries and to what extent we can and should second guess their priorities if the British taxpayer is partly or wholly footing the bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70130-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07013072000023">The Tanzanian context of the deal cannot be ignored. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. In 2001, more than half the population lived in severe poverty. Life expectancy at birth was 45 years. Primary school enrolment was 67 per cent. Some 2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS. Tanzania had a national debt of $5.4 billion. It had recently received debt relief from the World Bank and the IMF through the initiative for heavily indebted poor countries. For a long time, Britain has been a major donor. In 2000-01, we gave &#163;111 million&#151;&#163;35 million of which was in direct budget support. In handing over that money, British taxpayers wanted, and Tanzania needed, every possible penny to be spent on measures to promote development, such as building basic health and education systems and tackling killer diseases. According to Oxfam, &#163;28 million could have provided basic health care for 2 million people or an education for 3.5 million children.</p>

It is worth noting the powerful case that the then Secretary of State for International Development put forward. She rightly acknowledged that Tanzania could benefit from improved air traffic control, but many experts made it clear at the time that they thought that the dual military/civilian radar system that was sold was vastly overpriced. Despite the high price tag, the system would cover only a third of the country. According to the World Bank, a much  <br>

cheaper and more suitable civilian system could be bought. Indeed, in a bid to be helpful it commissioned the International Civil Aviation Organisation to examine the suitability of the proposed system. On 8 November, the ICAO returned with an extremely critical preliminary report that dismissed the system as using ageing technology and described it as</p>

In the light of that, let us hear today why the British Government concluded that spending &#163;28 million&#151;more than a quarter of the value of UK aid to Tanzania&#151;on an outdated and unsuitable radar system did not completely contradict the very guidelines that they had so warmly embraced?</p>

The Secretary of State is an honourable and decent man whom we respect. As he knows, Conservative Members support the principle of the international arms trade treaty to which the amendment refers. He is fair and open-minded. I was delighted that he said during last Wednesday&#146;s International Development questions that he was considering our proposal for an independent aid watchdog to provide impartial scrutiny of the effectiveness of British aid at reducing poverty. He and I share a commitment to tackling the scourge of corruption in the developing world. He recently starred in a DVD about corruption, produced by the Department for International Development, called &#147;Crimes of the Establishment&#148;. At the time of the affair, he was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development, so perhaps he will tell the House whether, at the time, he sided with the Prime Minister or his departmental boss, the Secretary of State for International Development.

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70130-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07013080000004">I shall begin by setting out some of the history. In 1999, the Government of Tanzania signed a contract with BAE Systems for a combined civilian and military-use radar system. The following year, BAE applied for two export licences for the system. In February 2001, a World Bank report was released, which concluded that the system offered poor value for money and was unsuitable for Tanzania&#146;s needs. The World Bank subsequently asked the International Civil Aviation Organisation for a more detailed report. In November 2001, that ICAO report raised concerns about the project and recommended a further report. At the same time, Tanzania reached completion point under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, and received $3 billion of debt relief, in a package from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In December 2001, the export licence was approved by the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;I shall come back to that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70130-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07013080000005">In February 2002, the UK decided to withhold &#163;10 million in budget support from Tanzania because of concerns about the purchase.

I am telling the House about what the report said. Its import was extremely clear, and I have just referred, in summary, to what it had to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70130-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07013080000008">In July 2002, the then Secretary of State for International Development, the right hon.

The answer is that there was no criterion 8, because the previous Government did not have any published UK criteria for assessing licensing decisions, which is why one of the first acts of the Labour Government after their election in 1997 was to introduce those criteria.

The issue was thoroughly discussed by the Departments involved and, in the end, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry concluded that the licence should be approved. That is not to say that there were no concerns about the system and its suitability&#151;there clearly were, as the World Bank and the ICAO reports made clear&#151;but the test of criterion 8 is whether it is likely seriously to undermine the economy and sustainable development.

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07013080000050">First, there was a need for clearer guidance within Whitehall. We have now agreed guidance for officials when they look at the impact of proposed arms exports on a recipient country. The principle that sustainable development must be taken into account in licensing decisions was enshrined in the Export Control Act 2002, which is one of the toughest licensing systems in the world. The House should recognise that. DFID continues to play an active part in the licensing process. The Export Control Act is due for review this year. The Department of Trade and Industry will lead the process, consulting widely with other Departments, Parliament and civil society. One important area that we will look at is the activities of arms brokers, how well the current controls are working and whether they need to be strengthened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07013080000051">The second question that we need to ask ourselves is how we continue to ensure, as a major exporter of defence equipment and as a major international donor, that UK arms exports do not undermine development. That is what we are concerned about. We know that excessive spending on arms can divert money away from health and education, and irresponsible transfers can be used to ignite violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07013080000052">Nevertheless, all countries have a right to provide for their legitimate defence and security needs, and those of their citizens. For that they need suitable equipment, and few developing countries have the means to manufacture that equipment. Most are dependent on arms imports. In the circumstances, what we can do is to have the right framework for taking decisions about UK licensing decisions, but to recognise that that is not good enough if other countries do not follow the same approach. That is why the UK has been leading the campaign for an international agreement, in the shape of an arms trade treaty, which would benefit everyone and which would also have the power to stop arms transfers that fuel violent conflict, particularly in the world&#146;s poorest countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07013080000053">I turn to the second area of concern: corruption.</p>

If the world did more to control the flow of small arms and light weapons, which are principally responsible for the terrible death toll in developing countries, I am sure the whole House would welcome that.</p>

in Tanzania intensify and gather pace in 2007. The Government of Tanzania will table new, strengthened anti-corruption legislation before the next Session of Parliament. Parliament is also considering a draft Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07013080000067">The Government of Tanzania have just launched the second phase of their national anti-corruption strategy. That sits alongside the public sector reforms currently under way, which President Kikwete spoke about during his recent visit, and which have steadily improved the accountability of Government and the services that they provide to their citizens. These reforms are supported by DFID. I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood for her work in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07013080000068">Reforms include public service pay reform, streamlining planning and budgeting, and increasing accountability. Tax reforms have increased revenue in Tanzania. It is encouraging that Tanzania has managed to lift tax revenues from 11 per cent. of gross domestic product in 2000 to 14 per cent. in 2005. Public financial management reform has improved expenditure control, allocating resources to sectors in line with national plans, and strengthening auditing and procurement. That reduces opportunities for corrupt practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07013080000071">Reforming procurement is particularly important in a case such as the one under discussion. The solution to concerns about the suitability of equipment, value for money, affordability or potential corruption is for countries to have sufficient capacity and their own procedures in place to deal with these matters themselves. That is the solution. In the case of Tanzania, these reforms are important individually, but they also complement one another in bringing about a transformation of the public service as a whole&#151;one that is better able to deliver for citizens and in which the Government are held to account. In Tanzania, we are seeing increasing demands from citizens in rural areas for greater sanctions against local officials who misuse resources. We are seeing demands for schools, clinics, water and roads. We have seen increased public demand for accountability. The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield mentioned the recent demonstration about the radar purchase, in particular, that was organised by Opposition parties in Dar es Salaam. The media have covered the issue, and civil society has added its voice to calls for a thorough investigation. All that demonstrates that in the case of Tanzania, pressure to investigate allegations of corruption in such cases is domestic as well as international. We should welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07013080000072">On international action, the UK has ratified the UN convention against corruption and promoted the very successful extractive industries transparency initiative. We are setting up the governance and transparency fund to help those working to improve transparency, we have established the international corruption group, and we are taking on additional police officers working with the City of London and Metropolitan police. Why? To increase our capacity to investigate bribery, corruption and money laundering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07013080000076">We have also had some successes. In one case, we returned funds to Nigeria that were brought into the UK in a suitcase. In another, thanks to the legislation that we put on to the statute book and the swift work of the police, to whom I pay tribute, in freezing assets that had been purchased with money that had come from Nigeria, the courts ruled just before Christmas that some of those assets could be sold so that the funds could be returned to the people of Nigeria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07013080000077">I want to turn to the impact of all this on Tanzania. While the concerns about the cost of the system were not sufficient to warrant refusal of the licence under criterion 8, as a donor we were concerned about the wisdom of the purchase and expressed those concerns to the Tanzanian Government, particularly as regards governance and financial management. It was the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood who did so. Having discussed all this with the Government, and having received assurances that they would not proceed with purchase of the second phase of the system, we continued with our aid programme. UK aid to Tanzania has doubled from &#163;60 million to &#163;120 million over the past four years and will continue to increase in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07013080000078">With the help of aid from Britain and other donors, Tanzania has made very impressive progress in its efforts to reduce poverty in recent years. Spending on health and education has increased significantly, and spending on defence as a proportion of the Government&#146;s budget has declined. Dependence on donors has fallen from 49 per cent. of the Government&#146;s budget in 2005-06 to just 41 per cent. this year. Picking up the points made by the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield about the difference that our development programme makes, we are seeing results. There are 8 million children in primary school in Tanzania today&#151;up from 4 million in 2000. The goal of universal primary education is within touching distance, with an enrolment rate of 96 per cent. Infant mortality, which was stubbornly high in the 1990s, fell by a third in the five years to 2004. Child malnutrition has fallen. Malaria treatment and prevention has improved, and immunisation rates are high. Of course, there is much still to do, but there has been real progress in improving the lives of poor people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07013080000079">I have tried to set out the background to the case and the process by which decisions were taken at the time.

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07013080000088">There is a moral imperative here.

Despite the Secretary of State&#146;s defence of the decision to grant an export licence, somewhere between the Government, BAE and Barclays&#151;perhaps all three&#151;our reputation worldwide has been left in tatters. How can we tell other countries to live up to their obligations when $12 million dollars lies in a Swiss bank account as testimony to corruption and bribery in those deals?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07013080000089">At this particular time in history, when the world is moving, albeit slowly and painfully&#151;as are we, as the Secretary of State said&#151;to tackle defence contract corruption and is striving to introduce transparency, it is vital that the Government answer to their part in what seems to be a very nasty business. While the Serious Fraud Office must pursue its investigations without fear or favour, it is also right that these matters should come before this House.</p>

The Secretary of State covered some of the ground, but not all. The first concerns the supply of a military air traffic system to one of the poorest countries in the world. One thing that the Secretary of State did not mention was whether he had had discussions with Tanzania as to the fact that only one third of the country would be covered by the system that it was purchasing. The system has been widely criticised, so I want the Government to clarify what questions they asked about the supply of such a system to the poorest of poor countries&#151;as other hon. Members have said, a country to which we were sending aid. Was the actual need for a system discussed? Did the Government advise the Tanzanian Government about the appropriateness of such a system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70130-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07013080000097">Secondly, the allegations of corruption about the sale need to be tackled more thoroughly. The investigation into the air traffic control contract in Tanzania raises questions about the Government&#146;s integrity. Granting an export licence for the military air traffic control system is a scandal. Selling such a system, which costs millions of dollars, to one of the most heavily indebted countries is also a scandal. The Tanzanian air traffic control system deal flies in the face of all that we claim that we want to achieve in aiding poor countries.</p>

It is the first time ever that I can recall the Conservatives asking for time to debate arms export policy. However, they are a little out of date in selecting a topic that was a matter of debate in other quarters five years ago.

The first report that we produced, in July 2002, looked in detail at the specific case of the export of military air traffic control systems to Tanzania, and the implications of the case in relation to the application of criterion 8.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70130-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07013080000126">The criticism there is clear: there were ongoing discussions involving the World Bank about the system, and the decisions to grant the two licences were made before there had been time to consider the outcome of those discussions.</p>

The point was made that it therefore had the right to decide what air traffic control system it wanted to buy. That is absolutely true, but the debate is not about what system it should or should not buy. That has nothing to do with us. The question is: what military air traffic control system we should or should not license for export? That is our decision, and that is why criterion 8 exists. Why would criterion 8 exist in the first place, if the European Union did not feel that it should take into account the impact of such decisions on sustainable development, notwithstanding the fact that Tanzania is a sovereign state that has the right to buy whatever equipment it can?</p>

We asked the Government for a copy of it on 27 March 2002. We eventually received a reply 18 months later, on 28 August 2003. The letter from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated:</p>

We were told, however, that we could not see the cost-benefit analysis on which the decision to grant the licence was based, and that the code of practice on Government information does not apply to Select Committees. We cannot understand that, and I will continue to pursue that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70130-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07013080000131">The issue goes beyond the specific decision to how Committees can scrutinise such decisions. The Quadripartite Committee has previously raised the issue of prior scrutiny of decisions&#151;scrutinising decisions before they are formally made. We were told that we could not do that and that it would not be right, as the Executive must make the final decision. Of course the Executive must make the final decision, but the entire media were engaged in that debate: it was no great secret that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) had a different view from that of the Government.

that in his reply. I am aware of the user guide and that the UK Government have again played a leading role in the European Union on the issue. I have read the user guide, which provides some helpful ideas about how to apply criterion 8, but I would not go as far as to call it a &#147;methodology&#148;. When we review the export control Acts and continue to debate criterion 8, I hope that further time can be given to that issue.

Member for Birmingham, Ladywood asked how many times criterion 8 has been used to reject an export licence application by the UK. The answer is once, as my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70130-0017.htm_para33"><a name="07013080000140">Before speculation becomes rife in the Chamber, let us consider that important question. When a licence is refused, a denial notification must be circulated among the other European Union member states. Given that if France refuses a licence a denial notification must be circulated among the other EU members, the Government presumably know on what grounds it has refused licences on 42 occasions applying criterion 8 grounds. I should be grateful if they could tell us that at some stage, and also tell us why the United Kingdom has only refused on one occasion.</p>

Governments face a difficult dilemma if the only way in which they can react to waste and suspicions of corruption is by cutting off further aid intended to help reduce poverty, but on this occasion we could have prevented this dubious contract by refusing or at least delaying a licence, without cutting off future aid.</p>

We now know, of course, that 30 per cent. of the contract value was paid into a Swiss bank account, but the Government do not want us to talk about that now that we have some evidence. However, we do have the right to know whether Ministers asked themselves the obvious question at the time: why were the Tanzanians pressing ahead with a contract for something that they did not need and could have got cheaper elsewhere, and for which they had arranged some highly questionable finance&#151;all against the advice of the ICAO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others? We know that the former Secretary of State asked herself that question, and that she reached the only conceivable answer: that someone had been offered big kick-backs. The deal stank&#151;it reeked of corruption&#151;but the Prime Minister persuaded other Ministers to hold their noses and let it through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07013080000167">We in this country talk a lot about governance. We lecture the Governments of developing countries, telling them that they must investigate, be transparent and hold Ministers to account, but the sad truth is that on this occasion, the suspicions fell on a British company. It was British Ministers who turned a blind eye; it was the British Government who rushed a decision through before the World Bank could publish its report; it was the British Government who ignored their own code of conduct. The words &#147;mote&#148; and &#147;beam&#148; spring to mind.</p>

He said that Britain could still exert considerable moral influence&#151;that anything that we did to highlight corruption and abuse would mobilise and strengthen the forces within African countries trying to clean up their systems. The sad truth is that this whole sorry episode will make it more difficult for the Secretary of State to exert that moral influence. I suspect that he would agree with me, were he in a position to do so.</p>

They put the well-being of poor people second to the interests of big business, undermined Britain&#146;s influence for good and set a damaging precedent for the future. The stain can be erased only if this House is prepared to do what we demand of others&#151;may I respectfully suggest that it do so through its Select Committee on International Development?&#151;and render the dealings of Government thoroughly transparent and hold Ministers, above all the Prime Minister, to account. It will be to the credit neither of this House nor this country if we let the matter rest as it stands.</p>

could have been better spent. That is undoubtedly so; however, I do not come to this debate with clean hands. If I had wanted a job in which I could keep my hands clean, I would have worked in a laundry. We are working in politics, and on occasion, we must do things for the greater good. Such an attitude is sometimes lacking in this Chamber; instead, Members occasionally hawk their consciences around this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07013080000172">A military system was not needed. We can say from this vantage point that a civil system could have been used, and provided at a lower price. However, and as the Secretary of State told us, we are dealing with an independent sovereign country. We might, and should, try to influence its decisions, and to do that we sometimes have to get a bit close&#151;perhaps close enough to influence the take-up of the second phase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07013080000173">In looking into this situation, I dug out some information on the needs of Tanzania, which is surrounded by eight neighbours. The figures that we have been given tonight for the air force conflict with those that I received this afternoon. Tanzania has 29 combat aircraft, one transport squadron, two training squadrons, two helicopter squadrons, four air bases and 124 airports, 11 of which are paved. It has 750,000 visitors a year, and the number is growing. Imports are growing, as are exports. So the country may have felt that to stay in front in Africa it needed a system that would provide some status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07013080000174">One fact that I discovered struck me as a little odd: all the sailors, pilots and officers in Tanzania&#146;s forces are trained in China.

It was not the place of this Government to say what the Government of Tanzania should do. After this episode, our Government strengthened their procedures further, because they admit that they got it wrong. Although aid was withheld for a short period it was resumed, and progress by Tanzania confirms the wisdom of that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07013080000178">We would all prefer that the money spent on the military were spent on improving the welfare of the people instead, but every country has the right to self-defence. I would not, in any circumstances, welcome or accept a licence for combat aircraft or tanks for a country in Tanzania&#146;s situation, but it had the right to decide that it needed a radar system&#151;irrespective of the type of radar system. Let us divorce the need for the radar system from the type of radar system and concentrate on that point after the inquiry has taken place.

All the parties involved in the deal should be deeply ashamed, but it is not an issue for party-political point scoring. It is good that the debate has not proceeded on that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07013080000181">The truth is that successive Governments of both parties go out of their way to promote British arms sales in a way that is unprincipled, is of no economic benefit to the UK, distorts our foreign policy and undermines our reputation. The case of the Tanzanian air traffic control system is a particularly sordid example of the UK&#146;s approach to arms sales. I am well aware&#151;indeed, hopeful&#151;that the investigation of the case by the Serious Fraud Office might result in criminal charges. That will be decided elsewhere. What is important here is for UK politicians to learn the lessons of the reality of UK arms sales policy and make real changes so that similar deals are not supported in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07013080000182">To that end, I want to put on the record what I know of British Aerospace&#146;s contract to provide an overpriced, outdated and unnecessarily military radar system to Tanzania, and of the powerful support given to the deal by the Secretaries of State for Defence and for Trade and Industry, and by the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister. Let us be clear: although the individuals holding those offices must take responsibility for the approach that they adopted, they were reflecting deeply held views and values in their respective Departments. The problem is systemic in nature, and that is what the House of Commons has to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para28"><a name="07013080000183">When the project was being discussed in Whitehall, I argued that it was clear that the deal was so useless and hostile to Tanzania&#146;s interests that it must have been made corruptly. I had no evidence at that time, but evidence has since emerged that large payments were made to secure the deal. That is especially shameful when what was being sold&#151;to one of the poorest countries in the world&#151;was a useless piece of military technology priced far above its real value. We must therefore ask the following question: if British Aerospace and senior UK politicians were willing to go to the lengths that they did to secure the Tanzania deal, how much further would they go when promoting arms sales worth billions of pounds?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07013080000184">I became aware of the contract when the World Bank representative in east Africa objected to the proposed sale. Some officials who had served in the Department for International Development for many years were surprised that the project had come forward for a second time. I understand that there had been a proposal some years earlier for a military air traffic control system to cover the whole country, but it had been blocked because Tanzania simply could not afford it. Now it seemed that the same project was being split in two and put forward again as a two-stage project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para30"><a name="07013080000185">The World Bank representative in east Africa was very concerned about the contract, as Tanzania was being considered for enhanced debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative. As a condition of debt relief, HIPC rightly imposes controls on future borrowing that require that it must be confined to concessionary lending&#151;that is, aid lending not at market rates from organisations such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank and so on. It also imposes a ceiling even on concessionary lending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para31"><a name="07013080000186">In this case, as has been noted, the loan was provided by Barclays bank which, as a commercial bank, was clearly incapable of providing a concessionary loan. Barclays colluded in this sordid project by inflating the size of the loan, it seems, and then pretending that it was concessionary in order to evade conditions set by the World Bank and the IMF. The smell given off by the project spread a long way, and Barclays has not been held to account, although the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), as his party&#146;s spokesman on international development at the time, tried to do something in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para32"><a name="07013080000187">As has been said, the World Bank representative in east Africa then decided to commission a report from the International Civil Aviation Organisation on the value of the deal to Tanzania. At the time it was argued by the DTI&#151;and some people have repeated as much tonight&#151;that Tanzania would earn money from the air traffic control fees and that the deal would therefore finance itself. As has been noted, the ICAO made it clear that the technology was old fashioned and expensive, that it would cover only half the country at best, and that it would not provide Tanzania with the air traffic control that it needed to develop its tourist industry. That development was very much in the country&#146;s economic interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para33"><a name="07013080000188">By contrast, as I have said, the European Investment Bank was offering a loan at a fraction of the projected cost. From memory, I believe that it put the cost of providing air traffic control to three or four east African countries at about &#163;12 million. The technology had progressed to the point that a much cheaper and more effective civil system was available, and an EIB loan to purchase it was on offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70130-0018.htm_para34"><a name="07013080000189">There is no doubt that Tanzania needed a new civilian air traffic control system to enhance its earnings from tourism.

all arms sales deals and will always find arguments for them. That is how it is and any incoming Government will face the same culture. We need to change it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07013080000192">When the events I was describing were taking place, the Department and I planned to offer Tanzania increased aid to help to fund a big new effort to provide free primary education for all children&#151;it was great to hear the Secretary of State report an achievement figure of 96 per cent. It seemed wrong that our increased aid would finance that objectionable project. The hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) said that it would not. Of course it would. If we give money to a country that is buying a rotten project for which it has to pay in foreign currency, our increased aid is, in effect, funding the rotten project. We cannot turn away from that; we are implicated whatever we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07013080000193">I made the decision to cut back our promised aid by &#163;10 million and went to see President Mkapa&#151;a man I greatly respect and who did a good job by his country. He told me that the contract had been signed before he came to office, a deposit had been paid and there was a penalty clause if Tanzania did not go ahead. I concluded that the best way forward for all concerned was for the UK to refuse a licence under criterion 8. As has been said, Robin Cook had raised the threshold for deals made by all EU countries to include consideration of whether an arms sale would affect sustainable development&#151;a provision that had never been made previously. There is no question but that the project affected Tanzania&#146;s development and that it should have been refused under criterion 8. If anyone argues that it should not have been refused under that criterion, we have to change the wording to tighten up the criterion so that we adhere to the standard.</p>

President Mkapa was a technocrat and a fine President, but he was not politically powerful and he inherited the contract. If the UK had done the right thing by refusing a licence under criterion 8, he would have been a very happy man, but there were penalty clauses for breach of contract and a payment of about &#163;5 million had already been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07013080000196">The important point is that it was a UK decision. At that stage, I spoke personally to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary&#151;then Robin Cook. The Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary agreed that we should stand firmly against the deal, but the Prime Minister just listened and gave no undertaking. The 2001 election then intervened and Robin Cook was replaced by a new Foreign Secretary who was strongly briefed by his Department and strongly supported the deal&#151;the Foreign Office is at it, too; it absolutely believes that its duty to the UK is to promote arms sales.</p>

deal must go ahead, come what may, and all Secretaries of State were pressurised in that direction. We&#151;that is I and officials at DFID, which is a great Department with lovely people&#151;were still determined to fight, but only then did we discover that there was a secret pre-deal approval system. The Ministry of Defence had given approval for the project, which was already under construction in the Isle of Wight, on the basis that it would not be contested because it was uncontroversial. The thing was being built, people were working on it and by that stage, although we tried, no one could be persuaded not to issue a licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07013080000198">It is easy to say that we should cut off aid if there is corruption, but there are many poor and hungry people in Tanzania. The aid is for them. Someone else stole the money, but if we punish the poor for that we are punishing the wrong people. What should we do? That is the dilemma and that is why we need to tighten up our systems. President Mkapa and I reached the agreement that if he promised that there would be no second half to the project, we would go ahead with increasing our aid. I saw him after he had ceased to be President, and he told me that he had kept the promise, so although that makes the system even more useless&#151;because it covers only part of the country&#151;at least no more money was wasted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07013080000199">My conclusion is that we need to ensure that such a project will never again be made. If we all agree that it is disgusting&#151;and I think that it is great to see the Tory party engaging in this debate&#151;we have a chance to try to clean up our system. Current UK policy is based on the assumption that all arms sales are good for the UK economy. Read Samuel Brittan repeatedly in the <i> Financial Times </i>and discover that that is not the case. No other sector is subsidised with so much political muscle pushing up the exports, come what may. If the sector cannot be profitable in its own right, the high-quality engineers who work in it should be redeployed in other sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07013080000200">Secondly, there seems to be a belief that somehow we have to have an indigenous arms industry as though Napoleon might invade and we need to be able to make our own rifles. It is a completely time-lagged notion of the need to prop up and support arms exports. One of its effects is that our military gets lousy radios, lousy rifles and so forth that would have been better supplied if we purchased some of the equipment on the international markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70130-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07013080000201">I repeat how pleased I am that the Tory party has raised this issue, but let us go beyond the usual point scoring. We have really uncovered something dirty here. The sale should never have been approved. All those senior officers in our Government should not be promoting dirty arms deals like this.

regrettable that other Members have not focused on that point. Tanzania is an extremely poor country. When I toured a school near the Kenyan border and met pupils and teachers, I was astounded at the conditions there. I was then taken to the homes of the children and saw that there was no electricity or running water. Those people lived in absolutely dire conditions. They were extremely hospitable, as so many Africans always are. It was a poverty that is unimaginable in our country.</p>

Just think for a moment of having a total budget of only $10 billion, with a population of 36 million.

I can honestly look the Secretary of State in the eye and say, &#147;I do not believe that it is an ethical foreign policy to sell a radar installation that has military implications, and that costs so much, to Tanzania, when that country is so desperately poor.&#148; <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>The Secretary of State&#146;s Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon.

It amounts to one third of the entire education budget for Tanzania. Our aid to Tanzania in 2005-06 was not &#163;121 million as the Secretary of State stated earlier; it was &#163;113 million. We complain about corruption and waste, but we promoted this white elephant ourselves. The radar has a military capability that far outweighs the requirements of the country&#146;s 19 military aircraft. Several hon. Members have bandied around figures for the number of aircraft that Tanzania actually has. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) suggested that the figure was 12, whereas I understand that it is 19. No matter what the figure is, it is significantly smaller than the number that would justify such equipment. I cannot understand how the radar can be a priority for Tanzania, given that it has been blessed with stable relationships with its neighbouring countries. It has not been invaded and it has a democratic Government. When I think about the poverty experienced by the schoolchildren whom I visited in Lunga Lunga, the concept of spending such an amount on a military radar is quite shocking.</p>

He put a very positive spin on the way in which Tanzania is moving. He has been to many African countries recently and he knows the huge financial constraints on those countries. I reiterate again that Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. Having seen the way in which people live in north Tanzania, I agree with the right hon.

Yet a British company sold a military air traffic control system to a country without an air force worthy of the name, at a staggering cost of $40 million.

He stated that there had been one refusal from the DTI under criterion 8, but it was interesting to hear from the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry) that the France-UK score was 45:1.

As a member of the Quadripartite Committee, he has inside information, much of which is confidential. That came across well in his knowledgeable contribution. He said that he was not convinced by the merits of the Government decision. That is a significant remark from a member of the Quadripartite Committee. If I understood correctly, he was not alone in reaching that conclusion. It was the unanimous decision of the Quadripartite Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70130-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0701315000035">The hon.

It is intriguing that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office took 18 months to reply to the Committee&#146;s letter and that when it came, the reply contained nothing more than members of the Committee already knew, which some would argue was an ideal parliamentary answer. The Committee has a reputation for the highest probity and discretion. The fact that the Government refused to provide the necessary information further fuels the suspicion surrounding the transaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70130-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0701315000036">We heard an excellent speech from my right hon.

It was an articulate contribution made with great clarity and intellectual rigour. He asked what was known at the time that the decision was made. He made it clear that it was primarily a military system. No UK Minister has ever denied that, unless the Minister is about to rise to the Dispatch Box and claim for the first time that it was not. I hope that my right hon. Friend was wrong in one element of his conclusions, because what happened with this particular transaction must not set a precedent for the future. He summed up the debate very well when he said that the Secretary of State had been defending the indefensible.</p>

She deserves enormous credit for her consistent and dedicated fight against corruption and for her consistent advocacy of people in the developing world. She has been a fervent champion for the cause of alleviating poverty. I hope that if she happens to leave this place she will continue her passion for helping people who are less fortunate than those of us in this House this evening.</p>

He emphasised the role of the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70130-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0701315000043">We then heard from the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), who deserves to be congratulated on consistently pursuing this issue with vigour and not giving up. He provided a detailed analysis and synthesis of the issues surrounding the export licence. He rightly observed that Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world and that criterion 8 was ignored and overridden. He highlighted the Barclays transaction, which is highly suspicious, and the interrelationships that exist between Barclays bank and the British defence industry. He deserves credit for the consistent way in which he has pursued this controversial issue.</p>

It was in that context that the Prime Minister pushed the deal through the Cabinet, not only against the protestations of fellow Cabinet members but in the face of criticism from the World Bank and the United Nations, fierce opposition from British non-governmental organisations, and pleading from some in Tanzania itself. The International Civil Aviation Organisation described the system as</p>

The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) said that the contribution from his Front-Bench spokesman was intelligent. Obviously, the contribution from ours was very intelligent. Several hon. Members made interesting contributions, including my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry), the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins), the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short), and the hon. Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb). I shall not detail their contributions, but I hope to pick up many of the points that were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0701315000062">The subject of the debate was the Government&#146;s decision on the export of a radar system to Tanzania. I welcome the opportunity to close the debate for the Government by focusing on the decision, the context, subsequent developments and looking ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0701315000063">The episode started in 1992, when our high commissioner in Tanzania alerted the then Government to the requirement for a new air traffic control system, and the Defence Export Services Organisation notified BAE Systems of the prospect. The Government&#146;s decision to issue export licences in December 2001 for an air traffic control system for Tanzania was taken after careful and lengthy consideration of the application&#151;and clearly some controversy&#151;against the Government&#146;s consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development explained, the Government take their responsibility on arms export licensing, including in relation to sustainable development, most seriously. In assessing all applications, we draw on the expertise of several Departments to ensure stringent assessment against the licensing criteria. They ensure that the risks that concern us all, including internal repression, internal or regional conflict, the need to support sustainable development and the risk of diversion to undesirable end users, are rigorously assessed on every occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0701315000064">The Government carried out just such an analysis when they considered the licences for the air traffic control system for Tanzania. We also discussed the issue thoroughly among Departments, and concluded that the licence should be approved. Although there were some concerns about the system and its suitability, ultimately they were matters for the Government of Tanzania to resolve. It was not our place to dictate to the Government of Tanzania which system they thought that they needed. Equally, if the export was not clearly in breach of any of the EU criteria, it would not have been right for us to withhold a licence with a view to blocking the proposed export.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0701315000065">One of the interesting features to come out of this debate is the balance that we need to strike between the criteria that should determine the Government&#146;s action and the independence of a sovereign nation. I should like to cite the remarks of Tanzania&#146;s Foreign Minister Kikwete&#151;now its President&#151;in 2002:</p>

The criteria required us to assess whether the export was compatible with the technical and economic capacity of the recipient country. Beyond that, I repeat that it was for the Government of Tanzania to assess whether the system was appropriate for their needs, and whether to purchase it. The fact that the UK Government issued the licences did not oblige the Government of Tanzania to proceed with the purchase.</p>

It is EU-based and is summarised, I am advised, in the Export Control Organisation&#146;s 2005 annual report, commencing on page 83, and accessible via the DTI website.

Moreover, the principle that sustainable development must be taken into account in licensing decisions was enshrined in the Export Control Act 2002. DFID continues to play an active part in the licensing process, and in all discussions on the arms trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0701315000082">I want to remind Members that UK export controls are among the most robust in the world, and to underline the Government's record on transparency in export licensing. In 1997, we announced, for the first time, detailed criteria for assessing applications, which reflected our commitment to managing arms transfers responsibly, especially so as to avoid their use for internal repression and international aggression. Prior to that, there were no published criteria. Those criteria have been incorporated into the EU code of conduct, which now applies to all member states. Therefore, we have led on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0701315000083">At one stage, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood said that the DTI always fights for arms deals, or words to that effect. If that is true, my Department is failing. In 2005, 129 licence applications were refused and many others were withdrawn when the stringency of the criteria were understood. I am advised that we actually have the highest refusal rate of any EU country. It is easy to throw around insults, but I am here to defend my Department&#146;s stewardship of this important policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0701315000084">We also publish comprehensive details of our policy and decision making in our quarterly and annual reports, and we are of course scrutinised carefully by  <br>

the Quadripartite Committee. Not least because of the issues raised, we will initiate a review later this year of the controls introduced, in 2004, under the Export Control Act 2002. That is timed to commence three years after the new export control legislation was implemented, in accordance with Cabinet Office better regulation guidelines. There will be full public consultation, and the review is timely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0701315000085">The Government also have a proud record on attacking corruption. We have ratified the UN convention against corruption, and put new legislation in place to allow us to do so. We have also established a new internal corruption group staffed by City of London and Metropolitan police officers. Our commitment to a new international arms trade treaty, as highlighted by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, is also relevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70130-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0701315000086">We will learn lessons from any situation of this kind, and the review will be the right time to consider those. We have had a lively debate, but I recognise that differences remain between the Government and the Opposition on this matter. The main differences are obvious. A Labour Government introduced a clear export control regime; the Conservative Government had no such clarity. A Labour Government have taken a series of decisive steps to combat corruption; the Conservatives let corruption fester during their Administration.</p>

The price of a litre of milk has fallen from 24.5p to 18p over the past 10 years, yet at the same time, has risen&#151;if bought from the retailer&#151;from 42p to 51p.

On ANZAC day each year, members of the all-party parliamentary group for Australia and New Zealand attend Westminster abbey to commemorate this important occasion. On 11 November 2006 you, Mr. Speaker, along with several hon. Members from this House, attended the opening by Her Majesty the Queen of the New Zealand memorial at Hyde park corner, three years to the day after the Australian memorial was inaugurated by Her Majesty, both standing as lasting tributes in London to the memory of those Australians and New Zealanders who lost their lives fighting alongside British forces through various wars and conflicts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70130-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0701315000630">The timing of today&#146;s debate could hardly be better. As many hon. Members will be aware, Australia day was celebrated only last Friday, 26 January. There was much revelry and celebration by many of the inhabitants of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands). I fear there may be one or two more sore heads next Wednesday, following the Waitangi day celebrations of 6 February in pubs all over Earls Court and the south-west of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70130-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0701315000632">Some people have defined the UK&#146;s relationship with Australian and New Zealand as being more akin to brotherhood than friendship. The three countries often fall out over sporting rivalries involving cricket, rugby or sailing, but our people have always shared a common heritage and been bound together by a deep-rooted historical camaraderie. That friendship led our three countries to share the tripartite ANZUK force; although it is now disbanded, that military unit used to be charged with protecting ANZUK interests in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70130-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0701315000633">There have been various trade agreements and student and business exchange programmes between our three countries, and we also share the same ideals of democratic governance. Moreover, many school and university leavers from Australia and New Zealand opt to take their gap year in the UK, and vice versa. Perhaps the most significant thing that we have in common is the fact that we share a constitution based on the Westminster model, and all three countries proudly uphold Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as sovereign and head of state.</p>

Gentleman agree that the UK Australia Leadership Forum has been responsible for big improvements in the relationship between our countries? It was set up by the two former high commissioners Michael L&#146;Estrange and Alastair&#151;now Lord&#151;Goodlad, and is being continued by the current high commissioners, Helen Liddell and Richard Alston. It met in London for the first time three years ago, and again in Canberra last year, and it brings together politicians and members of the business community. The Prime Ministers of the two countries have added their weight to the meetings, but both our nations face having a change of Prime Minister in the next 12 months. Does the hon. Gentleman share my hope that future forums will benefit from the attendance of the UK and Australian Prime Ministers and their senior Ministers, as has happened in the past?</p>

Especially, we deprived New Zealand of its main trading partner, about which New Zealanders have some right to feel affronted. Since then, however, I am pleased that Australia and New Zealand have flourished as independent nations. Perhaps the mother country can now learn something from her offspring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70130-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0701315000638">Both nations have shown great determination in defending the interests of their own people, internationally and domestically. Australia and New Zealand do not experience the level of violent crime and antisocial behaviour that we in the UK now endure. They do not release convicted paedophiles on to the streets owing to overcrowding in jails, or allow illegal immigrants to commit crimes within their borders.</p>

Gentleman is teaching at the moment, but from the fact that Australia has followed a very different policy from New Zealand and has been a sycophantic follower of American policy on climate change and on Iraq. New Zealand, on the other hand, has maintained an independent line on both issues&#151;as we should have done in the UK&#151;especially on Iraq, where it wisely stayed out. If we are to learn lessons, it should be from New Zealand rather than from Australia.</p>

Indeed, New Zealand was the only country to send any form of substantial military support, in the form of a frigate, freeing up our own Navy to engage the Argentine enemy and defeat her.</p>

It would also provide indispensable technological and scientific opportunities to research projects undertaken by scientists in conjunction specifically with navy and air forces from each of the three countries in areas such as the Arctic, Antarctica and the south Pacific.

Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell) on securing the debate. At one stage, I thought that he was going to make a speech of a general nature about the all-party group on Australia and New Zealand. I will write to the group in detail on some of the issues that we may not discuss tonight. I want to keep the group abreast of our continuing relationship with Australia and New Zealand. It is a special relationship&#151;it always has been and it always will be. Over the next 12 minutes or so, I hope to set out the work that I am doing as a Minister, in support of the Prime Minister, to sustain that relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0701315000660">From my own perspective, the issue is important because I have family in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. They are probably watching the debate. The McCartneys went to Adelaide and Melbourne many years ago. I regret to say that we meet on only a three-yearly basis. My mother&#146;s family are in Sydney. They are great rugby league fans. My Uncle Bill was a pilot in the second world war. He came here to fight against the Nazis and he took my aunt back home to Australia. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0701315000661">For a Scotsman and a diplomat there is also the question of how much to say about cricket and other sporting events. As a former chair of the all-party group on rugby league, I can say that the British Army rugby league team has defeated the Australian rugby league team in Sydney. That is the first&#151;and I think the last&#151;sporting achievement for some time where we have gained a victory. I thank both the British Army team and the Australians for that marvellous contest. As for our colleagues in New Zealand, I have a Maori name. I am called Tia Puka Iti, which means &#147;little fat man&#148;. However, having lost 5 stone in the last year or so, I think that I will just be the little man and drop the fat bit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0701315000662">The debate gives us a genuine opportunity to discuss our excellent relationship with Australia and New Zealand. We have a close and long-standing relationship with both countries. Political, defence and intelligence relationships are excellent and there is a  <br>

long tradition of co-operation on international affairs. The Prime Minister visited Australia and New Zealand in March last year and I followed up his visit in October. I will summarise the key outcomes of the visits and our ongoing co-operation with each country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0701315000663">In October 2006, I attended the Pacific Islands Forum post-forum dialogue in Nadi, Fiji. That was followed by bilateral visits to both Australia and New Zealand. The objectives and outcomes included bolstering activities in the region, working with Australia and New Zealand to give active support to them and their policies in the Pacific and developing both a bilateral relationship and the multilateral relationship that we have with other Pacific islands and states. Together with our colleagues from Australia and New Zealand, we sent strong messages about the importance of good governance in the region as a foundation for sustainable development. We supported the continued role of the Australian-led regional assistance mission to the Solomon Islands. The objectives and outcomes also included enhancing donor co-ordination in the region and ensuring our continued influence over the direction of European development aid. I supported the considerable efforts of the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, to ensure that the conference was not overshadowed by some of the events in the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para11"><a name="0701315000664">During my visits to Australia and New Zealand, I was able to follow up a number of the themes that were discussed at the forum. They have been followed up since by officials in the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry. In New Zealand, I was able to give reassurance about the United Kingdom&#146;s engagement with the Pacific. As a result, we are sharing our strategic thinking on the Pacific with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and supporting New Zealand&#146;s objectives in the region. I thank New Zealand for taking on consular responsibility for British nationals in several Pacific countries in which the UK is not represented. We reciprocate that assistance in countries in which New Zealand is not represented, so there is a close and effective working relationship between the UK, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para12"><a name="0701315000665">In Australia, we agreed to explore collaborative work to address the specific fraud problems faced by Pacific island countries. I have proposed co-operation between the UK, Australia and other international partners to address the unique climate and energy-related challenges that are faced by small island Pacific states. As a result of the visit, I have asked Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials and British high commissioners in the region to examine how we can maximise our impact in the Pacific and work closely with not only the European Commission, but our colleagues in New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para13"><a name="0701315000666">In November, the fourth UK-Australia security dialogue took place in London. It was an opportunity to hold more detailed discussions on security and defence matters at a senior official level. Both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence participate in the annual event. The agenda for the meeting included the Asia-Pacific region, Afghanistan and the middle east, as well as counter-proliferation and  <br>

counter-terrorism. The agenda will expand next year to include climate security. The hon. Gentleman was thus not quite right because there has been an active relationship on such matters for a considerable time. We should not underestimate that relationship or the efforts put in by ourselves, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para14"><a name="0701315000667">When the Prime Minister visited Australia in March 2006, he arranged to set up an annual Australia-UK ministerial meeting. The first of those took place in London in December 2006, with the Foreign and Defence Secretaries, military and intelligence chiefs and their Australian counterparts in attendance. There were discussions on Iraq, Afghanistan, counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, climate change&#151;including on a UK-Australia energy seminar to develop close working relationships on climate change&#151;and Pacific islands instability.</p>

<p><a name="st_o478"><a name="0701315000668"><a name="70130-0023.htm_spnew2"><a name="0701315001263"><b>Mr. Greg Hands (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con):</b> Will the Minister say a little about the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell) that citizens of Australia and New Zealand should be able to go through the fast-track channel at Heathrow? It seems to me that the channel is used by not only British and EU citizens, but European economic area and Swiss citizens. Surely Australians and New Zealanders could be accommodated in the channel.</p>

<p><a name="st_o479"><a name="0701315000669"><a name="70130-0023.htm_spnew3"><a name="0701315001264"><b>Mr. McCartney:</b> I will get through as many points as possible. I listened carefully to the wide-ranging speech made by the hon. Member for Romford, some of which we could all accept and understand and some of which was a lot of red herrings. It is important that the all-party group understands that there is a significant, welcome and supportive relationship among the three countries at every level, whether that is political or cultural. I hope that the relationship will be sustained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para15"><a name="0701315000670">New Zealand was the first country to give women the vote, and I was delighted when Prime Minister Helen Clark visited us last year. She met the Prime Minister and they jointly opened the New Zealand war memorial at Hyde Park corner on 11 November. As the hon. Gentleman said, that was a follow-up to the event that took place three years previously to honour the sacrifices made in not only the first and second world wars, but other circumstances. I was privileged to attend that most moving occasion in November, when I was reminded again of the extraordinary contribution that New Zealand made to the allied effort in the second world war. As Helen Clark said:</p>
<a name="70130-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="0701315000705"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The War Memorial commemorates the sacrifices which New Zealand and the UK have shared in times of war and serves as a monument to the relationship between our two countries. It will be appreciated by all who see it, both the British people who live in or visit London and also the many New Zealand citizens&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para17"><a name="0701315000672">Just as we have a dialogue on security with our Australian colleagues, we have such dialogue with our colleagues from New Zealand. The last meeting was held in London on 17 November, when talks were held on counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, counter-narcotics, organised crime and the security implications  <br>

of the rise of China. The next talks will expand to include a consideration of climate security. I hope that I have been able to explain that there is significant dialogue on all the matters that the hon. Gentleman raised.</p>

<p><a name="st_o480"><a name="0701315000673"><a name="70130-0023.htm_spnew4"><a name="0701315001265"><b>Andrew Selous (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> I declare an interest as a Member who is half-Australian. It strikes me that Australia has quite a lot to teach us on social policy, whether that is through how well it runs its child support agency or through its network of family relationship centres, which do much to prevent family breakdown. Will the Minister reassure us that the Government will focus closely on links involving social policy, perhaps through the Department for Work and Pensions and other Departments?</p>

<p><a name="st_o481"><a name="0701315000674"><a name="70130-0023.htm_spnew5"><a name="0701315001266"><b>Mr. McCartney:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks a good question and I give him the assurance that he seeks. A lot of work is done and many exchanges take place&#151;and not just political exchanges, but exchanges between officials in Departments. When I was at the Department for Work and Pensions, dealing with pensions, labour market access and training issues, I had a close working relationship with the Australian Minister, Mr. Andrews, although I had to advise him that my cousin was involved in trying to make his seat a Labour seat. However, that was another issue; we agreed to disagree on that. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, because such exchanges are among the most important cornerstones of our relationships, and we learn from each other. We have learned much about social policy from our colleagues in Australia and New Zealand, and vice versa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para18"><a name="0701315000675">The hon. Member for Romford raised the issue of immigration. On the development of our immigration system, now and in future, we are working closely with Australia and New Zealand to ensure that if we introduce any changes, there will be no disadvantage to citizens from Australia and New Zealand. Discussions with the Home Office are currently taking place, in a positive and constructive atmosphere. Australia and New Zealand are priority countries for our new youth mobility scheme, and that is of critical importance. Discussions on that subject are going ahead, and I will write to the all-party group in more detail about them and what they mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para19"><a name="0701315000676">On trade, Australia is a more significant market for UK exports than its comparatively small population of 20 million might suggest. In 2005, we were Australia&#146;s fourth largest trading partner after Japan, the United States and China. We sell more to Australia than to India or China, and Australia is the UK&#146;s fifth largest market for goods outside the European Union. The agriculture, mining, oil and gas, information and communication technology, biotechnology, creative and media, marine, railways, food and drink, recreation, leisure and aerospace sectors all offer significant opportunities for British companies. Wearing my other hat as Minister responsible for UK trade and industry, I view Australia as one of our priority markets. Much of the work that I did when I was in Australia was on developing a strategy with our colleagues there, inward investors and the Australian equivalent of the CBI, an organisation with which I was very impressed. It plays an important role in respect of industry in Australia, and it has a close working relationship with the CBI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para20"><a name="0701315000677">New Zealand is one of our top 50 export markets for a whole range of goods, including automobiles, tractors and pharmaceuticals. We want to develop trade and investment in that country, and work with it on policies on energy and climate security. We will do further work with New Zealand and Australia in the coming year, to take forward those issues and others. Again, I will write to the all-party group on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70130-0023.htm_para21"><a name="0701315000678">I thank hon. Members for our discussion. Australia and New Zealand are fascinating, and I never thought that I would become a Minister with responsibility for our relationships with them. I have a personal interest in the two countries, not just because of blood relationships or rugby league, but because they are fascinating in themselves. The people are wonderful and have wonderful imaginations, skills, knowledge and a can-do attitude&#151;the very attitude that we have as a nation. As long as I am in this job, I look forward to ensuring a positive relationship with Australia and New Zealand, on every level. Again, I thank the hon. Member for Romford and I will write to him shortly.</p>
