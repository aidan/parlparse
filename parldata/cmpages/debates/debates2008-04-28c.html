 The security situation in Afghanistan is stable, if fragile in places. In 2007, the Afghan national army and troops from the 40-nation international security assistance force achieved significant tactical success against the Taliban. This success has geographically restricted the insurgents&#146; ability to conduct sustained activity. During 2008, NATO figures show that 91 per cent. of insurgent activity has been reported from only 8 per cent. of the districts of Afghanistan. Yesterday, the Taliban carried out a cowardly attack on the mujaheddin victory parade. This attack illustrates perfectly their irrelevance to the future of Afghanistan. While the country celebrated liberation, the Taliban were firing indiscriminately at unarmed civilians. In tactical terms, that will prove to be a disaster for them.</p>

 When I was in Helmand province in February, I was surprised to learn that many of the farmers would prefer to grow wheat, which is now highly priced on world markets, rather than poppies. However, they had to grow poppies because of Taliban intimidation. When does the Secretary of State think that we will have the security situation sufficiently under control for Afghan farmers to feed their own people and not feed the habits of people in the west?</p>

 That is exactly the case in an increasing number of provinces in Afghanistan&#151;indeed, more are poppy-free than ever before. The greatest concentration of poppy growing happens to be in those provinces where there are the greatest security challenges. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand from his visit why that is the case. Because of the work of our troops in Afghanistan, particularly over the past 18 months, the number of areas under the control of the Afghan Government that are secure enough for farmers to make that transition is increasing. We will find in the outturn of the figures for this year that the Afghan poppy crop has reduced, but there is still a long way to go.</p>

Indeed, through Mastiff and Ridgback, on which we hope to make significant progress over the coming months, we will be providing a total of 400 new vehicles that will offer that level of protection. The hon. Gentleman will know also, because it is reported back here regularly, that Mastiff has proved enormously popular with the troops in saving lives.</p>

Our experience in Afghanistan shows us that the issue is not just a need for protected vehicles, in the sense of protected against such explosions; rather, we also need vehicles that give our troops both the necessary flexibility and movement, and a presence on the ground that is specific to the communities in which they are working. I fulfil that obligation. We provide a range of vehicles to the commanders. I do not intend to dictate to our commanders, with a long screwdriver from London, which of those vehicles they should use, but I am conscious of the need continually to develop and to deploy more protected vehicles, subject to that requirement.</p>

 I am slightly at a loss to understand my hon. Friend&#146;s underlying point, because President Karzai is a civilian. He was freely elected and is the democratic choice of the people of Afghanistan, and has proved to be a very good leader in very difficult circumstances. My hon. Friend addresses an important issue, which is the need to deal with corruption, drug trafficking and the relationship between them in Afghanistan, which permeates a large part of society there, up to the highest levels. President Karzai recognises that; indeed, when he addressed the NATO summit in Bucharest recently, he recommitted himself to dealing with those issues. However, we should not underestimate how difficult that is to do in Afghanistan.</p>

That has been an issue for our troops for some time, and I am pleased to say that in southern Afghanistan in the past year we have increased available helicopter hours by more than a third. The significant point that my right hon. Friend makes, which is known to the House, is that there is a significant number of helicopters in the world that are not deployable. That is exactly why the Prime Minister announced at Bucharest an initiative in the form of a helicopter trust fund, which is attracting significant support. Between seven and 10 countries have indicated their willingness to contribute to the fund and allow those helicopters to be deployed either by training pilots to fly them in Afghanistan or by fitting them with necessary equipment. I look forward to seeing countries carry out the promises that they have made.</p>

 The fact that the Taliban have been forced to change their tactics in that way shows the success of ISAF, particularly the exceptional work that our troops have done in Helmand province in repeatedly facing down the Taliban and over-matching them. The Taliban have been driven to use that asymmetric approach, which is entirely uncharacteristic of the Afghan approach to conflict. That is why the latest assessment shows that the Taliban enjoy support from only about 4 per cent. of the population of Afghanistan. Contrary to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s encouragement that we should change our tactics, we will continue with the tactics and the comprehensive approach that we have been so successful in developing in southern Afghanistan with our allies. We will also continue to support the Afghans in building the capacity to deal with the increasing asymmetric attacks.</p>

 I am acutely aware of the need for ISAF and for the whole international community, including the United Nations, to continue to enjoy the support of the Afghan people. The main focus of everything that we do in Afghanistan is to maintain the support of the Afghan people in achieving the objectives that they share with us. It is welcome that other allies maintain a focus on that, but our measurement of the support that we enjoy from the Afghan people suggests that it is being sustained. However, I am aware of that risk. The only answer is to build on the ability of the Afghans to deliver security and government to their own people. That is the focus of everything that we do.</p>

 The hon.

Currently, 2,200 American troops are deploying to southern Afghanistan, which will significantly increase our ability to deliver what we are doing in that part of the country.

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right&#151;and, of course, the Admiral is quite right, as he is in possession of a significant amount of the available information. Evidence suggests that a significant proportion of the equipment and armaments being used by insurgents in Iraq is of Iranian origin or has been transited through Iran. Any Iranian links to armed groups in Iraq outside the political process&#151;either through the supply of weapons or through training and funding&#151;is unacceptable. With our allies, we are seeking to challenge that in a number of ways. Through our support for the Department of Border Enforcement, we seek to interdict the transfer of any such weaponry from Iran into southern Iraq; and through supporting the searches conducted by Iraqi security forces, we have discovered, seized and destroyed a large amount of weaponry that appears to have been sourced from Iran. By seeking to influence the Iranian Government diplomatically in a number of ways, including involving other influential countries in the region, we are trying to get it across to Iran that it is not in its long-term interests to have instability in southern Iraq or any part of Iraq at all. We are also endeavouring to deal with the insurgent and other groups that the Iranians seek to support in Iraq&#151;and we have done so very successfully recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80428-0001.htm_para8"><a name="0804289000064">The latest outpourings from Moqtada al-Sadr merely add to the confusion that has emanated from his leadership of the Jaish al-Mahdi militia and his own political organisation. We do not rely on such statements, and I have always taken the view that our troops are at risk of attack from that source, so my answer to the hon. Gentleman is that that statement will have no significant effect on our assessment of the risk to our troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80428-0001.htm_para9"><a name="0804289000065">In answering the hon. Gentleman&#146;s principal question, let me direct him to the Chief of the General Staff&#146;s assessment&#151;which is very fresh, as he returned from Basra only days ago. While there was some criticism of the planning of the first phase of the operation, we have been involved in the planning and support of the later phases, and they have been extremely successful. The information that I have suggests that there are clear and encouraging signs that Basra is springing back to life, and that the firm action taken by the Iraqi security forces has extended their control to most of the city. I have many pieces of information from citizens of Basra that show how relaxed they are in the new Basra, as they see it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80428-0001.htm_para10"><a name="0804289000066">All those developments are very positive, but the situation is fragile. We must ensure that we see the operation through, and that we can enable the 14th division of the Iraqi army in particular to sustain the security that it has created.</p>

 The armed forces compensation scheme was introduced in 2005 for personnel who are injured as a result of service in the armed forces. For the first time, our personnel can claim compensation while they are still serving, by way of a tax-free lump sum for illness or injury, up to a maximum of &#163;285,000. Those more seriously injured will, in addition to a lump-sum payment, receive a tax-free, inflation-proof guaranteed income payment which is paid on discharge and monthly thereafter for the rest of their lives.

 The hon. Gentleman is not comparing like with like. This is a no-fault scheme, and the claim to which he refers was a negligence claim. Armed forces personnel can claim against the Department for negligence, but the key point is that, for the first time ever, armed forces personnel can be paid, while they are still serving, a sizeable lump sum in addition to any lump sum that they could claim under the war pension scheme after leaving the service. Moreover, the lifelong guaranteed income payment for those most seriously injured is worth many hundreds of thousands of pounds. This is a significant improvement on the previous scheme.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. When the statutory instrument was laid to set out the new compensation scheme, the Opposition parties did not object and did not pray against it. It is a bit rich for them, this far down the road, suddenly to start to criticise a scheme that they did not object to at the time.</p>

 In the light of the welcome comments by Commander in Chief, Land, over the weekend, the Minister might like to express his regrets for the inadequacies of the 2005 armed forces compensation scheme that General Richards has found so wanting, and as the current review implies. Meanwhile, the Adjutant General continues to push private insurance schemes such as Pax that cost the private soldier a month&#146;s pay to cover risks run on our behalf in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. Why does this month&#146;s gimmick&#151;the armed forces benefits calculator, designed to convince service men that they have never had it so good&#151;completely ignore the disbenefit of having to take out personal insurance to cover occupational risk?</p>

 As I said, that is a bit rich from the Conservative party, which, let us be clear, supported the armed forces compensation scheme. This is the first time that compensation of this scale&#151;up to &#163;285,000&#151;is payable while serving. That is a significant step forward. The guaranteed income payment is index-linked, tax-free and paid for life. Unlike the previous war pension scheme, it is not capped, changed or withdrawn if the injured serviceman or woman improves at some point. The Conservative party did not introduce any such scheme during its 18 years in power. The scheme should be kept under continual review, which is why we made the changes last year in terms of motor injuries and why we are reviewing it now in the light of experience.</p>

 From the discussions I have had with our armed forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan, I know that broadly speaking they ignore what they read in the media and know what the facts are. The fact with regard to Basra is that our forces are involved in a very similar way to the American forces. The American forces came down to Basra with the additional Iraqi forces. Our own forces are in Basra assisting the Iraqi 14th division, which they helped to give the capability that it is now showing in its success in Basra town. Although we should not overstate our own role, the Iraqis would not be capable of doing what they are now doing in Basra if it had not, in part, been for the contribution that the British forces have made and continue to make. We should not run them down just because the press do.</p>

Of course we must be mindful of the hard work we are asking of our armed forces. We must keep that under assessment at all times, and we do so. We take advice from the military chain of command on what is feasible and what is acceptable, and we must ensure that we stay on top of that and do not ask too much of our armed forces, because they are working hard.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is important that the work that the Afghan Government do is supported by non-governmental organisations. More important is the presence of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in southern Afghanistan. I am confident that under the leadership of Kai Eide, who has recently been appointed to the co-ordination role, we will see an early presence for the mission in Helmand province. That will be a sign to many organisations that they can come and work with us, but we should not ignore those organisations that are doing good work there now, many of which are Afghan-based NGOs.</p>

 The current situation in Basra and southern Iraq is nothing of the sort. The plan was clear: we would progressively hand over the provinces of southern Iraq to provincial Iraqi control. When we came out of central Basra and handed over to provincial Iraqi control in December, it was clear that the criminal and militia elements in the city could be dealt with only by Iraqi security forces. We went into overwatch and I made it clear that that was the plan. The Iraqi security forces are now doing that task, and our troops are deployed with them, mentoring them in the city as they do so, as are US troops who have come with the divisions that they mentor. There are some 14,000 plus Iraqi troops in Basra and about 800 American troops in the south. Those numbers are a proportion of the numbers of troops that we have. All those troops are engaged in doing exactly what we described they would do, and they are doing it very successfully. It ill behoves the hon.

 It has been reported that by mid-May British forces might be deployed to Kosovo in support of NATO&#146;s KFOR. The House would like to know whether the reports are true. Clearly, if we have a commitment we should fulfil it, but the last time the UK deployed its spearhead land element, as part of NATO&#146;s operational reserve force in 2004, it required more than 30 C-130 Hercules sorties and five C-17 sorties. That was before we had nearly 8,000 troops in Afghanistan as well as the air bridge that they need for logistical support. Where on earth will we find the extra lift capability for Kosovo without undermining our efforts in Afghanistan?</p>

 We have had a request, as the hon. Gentleman knows, to supply the strategic reserve for Kosovo.

 Given that the equipment that is supposed to be available in Afghanistan is often not available, many in this House and the armed forces will find that answer a touch complacent. It is a bit pathetic that we are even considering the difficulties of deploying a small force to another part of Europe. This all arises because of the mismatch between funding and commitments for the armed forces under the Government. The Treasury is failing properly to fund Iraq and Afghanistan. The urgent operational requirements system means that equipment might be procured, but through-life costs are falling on the core MOD budget. The tempo of activity means that equipment is worn out prematurely and no extra funds are being made available to compensate. Again, the core budget is under pressure, which creates a serious crisis for the military and industry. Is that why MOD individuals are describing the Department in this morning&#146;s papers as &#147;unfit for purpose&#148;, or are there other reasons, too?</p>

He scrapped it completely in 2006-07. For small businesses seeking to navigate their way around the rate of corporation tax, there has been a significant amount of change.

Businesses will be asking themselves why the Government are attacking small companies in this way.

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80428-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0804289000163">The genesis of the increase stems from the decision in the 2002 Budget to introduce the 0 per cent. rate of corporation tax for profits of less than &#163;10,000. That triggered a wave of incorporations of companies, which some predicted at the time. I believe that the Government&#146;s analysis of the situation is this: that a tax change that was meant to stimulate entrepreneurial activity led to that mass incorporation by people seeking to take advantage of the lower 0 per cent. rate  <br>

of tax, which gave them an advantage comparable to self-employed and employed people earning the same income. The analysis produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies bears out that analysis, which was then, however, used to justify the abolition of the 0 per cent. rate and is now being used to justify the increase in rate from 19 to 22 per cent.&#151;2p higher than the basic rate of tax that people who earn a comparable amount of income would be paying through the income tax system. The Government&#146;s introduction of the 0 per cent. rate created a significant incentive for businesses to incorporate. The abolition of the 0 per cent. rate has narrowed the gap between the effective tax rate that small companies enjoy and the effective tax rate that individuals enjoy when they are employed, but there is now a sense that the Government are seeking to go further and further in narrowing that gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80428-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0804289000164">Part of the Government&#146;s action is that which is before us today&#151;the increase in the small companies corporation tax rate&#151;but they have also taken other steps to deal with the issue. Last year&#146;s Finance Act introduced changes on managed service companies, and the pre-Budget report included proposals on income shifting&#151;again, targeted at incorporated small businesses. Those proposals have been deferred for a year, and business organisations welcome that, but they are concerned that they might return in next year&#146;s Finance Bill and are looking to have a proper dialogue with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Treasury to tackle those issues. A series of measures is being taken to tackle the gap in the effective rate of tax, but it is not clear to small business organisations just how far the Government intend to go in dealing with the issue. It would be helpful in the context of this debate if the Financial Secretary could clearly set out the basis of Government policy on the taxation of small companies and businesses, because significant concern is building up that the Government are turning their backs on small companies, that they do not show any understanding of how small companies operate, and that that is creating a culture in which entrepreneurial activity is penalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80428-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0804289000165">A significant cost arises from the Government&#146;s approach because companies that are already finding it difficult to trade profitably will see their taxable profits decline. The tax bill of any company with profits of less than &#163;300,000 will increase regardless of whether it employs one person, 10 people, 100 people or 1,000 people. That illustrates the crude nature of the Government&#146;s step. If this tax increase is motivated by a concern about incorporation, the Government need to recognise that it catches out many businesses, not only one-man bands. That is part of the unfairness that people perceive in the system. They see the tax rate and the tax bill for small companies increase in the Budget, as it did in the last Budget and as it will in the next Budget. The Government argue that the annual investment allowance will compensate for that. However there are two flaws to that approach.</p>

The Government are trying to incentivise only one form of behaviour when firms could operate in other ways to improve their businesses, for example, through investing in people by developing skills and so on. They are introducing the annual investment allowance when the Red Book forecasts a fall in growth in business investment from 3.75 per cent. in 2007 to between 1.75 and 2.25 per cent. this year.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes, as he often does, a perceptive comment. There is a problem with that sort of behavioural device because it supports one specific activity, rather than recognising different ways in which people might invest in their business. That is especially relevant given our economy&#146;s increasing dependence on the service sector. That is why Conservative Members believe that the best solution is to reduce the small companies rate of taxation, as the amendment proposes, and give companies and businesses the ability to determine where they will invest and spend their profits. That is a much better&#151;non-distortionary&#151;way of proceeding. It tells businesses that they know the best way in which to grow and allows them to decide how to act rather than relying on central Government and the Treasury to recognise their improvement in performance only so long as they invest in physical assets.

It will also give companies the responsibility for and opportunity of deciding for themselves how best to spend their money.

 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. I, too, have been frustrated at how anything that the Government spend their money on counts as investment, when sometimes, as I know from the parliamentary questions that I have tabled, it does not necessarily equate to spending that helps taxpayers.</p>

However, we believe that we should scrap the annual investment allowance and use the proceeds to fund a cut in the small companies rate of tax to 20 per cent. That would be in the best interests of business and is entirely consistent with our approach of having simpler, flatter and fairer taxes, by broadening the tax base through reducing distortionary relief and using the revenue gain to reduce the rate of corporation tax.</p>

Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) has tabled, has much to commend it and gets to the nub of the problem, which is the impact that the rate has on competition. It is important to consider the competitive impact of the rates of corporation tax paid in this country. The week before last we heard about the pharmaceuticals company Shire, relocating out of the UK because of tax, while United Business Media, which was formerly chaired by the Labour peer, Lord Hollick, made a similar announcement today about its domicile for tax purposes. Clearly there is a significant issue with the competitiveness of the UK tax system and how it compares with those of other major economies.

If the House were minded to reject the Government&#146;s report, that would delay the implementation of the small companies rate. That would cause some uncertainty&#151;although I gather that Parliament now has a much greater say on tax, thanks to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who seems to have extended parliamentary control&#151;and I am not sure whether, under the circumstances, we can allow that for the small companies rate. I would much rather the Government listened to our proposal and reduced the rate of tax now, rather than waiting until the report is published later in the year. I would therefore urge the hon.

Part of the issue is the complexity of the treatment of sole traders, the self-employed and so on, but in principle small companies should have a lower tax rate and should not be forced to pay a higher tax bill as a consequence of the Government changing their mind about how they deal with their tax affairs.</p>

Our deliberations have focused primarily on the 10p rate being doubled. Although the public as a whole, and people who watch politics carefully, inevitably tend to have a great preoccupation with taxation on personal income, taxes on small businesses are just as relevant&#151;sometimes more so&#151;to the prosperity of the individuals whom we represent as the taxes that are levied directly on their income. The Chancellor is championing the 2p cut in the main rate of corporation tax, but if we look at the small companies rate, we see that it was 19 per cent. in 2006, 20 per cent. in 2007, 21 per cent. in 2008 and that it will be 22 per cent. next year. There is no clearer direction of travel than that. People in my constituency and elsewhere who work for, or who are related to, people who work in the small business sector are understandably concerned about the impact of that increase on its profitability and competitiveness.

Inevitably, when a large business goes bust or makes several hundred employees redundant, people tend to focus on that, but the cumulative effect of lots of small businesses laying off a person here and a person there, which is much less readily observed by the media and by the general population, is none the less a problem for us if we wish to have a successful economy in the UK.</p>

It would then be for the Government to explain why other measures in the Budget, or that they announced in the pre-Budget report and previous Budgets, would compensate and ensure that business competitiveness remained as it is or would get better. I have to say that I am sceptical of whether the Government could come up with an assessment to prove that, and I am very suspicious that they could come up with an assessment that would say anything other than that business competitiveness would be weakened by an increase in the small companies rate at this time.</p>

Businesses are operating at a time of high and rising fuel costs, which are unlikely significantly to be moderated at any time soon, and within a framework of high transportation costs&#151;and every haulier I speak to tells me that that is unlikely to change in the near future. Businesses are seeing prices for raw materials skyrocket and I can evidence that with an example from my own constituency, where the Patak&#146;s food company factory recently closed down. Swingeing rises in the prices of its raw materials&#151;mainly chicken, rice and dairy products&#151;forced the factory to close as it became utterly uneconomic and completely unprofitable.

That is the key point. As prices for fuel, energy, transportation and raw materials go up, and as the external funding that companies used to rely on either dries up because of the credit squeeze or becomes much more expensive, we should not be taxing the money that small companies make in the way that we are with the rise in the small companies rate.</p>

 It is heart warming to hear that the hon. Gentleman is such an advocate of lower taxes on business&#151;a cause that he knows I support. Will he tell us what his party recommends for Scotland by way of a company tax rate either for larger or smaller companies?</p>

 We have focused our attention historically on the main companies rate, which we want to see reduced to 20 per cent. in order to create a real competitive advantage in Scotland. With regard to smaller businesses generally, the right hon. Gentleman will know that we have already taken steps to reduce or remove completely the business rates burden from 150,000 Scottish businesses. However they slice and dice us and from wherever we get that competitive advantage, we need to take such action through budgets. We think that we have done the right thing with business rates in Scotland and we now want to go much further on the main rate of tax. That is the approach that we would take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80428-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0804289000191">We want the increase in the small companies rate to be reversed, as we believe that would allow companies to make the investment to create the jobs that we all want as we move, I hope at some point, towards full employment. In the current economic circumstances, a tax rise will simply denude businesses of the money that they need to make that investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80428-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0804289000192">We know that that investment would be made. The Forum of Private Business survey last autumn&#151;at the time of the pre-Budget report&#151;was interesting in showing that 67 per cent. of members who responded said that, should the rate increase be reversed, it would encourage them to reinvest in their businesses. Almost half said that a reversal would give them the extra funds to invest in skills and training and almost half said that it would make them more likely to seek to grow their businesses. It is highly likely, I suggest, that should the increase go ahead, a much smaller number of businesses would have the cash to make the investment that they were talking about last autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80428-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0804289000193">That is a particular concern in Scotland. At the last count, there were 279,495 businesses in Scotland, of which 273,745 employed fewer than 50 people. Another 3,500 employed between 50 and 249, and only 2,265 are large businesses employing more than 250 people. We believe that the impact of the &#163;1.2 billion&#151;estimated by the CBI&#151;taken as a result of the increase in the small companies rate is likely to be disproportionate in Scotland.</p>

extremely disappointing that the Government should have backtracked on both elements of that attractive regime and that they have not learned the lesson from a country such as Ireland, which has persevered with a much more favourable tax regime for business across the board&#151;businesses large and small&#151;and has had the phenomenal success that we see in the Irish growth rate, the development of Irish business within the Republic and the collection of so much more tax revenue in general by the Irish Treasury.</p>

 I appreciate my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments about the Laffer curve, which I have gone on and on about in the three years that I have been a Member of Parliament. However, what bothers many small businesses&#151;with which, like me, my right hon. Friend has been involved&#151;is the timing of the tax increase. At a time when we should be supporting small businesses, it appears that we are attempting to undermine what they are trying to achieve in extremely difficult times by increasing taxes while, across the pond, the United States is doing everything it can to lower them.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Ministers must know from their conversations, as he and I know from our conversations with the British Chambers of Commerce and the bodies representing small businesses in Britain, that it is becoming much more difficult to be a successful competitor from a British base. Smaller companies are feeling the increase in taxation and the growing weight of regulatory cost even more than the larger ones, but that population of small businesses must be allowed to grow more rapidly so that we can experience success in the future.</p>

The danger is that the Government will take small businesses to tipping point with too much tax and regulation, so that, largely unseen, many jobs will be removed or new jobs will not be created and we will have a worse problem with unemployment.</p>

 It should also be borne in mind that nearly every large business that employs vast numbers of people started off as a small business.

 The hon. Gentleman is right, and it can be deduced from his argument that we need to lower tax and regulation on all populations of business if we want a really successful economy like the Irish economy. That is especially important in the incubator world of small business. Among the mighty population of small businesses in a vibrant economy will be a limited number that will go on to become the mega-corporations of the future. As Silicon valley demonstrates, businesses can grow from very small to very big in the space of a decade, with stunning implications for the success of the economy and the success of tax-raising on those populations of businesses, and job generation.</p>

 We might quip that the way in which to create a small business under new Labour is to start with a big business. However, on a more serious note, let me say that my right hon. Friend has not touched on another important issue. One of the hallmarks of new Labour has been chopping and changing, but what businesses like is consistency. Only through consistency of policy, particularly tax policy, can they thrive.</p>

He is giving me friendly help and assistance to make sure that I do not forget the important arguments. I am genuinely grateful to him and he is absolutely right that consistency is important. Being able to forecast the tax rate to be paid not just this year but next year and the year after is extremely important when it comes to drawing up a business plan. Any small business that wishes to grow relatively quickly will need access to outside finance: a bank loan, other investors, business angels or another way of raising capital. Any of those would immediately want a business plan, not just for one year but for, say, three.</p>

The net profitability obviously requires an assumption about the Government&#146;s tax rate. If the tax rate is changing every year&#151;or goes up every year&#151;it makes forecasting accurately more difficult. It also means that net profits will be less at the three-year stage, or at the five-year stage in a five-year business plan. That makes it more difficult to raise external capital; the banks and others   <br>

living through the credit squeeze may say that they are unable to help because the net returns are not sufficiently good. Altruistic as many financiers are, they are not normally interested in how much money a business generates to pay the tax man; they are interested in how much money a business generates to pay the shareholders and other private stakeholders, which is why the tax rate is so important.</p>

That is very important to the enhanced competitiveness of Britain that we will wish to see after the damage being done to it by higher taxes and more regulation.</p>

After years of debate in Parliament and elsewhere about taxation acting as an incentive to incorporation and encouraging distortion, the Prime Minister&#146;s final act of political theatre was to propose a Budget that cut the main rate of corporation tax to 28 per cent. while the small companies rate was simultaneously to be raised to 22 per cent. over three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80428-0005.htm_para18"><a name="0804289000222">More than that, years of debate about the disparity between personal taxation and business taxation rates influencing behaviour in undesirable ways by encouraging avoidance were further muddled by the fact that the small companies rate is set to rise above the basic rate of income tax. Having encouraged thousands of sole traders to incorporate, the Prime Minister aims to leave the small companies rate at just 1p below the level where he found it when he became Chancellor. The result of his small business taxation odyssey is that he has boxed thousands of taxpayers into a structure that may no longer be appropriate for them.</p>

A former Financial Secretary has quantified that the incentive for a self-employed person earning &#163;30,000 to incorporate and take income from dividends will reduce by &#163;1,000 by 2009-10. For some, that could be just the start of the additional costs. That would, perhaps, be more acceptable if disincorporation were a simple proposition, but it is not.

However, if the Treasury is actively pursuing disincorporation, the Minister must also admit that it has led the small business community on a wild goose chase for the past few years. Indeed, a tax policy that simply brings the Prime Minister back to where he began is certainly a novel interpretation of the role of the business cycle. Unfortunately, his changes have been counter-cyclical, if not counter-productive, and he has committed his successor to increasing the tax burden on small businesses at a time when they can least afford such a move&#151;I made that point to my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0804289000240">The Government announced changes in last year&#146;s Budget to encourage investment and innovation. The small companies rate of corporation tax remains highly competitive internationally and has by far the highest threshold in the G7 at &#163;300,000&#151;a fact that one would hope would be welcomed. The average threshold for other G7 members with a small companies rate is just over &#163;23,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0804289000241">If I may, Sir Alan, I will stray slightly wide&#151;although not, of course, wide of the amendments&#151;in responding to some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the Government and in explaining our proposals and why we seek to resist the amendments. The World Economic Forum ranks the UK as one of the top 10 most competitive countries, ahead of France, Canada and Australia, and the World Bank ranks the UK sixth in the world in doing business, ahead of Germany, France and Japan. We are also first in the G7 for ease of paying taxes, which is an important factor for small businesses. The Government are committed to tax simplification and have announced a package of more than 20 measures, including simplification of the associated companies rules and a new review of CT calculations for small businesses, all of which have been welcomed by small and medium enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0804289000242">I welcome the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) and his L-plates&#151;I have great sympathy for some of the comments that he made on that score. He stated that the UK tax system imposes significant burdens on small businesses compared with other countries. I do not accept that statement. At the Budget 2008, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs published details of how it is improving services for small businesses, including progress against its administrative burden reduction targets. According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers World Bank publication &#147;Paying taxes 2008: The global picture&#148;, a standard UK company spends less time complying with the tax system than a similar company in any other G7 country. The Government have outlined in their enterprise strategy, published at Budget 2008, how they will build on their targeted net reduction in the administrative burden of regulation by 25 per cent. by 2010. It is therefore wrong to claim that the changes to the small companies rate of corporation tax affect all businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0804289000243">The UK has around 4.4 million small businesses.

pay no corporation tax, so they will not be affected by changes to corporation tax rates. Of those companies that pay corporation tax, a quarter of large companies and more than half of medium-sized companies pay tax at the small companies rate. It is important to realise that the rate is in fact a small profits rate. Any company with profits up to &#163;300,000 benefits from that low corporation tax rate, regardless of its size.</p>

Members for Fareham and for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) said that the AIA did not go far enough. The hon. Member for Dundee, East in particular, speaking for the Scottish National party, criticised the AIA&#146;s ability to help with the costs of training staff, improving staff capability and other intangible investments. I am sure that he knows this, but it is worth bearing in mind the fact that the cost of employees can already be offset against tax. The AIA will allow businesses to offset &#163;50,000 of capital expenditure in a similar way.</p>

The Government have lowered corporation tax rates for small companies over the years in order to encourage investment.

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0804289000247">Those lower rates of tax resulted in a significant number of people incorporating, not to invest and reinvest in their businesses but simply to extract the profits in a way that reduces their personal tax and national insurance contribution liabilities. I shall not quarrel with the point made by the hon. Member for Fareham that we were warned of that at the time, but those who take such action carry out the same economic activity as they did before they incorporated but pay lower rates of tax than those who remain unincorporated and than employees.</p>

The increase in the small companies rate will reduce the differential in tax paid between the incorporated and the self-employed.</p>

 The difference in the tax burden for those who are incorporated and those who are unincorporated is clear and accepted, and our proposals have been phased in, to allow companies to take those changes into account, and to recreate, as it were, a fair and level playing field between small businesses competing in the same sector that may not be incorporated for tax purposes. The increase in the small companies rate reduces the differential between the incorporated and the self-employed. That means that the 3.3 million unincorporated businesses will be relatively more competitive&#151;thus, as I said, levelling the playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0804289000253">Last year, we announced a package of business tax reforms to improve competitiveness and encourage investment and growth.

The hon. Member for Fareham asked why a targeted solution to the tax-motivated incorporation problem was not adopted instead of increasing the small companies rate. We have done extensive work on the issue of small business taxation, balancing incentives for small business growth with fairness in the tax system for all, and the changes to the taxation of small businesses announced in the Budget last year provide a good balance between those objectives.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary reminds me that a figure of 700,000 new businesses is not a discouraging one. The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) asked me a general question about the economic climate in which we have made these changes. As I have just explained, they are intended to re-establish fair competition for those who have been incorporated for tax purposes, and thus enable them to take advantage of arrangements that ought to have been made for investment in business for growth purposes. By levelling the playing field, we will restore the motivation for companies to focus less on how to use incorporation to avoid tax liabilities, and encourage them instead to focus on growing their business.</p>

 As I have said, and as the right hon. Gentleman will remember, the intention of the changes that have led to advice given by tax advisers to incorporate to avoid tax was to encourage investment and growth, particularly in small businesses. We are now correcting an imbalance that has developed as a result of the behaviour in response to those changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para22"><a name="0804289000265">As I have said, the amendment would negate the purpose of marginal small companies relief. By way of illustration, if the Committee were to accept the amendment, a company making profits of &#163;301,000 would pay more than &#163;5,500 less in tax than a company making profits of only &#163;299,000. It would do nothing to benefit the vast majority of small businesses in the UK.</p>

Again, it shows that Opposition Members misunderstand the changes put forward by the Government, which are about improving competitiveness across all small businesses. Reducing the differential in tax between the unincorporated and incorporated will allow better direct competition. Delaying implementation of this change will allow the differential to remain. Furthermore, the changes to the small companies rate are part of a wider package that encourages all businesses to invest and innovate to assist future growth. The introduction of the annual investment allowance benefits all businesses, allowing them to compete more fairly.</p>

Together, they would cost the Exchequer more than &#163;300 million next year. That brings me back to the statement by the right hon. Member for Witney that I quoted earlier. The Committee should consider the amendments in the context of the fact that the main Opposition party voted against all the revenue-raising measures proposed in the 2008 Budget.

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para26"><a name="0804289000270">I take issue with the introduction and conclusion of the Minister&#146;s speech; they were written without the arguments for the amendments having been heard. It was clear from what I said that our proposed cut in the small companies rate of corporation tax would be funded through the scrapping of the annual investment allowance. We have made that clear, not only today but in debates earlier this year and around the time of the Budget. We believe fundamentally that by restructuring the current allowances and reliefs we can make savings that would pay for reductions in the main and small companies rate of corporation tax. We are proposing a funded tax cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para27"><a name="0804289000271">On several occasions, the Minister came back to the point that the Government&#146;s measure was to tackle what she claimed was an unfairness in the tax system which encouraged incorporation. Yet at the same time, as the Minister said in response to an intervention of mine, the Government have not done the work to understand whether last year&#146;s scrapping of the 0 per cent. rate was sufficient to discourage tax motivated incorporation. She further undermined her arguments by highlighting that larger businesses would also be affected by the tax increase. She referred to the proportions of larger and medium-sized companies that also paid the small companies rate of corporation tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para28"><a name="0804289000272">If we look at the rate of incorporation for companies in the past six years, yes, we see that there has been a 50 per cent. increase in the number of companies incorporating with only one employee. Companies with between one and nine employees are running at about 37 or 38 per cent. in that regard, and for those with more than 10 employees, the figure is just under 20 per cent. We are seeing significant increases in the incorporation of companies of all sizes. Given the long tail of owner-managed businesses, with no employees, that I see in my constituency, perhaps it is not surprising that a large number of them incorporate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80428-0006.htm_para29"><a name="0804289000273">The Government&#146;s measure is meant to deal with the issue of fairness, but it imposes an additional tax burden on small companies at a time when they do not need it&#151;they are struggling with higher costs and economic uncertainty. I will press amendment No. 1 to a Division because of the problems that face small companies. They want a Government who are on their side and are not working against them. By increasing the small companies rate of tax from 19 to 23 per cent., the Government are damaging those businesses when they need help and support. Conservative Members and, I believe, other Opposition Members recognise the importance of supporting small companies. I hope that those Opposition Members will back us in the Division Lobby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para1"><a name="0804289000777">The amendment seeks to have the Treasury justify the changes it intends to make to the capital gains tax system and to have them approved by the House of Commons before any implementation. There are a number of reasons for that, which I will explain later, but the assessment that we seek from the Treasury will consist of three parts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para2"><a name="0804289000778">First and most important, what would the impact be on businesses seeking investment? For us, that is the most crucial area. As they stand, the Government&#146;s proposals will only damage business investment. For example, if someone who invests in a business and pays capital gains tax seeks the same cash return after tax under the changes, that will leave less profit in the pot for, say, a proprietor investor or a manager investor, who may no longer take the risk and seek that capital. If, on the other hand, the investor receives the gross amount and pays the additional tax under the new system, they may consider the risk not to be worth taking and decide to take their money elsewhere, perhaps out of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0804289000779">Secondly, the Treasury should report on investors who normally pay tax via capital gains tax, not least because it would appear from all the reports that I have read and all the people to whom I have spoken that the changes to the rules have had the consequence, unintended or otherwise, of encouraging real investors to sell up and take their money out of businesses to avoid falling into the new tax regime. That has been evidenced by a flurry of recent newspaper reports, of which I shall give one or two examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0804289000780">In article entitled &#147;How Darling&#146;s ill-thought CGT fix has only made things worse&#148;&#151;not exactly a snappy title, but one that sums it up&#151;the <i> Sunday Herald </i>said:</p>
<a name="80428-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="0804289000843"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The unseemly dash by owners of companies and other assets to beat the April 5 deadline for the capital gains tax changes introduced by Alistair Darling reached a crescendo last week.

 Is there not a problem with that, in principle at least? If more time is given, that will allow the distortions that the hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier to happen, such as small business people wanting to sell when a radical change is proposed. How would his amendment get around that problem?</p>

<p><a name="st_o129"><a name="0804289000790"><a name="80428-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="0804289001500"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 I was just about to make that point. The hon. Gentleman is probably right, on balance, in relation to the previous debate on corporation tax, to say that changing things now might create distortion and uncertainty. However, this measure was proposed in the pre-Budget report and there was a flurry of panic, mainly in the Government ranks. The Government then changed things to introduce the &#163;1 million lifetime entrepreneurs&#146; allowance, but there was still a lack of clarity&#151;I know that from speaking to accountants close to the end of the financial year&#151;so I am not convinced at all, in this case, that a small additional delay until we get clarity from the Government would deliver the instability that the hon. Gentleman describes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0804289000791">The third area that the Treasury should report on is the housing market, particularly in areas of Wales, Scotland and elsewhere where there is pressure on house prices, a lack of affordable first-time accommodation, particularly for those on modest wages, and a shortage of affordable private lets. The paradox of the CGT changes is that not only are they damaging investment in business and possibly driving investors to take their money elsewhere, but they have made speculation in the private housing market more attractive. That is bizarre at a time when there was already huge pressure&#151;particularly in high-pressure areas and remote, rural areas&#151;and a shortage of housing combined with low wages. That is a catastrophic thing for the Government to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para14"><a name="0804289000792">Again on the impact on business, tax is going up, as are costs such as fuel, energy and the transport of raw materials. Traditional funding routes have either dried up because of the credit squeeze or are very expensive, and the stock exchange and the alternative investment market are either inappropriate or too expensive for the kinds of businesses that seek private investment at the lower level. This is the wrong time to make changes to CGT that risk, even potentially, driving out investors from business. Let me give an example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para15"><a name="0804289000793">Historically, to get a stock market listing a company needed to be a &#163;100 million-plus company, but the truth is that the figure was much bigger than that. Entry-level costs were &#163;750,000, and so were fundraising costs; advisory costs were &#163;250,000; and commission was 2 to 5 per cent. of the money to be raised. Even on AIM, entry level was about &#163;300,000 and so was fundraising, commission was 2.5 per cent. and advisory costs were about &#163;50,000. That was for companies looking to raise &#163;2 million to &#163;20 million. With traditional bank funding drying up and with other routes being beyond the means of most small companies, private investors were filling an important gap. If there is a risk&#151;I believe the risk is real and serious&#151;that the capital gains tax changes will force private investors with capital to take their money elsewhere, the change needs to be reviewed and revised. I was happy not to press my earlier amendment No. 7 on corporation tax, but although I will wait to hear what the Minister has to say and see whether she provides me with any comfort, if she fails to do so I am likely to press amendment No. 8 to the vote.</p>

 Most of the debate on the Bill so far has focused, quite understandably, on clause 3, which doubles the 10p rate of income tax. The Prime Minister is, of course, personally responsible for the changes in clause 3&#151;and, indeed, clause 5, which we have just debated, as both were announced in the 2007 Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80428-0007.htm_para16"><a name="0804289000795">Clause 6 is, by contrast, something of a home-grown own goal for the Chancellor, at least if we believe that he is the author of the 2007 pre-Budget report. Although the doubling of the 10p rate has delivered the short-term political damage, the fiasco of the pre-Budget report and the capital gains tax changes will have a lasting and negative effect on business sentiment. The manner of the introduction of such far-reaching changes to business asset capital taxation in the pre-Budget report&#151;with no consultation, no forewarning and little thought&#151;was damaging enough in itself, but the signal that Labour was willing to sacrifice the interests of business to short-term political advantage was more damaging still. The substance of the proposal, at a time when the economy is slowing and public concern about jobs and prosperity is growing, sends a hugely negative message to British business and to Britain&#146;s entrepreneurs.</p>

two aspects to the problem. First, there is the substance of the changes that clause 3 introduces, which amendment No. 8 is designed to address; secondly, there is the manner in which they were introduced, particularly the lack of consultation, the lack of clear signposting and the reversal of what had been seen as a long-term commitment by the Government to a lower CGT rate for long-term gains. That, I suspect, as much as the substance of the measure itself, is extremely damaging to the climate for Britain&#146;s entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80428-0008.htm_para0"><a name="0804289000798">By raising business taxes at a time when our competitors are cutting them to support investment and underpin their economies, the Government have undermined business confidence. The abandonment of what was an iconic long-term Labour policy of a 10p capital gains tax rate for long-term gains&#151;announced with great fanfare by our present Prime Minister even before the Labour Government came to office&#151;has dealt a blow to British enterprise and entrepreneurs at a time when we should be promoting it and them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80428-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0804289000799">I have to say that we have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiment behind amendment No. 8, and I agree with almost everything the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) said in introducing it. Regrettably, however, it would not quite do what its sponsors wish it to do. It would indeed postpone the change in the main rate from 40 to 18 per cent., but because the implementation provision that the amendment would introduce covers only subsection (1), schedule 2 would be effective anyway, ending taper relief and indexation. It would, I think, have the opposite effect to that which the hon. Gentleman seeks, in that it would push the effective CGT rate on business assets up to 40 per cent., rather than leaving it at 10 per cent., as he intends.</p>

As my concerns relate to precisely those areas that the hon. Gentleman outlined&#151;even though my solution is to vote against clause stand part, rather than to support the amendment, for reasons I have explained&#151;I hope that it is convenient for me to set them out now, as time is limited, so that we might not need a separate clause stand part debate.</p>

That plan was torn up when the Prime Minister bottled it and canned the election for reasons that, we are assured, had nothing whatever to do with the opinion polls.

signs of economic slowdown in the aftermath of the Northern Rock fiasco&#151;had to be drawn up on the back of a fag packet over the weekend. Even one of the Prime Minister&#146;s closest allies, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), described that as</p>

I say to the Minister that the damage to Labour&#146;s reputation as a business-friendly party may be irreversible.</p>

The proof is in schedule 3, where the complex and still extremely unclear entrepreneurs&#146; relief adds a tier of complication to the system that was supposed to be simplified. This is a missed opportunity for comprehensive modernisation of business capital taxes based on a full, extensive and genuine consultation. In fact, the capital gains tax change was a straight tax grab, originally designed to raise &#163;900 million a year for the Treasury, and a wildly misplaced attempt to address the issue of taxation of private equity-carried interest&#151;something that had been exercising the Government and the trade unions before the pre-Budget report and, ironically, a problem that now looks likely to have gone away all by itself, as the bank credit on which private equity deals depend has all but dried up.</p>

It has imposed a huge retrospective cost on thousands of businesses. At a stroke it has withdrawn the single tax measure, taper relief, that had been held aloft as the symbol of new Labour&#146;s commitment to business. It was hailed as a simplification but it was a simple stealth tax. Because it was made up on the hoof without a consensus behind it, the Chancellor had to back down at a cost of some hundreds of millions of pounds, and the Financial Secretary cannot tell us where that money is coming from. The Chancellor introduced the entrepreneurs&#146; relief and thus created a system more complicated and more unfair than the one it has replaced.</p>

 This feature of the Bill is a classic example of what a Government do when they are driven by political considerations rather than the overall requirements of the economy. At the Conservative party&#146;s autumn conference in September of last year it put forward a series of proposals on taxation in anticipation of a possible general election&#151;of course, none of them went any way to helping people who had been adversely affected by the doubling of the 10p rate, but we will come to that later. The Government felt they needed to respond to the Conservatives&#146; apparent seizure of the initiative and as a result the Treasury was thrown into an exercise. That process may have lasted only a couple of days but, in that time, the Treasury went from having a blank sheet of paper to drawing up a series of taxation proposals that would have a deep and significant effect on business and on our economy.</p>

The parallel that my party draws is between the taxation rate paid by people who are taxed on their capital and the rate paid by those who are taxed on their income. I am extremely supportive of wealth creation; we need an economy that generates prosperity so that people can prosper in their private lives and so that we can afford to fund key public services. However, it offends the sensibilities of the Liberal Democrats and many millions of people throughout the country that there are people in Britain, who work in private equity and the like, who pay a much lower marginal tax rate than the people who clean their offices. In our view, that cannot be right.</p>

left-wing policy; it is entirely in tune with what other Governments have proposed in the past. The danger otherwise is that people with good accountants who are able to convert their income into capital will pay considerably less as a share of tax, and we will effectively create a two-tier system: one for those who are taxed on the money they take home at the rates we will now have to get used to&#151;20p and 40p, with national insurance contributions in line with that&#151;and another for those who enjoy much more favourable rates of taxation, despite having considerably higher earnings.</p>

 Does the hon.

 I understand the hon.

The Liberal Democrats do not wish the overall share of taxation to rise as a proportion of gross domestic product. We would, however, ask something of high earners&#151;who currently pay lower marginal rates than those who clean their offices&#151; so that people on lower incomes could pay a lower marginal rate. Both the Conservatives and Labour are unable to match that commitment.</p>

 Is not the problem with what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting the fact that that mobile wealth creation will leave these shores and go elsewhere? Although I fear that it does not fall within the context of the clause, a discussion of the benefits of globalisation is legitimate because far too many people in both the first world and developing countries are perhaps being left behind.

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08042815000009">Let me answer the question by flipping it on its head; the onus is on both Labour and the Conservatives to make the moral case for a cleaner who earns &#163;10,000 a year paying a higher marginal rate of taxation than the boss of the company whose offices he or she cleans, who takes home &#163;1 million in the form of capital. There is a genuine debate to be had about that. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), who represents large numbers of people&#151;more than any of the rest of us&#151;who fall into both categories just put forward the argument, as do the Government, that it is morally right that cleaning staff should pay a higher marginal rate. I merely inject a note of controversy into the debate by saying that I do not agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08042815000010">The changes made by the Government have resulted in a perverse set of consequences. The Budget proposals reward property speculators while penalising people who have run small family businesses, and many small investors&#151;perhaps employee share scheme holders&#151;lose as a result. In addition, because the changes were introduced in a haphazard, short-term fashion with inadequate consultation, many people have been unable to prepare for them in a way that most people would consider reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08042815000011">The effect has been, as the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) described, that people who have worked and planned on the basis of a tax regime that they thought would affect them when selling their small business at the end of their working life, and who had a legitimate expectation that if the tax regime was to change they would have long enough to change their behaviour to take account of the alterations, have suddenly had the changes sprung on them without adequate time to make the necessary adjustments to their circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08042815000012">That introduces what feels like a retrospective degree of taxation. Although it is not strictly speaking retrospective, that would be the outcome for people in terms of the practicalities of selling a business in a short time scale.

 The hon. Gentleman asks which U-turn; I shall come to many of the others later in our deliberations. The specific one is the &#163;1 million of relief for entrepreneurs. Even that carries problems for people who are serial entrepreneurs, whose business is to rapidly grow and sell companies. That is a legitimate and healthy business model that contributes to the overall growth of the economy, but those involved are penalised by the proposals in a way that people who stick with one business over a longer period of time are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08042815000015">For all those reasons, we disagree with the approach that the Government have taken to these matters.

credibility crunch. The Chancellor&#146;s last few months in the Treasury would have done the three stooges proud, although I do have some sympathy for the fact that he seems to have become the Prime Minister&#146;s one and only stooge when it comes to taking the consequences of unpopular taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08042815000017">Nevertheless, by 24 January, the Chancellor had already confirmed his first U-turn of the year in an attempt to water down the impact of an 80 per cent. tax rise on small business at a time of increasing economic uncertainty. We are still in the dark about why the Government should have set about, apparently deliberately, undermining their own much vaunted objective for increasing long-term investment in business. The only explanation is a bad one: that it is a knee-jerk reaction against a very small number of individuals in the private equity industry who were making use of taper relief to reduce the capital gains tax charge on their carried interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08042815000018">To give credit where it is due&#151;and notwithstanding the comments made by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)&#151;Ministers were always adamant in their public statements that there was no special loophole in the taxation of the private equity industry, and that was indeed the case. But faced with pressure to close a loophole that did not exist, the Chancellor did the next best thing and threw the baby out with the bathwater by abolishing taper relief altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08042815000019">We are entitled to ask about the principles underlying the change as much as about the impact of the change itself. Was it simply designed to target a small number of individuals&#151;with the damage to businesses and angel investors viewed as the necessary price to be paid&#151;or was there a genuine principle and strategy involved? What, indeed, is the Government&#146;s current direction of travel on the taxation of business, the stability and predictability of that taxation and the encouragement of long-term investment? Those are legitimate questions that still need to be answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08042815000020">What we do know is that clause 6 represents a tax hike of some &#163;700 million, even with the last-minute concessions subsequently offered by the Government. But the potential cost to the economy of the proposed changes dwarfs the money that the Treasury hopes to raise through them. Capital gains tax has never been a big revenue raiser and the tax base has never been very wide, raising just &#163;3.8 billion from 266,000 individuals in 2006-07, rising to &#163;4.8 billion on the original forecast of the pre-Budget report. Nevertheless, it has significant potential as a disincentive to long-term investment&#151;the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08042815000021">The only benefit to the economy presented by the Chancellor&#146;s erratic driving on capital gains tax reform has been the thousands upon thousands of hours of overtime worked by lawyers, accountants and financial advisers up and down the land as they struggled amidst a dearth of information in order to give their clients reliable advice in advance of 6 April. That is quite some contribution, although it is presumably not the outcome for which the Treasury planned.</p>

However, I prefer to look directly at one of the architects of the scheme. Edward Troup, who is now director of business and indirect tax at the Treasury, wrote witheringly in the <i> Financial Times</i> in January 2002 complaining that the Prime Minister&#146;s original introduction of taper relief had pandered to political lobbying and had</p>

A single rate of, say, 20 per cent applied across the board would stop the worst excesses of avoidance without creating undue distortion.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08042815000046">It has become easy in recent weeks to poke fun at a Government who are at war with themselves. It is perhaps more worrying that Treasury officials do not seem to be on the same page as Treasury Ministers. Officials seem to like the idea of brutal simplicity, even when the burdens fall disproportionately. Ministers, on the other hand, do a good line in opportunism masquerading as principle. Members of the Committee will know of my background in the venture capital industry and I want to conclude my remarks by focusing on the support available to serial angel investors.</p>

I have no doubt that after months of confusion the scheme is of some comfort to small business men who have a lifetime of work invested in their family businesses.

reasoning&#151;that taper relief was a successful short-term incentive that had outlived its usefulness because it attracted tax avoidance&#151;was a new departure for the Treasury and broke with years of momentum.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that even if taper relief had outlived its usefulness&#151;I do not believe that for a moment&#151;it is imperative that the Government signal an intended change of direction well in advance and consult widely on it, otherwise, the impression is created that policy is being made on the hoof? Frankly, that invites investors in this country to apply the same kind of risk premiums for lack of certainty in policy that they might more typically apply in less developed economies.</p>

 As always, my hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We made that point in the debate on the previous clause. It shows the lack of predictability, consistency, planning and consultation in the Government. We need planning. We need to consult thoroughly with businesses so that they can plan in the long term, not the short term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para35"><a name="08042815000054">Mr. Neale&#146;s justification for the change of direction was that the Treasury was</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para36"><a name="08042815000055">That statement was made on 17 October. On 24 January, the Chancellor changed his mind again. Not only do the proposals fail to provide simplification, but the Treasury&#146;s view of long-term tax planning appears to have shrunk to a window of a little over three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para37"><a name="08042815000056">In January, the Chancellor also seemed keen to emphasise that there were many alternatives for helping small businesses such as venture capital trusts and the enterprise investment scheme. However, venture capital trusts have been endlessly tinkered with by the Government. I remember the Committee&#146;s discussions on the second Finance Act of 2006, when the gross asset value for VCT investments was lowered to focus investment on small companies and, at the same time, the incentive for investors was cut by an increase in the tax they had to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80428-0009.htm_para38"><a name="08042815000057">The VCT regime has been a story of fluctuation and indecision, year in, year out. It sits badly with a capital gains tax regime that fluctuates not only year by year but month by month, yet the VCT regime is one of the crutches that the Chancellor is using to prop up his latest ill-fated reform. The Chancellor must decide which road he wants to follow: targeted incentives to encourage specific policy objectives, or a simpler, flatter tax.</p>

In particular, a number of old reliefs are abolished, leaving an easy-to-understand tax-free allowance and a single headline rate of tax.

The figure in the 2007 pre-Budget report for 2010-11 was &#163;900 million. The figures published in the Budget do not separate out the final estimated cost of entrepreneurs&#146; relief.

In progressing the capital gains tax reform programme, the Government have been guided by three key principles. First, we are determined to deliver a significantly simpler tax regime. There is no doubt that capital gains tax legislation had become one of the most complex parts of the tax code, and there are genuine benefits in sweeping much of that complexity away.</p>

A generous tax-free annual exempt amount will continue to keep the vast majority of individuals out of the capital gains tax net. For those with larger capital gains, it is right and fair that they should make a contribution to the public finances, and for that minority, the new 18 per cent. rate remains internationally competitive. Finally, the Government remain particularly committed to supporting businesses and promoting enterprise. We recognise the contribution to the economy and to society that our entrepreneurs make, and have introduced a new capital gains tax relief focused closely on that group. We have also retained a number of targeted tax incentives, including the enterprise investment scheme and venture capital trusts.</p>

 Of course Killik and Co. is in favour of reducing the tax paid by passive investors in the shares of large companies quoted on the London stock exchange.

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80428-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08042824000023">The proposals for capital gains tax reform have been controversial. We do not generally consult on changes to tax rates, but wide-ranging discussions with interested parties took place after the pre-Budget report, and the entrepreneurs&#146; relief announced in January was our direct response to the concerns that were raised. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs have engaged in discussions with tax experts on the technical detail and issued draft legislation for comment ahead of Finance Bill publication. The entrepreneurs&#146; relief directly responds to the concerns raised by business groups and it should receive a warm welcome in the House.</p>

However, the new entrepreneurs&#146; relief continues to deliver targeted support for business. The change will deliver a massively simpler system that will benefit everyone. The hon. Member for Taunton said that the entrepreneurs&#146; relief makes matters more complex, but again, I do not agree. The reform will replace a significant amount of structural complexity, which is a change well worth having. It will provide a simple system, based on a single headline rate and a focused relief for entrepreneurs.

The hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Runnymede and Weybridge pressed the matter of entrepreneurs&#146; relief, saying that it was not good enough and it was a small concession, and they referred to the loss of confidence in the UK as a business environment, but entrepreneurs&#146; relief will deliver a 10 per cent.

 Does the Financial Secretary recognise that the problem faced by the UK is not the number of start-up businesses&#151;that is holding up pretty well&#151;but the number of businesses that reach the critical level of a &#163;1 million turnover within three years? That number has fallen, so more lifestyle-type businesses are starting up, but fewer of them are growing to become scalable businesses that will create the jobs, wealth and prosperity that the economy needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80428-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08042824000029">Amendment No. 8 seeks to delay the implementation of clause 6 pending a Treasury report on how capital gains tax reform will affect businesses seeking investment, investors who normally pay tax via capital gains tax, and the availability and cost of houses to buy and rent. It is unnecessary, and worse still, by abandoning the 6 April 2008 commencement provision, it would mean significant disruption for taxpayers who would no longer know where they stand. The Government have been clear from the outset that the reformed regime will be much more straightforward for people who pay capital gains tax. We announced the changes in advance to give people time to arrange their affairs accordingly, and we listened to the concerns that were raised by business groups following the announcement introducing a new tax relief targeted on entrepreneurs to meet these concerns.</p>

<p><a name="st_o173"><a name="08042824000030"><a name="80428-0010.htm_spnew18"><a name="08042824001008"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 The Financial Secretary says that advance notice was given in order for people to put their affairs in order, but it was given only because of the hue and cry after the initial announcement last autumn. We then had the situation through February and March where accountants and other financial advisers were pulling their hair out because there was a lack of clarity as to what was meant, and people were pushed into selling businesses or disposing of shares, or were not sure whether to hold them. I will not buy the &#147;This will throw the whole system into chaos&#148; argument, because it will not. If the amendment were passed, it would allow the Treasury to do precisely what it says, which is to prepare a detailed assessment of the real impact of the real changes, so that people could take informed decisions in the future.</p>

 I did not think for one moment that the hon. Gentleman would buy the argument, but I am confident that Government Members will accept the case and support the changes that we propose. We have listened to the concerns that were raised by business groups following the announcement. On the issues around property investments, it is important to remember that capital gains tax is just one of many factors that influence people&#146;s decisions about when to buy and sell. More importantly, the Government have taken a number of steps, both through the tax system and more broadly, to promote housing supply and improve affordability for first-time buyers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80428-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08042824000032">The hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Taunton asked about the save-as-you-earn plan, and suggested that it might be unfair. Our figures show that the average amount of gain that a typical employee makes from save-as-you-earn options is well under the annual exempt amount of &#163;9,600 a year, but I have no doubt that we will return to that point in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80428-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08042824000033">The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) made an entertaining and interesting contribution. I have been trying to read his lapel badges from a distance, and I now know what they say. In 1992&#151;hon. Members will remember that that was the year when the Labour party failed to get into government&#151;I remember wearing a badge saying &#147;Don&#146;t blame me, I voted Labour&#148;, but the wearing of lapel badges is a practice that I am happy to have grown out of.</p>

relief will deliver a 10 per cent. capital gains tax rate for the vast majority of small business owners and material investors, and overall the UK continues to be an excellent place in which to do business. He asked how another 28 pages of CGT legislation could possibly constitute simplification, but it is what they do that will provide the simplification. They will sweep away layers of complex rules built up over many decades, and the legislation as drafted is necessary to ensure that the various changes are made and followed through correctly. The end result will be a substantially simpler regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80428-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08042824000035">The hon. Member for Taunton asked whether the 18 per cent. CGT would lead to all sorts of avoidance. As he will be aware, there are already numerous rules in the tax code to prevent individuals from disguising income as capital gains for tax purposes. The Government have a clear track record of blocking tax avoidance if it arises, and they are consulting on options to strengthen the anti-avoidance machinery in respect of that issue.</p>

 I have been interested to read the criticism that the tax code is getting ever longer. In truth, a lot of that has resulted from the tax law rewrite work, which has introduced simplification and clarity. It has also resulted in greater explanation within the code, which is therefore longer. The language is simpler, but reading it takes longer. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s criticisms are not worth taking seriously.</p>

 I thank the Financial Secretary for her consideration of our amendment. Early in her reply, she said that our party, which is governing in Scotland, and Plaid Cymru, which is jointly governing in Wales, needed to take responsible decisions.

He said that the Government&#146;s measure was a home-grown own goal, which it is; he said that the Government had sacrificed business to short-term political advantage, and they have; and he said that we needed a properly thought out package of capital gains tax, and we do. He criticised the Financial Secretary for the Government&#146;s bringing forward of their CGT changes with no advance warning or discussion, and I agree entirely. He went on to say that schedules 2 and 3 will need detailed scrutiny upstairs in Committee, and I can hardly contain myself in anticipation of the glorious hours when we will do just that.</p>

Without the assistance of the civil servants or advisers that other parties have, I am unable to go into as much detail as I would have wanted to on schedule 2. However, I have presented a principled amendment that seeks the clarity that the Government have failed to provide so far. I wish to press amendment No. 8 to a Division.</p>

 I beg to move amendment No. 16, page 11, line 17, at end add&#151;</p>

<p><a name="80428-0012.htm_amdt0">&#145;(3) The amendment made by subsection (1) ceases to have effect on 1st April 2009 unless the Secretary of State has made regulations under the Gambling Act 2005 which permit up to one-fifth of the gaming machines in bingo halls and arcades to be Category B3 machines (as defined in regulations made under section 236 of that Act).&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08042824000956">Amusement machine licence duty is important not only to the many small businesses that are involved in gaming arcades up and down the country, but, further up the supply chain, to the various manufacturers and companies that service gaming machines. It is also important to the Treasury. It raised around &#163;208 million in tax revenue for the Treasury in the financial year 2006-07, according to the British Amusement Catering Trade Association. Indeed, the association estimates that the industry&#146;s overall contribution through gaming arcades and the gaming machines that are also in bingo halls, for example, is even greater. The industry employs 26,000 people directly, so when employment taxes&#151;for example, national insurance and PAYE&#151;are included, the estimated total tax revenue from amusement arcades is a substantial &#163;600 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08042824000957">Against that backdrop, the industry described the further increase in this year&#146;s Budget in amusement machine licence duty as a &#147;missed opportunity&#148;, given the pressures that it faces as a result of the Gambling Act 2005, which was effected last September. The amendment is intended directly to assist an industry that is under pressure, and to strengthen the Treasury&#146;s  <br>

ability to ensure that we retain a successful gaming and arcade industry, which can continue to contribute to the Exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08042824000958">The amendment would enable gaming arcades to have up to one fifth of their gaming machines as B3 machines, and unless the provision was in place by April next year, this year&#146;s Budget increases in amusement machine licence duty would lapse. The amendment would force the Government to revisit allowing more B3 machines per establishment than the current rules in the Gambling Act permit. The new rules restrict establishments to a maximum of four machines, irrespective of the venue&#146;s size. The Act also introduced a further change, reducing the maximum stake on B3 machines from &#163;2 to &#163;1, which has meant a dramatic fall in the turnover of gaming arcades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08042824000959">Although the debate is about amusement machine licence duty, to explain my amendment properly and so that hon. Members at least understand my rationale for tabling it I need briefly to outline the dramatic effects of the Gambling Act. I could have tabled a further amendment on increasing the current limited stake from &#163;1 to &#163;2 for a &#163;500 maximum prize on B3 machines, which the Gambling Act reduced. However, I believe that the amendment will give me the chance to make plain my concerns about the viability of the gaming arcade industry and the impact on the economies that it supports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08042824000960">Many people who are involved in the gaming arcade industry have serious concerns about even its short and medium-term viability, if my amendment is not accepted. Those anxieties are especially prevalent in seaside communities, where a much larger base of the local economy is linked to tourism and the entertainment industry generally.</p>

<p><a name="st_o185"><a name="08042824000961"><a name="80428-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="08042824001912"><b>John Penrose (Weston-super-Mare) (Con):</b>
 I assure my hon. Friend that I have received numerous representations from people in my constituency who run establishments such as those that she describes. They are all suffering greatly. Many have experienced catastrophic falls in revenue and many wonder for how long they can continue. My hon. Friend is right and I cannot emphasise enough the seriousness of the position of that sector of the industry.</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="08042824000962"><a name="80428-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="08042824001913"><b>Justine Greening:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a helpful contribution, which illustrates the two key points that I want to make today. First, now is not the time to increase tax further on the industry through raising the amusement machine licence duty. Secondly, it is ironic that a fair amount of the Exchequer&#146;s tax revenue, which it already, and no doubt willingly, takes from the industry is under threat because the businesses are threatened. The concerns that my hon. Friend expressed are reflected in early-day motion 840, which 155 Members from all parties have signed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08042824000963">The British Amusement Catering Trade Association has assessed that, since the introduction of the Gambling Act, revenues have collapsed by an average of 21 per cent. year on year. The amendment aims to ensure that the trend in collapsing revenues has a chance of being reversed by the Government well before the planned review of the impact of the Gambling Act, which is likely to be long drawn out. That review is currently planned to start in 2009. It could take many months&#151;  <br>

perhaps longer&#151;so we will probably not see any action until 2010. As the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said in a recent Adjournment debate:</p>
<a name="80428-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="08042824000984"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We cannot afford to wait for a six-month review, or even a three-month review. My constituents&#146; businesses are going under now. We need to send a signal now.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report,</i> 22 February 2008; Vol. 472, c. 744.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08042824000964">If the Committee supports the amendment, we would send that signal, which businesses need to give them hope that they can keep going until their problems are properly tackled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08042824000965">Without the changes that the amendment proposes, the risk to Treasury revenues is significant. However, let me be clear: for Conservative Members, it is more important that those tax revenues are based on economic success and jobs. I am worried that, by the time we who raise our concerns tonight are proved right, it will be too late to protect those gaming arcade businesses and bingo halls, which are also affected by the changes that the Gambling Act introduced, and they will be lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08042824000966">Unfortunately, the reality is that many of those businesses, which are the lifeblood of many of our most loved seaside and coastal towns, are under pressure and are going to the wall. I am talking not only about gaming arcades that form the very identity of places such as Margate, Blackpool, Portsmouth, Hastings, Great Yarmouth and Ramsgate&#151;I could continue&#151;but about family businesses that have been passed down from generation to generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08042824000967">Such businesses are the lifeblood of their local economies and are often committed to those economies, alongside providing employment, too. They deserve to be supported by the Government. Instead, they are being undermined. The Government will not take note of their cries for help, even though the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who has responsibility for gambling, admitted only in February that there was a &#147;serious problem&#148;. Ministers seem more concerned with saving face than with saving jobs and supporting local communities. My amendment challenges that most damaging attitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08042824000968">Gaming arcade businesses are being asked to compete with betting shops and casinos with one hand tied behind their back. The stakes and prizes of their machines cannot compete, and such businesses cannot have the number of machines that they need to stay profitable. My amendment aims to challenge that by removing the excessive control over the number of B3 machines to which an establishment is limited, and allowing up to 20 per cent. of any establishment&#146;s machines to be B3 machines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08042824000969">Without my amendment, there is a danger that the Treasury&#146;s tax revenues will fall, not just because of lost amusement machine licence duty but from lost employment taxes from long-standing, often family-run, businesses. My concern is that such businesses are under so much pressure that many are in danger of going to the wall, as we have heard. My amendment seeks to prevent a lose-lose situation&#151;in which everybody loses, not just, most importantly, the businesses concerned, but the Exchequer.</p>

It would mean that those underlying causes, which are so badly holding gaming arcades back, preventing them from competing with other gambling businesses, would have to be addressed. Even if those causes were not addressed, however, there would at least be no raising of amusement machine licence duty, as the Budget proposes.  <br>

Instead, the rates would be frozen. Without addressing the more fundamental issues&#151;not just the number of B3 gaming machines allowed, but the need to increase the B3 machine stake from &#163;1 to &#163;2&#151;this is no time for the Government to put further pressure on an industry that is already on its knees.</p>

The 2005 Act is sucking the economic lifeblood out of seaside communities, bingo halls and gaming arcades throughout our country. Treasury Ministers must take the necessary steps to make their colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport listen and take action before it is too late for those economies and communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08042824000981">It is time that the Government started supporting local economies, especially in the seaside towns that form so much of our valued national heritage. Today the House has the chance to join the Conservative Opposition in voting to stand up for those seaside communities. I hope, too, that we will have the support of all those hon. Members who signed early-day motion 840. For the sake of the communities affected, I hope that we can all take that opportunity.</p>

 On the face of it, clause 21 is fairly innocuous in terms of raising revenue, but it has obviously raised huge concerns in many parts of the gambling industry. I represent a constituency with coastal resorts, and although the adult gaming centres and amusement arcades in those resorts are small they form part of the entertainment that many such resorts provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08042830000002">Acceptance of those facilities is slightly mixed. Not all my constituents have gone to the planners saying that they would like more of them. Indeed, demonstrations and campaigns have been mounted to stop certain businesses starting up. We need to strike a balance. Tourists like to use such facilities when they visit, but they are not necessarily the flavour of the month with local residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08042830000003">Nevertheless, such facilities have been around a long time and are, in the main, small family businesses. In the ordinary run of things, merely raising the duty by the rate of inflation would not be particularly onerous. However, as the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) pointed out, a combination of the Gambling Acts, in some cases the smoking ban and the increase in alcohol duties has begun to put a lot of pressure on such businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08042830000004">It is not only arcades that are affected; small pubs and bingo halls are also affected. I was interested to learn about the restriction to four B3 machines in bingo halls, because some such halls are rather large establishments that hold quite a few people. During breaks, people rush to use the machines, but if there are only four machines, there will be queues of people waiting to use them. Four machines might be an acceptable number in a small establishment, but it is not reasonable in a large bingo hall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08042830000005">The Government should consider the whole situation and the effects of different aspects of their legislation and policy. Together, those measures have put particular  <br>

pressure on such businesses, and it is time to pause and consider the situation in the round. They must consider the effects on businesses and coastal towns, which have many such businesses, and particularly the effects on revenue and jobs. A significant number of jobs are affected; I was surprised to learn how many people are directly or indirectly involved in this large industry. There are great concerns that our efforts to modernise the industry and squeeze a bit more revenue out of it are going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.</p>

 One of the original ideas that led to the changes was the trade-off whereby super-casinos were to come in and ambient gambling was to be reduced. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that plan has evaporated because super-casinos are not going to happen, but that ambient gambling is still being hit? The Treasury therefore risks losing revenue from ambient gambling because those business are all going under, but without getting the extra uplift in revenue from super-casinos.</p>

 I could not agree more. That is exactly what has happened. Some of the smaller businesses involved in the gambling industry might have breathed a sigh of relief that the super-casinos were not going ahead, but they have suddenly realised that the panoply of Government policy on this issue is having almost the same effect of potentially putting many of them out of business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08042830000008">There is time to address this issue. We support the amendment in the sense that it gives us the chance to pause, consider the matter in the round and see whether there is a better way of dealing with it. The duration of licences could be considered, as could the opportunities for rebates that the industry has proposed. The industry has put forward some very constructive ideas and does not seek to have things all its own way. It seeks a fairer way of dealing with these matters so that businesses can carry on and continue to provide employment, and so that attractions at resorts, including small family businesses, can continue. That would also mean that revenue would continue to come to the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80428-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08042830000009">Unless we consider those issues, there will be a rapid demise in many of those areas. Some people who do not support the concept of gambling might think that is a good thing, but many people would be substantially affected by the demise of such businesses. It is time that the Government paused to consider the whole issue, including the effects of the Gambling Act 2005 and other measures that will be devastating for a significant number of businesses.</p>

 I find the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position somewhat contradictory, unless he was making a speech on the clause stand part debate. The amendment does not ask for a pause, to use his word. It sets out a way forward, as perceived by the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening). It does not ask the Government to pause and consider the evidence to see whether anything needs to be done and whether there is a problem, which seems to be what the hon. Gentleman suggests. That is not what the amendment asks for and I urge him to reconsider his support for it. As a result of that reconsideration, he might decide to vote against clause stand part, which would be a more logical position and would be commensurate with his earlier remarks.</p>

That is what has happened. People are migrating out of the arcade centres and, indeed, the bingo centres and going across the road to the bookies, where there is a different and harder form of gambling, which now meets their desires. I have already mentioned the FOBTs, where &#163;100 a bet can be put down every 20 seconds and scant regard is paid to what is actually being done. That is the consequence&#151;the unintended consequence&#151;of the Gambling Act 2005, which we have an opportunity to amend today. That is why we are proposing the amendment.</p>

Now that the hon. Gentleman has heard the arguments, I certainly hope that he will join us in supporting the amendment, which is crucial to helping our communities, particularly our seaside towns. If you visit any of these places, Mr. Cook, whether they be bingo halls or arcades, you will see them boarded up; they are closing down at a colossal rate of knots. The last six months has seen more of these establishments closed than ever before, as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) mentioned.

 May I first congratulate the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) on what I thought was an excellent speech, putting the case on behalf of an industry that has been badly let down? Throughout the negotiations on the Gambling Act 2005, including the pre-consultation, the Government promised to listen to the case that BACTA and others were putting forward not just to safeguard themselves but in an attempt to work with the Government. When the Gambling Bill came out, it was clear that the Government had totally ignored all that advice and guidance. Labour Members voted gladly to support that, without realising the damaging consequences to the industry. I am grateful to the hon.

Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) about people demonstrating or campaigning&#151;it is more about campaigning against new practices, as I do not believe there is a campaign in the country to try to close these operations.

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80428-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08042832000003">The amendment offers an opportunity for the Government to say that they realise that the industry is important in employing tens of thousands of people&#151;not just in the front line in the arcades, fairgrounds and on piers, but in the manufacturing industry in respect of servicing the machines. Countless thousands of people will lose their jobs. If they were all concentrated in one or two constituencies, there would be a national outcry and the Government would be forced to take action. Because those people are mainly dispersed around the coastline and in the city centres, the Government can choose to ignore the problem&#151;there may only be a few dozen here or there, perhaps 50 in a city such as Portsmouth, so they can ignore it. I would say, however, that the Government ignore it at their peril. They not only disadvantage the industry when those arcades are closed down, as many people who enjoy the facilities offered there will be equally disappointed when the bingo halls are forced to close, like the arcades that are already closing.</p>

Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) talked about&#151;people migrating from arcades to the real danger of heavy gambling, which the hon.

In many areas, those arcades are one of the last places where the family can go on a wet day, having planned to do something else, and not have to spend a lot of money to have some fun as a family.

 Clause 3 has dominated debate on the Finance Bill. The policy changes that it contains have unravelled, and they have unravelled for the same reason that the Government are unravelling; they are incoherent, inconsistent and driven by short-term political expediency rather than a long-term strategy. The problems that the clause has created are the Prime Minister&#146;s problems. He announced these measures in his last Budget, measures that he knew&#151;even when taken together with all the other measures that he announced&#151;would have the effect of making 5.3 million low-earning households worse off. So why did he do it? Various theories have been advanced, the most generous&#151;and, I have to say, the least probable&#151;of which is that he did not appreciate the effect the measure would have on the poorest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80428-0014.htm_para6"><a name="0804292000009">I bow to no one in my enthusiasm for identifying flaws in the Prime Minister but stupidity and innumeracy are not two that even I would suggest. Was it, as I have previously suggested, a move designed to establish his credentials ahead of a Labour leadership election and a honeymoon general election as the successor to Blair, able to reach out to middle England? Or, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) suggested in the debate last Monday, was this entire elaborate strategy&#151;announced in the way it was, with the abolition of the 10p rate concealed in the Budget small print and the reduction in the basic rate trumpeted in the final paragraph&#151;nothing more than a tactical manoeuvre to try to wrong-foot the Leader of the Opposition in his reply? Whatever the motive, it was a cynical and short-term one, abandoning a long-term Labour party objective and a 1997 manifesto commitment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o232"><a name="0804292000010"><a name="80428-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="0804292000147"><b>Lembit &#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b>
 Regardless of what the Government&#146;s motives were in changing the policy, the absolute wage rates in my constituency have decreased by 4 per cent. in the last 12 months&#151;and they started off at 25 per cent. below the national average&#151;so this change is having a practical negative effect in my constituency. It is reducing the average standard of living in Montgomeryshire and in many other constituencies, too.</p>

<p><a name="st_o233"><a name="0804292000011"><a name="80428-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="0804292000148"><b>Mr. Hammond:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. This tax change, which has had a negative impact on 5.3 million of the poorest households, comes at a time when earnings are stagnant and prices are soaring, leaving the average family squeezed in a vice-like grip. This measure is all the Government can offer them; at a time when those households need a hand up, all the Government offer them is a tax increase.</p>

<p><a name="st_o234"><a name="0804292000012"><a name="80428-0014.htm_spnew12"><a name="0804292000149"><b>Mr. Julian Brazier (Canterbury) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend is being too generous to the Prime Minister. The clear reason for this measure is that the only category of the poor that count in the eyes of the current Administration are those who are part of the client state. The point is that this measure is heavily hitting people who are not in receipt of benefits.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right in that the people who will be worst hit will be those who are working. I accept his criticism; I have clearly been too generous to the Prime Minister, and I promise my hon. Friend that I will try to do better in future.</p>

 I rise to ask a question in a spirit of genuine openness. This time last year, my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) moved an amendment, which eight of my colleagues and many Liberal Democrat Members&#151;and, I think, one Conservative&#151;voted for. Why did the hon. Gentleman not vote for this last year, when we had the opportunity that was led by eight of my colleagues&#151;and myself, I have to say?</p>

 I will answer that question genuinely&#151;as, in fact, I answered the same question last Monday. We flagged this tax on the poorest within an hour of the then Chancellor sitting down at the end of his 2007 Budget speech. The amendment in question sought to impose an ongoing restriction on Governments, Chancellors and the Treasury in dealing with income tax changes. We felt that that was not the best way to deal with the problem. This specific issue is in this year&#146;s Finance Bill, and we are addressing it by tabling amendments that will deal with the problem before the House today.</p>

 We have not said that we would introduce the 10p rate, and it is clear that the Labour Members whose position was critical in forcing the Government&#146;s climbdown were not necessarily seeking to reinstate the 10p rate. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Gentleman says, &#147;Ah&#148;, but perhaps he would care to ask the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who is sitting not 3 m along the Bench from him.

That is also our objective tonight.</p>

 I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. About 40 per cent. of my constituents earn less than &#163;19,000 a year. That means they will lose out from the 10p rate. However, the vast majority of them will gain substantially because of the way in which the moneys have been redistributed through working family tax credits, child care tax credits and housing benefit. <i> [Interruption.] </i>No, not clients of the state; people who work hard for the state, and who receive only the minimum wage in return for their labour.</p>

That is the group of people we are addressing today. Also, in addition to those 5.3 million people, there are millions more people&#151;including some of her constituents &#151;who have benefited from this package and who are equally disgusted that a Prime Minister, especially one who poses as the protector of the poor, could so cynically betray those who have placed their trust in him.</p>

Faced with defeat, he ran up the white flag. He did so not because he had been persuaded of the argument or because he acknowledged that he was wrong, but simply to avoid a humiliation on the Floor of the House tonight.

It should be as acceptable to those who are convinced of the Prime Minister&#146;s sincerity as to those who doubt it, and as acceptable to those who wish to live in hope as to those who prefer to learn from experience.</p>

It would give the Government the rest of this year to take action and come back to Parliament and report on the measures that they have taken to mitigate the effects of this clause on those who will pay more income tax as a result of the combined effects of clauses 3 and 1&#151;the clause reducing the basic rate of tax. When they had done so, it would require a simple resolution of the House that it is satisfied with the statement made to lift the threat of the sunset provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80428-0016.htm_para3"><a name="0804292000063">The amendment is deliberately not prescriptive. It does not seek to tell the Government how they must address this problem; whom they must compensate and to what extent, or by what means.

 The logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position is that it would be satisfactory to get rid of the 10p rate, provided that the House was satisfied with a complex compensation package. Surely it is a crazy idea to get rid of the 10p rate and try to compensate various groups through ever more complex means, only to end up spending public money on other groups who did not lose but cannot be separated from those who did. The whole idea is nonsense, and it would be far better simply to retain the 10p rate&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

If the Government deliver those Members what they promised them, or at least a package that they accept as being a fair and reasonable solution in all the circumstances, they will get their motion, whatever the Opposition parties do. But the provisions of the amendment would be the House&#146;s insurance policy against the Government who, with the rebellion off and the elections behind them, could renege on the commitment they have made.</p>

There was a shabby attempt to shuffle part of the burden on to employers by a political interference with the rate of the minimum wage. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will provide some specific and concrete assurances in the course of this debate. If so, that will be yet another change of direction, albeit a welcome one.

He has a track record now. Over the last decade or so, we have seen many offerings from the Prime Minister that do not quite match the fine rhetoric with which they were presented. We have all learned&#151;and it takes a conscious effort now to remember that this was not the case before 1997&#151;not to take what we hear in the Budget speech at face value, but to wait until we have trawled through the mountains of small print and press releases before passing judgement. Now the Prime Minister has to live with the consequences of that track record and recognise that many in the House will have been alarmed by the gap between the right hon. Member for Birkenhead&#146;s version of the deal and the Chief Secretary&#146;s comments on &#147;Newsnight&#148; last Wednesday. They will have been alarmed that they might have sold the pass too quickly, without a clear Government commitment on the extent of the compensation, the amount and how it will be backdated.

 I very much agree.

 Let me make this clearer. The Liberal Democrats&#146; objective is to ease the tax burden on people with very low incomes who cannot afford it at present. The Government propose to double the 10p rate to 20p for those people, going completely in the wrong direction. We could choose to use the 10p mechanism to assist those people, or it could be done some other way. A millionaire pays less as a result of the 10p rate decision, so I appreciate that it is not a very focused tax reduction for people on low and low-to-middle incomes, but it is a hell of a lot better than what the Government are proposing, which is that that tax burden should be doubled for those people.</p>

Many in the London media commentating classes make the mistake of thinking that anybody who earns &#163;14,000 to &#163;17,000 a year is a low earner. For many constituents of mine, that is a typical wage. People who work as hotel receptionists or on farms or who have secretarial jobs do not regard themselves as low earners or as people who need to be beneficiaries of the largesse of the state. They want to get on with paying a reasonable proportion of their salaries in tax to fund public services, but they also want to be able to provide for themselves and their households. The issue affects millions of people&#151;including, but not exclusively, the poorest.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way; he is being very generous. He has been talking a lot about Liberal Democrat policy and what might happen at a general election in two years&#146; time, but my constituents are struggling now. The reason for the concern on the Labour Benches and elsewhere was that all our constituents are struggling now. No one is going to reinstate the 10p band at a cost of &#163;7 billion; we are looking for mitigating procedures that cost about &#163;700 million. Will the hon.

 Yes, is my answer to that. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, I have never claimed anything else.

If one person has no money and another is a millionaire, their average wealth is &#163;500,000, but that figure does not reflect the circumstances of either person. The Government talk about &#147;average&#148; losers, but some people may be overcompensated and end up with more money as a result of the package than if the 10p rate had been kept in place.

 Another problem with using the minimum wage is that it will not help two obvious groups of people: first, those whose overall pay is low because they are part-time, even though their hourly rate is greater than the minimum wage; and, secondly, self-employed people such as jobbing builders and low-paid freelancers of various sorts&#151;window cleaners, for example&#151;who will not be benefited by an increase in the minimum wage.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that the proposal will not help many people in London, because firms have gradually been encouraged to move to the London living wage of just in excess of &#163;7?

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The national minimum wage has less effect in London, where wages and the economy as a whole are geared at a higher level because the cost of living is greater. Raising the minimum wage by, for example, 50p will therefore have a less profound impact in this part of the country than it would elsewhere.</p>

doubt about this. After all, what was the motivation for cutting the basic rate from 22p to 20p, paid for in large part by doubling the 10p rate? It was so that the Prime Minister could say to the <i> Daily Mail </i>and to other representatives, as he saw it, of middle England, &#147;Don&#146;t believe for a moment that Tony Blair leaving as leader of the Labour party means that new Labour is dead as a concept. I am still able to carry new Labour&#151;the election-winning coalition that has got us through the last three general elections and can still be held together with me as leader of the Labour party. My demonstration of that is that I am able to trump the Conservative party on the basic rate of tax.&#148; That was the motivation&#151;it had nothing to do with the poor.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman carefully consider what he has just said and retract it in the interests of accuracy? He is repeating what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said a few days ago&#151;that the cost of reducing the standard rate from 22p to 20p was being met largely by the impact of the reduction of the 10p rate on the less well-off. That is not the case. The cost of reducing the standard rate is &#163;7,000 million or thereabouts; the cost, and the impact on the 5.3 million people affected, is &#163;600 million or thereabouts, which is less than 10 per cent. of that.</p>

 Listen, and I will explain. Compensating only the people who are net losers because of the doubling of the 10p rate would cost about &#163;700 million&#151;the figure mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. The total increase in revenue from doubling the 10p rate is far greater than that because someone who is earning &#163;100,000, &#163;150,000 or &#163;200,000 a year will also be affected by the 10p rate. We are talking about two separate measures. The 2p reduction in the basic rate was paid for in large part&#151;I did not say entirely&#151;by the doubling of the 10p rate. A lot of people are net beneficiaries of that change because the 2p reduction in the basic rate more than compensates them for the doubling of the 10p band, which is quite narrow. However, some people on lower incomes&#151;those who are, depending on their circumstances, earning up to &#163;18,000&#151;are net losers. The hon. Gentleman is confusing two separate points.</p>

We have to cast our mind back and ask ourselves who the beneficiaries of the Conservative tax-cutting package were. Were they the people I mentioned a while ago&#151;those on typical wages, such as people working on farms, hotel receptionists or secretarial staff? No, they were completely overlooked. Were they pensioners on modest incomes between the ages of 60 and 64? No, they were completely overlooked. Were they people on low wages under the age of 25 without children? No, they were completely overlooked, as well. The people whom the Conservative party thought had the most acute needs in our society, and were therefore most deserving of an easing of their tax burden, were people who lived in houses worth somewhere in the region of &#163;1 million, who had entirely paid off the mortgage on their house. I regarded that as an extraordinary prioritisation, although I do not doubt that it was effective in preventing the Prime Minister from calling a general election.</p>

 I am not launching a vitriolic attack on anything. I think that there is a place for inheritance tax, as does the hon. Gentleman, because he does not want to abolish it altogether. At the moment, because of rising house prices the threshold at which people start to pay inheritance tax is too low. The point of dispute is whether it should be raised as high as the hon. Gentleman is proposing, or whether there are people who need that assistance more. I would argue that my constituents and others who earn &#163;11,000, &#163;12,000, &#163;13,000 or &#163;14,000 a year are more deserving of Government assistance than those who live in houses worth &#163;1 million who have paid off their mortgages entirely.

 In asking that of those on his Front Bench, will the right hon. Gentleman also ensure that the Financial Secretary accepts that she was wrong to give the impression in an earlier debate that there were not significant numbers of people who were affected by the measures? She specifically said that she did not accept the figures that were presented by our party. However, the Government now admit that the right hon.

 I thought it was quite clear to us all that the Government now accept that there are significant numbers of losers. Because the Treasury Committee is starting an important inquiry on this point, it would help us all, when we think of the evidence that we wish to give that Committee, if the Government at some stage&#151;perhaps not tonight, but soon after this evening&#146;s debate&#151;brought us up to date on how many losers they expect. What is the age of those losers? Where are the losers in the totality of the income distribution? How many of those losers are in households in which the other member gains from the cut from 22 to 20 per cent., so that the household is better off, although that individual loses?</p>

 Before the right hon. Gentleman tries to pin the Government down on their vague promises, will he give his opinion on how we got into this appalling state? He mentioned that the proposals were put forward by the then Chancellor just over a year ago; 13 months later, the Prime Minister has said several things within the space of a week. First, he said that nobody would lose out, then he said that some people would lose out, but that the Budget was too complicated to unravel. Then he said that people would lose out and that the Government would try to unravel it, but that it would take six months to work out what to do. Is that the result of staggering incompetence or of outright cynicism and their belief that they could treat the poor as badly as they liked and those people would still vote Labour?</p>

compensation that was as comprehensive as possible. There may be doubts about the numbers, but I did not doubt for a moment that once the Government adopted a new position, there would be compensation. My understanding was that they were not going to take a mean-minded approach that excluded people, and that there would be efforts to make the package as comprehensive as possible. They were going to consider two ways in which to achieve that: through tax credits or using the Revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80428-0018.htm_para2"><a name="0804294000038">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) that there are real difficulties with using the tax credit structure as a means of achieving that objective. The Government were to look at the Revenue and national insurance systems to see how packages of compensation could be paid, and the compensation package was to be made up of several factors. There is clearly a definable group of people who will be affected&#151;those aged over 60 but under 65. In the Budget, the Government have substantially increased personal allowances for those aged 65 and over, which covers that group for losses owing to the abolition of the 10p rate. Some of the funds in relation to the reduction of the rate from 22p to 20p will also be used.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that that 60 to 65 group concerns women pensioners in particular, especially those who have made provision for private pensions, which is a minority of women?

 I agree totally. They are one of the many groups whom we should wish to salute, rather than kneecap, when we pass measures in this place. The Government are considering compensating that very group, which my hon. Friend has mentioned on a number of occasions. One mechanism for paying that group might be the one that is used to pay the winter fuel allowance. That is not to say that it would be a winter or summer fuel allowance, but that such a mechanism might be one of a number of ways in which the Government could reach and compensate groups that have suffered.</p>

My understanding is that there will be an effort to seek out people who are aged under 60 but in work, and to find means by which to compensate them. That brings me back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire that there are different ways of doing that. Once again, however, let us not kid ourselves that this is going to be an easy exercise; but when we say that, let us also remember that no party is advocating the reintroduction of the 10p rate.

Members who are avid readers of the reports from the minimum wage commission will know that a number of recommendations were made, including lowering the age at which the adult rate should start. Recommendations have already been made, which the Government have not accepted in the past, so it is not true to say that somehow the Government are going to go in with their boots to the minimum wage commission and make it set rates or change its attitudes.

 I find this an extremely unhappy debate. It follows a period in which we have seen several Budgets dominated rather more by politics than by any great economic common sense or sense of social justice. In a way, two of them have been conflated. The Budget that introduced the 10p rate was, in my opinion, based on a mistake, and the Budget that has tried to remove it has made a mistake as well. Listening to today&#146;s debate, I find myself uncertain about how the House as a whole&#151;if there is, temporarily, a majority in the House that wants to repair the damage&#151;will emerge from this, and what exactly is supposed to result from the Government&#146;s package to restore the position.</p>

That was a mere electoral slogan, produced to give the impression to people paying the standard rate that they would all start paying the 10p rate, because then, as now, the Government&#151;particularly the present Prime Minister&#151;constantly ran scared of the Conservatives&#146; reputation for tax-cutting. Although the present Prime Minister was not going to cut taxes, he gave the impression that the 10p rate would be the new starting rate and introduced it, which caused unnecessary complication to the tax system and did not benefit anything like the number of people that some Labour speeches had given the impression it would.</p>

not want too many income tax rates, because it over-complicates the system&#151;but I thought that it would be difficult to get rid of it, because it would not be possible to raise taxation on precisely the group who have been hit now. I must admit that the only solution that occurred to me was that over the years it might be possible to fix, and not raise, the ceiling for the 10p rate and let the threshold creep up over time, so that one day, mirabile dictu, it would vanish; but it might have taken a very long time to do it in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80428-0018.htm_para17"><a name="0804296000013">The trouble was that because of the state of the public finances, the Chancellor could not conceivably afford to cut the standard rate. It was not sensible to do so when he was presiding over deteriorating public finances and a borrowing requirement that he was not even capable of forecasting correctly, let alone financing in any responsible way. So he did not find all the money from the 10p rate; he found some from business. He presented as a tax-cutting Budget what of course turned out to be a tax-raising Budget. That was a frequent performance of the present Prime Minister when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Too much of the money was raised by abolishing the 10p rate, so there was an extraordinary transfer of money from some of the poorest earners in the country to quite a lot of the better-off.</p>

Looking back, I can think of no other reason why part of the Budget proposed that the change would not come into effect for 12 months. It was not even legislated for at the time. The only reason for that was, as we all know, that the groups about whom we are talking do not follow the details of Budgets; 90 per cent. of the public do not follow the details of the Budget.

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0804296000015">In this House, a lot of people noticed the measure last year. It took about 24 hours for them to do so because it had not been clearly flagged up. The then Chancellor had tried to bury it, but the debates erupted and the issue got into the press. People began to talk about not a tax cut, but a tax con, one of the popular phrases that rapidly got into the political debate. But none of us at that time came up with a proposal, apart from the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). There was a very simple problem. I have looked up my own speech to make sure and I did state that as someone of pensionable age and reasonably well off, I had benefited considerably from the Budget. I was suitably grateful; it was very nice of the then Chancellor to put me and one or two of my hon. Friends in a rather better position. I did ask why this was at the expense of some of the lowest earning people in the country, as that did not seem to be very sensible. But none of us had a remedy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0804296000016">If my analysis is right&#151;that the real problem was that the then Chancellor was cutting the standard rate when he could not afford to do so&#151;the logical explanation would be not to cut the standard rate by quite so much. But in this Chamber we appreciate that all of us, including me, did not have the nerve to get up and say &#147;You should not cut the standard rate until you can afford to do so. Why don&#146;t you put it back again?&#148; We ruled that out, but now comes the uncertainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0804296000017">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead, not for the first time, has achieved an absolute triumph by mobilising what was, I suspect, a much more considerable body of support in his own party than the ones who had the nerve to sign the relevant motion to make the Government do something about it. But he is plainly extremely unclear exactly how the measures will be delivered and, let us be clear, he is talking about a considerable amount of public expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0804296000018">We keep talking about how much it would cost to put back the 10p band. I have no idea what sum the right hon. Member for Birkenhead is visualising will be spent on compensating all these people. I will not be so churlish as to ask how this will be paid for, because it could not be paid for at the time of the 2007 Budget. The Treasury sometimes finds itself hit on the head with public expenditure that it cannot afford so the next pre-Budget report or Budget will presumably contain some means of raising the revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0804296000019">Meanwhile, the difficulty is that all the mechanisms that we have identified are extremely complicated and unsatisfactory. I regard the winter fuel payment as an electoral bribe paid to most pensioners. The money is taken from the right-hand pocket and put in the left-hand pocket at Christmas with a clear message; pretend this is for your fuel bills and spend it wisely. Many Members of this House receive it, as do most Members of the House of Lords, who regard it as a tax rebate. If it is given to everybody between the ages of 60 and 65, those of us who, sadly, have just crept past the age of 65 will be very indignant because most of those people will not be on a 10p marginal rate and quite a lot will be young pensioners, many with full-time occupations and good incomes. It is not very satisfactory.</p>

It greatly benefits some low-earning people, but it also causes great hardship to many low-earning people because of the errors that are made and the pain of recovering overpayments. So, how on earth will we target effectively the people we have in mind? I will vote for the amendment because it puts in concrete form the only thing that matters: that the Government, having agreed to do this, have to come back and produce something that delivers the goods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0804296000021">I listened to the Chief Secretary last week, and I can well understand why she has ducked out of the debate today, because last week she did not have the first idea how this undertaking would be honoured. I understand the difficulty: Prime Ministers have a habit of making sweeping promises and then turning around to the Treasury and saying, &#147;Carry on sergeant-major; now deliver what I have promised a majority of the House of Commons we are going to do.&#148; So I wish the Financial Secretary well, when she rises to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0804296000022">I share some of the suspicions that have been raised, however. I read the Chancellor&#146;s tax letter to the Select Committee Chairman. The recipient, the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), is present; I see that he is nodding, and I am sure he agrees that the letter does not cast a great deal of clarity on exactly where we are now going to go. I am also worried that weasel words are already getting in, in the context of what the right hon. Member for Birkenhead has just related to us or has ever said on the subject. In particular, although the letter talks about the pensioners&#151;those over 60&#151;being, perhaps,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0804296000024">when it goes on to talk about the other categories of people affected, there is no suggestion of anything being backdated to the start of the financial year. Therefore, the idea that people will be compensated in full, or even on average, did not even get as far as the Chancellor&#146;s letter. As one of the Liberal Members rightly pointed out, all Members are meeting people, so we can all cite people who are&#151;sometimes in the most elaborate, but unfortunate combination of circumstances&#151; hit by this. People come to us and say, &#147;My income has gone down,&#148; and they will all have to wait for some period of time before any changes are even announced that will address that, and only the people between the ages of 60 and 65 appear to have got any undertaking of a backdate even by the time the Chancellor wrote this letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0804296000025">We are now all facing up to the fact that, even since the 2007 Budget, things have got much worse for the people we are concerned about. Since the announcement but before the change came into effect, while earnings have not been moving significantly, utility bills and council tax have increased and food bills are rising very rapidly, so everybody&#146;s discretionary income is being squeezed and the current situation of the people concerned is worse than we could have contemplated when this measure was first announced. Therefore, the sums&#151; comparatively small, though they might sound to us&#151;that  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0804296000026">We need an amendment to hold the Government to what the right hon. Member for Birkenhead thinks they have committed themselves to, but we cannot just take that on trust. The fact that it is almost impossible to conceive of an easy mechanism for achieving this means that we must make sure that the whole thing does not slip away and get lost so that by the time we reach the pre-Budget report in November we are again having obscure arguments with Treasury Ministers who are trying to persuade us that, really, when we look at this carefully, quite a lot of what they said happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0804296000027">This is an appalling episode. Some long nights of work are required in the Treasury to sort out how to compensate most of these people and, equally importantly, how to make sure they are helped fairly quickly this year to deal with the consequences now. If we just let this go today simply on the basis of the assurances we have been told about, and when we find that those assurances are almost impossible to understand&#151;we cannot get hold of them and do not know what the mechanisms will be&#151;it would be a great folly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0804296000028">I therefore urge the right hon. Member for Birkenhead to vote for the amendment, which just ties the Government down to introducing specific things. The House has risen as a body and said to the Government, &#147;This is not a fair way of paying for the point you wanted to make in the Budget at the time.&#148; We must ensure that they come back with a fairer way or a system of compensating those who are about to suffer. I do not envy the Financial Secretary to the Treasury&#151;I see her poised to get up, so I shall allow her to do so in a moment&#151;as she has one of the more ridiculous and impossible briefs to present to us. I hope that she can assure us at least that she will use her best endeavours, and perhaps she will allow the amendment to hold her to things and make her deliver something concrete.</p>

 Before the Minister rises, I wish to make a brief contribution about one of the groups that is losing out from this package&#151;people in the 60 to 64 age bracket. My contribution is inspired, first, by the fact that this group has been in contact with me and with many other hon. Members in largish numbers, and, secondly, by what the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said. There is a sense that the House is being asked to accept a pig in a poke for this group and that what those constituents want, above all, is certainty. I do not believe that that certainty has so far been provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0804296000030">I raise the issue of women in the 60 to 64 bracket, in particular, because one of them contacted me having heard the Prime Minister give an interview in which he said that people should not worry because pensioners have been compensated. This lady said, &#147;Last time I looked I was a pensioner, but I am losing out by more than &#163;200 a year&#148;. That is because women in that age bracket, although pensioners, do not qualify for the pensioner tax allowance. Such people have contacted me and other hon. Members in large numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0804296000031">The first question is: what compensation can such people expect to receive? Amendment No. 19 refers to the compensation package and suggests that the 10p  <br>

rate is reversed unless we are happy with the compensation package. I am not convinced that we will get the very precise answers that women in the 60 to 64 age group want&#151;I shall shut up and sit down shortly so that the Minister can tell us her response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0804296000032">When I intervened on the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, I asked what these people will get. What can they expect, supposing that they have lost up to &#163;200 net of other changes? If I understood him rightly, he said that they could expect average compensation. If the group, on average, has lost &#163;100, I take his understanding of what he has been promised to mean that the people involved will get &#163;100. If, for the sake of argument, there were 300,000 losers in this age group, half would still gain and half would lose. Clearly people would lose less than they would otherwise have done, but there would still be a significant number of losers. The first point is, thus, that women who have read in the press that the Government will compensate them might discover, at some point, that the Government will not compensate them in full&#151;they may compensate people in part at some point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0804296000033">The second question is: when will such people be compensated? This group ought to be the most straightforward of all to deal with, because if the winter fuel payment mechanism is used, that is probably one of the simplest things that could be done. If we have to wait until the pre-Budget statement, which is traditionally made in November, and then, presumably, for legislation, because we will need to define, in a new way, a very specific group, people will not get their money until 2009. The reason the winter fuel payment has a September cut-off date is that it takes three months to give everybody the money. Let us assume that the pre-Budget statement is made in November, and legislation is made over Christmas and the new year. If we add three months on top of that, it could be well over a year before those women receive partial compensation. That is not what they will have perceived they were going to receive.</p>

 Two things are now clear from this debate. The first is that no party is proposing the re-introduction of the 10p rate. The second is that nobody yet has any ideas about how to compensate people. A judgment must be made as to whether we believe that the Government, in good faith, will strive to find as many of the people involved as possible. Nothing on tonight&#146;s Order Paper gives the pensioners that the hon. Gentleman is talking about any more reassurance than we have heard from those on the Treasury Bench or from me.</p>

 I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on his second point; it is a question whether we believe in the good faith of the Government. Given that the root of this problem was an attempt to deceive people and to portray something in one way that came across in another, the worry is that the presentation of this compensation package is already being spun. I simply do not have confidence that the Government will act in good faith in this regard. On his first point, I suspect that we will divide later on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. The Liberal Democrats will clearly and unambiguously vote against the Government&#146;s measure.</p>

Let us suppose that the package costs around &#163;1 billion&#151;because we cannot identify the losers and just give them back their losses&#151;and we end up paying, for example, men in the 60 to 64 bracket who may not have lost out in the first place. Where would that &#163;1 billion come from? Would it come from another tax, thus creating a whole new set of losers? Can we be confident that the compensation package really will compensate people, or will it just create a new set of unjustified losers? The right hon. Member for Birkenhead would be the first to acknowledge that that money will have to come from somewhere. Someone will have to pay the bill for this incompetence and we may find that it is other vulnerable people, unless it is achieved through a progressive mechanism.

 I am sorry if the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) thinks that I am a sorry substitute for my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, but it is normal for the Financial Secretary to respond to such amendments.</p>

The amendments are unnecessary and would effectively freeze clause 3 if they were accepted. They are, in the time-honoured phrase, wrecking amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80428-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0804296000040">The result of these amendments would be to change fundamentally clause 3 and would mean that Budget resolution 4, which enables HMRC to collect tax between the start of the tax year and Royal Assent to the Finance Bill, would fall. We would be left in the position in which HMRC would have no legal power to collect any tax on the first &#163;2,320 of taxable income from the start of the tax year. Most employers, because they would require changes to their payroll systems, would also be unable to deduct the correct amounts from their employees.</p>

Employment is now at record levels, at 74.7 per cent. with over 29 million people in work&#151;a rise of more than 2.9 million since 1997. Alongside this, in 1999, the Government guaranteed the lowest paid a minimum income for the first time. Since its inception, the national minimum wage has risen by 59 per cent., while median earnings have risen 37 per cent. That has brought to an end the long-term trend of wages at the bottom of the income distribution growing far more slowly than average earnings. That reform is very precious to me, as I used to work as trade union organiser for the then National Union of Public Employees and campaigned on the issue throughout the 1980s, when it was not universally supported by the Labour movement.

They bid &#163;2, &#163;1.50, &#163;1.20, &#163;1&#151;and then, &#147;Sold to the lowest bidder!&#148; The Conservative party called it efficiency savings.

Some 3 million of Britain&#146;s 7 million families with children will receive more in tax credits and child benefits than they pay in income tax. That will effectively wipe out their tax liability altogether. For those without children, the average award in 2005-06 was more than &#163;1,900 a year.

The changes removed the 10p starting rate of tax, reduced the basic rate of tax to 20p, increased the allowances for pensioners aged 65 and over, increased working tax credits to help low-income households and increased child tax credits to provide additional support to families with children. As a result of the changes, child poverty will affect 200,000 fewer than otherwise and households with children in the poorest fifth are, on average, &#163;340 a year better off. Some 600,000 fewer pensioners will pay income tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80428-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0804296000053">In the 2008 Budget, the Government were able to go even further, with additional increases in child tax credit and child benefit that remove another 250,000 children from poverty. We will provide additional support to pensioners through the winter fuel allowance.</p>

 Some time ago, when I attempted to intervene, the Financial Secretary was making the point that under the Government&#146;s system it is crucial to encourage people where possible to take up the means-tested benefits, such as tax credits and pension credits. However, it is sometimes difficult to persuade someone to apply after they have been through the nightmare of the seesaw between reclaims, overpayments and underpayments. As others have said, if the Government are going to rely on that encouragement as the safety net and think that it will solve the problem, that is quite a dangerous presumption.</p>

 The tax credit system, as a result of changes made as long ago as 2005, is vastly improved, and I continue work, as does Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, to improve customer experience of the service. The hon. Gentleman will know, because he will have heard me say so on previous occasions, of the changes that we are working to introduce that will help claimants, particularly those who have had problems in the past. We know who they are, and we can work with them to make their experience better.</p>

 I am going to turn to the points that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80428-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0804296000059">The 10p starting rate of tax to be removed in clause 3 was introduced in 1999 as part of long-term reforms, and was part of the initial process to help support low-income households. However, with the measures that have been introduced since 1999, particularly the introduction of the national minimum wage and the subsequent introduction of tax credits, we can now better target our resources on low incomes.</p>

 I want to respond to the points made in the debate, but I shall give way to the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer).</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="0804296000063"><a name="80428-0020.htm_spnew7"><a name="0804296001294"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b>
 In our discussions over the past 10 days, the Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) that she did not accept his figures for people who would lose out as a result of the changes. Will she now give confidence to the House by admitting that he was right, and she should have accepted those figures, which the Government now accept are correct?</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="0804296000064"><a name="80428-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="0804296001295"><b>Jane Kennedy:</b>
 It was not clear at the time exactly what the figures were to which the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex was referring. I have dug out the answer I gave in the House in October to my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead. It set out in detail those people who would benefit from the changes and those people who would lose: it set out the numbers, and the amounts per week anticipated for changes in income. That is quite clear, and I have never sought to deny it, so I do not know what the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal is referring to.</p>

 I am trying to make progress, to reach the point where I can reply to the genuine concerns expressed by Labour Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80428-0020.htm_para5"><a name="0804296000067">Removing the 10p rate has enabled us to introduce further measures that reduce child poverty and remove pensioners from tax, but we have also produced a tax system with only two main tax rates applying to the same income as the two main rates of national insurance. This is now one of the simplest personal tax systems in the developed world. Having set out the benefits of the changes that we have made, I acknowledge that, as a consequence of redirecting resources as I have described, some households have less income as a result, and that those households are often on a low income. I regret that that is an effect of those changes, which is why we would have looked to help such households in the future anyway, and we intend to do that very thing in the next days and weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80428-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0804296000068">I am grateful to my right hon.

 I do not wish to be drawn on the outcome of this further work. I say that advisedly, not intending in any way cynically to avoid the question that is being put, but it is only right and proper to undertake the work of reviewing what can be done properly and seriously, and to ensure that the Government can bring forward their commitment to do more, in particular for low-paid workers without children and pensioners under 65.</p>

 As I have said, my right hon. Friend made a thoughtful and constructive response to the debate. I am grateful to him for the way in which he has contributed, and we will be working with him and others to take the work forwards. The Chancellor made a commitment in his letter that there are households that we want to do more to help. It would not be appropriate for the Government to commit at this stage to the detail of what measures we may consider before the report is delivered.

(Mr. Clarke) commented on the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s achievement in that the Government have agreed to do something. The problem for the House and the right hon. Gentleman is that no one is clear what that something is. The right hon. Gentleman, in his e-mail to his fellow Members who signed the amendment last Wednesday, said that the deal involved everyone being compensated in full and would be backdated to 6 April.</p>

 Let us be quite straight about this. The Government have changed their position and they are starting to work. Had the hon.

 If the right hon.

 If the right hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall address some of his other points. As I understand his comments this evening, he has said that the average loss for the group of people losing as a result of the measures is &#163;2 per week, but the maximum loss is &#163;256 per year. However, as I understand his comments this evening, the commitment that he thinks he has achieved from the Government now is to compensate only at the average loss of &#163;2 per week. So there will still be people out there who have lost as much as &#163;152 a year as a result of the measures, even if the Government deliver on the possibility of compensating them all at the average rate.</p>

nothing that we have heard from those on the Government Front Bench gives us any confidence that we will have a clear picture of the total package of compensation by that time. He has urged Labour Members not to be beguiled by the Conservative amendment, which the Financial Secretary has referred to as a wrecking amendment. I say to her and the right hon.

It is an insurance policy for the House. It is a mechanism that would allow the House a guaranteed way of coming back to this issue if it is not resolved satisfactorily. The amendment would require the Government to tell the House what they have done, and they will not be in a position to do that by Report. I suggest to the House that it needs this insurance policy to ensure that the deal that the right hon. Gentleman, to his great credit, sought to do with the Prime Minister is delivered on by the Prime Minister and is not reneged on by the Government once this week&#146;s elections are out of the way and the immediate inconvenience of a Labour Back-Bench rebellion is off the books.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Many London Members will have been greatly disturbed to see in our local papers last Friday an advertisement placed by the Electoral Commission in connection with Thursday&#146;s mayoral elections. The advertisement shows a facsimile of a ballot paper, and suggests that the voter&#146;s mark be placed against candidate No. 6, who happens to be the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson). May I ask whether Mr. Speaker has received a request from the Justice Ministry to make a statement to the House to clear up this extremely disturbing business?</p>

 The past 18 months have not been easy for NHS staff in North Yorkshire and York. Despite the Government&#146;s substantial real-terms funding increases each year&#151;including this year&#146;s increase of &#163;51.7 million to the North Yorkshire and York primary care trust, which, for the first time, took its allocation to &#163;1 billion&#151;clinicians and managers in York and other parts of North Yorkshire had to close beds and restrict access to some treatment such as assisted conception and stripping varicose veins in order to reduce deficits built up by some acute trusts and, principally, by the PCT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0804297000023">The frequently critical but not inaccurate press coverage of those events over the past two years or so obscures the fact that the North Yorkshire and York area is one of the healthiest places in Britain to live, with some of the best health services. We have the longest life expectancy and the lowest cancer death rate in Yorkshire. The stroke death rate, for example, has fallen 60 per cent. over the past 11 years, from 28 deaths per 100,000 to 11. That is the lowest stroke death rate in Yorkshire. The coronary heart disease death rate has fallen 50 per cent. over the same period, from 90 deaths per 100,000 to 45.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0804297000024">Treatment rates in North Yorkshire and York are generally good. The percentage of patients treated within 18 weeks of referral is better, at 71 per cent., than that in the Yorkshire region as a whole, at 67 per cent. Those figures are from January 2008. The treatment rate in North Yorkshire and York is better than that in nine of the 13 other PCTs in the strategic health authority area.</p>

In other words, more patients as a proportion of the population receive those operations than is the case in most other parts of the country. Our PCT is in the top 25 per cent. of PCTs in that respect. Overall, NHS services in North Yorkshire and York are significantly better than they were 10 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0804297000029">In 2007-08, the PCT turned a financial deficit of &#163;13 million from the previous year into a surplus of &#163;14 million at the end of March this year. In the past year, the PCT has achieved run-rate balance. That is to say that in the past year its expenditure each month was less than the income it received. That is a remarkable achievement&#151;a remarkable turnaround for the PCT that had the worst deficit in the country. It is an achievement by the clinicians and managers who have worked together to deliver that result. It means that North Yorkshire and York PCT is no longer drawing resources away from other areas in Yorkshire with a lower life expectancy or a greater burden of disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0804297000030">I understand and support the Department of Health&#146;s policy requiring health trusts that overspend to bring their books into balance. I recognise that without that discipline every trust would overspend, and the Government would lose the financial control that they exercise on behalf of the taxpayer. However, now that North Yorkshire and York PCT is in recurrent balance, I think the Department should consider modifying its policy to a limited extent and write off the remaining historic deficit, which is about &#163;19 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0804297000031">This year the regional authority&#151;the strategic health authority&#151;is expected to deliver not a deficit but a surplus of some &#163;200 million to &#163;300 million, so it could afford to write off some, or all, of the North Yorkshire and York deficit from a much larger region-wide surplus. It could do so without drawing resources away from other areas, because those other areas currently do not have the capacity to spend all the money that they are allocated. I hope very much that they will develop the capacity to spend their allocations in full in future years, because they have health needs that demand it. However, North Yorkshire and York will not inhibit higher spending elsewhere in future years, because its spending is now in balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0804297000032">I realise that I am asking for a change in Government policy and I accept that that is unlikely to happen on the Floor of the House this evening, but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether she, or one of her ministerial colleagues, would meet me to discuss my proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0804297000033">There is another matter that I should like to discuss at such a meeting: the NHS funding formula. North Yorkshire and York PCT currently receives less funding per capita than any other PCT in Yorkshire and the Humber. Last year it received &#163;1,306 per person, compared with &#163;1,621 per person in the best-funded PCT in Yorkshire, and an average of &#163;1,484 per person in Yorkshire as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0804297000034">One other PCT in Yorkshire receives almost the same level of funding per capita as North Yorkshire and York. East Riding of Yorkshire PCT receives &#163;1,316 per person, just &#163;10 more than North Yorkshire and York. Both PCTs receive substantially less funding per capita than any of the other Yorkshire PCTs, and they are the only two PCTs in Yorkshire that are in deficit. I believe that there is a connection between those two facts. The better-funded PCTs are unable to spend their higher allocations, which is why there is such a significant surplus across the strategic health authority as a whole. Although they spend more per person than the north and east Yorkshire PCTs, with good reason&#151;they have a greater burden of ill health in their areas&#151;the north and east Yorkshire PCTs  <br>

remain in deficit, at least partly because of the lower allocations per head in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0804297000035">Some of the costs that are directly related to rurality, such as transport costs, are not reflected in the current funding formula. North Yorkshire and York is a very big area. I can tell my hon. Friend, who is a London Member of Parliament, that from east to west is 110 miles, as far as from her constituency to Bristol, and from north to south is 90 miles, as far as from her constituency to Leicester. It is a very big area indeed. Whereas in urban areas an ambulance might travel 3, 4 or 5 miles from the ambulance station to a patient and then to a hospital, in North Yorkshire and York it might be a 50 mile trip. Given the level to which fuel prices are rising, it is easy to see why the cost of the ambulance service in North Yorkshire is rising faster than the cost in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0804297000036">It is not just the ambulance service and ambulance staff who have to travel. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will know very well from her professional background in the NHS that district nurses, health visitors and Macmillan nurses travel to see patients in their own homes. Their fuel costs will of course be higher than in urban areas but, significantly, the time they spend travelling, which may be half an hour to see a patient in a rural part of north Yorkshire, is time that has to be backfilled by additional members of staff. We have, for a population of around 1 million, four district general hospitals that are 30 or 40 miles apart. We have 10 community hospitals, which would not be needed in a less rural area. All that adds to the costs of the PCT. I hope that we can discuss the funding formula if my hon. Friend the Minister agrees to meet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0804297000037">York itself has within its boundaries some areas of severe deprivation&#151;wards that are among the 20 per cent. most deprived wards in Britain&#151;yet those areas do not receive the same level of funding per person as equally deprived areas or, indeed, less deprived areas in west and south Yorkshire. The PCT wants to use the growth money it is receiving from the Government to improve services, as they are being improved in other PCT areas in Yorkshire, and to provide additional resources for the most deprived communities in York&#151;and, indeed, in Scarborough, where there are also some very deprived wards. However, it cannot do so at the moment because the growth money is used to deal not with the service improvements that are expected by patients across the country, but in clearing the deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0804297000038">York&#146;s practice-based commissioning is very significantly improving primary and community care services in York. The PCT&#146;s strategy for clearing the deficit has depended heavily on reducing provision in hospitals and transferring some services to community and primary care settings where those services can be provided better and closer to patients. The York health group&#151;that is to say the practice-based commissioning team&#151;and the local medical committee have worked with the PCT to enable that reconfiguring of services to take place for the benefit of patients, while contributing significantly to the savings that the PCT has made in the past 18 months, which in the past year have led to its getting back into recurrent balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0804297000039">York has some very good GPs and some very good GP practices, and many of the services that Lord Darzi proposes in the new polyclinics, such as minor surgery, dermatology, audiology and some ophthalmology services,  <br>

are already provided by GPs in practices in York. It is important for the Government to recognise that the health needs of all areas of the country are not the same and that a one-size-fits-all health strategy would not be appropriate in relation to polyclinics. A polyclinic provided by an independent contractor will certainly be the right response to health needs in some places, but if our PCT ended up top-slicing the resources for GP surgeries in York in order to pay for a polyclinic, it could undermine the very services that are now provided in primary care by GPs and practice nurses that have enabled the PCT to get its budget back into balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0804297000040">I ask the Minister to ensure that there is not a quick move within York to a polyclinic, and particularly not to one provided by an independent contractor, which would disrupt the reconfiguration of services that, by means of a strong partnership between the clinicians, PCT managers and managers and clinicians at the acute trust, has done so much to improve services and reduce costs in York.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) on securing this Adjournment debate on funding for NHS services in his constituency. He has long been a champion of health services in York, and I commend him for the dedicated way in which he serves his constituents&#146; interests. I had the pleasure of working with my hon. Friend on health issues even before we came into the House, and I know of his commitment, in particular to the economics of the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0804297000042">My hon. Friend is aware that North Yorkshire and York primary care trust has faced significant financial pressure since its inception in October 2006, and by the end of that financial year it had recorded a deficit of &#163;32.1 million, the largest in the country. However, at quarter 3 of the 2007-08 financial year the trust had significantly reduced its debt and was forecasting a deficit of approximately &#163;19 million. The trust has also reached a position in which it is now operating financially within its means on a month-by-month basis. That demonstrates a sustained and concerted effort by the PCT to address its financial problems, and I congratulate all involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para27"><a name="0804297000043">That progress is to be commended, but I must point out that all PCTs have a statutory duty to live within the resources allocated to them. My hon. Friend has raised a genuine point about using some of the financial surplus which has been forecast by Yorkshire and the Humber strategic health authority for the benefit of PCTs such as North Yorkshire and York PCT, which is having to tackle a sizeable deficit. I am sure my hon. Friend will not be surprised to hear that I remain of the view that NHS organisations must live within their means, but I do not underestimate how challenging it might be for those PCTs and NHS trusts that are having to pay back large deficits that have built up over a number of years. However, the Department of Health, and consequently the NHS, must live within the agreed level of resources in each financial year. That level is set by the Treasury, and voted by Parliament.</p>

Friend, I feel I must show restraint, but I agree to discuss the issue with my ministerial colleagues and to meet my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para29"><a name="0804297000045">At quarter 3 of this year, the forecasted net surplus for the NHS as a whole represents just 2.3 per cent. of total revenue expenditure. This surplus, all of which sits within NHS organisations, creates the necessary flexibility for the NHS to respond to fluctuations in demand, activity and cost, while maintaining sufficient funds for investment in new patient care and services. The forecast surplus is in line with our overall financial strategy and, when seen within the overall context, is a small percentage of NHS resources, but I can assure my hon. Friend that the Department is continuing to work through the strategic health authorities to performance manage the 17 organisations reporting a deficit at quarter 3 of 2007-08, in order to help to bring them into recurrent financial balance as quickly as possible.</p>

This set out the measures that the PCT is taking in an effort to return to financial balance in 2008-09 and deliver a 1 per cent. surplus from 2009-10.</p>

The commissioning of high-quality resources while addressing the financial deficit can reasonably be achieved only through the equitable allocation of funds, based on need and in comparison with PCT areas. Revenue allocations are made to PCTs on the basis of a fair funding formula, which rightly directs funding to areas of greatest need. I am advised  <br>

that although the funding per head of population for North Yorkshire and York PCT is the lowest in Yorkshire and the Humber SHA, that is accurate only when one looks at the raw population data. My hon. Friend might like to raise that point at a meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para32"><a name="0804297000050">A number of factors, including difference in the age of the population and in deprivation, as well as simply the size of the population, informs the weighting of NHS funding. When one examines the weighted population figure, one finds that spending per head of population in North Yorkshire and York is average among PCTs in Yorkshire and the Humber SHA area, and therefore it is not feasible to infer that North Yorkshire and York is inadequately funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80428-0022.htm_para33"><a name="0804297000051">In 2008-09, North Yorkshire and York PCT will receive, as my hon.

That represents an above-inflation increase of 5.5 per cent., and the PCT will be 0.2 per cent. over its fair funding target in 2008-09.

I am pleased to inform him that the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation will, once again, address rural issues as part of its work programme. That piece of work will support revenue allocations to PCTs after the 2008-09 financial year, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring equitable funding for all areas.</p>

Commission quality of service rating from good in 2005-06 to excellent in 2006-07. Furthermore, I know that North Yorkshire and York PCT, like every PCT in England, is developing plans for a polyclinic in the region to improve access and better meet the needs of patients. Let me reassure my hon. Friend that the polyclinic will be funded by the Department of Health and that the PCT will not be expected to find funds from its own resources unless it chooses to commission extra services. There are no plans to close existing practices, which have often served their population well, or to force a model on to GPs, which appears to be my hon. Friend&#146;s concern.</p>

The overriding objective is that primary and community care should be organised around patients in ways that make sense to local communities and commissioners. Yorkshire and the Humber SHA advise me that North Yorkshire and York PCT scored an 86 per cent. satisfaction rate for overall GP opening hours in a patient satisfaction survey, and I hope that the development of any future clinics will help to improve those impressive results further.</p>
