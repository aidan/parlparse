 Generating capacity has an effect on prices. As my hon. Friend is aware, Ofgem has launched a welcome investigation into the electricity and gas markets.

 Factually, my hon. Friend is entirely correct. Nuclear power is responsible for producing about 40 per cent. of Scotland&#146;s electricity.

 The Minister is, of course, quite wrong. The last figures from DBERR itself show that nuclear power made up only 26 per cent. of generation and was falling as renewables rise.

 We have another review, but I remind my friend that Joel Barnett called for a review of the Barnett settlement, which gives to Scotland &#163;1,500 more in public spending per head than it does to England.

 I say to my hon. Friend that, as he is well aware, the Scottish Parliament has tax-raising powers under the Scotland Act 1998, but it has chosen not to exercise them. Members of the Scottish Parliament, in a motion that they overwhelmingly passed, accepted that proper financial accountability must be looked at in the context of the review, and we shall have to wait and see what comes out of that process. The Barnett formula has delivered stable and transparent settlements for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales for about 30 years.

As I recollect&#151;I was not party to any of the discussions&#151;in the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament elections, discussions took place between all sorts of people about the formation of a Government in Scotland.

The democratic deficit in Scotland is that, allegedly, a conversation is going on, although it is a pretty muted one, instigated by the Scottish Executive and paid for with public money, but without the authority of the Scottish Parliament.

Currently, we see a significant reduction in support for independence in Scotland, but that is no wonder, given that we have an Executive running Scotland who are more interested in powers that they do not have than in using those that they do for the people of Scotland.

The reason the service is world class is that there is a concentration of expertise at Selly Oak hospital that would be almost impossible to replicate anywhere else. I am aware of one occasion, for example, on which a soldier returning from Afghanistan required the attention of 16 trauma consultants. Only Selly Oak hospital can provide that.

 I agree with my hon. Friend that, after many years of decline, the city of Glasgow has undergone an astonishing renaissance in recent years. It is now important that economic opportunity is expanded out from the centre to all Glasgow&#146;s inhabitants. We will be able to do that only if we ensure that people have the right skills and training to be part of Glasgow&#146;s economic success. That will not happen by capping the number of available apprenticeships, which is what the SNP has done, in sharp contrast to the big expansion in apprenticeships that my right hon.

It is right that he pursues an investigation to see whether competition is working effectively in the industry. It is also true that as a result of the European emissions trading scheme windfall profits have been made by the energy companies. That is a matter on which the head of Ofgem has also commented. The energy companies have made additional money available this year to help people on low incomes pay their fuel bills, but that is a small amount in relation to what the Government are doing through the winter allowance. Our winter allowance is &#163;200 for the over-60s and &#163;300 for the over-80s. This winter, when people are experiencing high utility bills, the winter allowance that we are giving is crucial.</p>

 I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s second point. We are proposing major changes in the EU so that it is more outward looking, more global in its orientation, more flexible and less bureaucratic. On her first point, let us be absolutely clear that on every other amending treaty for the EU, the decision has been made by this House and not through a referendum. The Single European Act, Nice, Amsterdam and Maastricht were all decided on in this House. It is the Conservative party that has changed its mind, not the Labour party.</p>

 With the prison population at record levels, Prison Service managers are understandably trying to use every available place that they can find. For Members of this House with open prisons in their constituencies, there is a concern that security vetting is being relaxed because there are spare places in open prisons. Will the Prime Minister ensure that there is an investigation and will he guarantee that security vetting will not be relaxed simply because of pressure on prison places?</p>

20,000 more prison places over the past 10 years. Even this year there will be a rise in prison places from 82,000 to 85,000 and we will create 15,000 more prison places in the years to come. The reason that we are doing that is that we have brought more offences to justice. Five years ago, 1 million offences were brought to justice; now the figure is 1.4 million. That is a tribute to good policing in this country, and it is because we have been prepared to invest in the police services through our public expenditure.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80305-0003.htm_para1"><a name="08030572000167">Fireworks used in the United Kingdom are too often too noisy. We need a lower limit on their noise, and improved labelling of fireworks to go along with it. I thank the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which I am a long-time member, for its assistance with background information to the Bill. I pay tribute to my former colleague Bill Tynan for the work that he did to bring in the Fireworks Act 2003, which has benefited millions of people and millions of pets in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80305-0003.htm_para2"><a name="08030572000168">Under the 2003 Act, there is a ban on those aged under 18 buying fireworks. It introduced a curfew on the use of fireworks between 11 pm and 7 am, except on four major festivals: Diwali, Guy Fawkes night on 5 November, new year&#146;s eve and Chinese new year. Regulations made under the Act in 2004 introduced a limit of 120 dB for fireworks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80305-0003.htm_para3"><a name="08030572000169">Fireworks fall into four categories. Category 1 fireworks are suitable for use inside domestic buildings; category 2 fireworks are suitable for outdoor use in relatively confined areas; category 3 fireworks are suitable for outdoor use in large open spaces, and category 4 fireworks are incomplete or not intended for sale to the general public. Most fireworks with which the Bill is concerned, and which concern our constituents, fit into category 3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80305-0003.htm_para4"><a name="08030572000170">The 2003 Act also introduced criminal sanctions for contravention of fireworks regulations&#151;an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months&#146; imprisonment or a fine up to level 5, which is currently &#163;5,000. Unfortunately, a recent poll suggested that 60 per cent. of people in this country think that the Act and the regulations made under it are not effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80305-0003.htm_para5"><a name="08030572000171">Like many Members, I love fireworks&#151;I love the visuals of fireworks. I am not against fireworks or against their use in domestic situations, but I am against the antisocial use of fireworks, which is generally connected to their noise.</p>

fact that certain nights of the year may be difficult for astronomers. However, what my constituents write to me about is the noise of fireworks, and I suspect other Members receive similar letters from their constituents. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80305-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08030572000173">As I said, the current limit is 120 dB. To give the House some idea of what that sounds like, it would be like being 120 m from a passenger jet. A road drill is 100 dB, and 95 dB is roughly equivalent to a book being dropped 1 m on to a table. At a lower level, 70 dB is the normal sound one would hear on a television and, depending on traffic volume, between 70 and 80 dB is the background traffic noise that many of us experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80305-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08030572000174">We continue to receive letters from constituents understandably complaining about the noise of fireworks, even though most fireworks sold and used in the United Kingdom are below the current 120 dB limit. However, they still disturb humans and pets, so the Bill would lower the threshold from 120 to 95 dB in the interests of improving the lives of all of us&#151;human beings and pets. There would also be safety implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80305-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08030572000175">Secondly, the Bill would improve the labelling of fireworks. Three and a half years ago, I tabled early-day motion 1549:</p>
<a name="80305-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08030572000934"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;That this House believes that, in the interests of helping to promote good neighbourliness and animal welfare, regulations should soon be made under the Fireworks Act 2003 requiring all those selling fireworks to label them clearly specifying the decibel level produced by each firework when used.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80305-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08030572000176">I want informed choice for consumers. I am sure that many people who buy fireworks have no intention of disturbing their neighbours. However, unless we have clear labelling on the noise level to be emitted by fireworks it is difficult for people to know until they use them whether they will in fact disturb their neighbours or animals in the neighbourhood. We should lower the level allowed for fireworks used in the United Kingdom from 120 dB&#151;the current limit&#151;to 95 dB, and we should make sure that fireworks supplied for use in the UK have a clear label specifying the decibel level to be emitted by the firework.</p>

Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) pointed out, for the abolition of even more to come, the total collapsing of the third pillar of the EU, the widened scope of the European Court of Justice and the increased powers of the European Parliament&#151;an argument that the treaty is not even a significant change in the relationship of the EU to the member states can only be an exercise in intellectual nonsense and political deception.

 The right hon. Gentleman thinks that there is a fundamental difference between the documents, but my argument is that there is no fundamental difference between them. Let me complete the answer to that, and I shall come to his second point in due course.</p>

Member for Kingston and Surbiton. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman will explain later who originally came up with it. That argument concedes that the Lisbon treaty is indeed 90 per cent., or thereabouts, the same as the constitution, &#147;But,&#148; it goes on, with an air of triumph inappropriate to the facts available, &#147;a mouse is 90 per cent. genetically the same as a human being, and it is the 10 per cent. difference that really counts.&#148;</p>

Even if we bend over backwards to accommodate that view, however, by no stretch of the imagination do the changes made between the two documents turn the man-like constitution into the mouse-like treaty of Lisbon.</p>

They are nice to have, but they make no material difference to the policies, powers or procedures of the EU. The changes between the constitution and the Lisbon treaty also take one important step backwards&#151;the removal of the commitment to undistorted competition within the EU from the overriding objectives of the European treaties&#151;but the vast majority of the rest is the same.</p>

Only two things have changed: the general election of 2005 was got out of the way, and the Government decided that a referendum could not be held because they did not think that they would win it. The Prime Minister who did not have the bottle to call a general election he had prepared for is the same Prime Minister who does not have the courage or honour to hold a referendum that he has promised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80305-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08030572000286">As a result, this treaty is devoid of any democratic mandate or legitimacy, which is a rarity in the history of European treaties. The authority of the Wilson Government in the &#146;60s to pursue entry negotiations into the then European Economic Community derived from a clear commitment in their election manifesto. The mandate of the Conservative Government elected in 1970 to complete those entry negotiations was based on an explicit manifesto commitment. The Labour Government elected in 1974 said that they would hold a referendum, and they did. The Conservative manifesto in 1992 included the intention to ratify the treaty of Maastricht. However, nowhere did the Labour manifesto of 2005 say that if the constitution were defeated elsewhere in Europe, it would be brought back with a few tweaks or that a commitment to a British referendum would be abandoned.</p>

Given that the treaty brings about major changes in the way in which Britain is governed, the Government have nowhere&#151;neither in a general election nor in a referendum&#151;requested or received the authority and consent of the people. The absence of such authority damages the democratic legitimacy of the European Union in the eyes of the electorate. The unwillingness of those who favour a treaty of this kind to submit their views to the electorate contributes neither to democracy nor to the quality of argument.</p>

said that once the new EU treaty had been ratified, pro-Europeans in Britain, as he termed them, would have no more excuses in trying to combat public hostility to the EU. The implication is that, once the treaty is ratified without the voters&#146; consent, Ministers must start working on the voters in order to encourage them to favour such things. What is wrong with trying to persuade the voters of the merits of the case before ratification, rather than afterwards? What does it say about the convictions of politicians when they reserve their arguments for following quietly in the wake of decisions, rather than arguing boldly for them in advance? It tells us that their calculations are more important than their convictions. As one commentator wrote yesterday in <i> The Independent</i>:</p>

 The logic of the hon.

In our role as constituency Members of Parliament, most of us in the House&#151;I suspect that this applies to all parties&#151;visit sixth forms and local colleges, and speak about the work of Parliament and why elections matter and votes count.

 No, I am explaining my argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80305-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08030572000310">It is central to people&#146;s faith in participation, which we so strongly encourage, that Members of Parliament, once elected, do their best to be true to the broad direction and principal promises that they have made to voters. On occasion, when Members of Parliament cannot do so, there should be a compelling reason that the country as a whole can understand and, at least in part, accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80305-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08030572000311">No such argument prevails in this case. If the Committee votes down the amendments calling for a referendum, we will have to go to our schools and colleges and say that there are times when almost the entire House of Commons can be elected on a specific pledge, and yet a majority in the House can then decide to renege on it, not because it is unaffordable, not because there is an emergency and not because the voters no longer want that pledge, but simply because those in the majority calculate that it suits them in the short term and that they can probably get away with it.

All those allegations have been made in the course of these debates. The hon.

Thirdly, in respect of the consequences, the constitutional treaty was alleged by many Conservative Members to be a slipway to a superstate.

Member for Richmond, Yorks talked a great deal about the passerelles, which he said introduced a new &#147;ratchet&#148; clause. Such clauses have been around for 22 years, and have been used on one occasion. They were first introduced by the Single European Act, and have been extended in every subsequent treaty. Far from being novel or an innovation, they are an established part of the EU machinery. Contrary to what the right hon. Gentleman alleged on the radio this morning, there are new powers for nation states. Not only must every Government agree to them, but every Parliament has new rights as well. Furthermore, it is not true that the treaty extends qualified majority voting in a way that undermines the British national interest.</p>

Fifteen are purely procedural&#151;for instance, the procedures on the Comitology Committee, and the internal rules for appointing the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee. Those are not threats to the constitutional balance in this country. Twenty changes break down barriers to action in areas where that is clearly in the UK interest, from energy to development and disaster assistance.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The difference between the Lisbon treaty and the constitutional treaty is to do with that very point. The constitutional treaty would have allowed people a vote on the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, and Nice and Amsterdam. We should have had a referendum on that, because it was a genuinely constitutional treaty wrapping up all the other treaties in one document. The Lisbon treaty does not do that. A vote on Lisbon offers no vote on Rome, no vote on Maastricht and no vote on the Single European Act. It really is that simple.</p>

We Liberal Democrats believe that referendums should be used not willy-nilly, but with care and sparingly, for issues of constitutional significance. Even for issues of constitutional significance, it is not always clear to me that we need a referendum. I do not think that anyone in any party argued for a referendum when this House passed the Human Rights Act&#151;or, indeed, back in 1950, when the European convention on human rights was signed. We rarely, if at all, hear arguments that there should be a referendum on reform of the House of Lords or the Freedom of Information Act, so there are many constitutional issues on which people do not think there should be a referendum.</p>

When one looks at the really big changes proposed in the old treaty, one finds that, as has emerged from the debate, by far the biggest one was on justice and home affairs. To be specific&#151;as this debate so far has not been&#151;the proposal that the EU would have competence over cross-border police co-operation and cross-border aspects of criminal justice represents, to any fair-minded person, a big shift. It is arguable whether it is of major constitutional significance, but it was the biggest proposed transfer of power in the original treaty.</p>

went much further; indeed, they took power back from the EU. Britain gained new opt-ins on aspects of JHA in areas that the Conservatives had signed away at Maastricht. That is one of the greatest ironies of this debate. The Conservatives not only want a referendum on a document that is significantly different, but in opposing the Lisbon treaty, they oppose powers being brought back to this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80305-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08030572000525">Let us examine some of the many similarities. Both treaties sought to change &#147;ecu&#148; to &#147;euro&#148; and &#147;economic community&#148; to &#147;European Union&#148; in all the past treaties. Both treaties contain a hatful of useful reforms, from energy liberalisation to information sharing about sex offenders, from cutting the bureaucracy to strengthening accountability. Are those the reasons why any of us promised a referendum? Absolutely not. Is it contentious to co-operate on tackling terrorism more effectively? Do we need a referendum on that? Why are the Conservatives so worried about Britain being more able to influence countries in eastern Europe? Is it to clamp down on the trafficking of guns, of drugs or of people? As has been said, when the facts change and the treaties change, people should have the courage to admit that.</p>

 I would like to challenge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s use of the word &#147;modest&#148;. I think it is good that the size of the Commission will be reduced, because I want an effective Commission, but we must consider the institutional structures. There is a basic principle that at any one time every country should be represented in the Commission. Once the Commission&#146;s size is reduced that will no longer happen. That is significant, so the treaty contains big changes. Some may be good, others not so good, but the word &#147;modest&#148; does not apply.</p>

 No, I will not give way, because I want to make some progress. As the House knows, the Liberal Democrats believe that there should be a referendum on Britain&#146;s membership, because as pro-Europeans, we want to argue that case. We believe that such a referendum would enable us to get on to the front foot for the first time in a generation to argue the case for Europe. More importantly, it would enable us to set to rest people&#146;s concerns about Europe and rebuild the deep coalition for Europe. Whether on climate change or on globalisation, on beating terrorism or on tackling international crime, the arguments for the future role of Europe are as strong as the past arguments for a Europe that has helped to bring peace and prosperity, democracy and human rights to our once battered and divided continent.</p>

 No, and I shall explain why. The hon. Gentleman has a principled position on the European Union, which a fair number of his colleagues share&#151;they want to get out. The past 11 days of debate have made it clear that the new leadership in the Conservative party has not been able to move the party to the centre of British politics, where the majority of people believe that we are better off as part of the European Union. There is still a group in the Conservative party that has a stranglehold on policy on Europe, and it wants to take Britain out of the European Union. I am grateful to the hon.

In 2004, the then Prime Minister took the view that the constitutional treaty that was being developed in the European Union, with the help of some of my hon. Friends, who played a key role, was in essence a refounding of the institution. The constitutional treaty aimed to repeal all the existing treaties and replace them. The former Prime Minister believed that that was of such significance that it formed a new constitutional structure for the European Union. He came to this House and said as much on 20 April 2004, when he made his position clear about the need for the British people to vote on the constitutional treaty.</p>

To go beyond our manifesto commitment, the constitutional treaty was, of course, killed off by the votes in France and Holland at the end of May and beginning of June 2005. There was an attempt to resurrect the constitutional treaty. Some talked about returning to the French or the Dutch to try to get a positive vote in favour of the European constitutional treaty, as it then was.

 Yet again, I must disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. The promise for a referendum referred to the new constitutional treaty, and we can then discuss what people believed that it stood for and so on. However, the promise concerned the new constitutional treaty, which, as we have heard, was voted down by voters in France and Holland and an attempt to resurrect it was effectively killed off. When we took over the EU presidency in July 2005, we had a period of reflection and, to everybody&#146;s benefit, we managed to shift from the concept of a constitutional treaty to considering a measure that is far more modest in its effect&#151;the Lisbon treaty. There was a period of reflection, and the view was taken that perhaps too much power was being given to the EU and that it was far better to get consensus from nation states, which the Lisbon treaty now reflects. That was the background to the manifesto pledge, and the commitment was to a vote on the new constitutional treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80305-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08030572000574">There are many differences between what was discussed in 2004-05 and what we have as a result of the Lisbon treaty. The Foreign Secretary has taken us through some of the major differences in content. I was interested to hear the shadow Foreign Secretary on the radio this morning. It is unfortunate that he is not in his place, because he came up with the totally illogical argument that a referendum was needed not because of content but because of some great principle that there should be a vote. He failed to address the substantive differences between the constitutional treaty and the treaty of Lisbon, but he knows that they are major and significant. He is looking for an argument to escape from the difficult position he would be in if he had to compare the content of the two treaties.</p>

<p><a name="st_o368"><a name="08030572000575"><a name="80305-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="08030572001421"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart:</b>
 Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that after the rejection of the constitutional treaty by voters in France and Holland Governments produced a document that would achieve pretty much the same things? They made what they felt were sufficient changes to deny that it is fundamentally the same. Will he not accept that this treaty is intended fundamentally to do the same job as the constitutional treaty, and that changes have been made cynically to avoid giving the people a say, not only in this country but in others across Europe?</p>

<p><a name="st_o369"><a name="08030572000576"><a name="80305-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="08030572001422"><b>Mr. Byers:</b>
 No, I do not agree with that. Interestingly, there are different constitutional situations in different countries. My understanding is that nine countries planned to hold referendums on the old constitutional treaty, of which one was the United Kingdom. Because it was regarded as a constitutional matter, not just a political decision, many countries were legally obliged to do so. Because the Lisbon treaty is so different, there is no need to have referendums in most of those countries&#151;I think that Ireland is the exception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80305-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08030572000577">The view taken by the Dutch Council of State&#151;an independent body that advises the Dutch Government on the steps that they must take to ratify treaties&#151;is particularly instructive and helpful. It is a constitutional requirement that there must be a referendum on a constitutional matter, and that body advises the Dutch Government on particular measures. Its conclusion on the constitutional treaty in 2004 was that it had to be  <br>

put to a referendum, because it would change the Dutch constitution. Its conclusion on the Lisbon treaty was quite different, stating that it</p>
<a name="80305-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="08030572000987"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;provides no arguments for the gradual expansion of the EU towards a more explicit state or federation. The treaty is substantially different from the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80305-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08030572000578">So there was a significant difference in the view and recommendations of the independent Dutch Council of State.

The question what would happen if there were a referendum and the vote was no has been asked a lot. The answer to that is that the provisions of the treaty would not apply across Europe as a whole. The status quo would be maintained. I would regard that as unacceptable, but a no vote would not change the situation; it would leave the European Union where it is at present. However, if we do not have a referendum and the treaty is implemented, creating a Europe that is unacceptable, the only option for changing that situation would be renegotiation. The failure to hold a referendum now would strengthen the moral right of the British to ask for renegotiation to create and secure a more acceptable Europe. We do not have to do that aggressively&#151;I have always been someone who believes that reform rather than confrontation is the right way in Europe&#151;but the treaty will create a running sore, not just in the UK but in other parts of Europe, which can be dealt with only by renegotiation.</p>

If we cannot find partners and secure renegotiation, we have to look seriously at asking to renegotiate our status within the European Union because the European Union will have left us with no option.

It is not the case that once the constitutional treaty had been produced and examined, the Prime Minister said, &#147;This is so important that we need to have a referendum.&#148; The referendum was announced before the constitutional treaty had been produced in its final form. As was suggested earlier, that clearly indicates that the decision was taken in order to clear the air.

 Let me take a step back to what I was saying. Tony Blair, the then &#147;dear leader&#148;, made the announcement on 20 April. Why did we make the announcement then? The answer is simple and straightforward: because we wanted to park the issue out of the way in the run-up to the general election. We wanted to have the referendum after the general election, so that the forces of darkness on the other side of the Chamber would not have that weapon to beat us with during the general election. I welcomed that; I saw it as a great advantage to us, as it prevented us from giving the forces of darkness a weapon that they would have used against us. I was also strongly in favour of a referendum.</p>

I am glad to say that I have my copy of that little red book with me today. Unlike some hon. Friends on the Labour Benches, I was never a Maoist or a Trotskyist, so it is the only little red book that I have.

When the document appeared, of course the party said, &#147;This is the document on which we will have a referendum.&#148; The Prime Minister could hardly say &#147;We&#146;ll have a referendum&#148; on 20 April, and then say, once he saw the document, &#147;No, we will not have a  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80305-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08030572000636">I return to the question whether the treaty is the same document as the constitution. Much of the discussion about that is a little like the question of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. I take the view that we gave a commitment to hold a referendum only on that constitutional form. As I indicated, I believe that we made a clear commitment to have a referendum on what was produced at the end of the day.</p>

Members do, from a pervasive cynicism about politicians in general&#151;not about me, because most constituents think their own MP is okay; it is the other lot that they do not like. There is an assumption that politicians and parties cannot be trusted and that we will say anything to get elected. That is not constructive or helpful, particularly to those of us on the left, because we depend on popular support to put forward a programme that seizes some of the instruments of power and changes society in the way that we want. It is necessary for us to command popular support in a way that is not quite so necessary for others.</p>

Let us be truthful. One of the real reasons why we are not having a referendum in Britain and why the elites of Europe are not having referendums in their own countries is that they do not have confidence in the people producing the right result.</p>

Let us not forget, for example, that Portugal wanted to hold a referendum on the treaty to demonstrate how committed it was to the European ideal, but Portugal was persuaded out of that view by the French and the British, in particular, leaning on them, saying, &#147;If you do that, it would set a precedent that would cause us enormous difficulties because we can&#146;t carry our people with us in a referendum. Therefore you should not allow your people to have a vote on the question.&#148; That changes somewhat the implication that the treaty is so trivial that nobody in their right mind in Europe would want a referendum.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for at last getting on to new clause 18, which is odd&#151;perhaps the most bizarre amendment ever tabled. It would allow the Government to change the question in a referendum to almost anything. How does he suggest that the Government might change it? The new clause would allow them to ask, &#147;Is the moon made of green cheese?&#148; Secondly, it would provide for a supplementary question. What chance is there of a Government, who yesterday led their troops through the Lobby to deny the House even the possibility of discussing an in/out referendum, ordering an in/out referendum subsequent to new clause 18 being accepted?

30 years is a transfer of power from this Parliament elsewhere. They have never been given a proper opportunity to have their say, yet at the general election they were promised a referendum, precisely on this transfer of power.</p>

 I disagree with my hon. Friend; he and I have never really seen entirely eye to eye on this issue. I do not believe that this treaty represents a massive further transfer of powers, and I can only refer my hon. Friend to earlier debates in which I have taken part and got involved in those arguments. I was actively involved at the British end of the Single European Act. I discussed the British position with the then Prime Minister as we tried to move towards the single market. That was a massive transfer of power&#151;the biggest since the original European Communities Act 1972, when we openly talked about pooling our sovereignty, and stood at the election to defend that decision. The Single European Act was the context in which we went in for qualified majority voting on a grand scale, because it was in British interests to do so. That is where the passerelle provisions came in; they are a sensible way of dealing with routine matters without having to go through the whole rigmarole of having an intergovernmental conference and all the rest of it.</p>

The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West addressed this question, but effectively tried to sweep it away. The fact is that everyone across western Europe is absolutely fed up with the tedious process of carrying through reform of institutions, which it was previously thought would be pretty routine and agreed by most people, after the enlargement of the Union. If 26 other countries succeed in ratifying the treaty&#151;that means the Irish succeeding with their referendum&#151;and then the British come along and say, &#147;Sadly, although we, the Government, agree with ratification, and Parliament agrees with it by two to one, we&#146;ve just got a no vote at the demand of <i> The Sun </i>newspaper.

There are provisions in the new treaty allowing members who want to leave to do so. We could start a negotiation on the basis of an association agreement. It takes a long time to secure such agreements, but Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein have managed to achieve them, and we could do the same if that is where we wish to be. But if there were a no vote, our role in the European Union would be finished and the House would be left with the consequences. The majority of us would not agree with the position we were in. It would be quite a decisive moment for our foreign affairs policy and our role in the world.</p>

It turned the European Community into the European Union. It was much more far-reaching than the Lisbon treaty. Did the 1992 Conservative manifesto promise a referendum on the Maastricht treaty?

 The right hon. Vulcan&#151;er, Gentleman&#151;may try to wriggle out of the position that he took as a member of the Conservative Cabinet and the fact that he voted against a referendum on Maastricht, but nobody will be impressed. He said one thing as a member of the Government, to keep hold of his red box, his car and ministerial salary, but now, totally irresponsibly, he is ready to switch his position. In the 19th century, a former Conservative Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, described the Conservatives as an organised hypocrisy. The only difference between then and the 21st century is that the Conservatives are no longer organised.</p>

<p><a name="st_o482"><a name="08030572000773"><a name="80305-0017.htm_spnew4"><a name="08030572001535"><b>Mr. Duncan Smith:</b>
 I enjoy following the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman). We have agreed on some things; we do not always agree on everything. First, let me state my position, as he did not read my name out from his list. I voted for the referendum on Maastricht. I voted against a lot during that period, but for a referendum, and here I am, still on the Back Benches, which shows what follows all that rebellion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80305-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08030572000774">I wanted to keep my remarks short, as I know that others wish to speak, but those who believe me when I say that will be mad, because I am a politician and will therefore go on a little bit. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) was right. At the Dispatch Box as Leader of the Opposition&#151;wonderful days&#151;I questioned the then Prime Minister about the issue with no effect, and I asked him for a referendum eight times. Eight times in a row he told me categorically that no such thing was necessary because what was about to happen was not consequential and&#151;what was the phrase used by the Foreign Secretary?&#151;not fundamental. Nothing was so important that it changed our relationship, and so there was no need for a referendum. It was not until after I had gone, sadly, that he gave the pleasure to my successor of agreeing to a referendum. I thought that was a bit mean at the time, because things might have been different&#151;who knows? Never mind; I do not want to go back there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80305-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08030572000775">That is the main point. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right: we can only reach one simple conclusion. I know that there is a huge debate running and rolling, which is full of history and memory. I love these European debates, because we have a sort of private conversation with each other about what we did 10 years ago, what our antecedents did 100 years ago and what we might be doing in 10 years&#146; time. However, he was right to say that the truth was that the then Prime Minister, with some trusted and confidential friends, made a decision. As they rolled towards an election, they decided that they would not survive it unless they answered the question about the referendum, which the Conservative party claimed was the way to settle the issues about the constitutional treaty. That was very simple.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman recall the Conservative party asking for a referendum on the Nice treaty before the 2001 election? We made no promise of a referendum, and we still won that election.</p>

 Come on! I must tell the hon. Gentleman, who intervenes quite a lot, that the politics of the situation dictates what happens at the time. In the time running up to Nice, his Government were not in trouble or difficulty and were able to envisage the coming election with some sanguine sense of success. Things were different by the time they hit 2004 and 2005. The reality was that the decision was taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80305-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08030572000779">The intriguing thing, which really bothers me, is that as I watched and listened to the Foreign Secretary, it occurred to me that I had never seen somebody speak for a Government who has looked so contorted and so twisted, and who has so turned in one argument against another. At one moment, his point was only that it was fundamental, but then it was not fundamental; then we were clearing the air, but then we were not because we were clearing fundamentals instead. The argument went round and round. If he reads it in <i> Hansard </i>tomorrow, he will say to himself, &#147;What an awful day I had. I had to say something that I know is fundamentally not true. There is no major difference between the Lisbon treaty and the constitutional treaty. What happened in between was a political imperative.&#148;</p>

European leaders. The letter shows that they needed to find a way to avoid any reference to the public, such as a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80305-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08030572000792">The first point about which we should be clear is that the process is a classic, cynical political mechanism. If we believe that, we shall not go far wrong. I do not want to engage in the arguments about whether there were three or 38 things in the treaty&#151;or, as the Liberal Democrats said on television today, that there are so many thousand words versus another so many thousand. It is all meaningless nonsense. The truth is that everybody believes the treaty is basically the same as the constitution. The collapse of the pillars and the nature of the debate are critical, so there is clearly some cynicism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80305-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08030572000793">There is another reason for a referendum. People talk about the principle that the House should decide, but the truth is that the principle has become a bit of a joke. What do we really think we decide on in this place that the Government have not already told us we must decide? When did the House last manage to insert an amendment at any stage of a European treaty that reflected the will of the public or the House? It has not happened. We know about the wonderful whipping system on both sides of the House&#151;I do not blame the Labour Government for that; I had to defy it myself in my day. The whipping system guarantees that, to a greater or lesser extent, the Government have their way and their business.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that in a referendum, which is itself authorised by&#151;if I may say it&#151;the humility of Members of Parliament who realise that they must hand the decision back to the people because it is so important, the people would be presented with a neutral question that cannot be whipped, so we would have genuine public opinion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80305-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08030572000796">The problem is that there is a conflict. I have enormous respect for my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, as they know. They have constantly and rightly made the argument about the principles of the House and we have debated them many times, yet they may offer a basis for a referendum. Both have complained&#151;rightly&#151;about the way in which the Bill has been railroaded through the House. Debate has been curtailed in the appalling nature of the Second Reading debate instead of the line-by-line discussion we were promised. As I said the other night, who would ever have thought that when the Prime Minister said line by line he actually meant only the top two lines of the treaty with no discussion of the rest. There has been next to no debate, so the argument that should stand&#151;that the House is supreme so it should make the decisions&#151;falls in this case, because we have had no opportunity to make any mark on the treaty or to debate it properly. That process shames the Government, but it leaves us with one question. If we are unable to make the debate work, if we cannot question the Government properly and have no real opportunities to discuss the amendments, the only option open to us is to go to the country, because our process is not working.</p>

 I respect my right hon. Friend&#146;s views on the matter, but if we took that line we should have to put almost everything that comes to the House to the people. The Government have destroyed the ability of the House to negotiate and discuss all issues. That is the fault of the Government and I can but hope that our Front-Bench colleagues will commit our party to pushing back all that so-called modernisation.

 My right hon.

That will be it. We shall not have another chance. At least we have a chance to revisit domestic legislation and change it, but we get only one shot at European treaties until the next time around. As custodians of sovereignty, we need to refer back to the public if we are letting some of it go. It is as simple as that.</p>

But&#151;there is always a good &#147;but&#148; in politics&#151;the issue is not just about time; it is about quality of time. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Labour Members should hear me out, because many of them have not been in the Chamber during debates on the Bill. The point is that a mechanism was used to curtail debate in the time allocated. That mechanism provided for Second Reading debates, and not line-by-line scrutiny. The quality of the process has been appalling, because we have allowed ourselves to be sucked into holding generalised discussions, debates and arguments. Only on a few occasions have we been able to get to the substance.</p>

The reason why ever more people, including my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), are changing their minds and agreeing that there should be another referendum is that there has been no popular consent for the arrangements that have developed over the years, as represented in the new treaty.</p>

 I agree. In the referendum that my hon. Friend mentions, I voted to go into the EEC. I do not resile from that; I was right to vote for what I did. I voted to go into a marketplace, and to share certain functions to create that marketplace, but we have gone a lot further than that. The problem is that there is dishonesty in saying, &#147;You all knew about this when you first joined. You all knew, for example, about the supremacy of European law.&#148; That is nonsense. People who say that know very well that they did not think about that issue when they voted on whether to join. That is the real reason why it is time to have a referendum on the treaty: it will allow us to tease out the fact that if we keep going down the road that we are taking, without making any change, things will go wrong.</p>

 Earlier, the right hon. Gentleman seemed to be saying that he would like the opportunity to amend the treaty. It has never been the practice of the House to amend treaties, particularly multilateral treaties. One has to accept or reject them, and there is no possibility of amendment. He says that the matter is final, but that is to disregard an important provision that I thought that he, and many of his more Eurosceptic colleagues, would welcome. For the first time in any European treaty, article 49A introduces the possibility of secession. It is possible for the House to avail itself of that provision, and to secede from the European Union, at any time. In that sense, the move is clearly not final.</p>

I am not sure what he is saying; is he saying that the EU could have held on to us?

 The treaty before us is the end product of a long process of renegotiation and failed reform set in train by the Laeken declaration of 2001. We have ended up with a treaty that, instead of reforming Europe, has consolidated more powers at the top. Why does the hon Lady think that her constituents and mine should be denied an opinion on whether they agree with that reform process and the treaty that has come out of it?</p>

 I do not accept that the treaty is all bad and does not reform; there are some very good things in it. I believe that the number of EU Commissioners should be reduced, and I am pleased that that is happening. I am also interested that the treaty provides a mechanism for member states that wish to change their relationship with the European Union or withdraw from it; it means that they will be able to do so in a negotiated fashion. That has not existed before, and I would have thought that any Eurosceptic would welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80305-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08030572000842">I shall try to move on. The European Union now represents 27 countries with a combined population of more than 490 million people. Its institutions and working practices are hopelessly out of date and failure to reform them will continue to constrain their ability to function anywhere near as effectively as they should. I am sure that few people, in the House or outside it, would disagree that widespread reform is essential.</p>

It is difficult to see how an organisation that seeks to manage much of the economic, social and political affairs of 27 diverse nations&#151;each of them answerable to their domestic voters with all their problems, aspirations and political agendas&#151;could aspire to do anything else. However, I believe that a number of measures in the treaty will help. The Lisbon treaty offers significant improvements over the current arrangements, and that is why I am supporting it.</p>

Throughout the period in question, no mainstream political party advocated withdrawal from the EU, and I suspect that that will still be the case at the next general election. That state of affairs has left the British people with no realistic option other than to accept that membership of the EU, whatever its faults, is synonymous with UK citizenship. I do not believe for a minute that those who voted to join the EU in 1975 believed that they were making an irreversible commitment. It is high time that the question of our continuing membership of the EU was put before the British people, not as a simple yes/no question, but as a choice between clear alternatives.</p>

It is more likely that withdrawal from the EU would curb the ability of those who engage in such despicable practices to enter our country in the first place.

We should not rush into anything, and we should carry out that process in an organised fashion. That is what the people of this country really want. They want a serious public debate on Europe, and at the end of that debate, they will want some options.

 Towards the end of her speech, the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) was in danger not only of being out of order, but of putting across her preferred European dimension. The trouble is that there are 60 million people in Britain, and in practice, one cannot proceed to determine our relationship with the European Union in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80305-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08030572000854">I have been following the most recent process closely. Indeed, I read the draft constitution before the French people rejected it. Personally, I thought that the contents were valuable, and I am glad to say that many of the most valuable parts are in the treaty of Lisbon, which is why I am happy to support that, too. Nevertheless, the constitution was an attempt to create a watershed moment in the European Union, which made it completely different in character from all the amending treaties that had gone before&#151;from the founding treaty, the treaty of Rome, through all the others that have been mentioned, right up to the treaty of Lisbon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80305-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08030572000855">That is why, as somebody who is not an enthusiast for referendums and who believes that many of the reservations that have been expressed today are valid, I nevertheless felt that a constitution that swept up more than 50 years of European Union history, from the founding treaty to the most recent amending treaty, was an appropriate moment to redefine the relationship and give people the chance, which they have not had for more than 30 years, to determine whether the new, reformed, relaunched European Union&#151;that was the intention&#151;was where we wanted to go. That is why I was happy to support my party&#146;s commitment at the last election to hold a referendum on a constitutional treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80305-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08030572000856">However, at the very moment that we were committing ourselves to that, the French and the Dutch were deciding that no such constitutional treaty was likely to exist. I do not wish to repeat the arguments, which have already been rehearsed today, about the processes by which we moved from there to where we are now. What is a matter of concern, however, is that the process that we are using is far less transparent and consultative than it could and should be. One of the things that I particularly welcome about the treaty of Lisbon is that it gives national Parliaments a more clearly articulated role in that process. In the future&#151;I hope that this will be in the long term, before we get to the next reforming treaty&#151;the process may well involve the 27 national Parliaments.</p>

That would be a domestic problem, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe has articulated.

 It is interesting to note that the hon. Gentleman is willing to listen to the people of Estonia, but not to the people of Britain. Leaving that aside, however, will he clarify his earlier comment that if the House were to grant a referendum and the British people were to vote against ratification of the Lisbon treaty, it would in some way compromise our membership of the European Union? That did not happen when the French and Dutch refused to ratify the constitutional convention: they are still members of the EU and no one called that into question, so why does the hon. Gentleman think that it would be any different for Britain?</p>

 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman travels at all in Europe or talks to our political colleagues&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, we need to bear in mind that our Conservatives do not have any! Those of us who talk to mainstream political groups in pretty well every country in Europe could tell the hon. Gentleman quite categorically that the process by which the constitution was abandoned was painful enough. The follow-up process whereby 27 countries sought to reach agreement by delivering the Lisbon treaty and its many constructive and practical measures&#151;the British Government, along with the German Government, played a constructive role&#151;was also hugely difficult. If the hon. Gentleman believes that it would be willingly acceded to if the UK Government stood up and said, &#147;Sorry, guys, I know that 26 of you are already going to adopt this treaty, carry it forward and start working with it, but we are not, as we want another couple of years to rethink the whole thing,&#148; I have to tell him that he is living in cloud cuckoo land. The truth is that we do not know what the consequences of a no vote in a referendum would be, but it would certainly not be in the interests of the United Kingdom, of our reputation or of our influence within the European Union.</p>

 Not knowing the consequences has not stopped the hon. Gentleman from asserting them very vigorously&#151;and, in my view, inaccurately. Amendment No. 296 provides for an enabling power to have another referendum, so would that not satisfy the Liberal desire to have their in/out referendum?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman had been in his place earlier, he would have heard my hon.

He said clearly and specifically as a pro-European that in his view there is no difference between the constitution and the treaty. He happens to be my constituent when he is in London, so I do not want to disagree with him when he says something like that. For me, he has summed the whole thing up.</p>

No matter what is said here today, no matter how many fine words are uttered and no matter how great the detail, the vast majority of the public know that what we are voting for in the treaty is exactly the same, and has the same intent, as the constitution on which the Prime Minister promised a referendum&#151;a promise that was included in our manifesto.</p>

I hope that some of my colleagues have been influenced by the many good speeches today in favour of a referendum, but the matter is not over yet, because if we do not secure a vote tonight, it will go to the House of Lords. Do we really want to run the risk of the unelected House of Lords sending back measures that we have refused to agree to because we, as elected politicians, do not want to go along with our manifesto commitments? That would be ridiculous, and it would show what a farce the whole situation has become.</p>

Of course, a great many people have made representations to me, and I hope that each of them believes that they received a substantive response to their points.

old constitution, so for me this matters rather less than it might do to most. One can quote Val&#233;ry Giscard d&#146;Estaing till the cows come home, but the fact is that if one approved the old constitution, one will say that it is pretty well the same thing; if one did not, one will claim that it is something different.

Of course I accept that there are occasions when a once-in-a-lifetime issue arises that we ought to refer to the country at large, but if one looks at the history of referendums, one finds that they are usually used to override democratic scrutiny and debate. That is the 19th-century history of referendums. They often seek a simplistic response to an often simplistic question, in which the consequences of the answer are never explored, and they usually take the form of a surrogate verdict on the Government themselves. The question and the answer are sometimes widely removed from each other.</p>

 It is certainly true that a strong body of the press articulates vitriolic hostility to the European Union and to this treaty, and such comment is not always as informed as it might be. The comfort that I find is that I wonder how many people buy the red tops for the political comment, rather than for the coverage of media personalities, the world of sport and footballers&#146; wives. That is quite legitimate, and occasionally all of us enjoy a surreptitious glance to relieve some of the rigours&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I invite colleagues in Portcullis House to look in the corner room where the newspapers are stacked and observe how rapidly they disappear through the course of the day.

My party is devoting a huge amount of energy to looking at how we might redress the balance in the way in which our democratic processes work in the Westminster village. That is a far more urgent task than dealing with some of the fears that we are expressing at the moment.</p>

 I shall try to be brief. I put a message to all Europhobes on my website, saying that I intended  to vote for the Lisbon treaty. I did so because I wanted to provoke a reaction from my constituents. Many words have been spoken about the great interest in the subject outside the House, but I have had only one e-mail and one letter from my constituents&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am waiting for more to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80305-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08030581000010">The e-mail said that the treaty was &#147;introducing communism by stealth&#148; into this country, and the letter said that because of my views, I deserved a long, lingering and painful death. That indicates the level of interest of some people. However, I have had letters from non-constituents, both before I put the message on my website and subsequently. They spoke of the German plot to take over Europe, the Pope and many other examples of the fantasies that some obsessives have about the European Union.</p>

We need to be honest about this treaty and about the basis of the debate that we are having. I will be honest: I have always opposed referendums. I was extremely disappointed and shocked in 2004 when our party leader bounced the party into that position. I cast no aspersions on the reasons for that move. I simply believe that it was a mistake then and has had some very serious and unfortunate consequences for the political debate. It has meant that there has been no open public debate on these European issues. For two years after the rejection of the constitutional treaty in France and the Netherlands, we did not really have a proper debate and discussion during the period of reflection.</p>

Indeed, some of the earlier debate in Committee today reflected that. The media are not interested in the detail of why the Lisbon treaty is in Britain&#146;s interests and how it will reform the European Union to ensure a more efficient and effective way of working after enlargement to 27 countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80305-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08030581000013">I do not wish to repeat the arguments, and I also referred to the issues in the debate on the foreign policy aspects of the treaty and on Second Reading. However, it is not helpful to have a statement from the shadow Foreign Secretary that the Foreign Affairs Committee said that the Lisbon treaty was exactly the same as the constitutional treaty. That is not what it said, and I tried to intervene again, but the right hon. Gentleman would not take the intervention. I wish to place it on the record that the Committee did not say that. It pointed out that the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs had been replaced with a high representative for foreign and security policy. It also pointed out that there were two UK-inspired but non-legally binding declarations on common foreign and security policy in the text, neither of which were in the constitution. It is therefore not true to say that the treaty is exactly the same.</p>

Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne). As has been mentioned, there are the UK Government&#146;s red lines, which mean that the treaty is different for the UK than it is for the other 26 member states&#151;or the other 25, because Poland has some association with the UK on some issues.

 I want to conclude. The debate in our media has not helped to clarify the issues or people&#146;s understanding of them.

 And behind closed doors. We cross-examined the then Foreign Secretary, who made it clear that she knew nothing about what was going on, officially. However, we know that the sherpas in UKRep, COREPER and so on were convened and carrying on negotiations behind the scenes. The questionnaire to which my right hon. Friend referred illustrates that point clearly. That is one fundamental constitutional change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08030581000031">The second fundamental constitutional change is the obligation on national Parliaments, which we have discussed in previous debates. Other changes are the merger of the existing treaties into a Union with a legal personality, and the collapse of the pillars. The intergovernmental method is being done away with on certain matters in favour of the Community method, thereby vastly increasing the powers of the European Court of Justice. That is another fundamental change in the constitutional relationship between the UK and the EU. We are giving enormous additional power to the ECJ. The accumulation of the new constitutional powers and the reciting of the primacy of law in declaration 17 mean that, for the first time, we have reinforced case law within the framework of a treaty.

I am not talking about specific powers, which are bad enough in themselves&#151;for instance, the charter of fundamental rights was another constitutional change of the first order. I am saying, in essence, that changing the division of competences moves powers between the UK and the EU. I am clear about that, as are all other constitutional authorities. Even the Foreign Secretary admitted that there would be constitutional changes, some of which I do not like. They are predicated on the assumption that the EU will rather arrogantly say that it will be good enough to give us new powers in relation to the national Parliaments. Well, thank you very much, but we are a national Parliament that has been going for quite a long time.

 I am dealing with the constitutional implications of what the Foreign Secretary said. It is clear that in a range of matters in the construction of the treaty there is constitutional change of the first order between us and the EU. That is why a referendum is required. The Foreign Secretary used those criteria for a referendum in his argument. He said that if there were a structural change there ought to be a referendum, and, with respect Mrs. Heal, I am indicating that structural change is exactly what is happening in the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08030581000035">Part of the issue relates to why we should want a referendum. It is because the House should have the humility to decide that we want to give the decision back to the voters. Furthermore, as I said in an intervention on a Liberal Democrat Member yesterday, there would be no point in staying in if we did not have the right to legislate in line with the wishes of the voters of the UK as expressed in general elections. That is the basis of our legislative process. We give effect to the wishes of voters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08030581000036">The plain fact is that unless we reassert the supremacy of our Parliament, as set out in my new clause 9, on which I expect us to be able to vote later, we would not be able to maintain our position in the EU. We must have a provision stating that notwithstanding the European Communities Act 1972, we will continue to legislate on behalf of the voters of the UK and that the courts must give effect to the provision in any later Act even if it is inconsistent with the provisions of European legislation. That is not withdrawal. Case law is clear: such a measure would not repeal all the treaties; it is about particular provisions. My party agreed on amendments to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, which was pushed through both Houses, and we should do so again today.</p>

Let us imagine the Leader of the Opposition becoming Prime Minister and going to his first European Council, having chosen not to let the matter rest there.

Oh, and I apologise to you, Mr. Rodriguez Zapatero, Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel, for not co-operating with your political parties or your Governments over the past few years, but it would be nice if you signed up to a different form of treaty.&#148; That would not happen.

 I shall follow your advice, Mrs. Heal. Let me turn to the Liberal Democrat position on referendums and on whether we should have one. It is time that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) came out. It is not that difficult in the end. It may mean being condemned by the <i> Daily Mail</i> and <i> The Sun</i>, but the truth is that it is fine to be a genuine pro-European. It is time that he and the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson), who is not in the Chamber, owned up to the fact that they are pro-Europeans. The Liberal Democrats cannot hide that fact from the electorate. They cannot pretend that they really want a referendum, but that the wording is not right. They should put their heads above the parapet and own up to being the most pro-European party in the House, and to the fact that they would have signed up to whatever Europe had thrown forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08030581000049">The truth is that this is a proxy debate. It is not really about referendums. It is about whether people want to be securely and firmly in the European Union, because they believe that in an uncertain world it is important to have stronger international institutions, or whether they believe that Britain can go it alone. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Stone, who has moved but who, I am glad to say, is still in the Chamber. I believe that there will not be a fundamental change. We will still set our own taxes, and have our own Army and Navy, and our own foreign and defence policy. There will not be a substantial change, which is why there should not be a referendum.</p>

 It is normally a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), but whereas all other Members who have spoken have recognised that the debate raises issues of principle that transcend and divide party, he chose to make a purely partisan speech, and made little contribution as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08030581000051">Twenty-five years ago, I was elected to the House&#151;as was the Prime Minister, as it happens. Unlike the Prime Minister, who was elected on a pledge to leave the European Community, I have always believed, and still believe, in remaining a member of the European Community.

They may be more significant or less significant than previous treaties, but every party in the House made a promise that their electors would have a vote in a referendum on that constitutional treaty, and the treaty of Lisbon endorses and implements the substance of that constitution.</p>

 I will go straight to one of the arguments used by those who try to cover over the change of heart that they have had since before the election&#151;that it should be a matter for Parliament that there has been a significant change.

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08030581000064">The first argument that supporters of the change of heart deploy is that the Lisbon treaty is less important than previous treaties. The only question that faces those who made a promise about the constitution is how the treaty compares with it&#151;not with Maastricht or any other reforming treaty, but with the one on which they promised their constituents a vote. The European Scrutiny Committee has said that the treaty is substantially the same as the constitution. We know that almost all the leaders in Europe who are free to do so have said that the documents are the same. No Minister has explained to us why the Spanish Prime Minister, the author of the constitution, Giscard d&#146;Estaing, the Belgian Foreign Minister, the Italian Prime Minister and countless other leading lights should say things that are untrue. Why would they say that the two documents are fundamentally the same if they are fundamentally different? Ministers have not even addressed the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08030581000065">The second argument is that no countries on the continent have held referendums on the Lisbon treaty. Of course they have not. Those that were required to hold referendums did so on the constitutional treaty. If they got a yes vote, they decided that they did not need another referendum on a document that is substantially the same. If they got a no vote, they decided not to get another biff in the face, and to pretend that the Lisbon treaty is different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08030581000066">The third argument is that all the Governments of Europe signed up to the statement that the constitutional concept had been abandoned. I have before me the words of the statement that was issued after the Council meeting. It does, indeed, state that the constitutional concept was abandoned, but it continued, in the same sentence and the next, that, instead of</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80305-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08030581000068">The fourth argument is obscure&#151;indeed, it is designed to be obscure. As Samuel Johnson said, if you want to escape from a difficult hole, emulate the squid and squirt black ink in their faces while making your getaway. Supporters of the change of heart have adopted the argument that the constitutional treaty involved repealing all the existing treaties whereas the Lisbon treaty does not. They fail to say that the constitutional treaty abolished existing treaties but reintroduced all their powers in its text.</p>

The first is to amend, in detail, all the existing laws until they are brought into the relevant form and adjusted and amended until they equal a final text; the second is to repeal all the existing laws and treaties and replace them with a new text incorporating those laws and any changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80305-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08030581000070">When we do that in this House&#151;in respect, for example, of accumulated finance Bills&#151;we normally call it a consolidation Bill. We consider it less, not more, important; we devote less time to it because it does not change any laws, but simply brings them all together. Essentially, what the European constitution did was to bring all the existing treaties together to make one document. If there is any doubt about the differences between those different routes, the Government have allayed them&#151;they have published not only the Lisbon treaty, but the consolidated treaties that result from the Lisbon treaty. We know the final text that we have reached through the process of detailed amendment, and I have to report that it is almost identical to the consolidated text of the original European constitutional treaty. There is precious little difference, and the Government are adopting mere persiflage with their argument.</p>

With a great flourish, the Foreign Secretary ended by saying that we should do what electors pay us to do. Well, after the last election, they sent us to fulfil our promises. All of us, except those who had dissociated themselves from the manifesto promise, were sent here to implement the promise to have a referendum on this treaty. If we do not do so, we are not doing what the electors pay us to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80305-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08030581000073">Finally, people say that the treaty is only a modest step and is no bigger than previous treaties. However, each step brings us nearer to a final point. If someone is on their way to Beachy Head, the first few miles do not matter, but the last few steps near the edge matter a great deal. I shall cite Hegel and Marx, authorities who may have more force on the Government Benches. They said that beyond a certain point, quantitative changes result in a qualitative change. Beyond a certain point, accumulative slices of the cake through successive treaties bring about a substantive, qualitative change. Over a period, if we keep on allowing without any check such transfers of power from us to the European institutions, we will cease to be a nation delegating powers to ancillary bodies and ourselves become an ancillary body allowed only to exercise such powers as a nation called Europe allows us to.</p>

That was probably the case for many who should have advised the former Prime Minister that he was making a major error when he felt that he had to call a referendum because of parliamentary considerations. I do not think that the question of a referendum was relevant to this treaty. Why did that happen? Was it a rush of blood to the head? I would say that it was probably a rush of fear in the focus groups, which seemed to have more influence on Government policies in the run-up to the election than the party&#146;s wishes on the matter.</p>

They have brought back something different from the original treaty for a constitution. That is the reality; this treaty is significantly different. There would have been a European Foreign Secretary, a president of Europe and a constitution. It was a treaty for a constitution. Aided and abetted by the Dutch and French voters, who rejected it, there was a panic, and then a two-year period of reflection.

 The Conservatives are judged by their words. The hon. Gentleman cannot identify a specific proposal in the Lisbon treaty that makes it more significant than the Maastricht treaty. He is a supporter and member of the Better Off Out campaign. He has the honesty of holding that view and commitment, and that is a growing trend among Back Benchers in the Conservative party, which continues to gallop ever closer towards Eurosceptic isolationism. The Conservatives also refuse to acknowledge the consequences of their isolationism, which has captured most&#151;although, of course, not all&#151;of today&#146;s Conservative party. No previous Conservative Government ever offered a referendum on a European amending treaty. No conservative Government anywhere in the European Union are even considering holding a referendum on this treaty. No conservative Opposition in any country of the European Union are demanding a referendum as our Conservative Opposition are doing.</p>

It is clear that his once influential party&#151;which was the party of Europe for 30 years, in a tradition set by Macmillan and Heath&#151;has, in the main, been reduced to an isolationist, anti-European rabble. That is a policy set and dictated by the hon. Member for Stone. It represents a victory of ideology over national interest, and this Parliament should not give such a policy its consent this evening.</p>

 This has been a debate about broken promises. First, the Government promised a referendum. Then, in lieu of a referendum, they promised the House of Commons 20 days of detailed parliamentary debate. Then they broke that promise, and allocated only 14 days&#151;less than half the number given to debate the treaty of Maastricht. Then  <br>

they broke that promise. They told us that we would give the Bill line-by-line scrutiny, but they so manipulated the debate that the detailed scrutiny of the amendments was left until the end of the day, and large groups of amendments were not debated at all, including critical amendments on borders, visas, immigration, asylum, defence, social policy and the free movement of workers. None of those provisions was subjected to line-by-line scrutiny at all, yet such scrutiny was the Government&#146;s main excuse for not granting a referendum in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80305-0023.htm_para0"><a name="08030581000123">I turn first to the Foreign Secretary&#146;s speech. At the risk of being ungallant to him, I must say that he did not have a very good day. First, he tried to argue that the Government had originally promised a referendum on the EU constitution because it represented fundamental changes to our relationship with the European Union. Then, when he was pressed further, the right hon. Gentleman said that it did not represent a fundamental change in our relationship with the EU. Taking interventions from all sides, he completely dropped the ball when he said that the reason why the Government promised a referendum in the first place was that they needed to &#147;clear the air&#148;. Well, if we needed to clear the air then, why do we not clear the air now and give the people of this country the referendum that they were promised? If that is the only argument that the Foreign Secretary can put to the House, I look forward to the rapid promotion of the Minister for Europe.</p>

They have no mandate for an in/out referendum in their 2005 manifesto, which promised a referendum on the EU constitution and gave no promise on an in/out referendum. They are arguing a case to paper over the cracks in their policies without any endorsement from the people who sent them to this House of Commons. That is the mess that they find themselves in. My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) made the point about the missing cojones&#151;and I have to say that, at the end of this debate, they have still not been discovered. The Government lost a pair of discs; the Liberal Democrats lost a pair of something else&#151;and they have not yet been found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80305-0023.htm_para2"><a name="08030581000125">Tonight we are taking an important decision for our country, so what are the Liberal Democrats going to do?

They are going to go and hide in the toilets because they do not have the guts to vote on the question either one way or the other! And it is the Liberal Democrats who promise us a new politics, a politics of change. If that is all they have to offer, they should go back to the starting board and start again.</p>

 Last week, Plymouth was awash with rumours that our naval base was to close within five years, that our dockyard was in danger, and that the Royal Navy was being run down and let down. Some found this bizarre and bemusing, but others were worried, and, for those who were worried, I was angry because it was all so unnecessary. I was even more concerned to hear of one person, who was set to move their home from up north to Devonport, bringing with them valuable skills, who was nearly put off doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para7"><a name="08030581002310">I want to start by looking at the role of the Royal Navy in the 21st century, and at the threats that it is being configured to face. Understanding those factors is crucial to understanding the future for Devonport. Opportunities, as well as challenges, arise from the revolution in British military capabilities and, as ever, there will be a central role for the Royal Navy, which our city has such a proud record in supporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para8"><a name="08030581002311">In the cold war, the Navy existed principally to counter the threat of Soviet submarines in the Greenland-Faroes-Iceland gap. It does not take a strategic genius to realise that that threat has pretty much gone. There might be concerns about Russia, but they are now of a very different character and scale. The cold war gave rise to the need for large numbers of anti-submarine frigates, small aircraft carriers carrying anti-submarine helicopters, and deep-water minesweepers optimised for the cold north Atlantic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para9"><a name="08030581002312">The threats of today and tomorrow arise from international terrorism and from rogue or failing states. These in turn are intertwined with a series of other issues, such as the rise of piracy, the trafficking of drugs and people, and humanitarian disasters. It is perhaps more difficult to articulate the threat now than it was during the cold war or in the first half of the 20th century. Indeed, the uncertainty that now exists in the world is in many ways the danger itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para10"><a name="08030581002313">Today, the deployment of our armed services most often takes place in coalition alongside the US and others. Forty other countries are involved in the NATO international security assistance force mission in Afghanistan, and more than 20 are involved in Iraq. As the years go by, a European coalition might become an increasingly likely basis for deploying a joint capability. It is against that background that the announcement about the 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers needs to be viewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para11"><a name="08030581002314">Britain is one of a handful of NATO countries that has largely got to grips with making changes to ensure that our armed forces, and their equipment, are relevant to the challenges that we face today and the threats that we may face tomorrow, and that they are interoperable with those of key allies. For the Royal Navy, that has meant a transformation from a cold war force to a versatile, multifaceted fleet with a range of capabilities. Out have gone the large numbers of escorts optimised for anti-submarine warfare, and in their place have come larger aircraft carriers, new amphibious ships, better kit for the Royal Marines&#151;as  <br>

well as more Royal Marines&#151;a new generation of nuclear submarines, and the maritime airborne surveillance and control aircraft, which will provide general situational awareness and be able to control the carriers&#146; aircraft. There will also be a fleet of more flexible and agile vessels, in the shape of the future surface combatant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para12"><a name="08030581002315">Today&#146;s Navy is making a significant contribution to the present conflicts, in the form of landing forces, artillery bombardment in support of ground forces, the minesweepers that clear Iraqi ports, and naval auxiliaries delivering humanitarian supplies, to name but a few. Even in landlocked Afghanistan, huge numbers of naval personnel&#151;including reservists&#151;are involved. The Royal Navy is unique among the three services in operating not only at sea, but on the land and in the air. Many people outside communities such as Plymouth fail to realise that the Royal Marines, who have been fighting with such intensity in Afghanistan and Iraq are, in fact, part of the Navy. Likewise, many of the aircraft so vital to operations in those countries are naval aircraft flown by naval pilots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para13"><a name="08030581002316">This country needs a strong Royal Navy as much now as it ever has. In no way is it being sidelined, but it must be tailored to the needs of today and tomorrow. We need large carriers that can deploy significant numbers of aircraft anywhere in the world they are needed, so as to avoid relying on foreign airfields and the diplomatic implications and restrictions that that can bring. We need submarines armed with missiles that can strike deep inland with pinpoint accuracy, that can gather intelligence, or that can land special forces. That is why the Government have equipped all our fleet submarines with Tomahawk and are building a new generation of Astute class submarines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para14"><a name="08030581002317">We need amphibious ships that can carry troops and their equipment and that can deploy them ashore by landing craft, by helicopter or directly onside&#151;or, conversely, evacuate British nationals or foreign civilians from harm&#146;s way, as we saw happening two summers ago in Lebanon. The helicopter carriers, assault ships and landing ships represent a complete modernisation of our entire amphibious flotilla. We need sealift vessels and support ships that can support forces ashore for extended periods of time. That is why the Government will renew the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service through the military afloat reach and sustainability project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para15"><a name="08030581002318">I sometimes wonder whether the Opposition have cottoned on to the importance and the nature of those changes. So much of what they say seems to be rooted in cold war thinking, just as their economic policy is in Thatcherism and their social policy is in Victorian thinking. Certainly, they seem very preoccupied with ship numbers rather than appreciating that what is really important is having a wide, balanced and flexible range of capabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para16"><a name="08030581002319">The Navy has a very positive future, as central to UK defence policy as the other services. The transformation of capabilities to meet modern threats is covered in an excellent article by Dr. Eric Grove in the February 2008 edition of the parliamentary briefing, &#147;Tomorrow&#146;s Royal Navy for Tomorrow&#146;s World&#148;. He concludes that when all of this change has worked through:</p>

<a name="80305-0025.htm_brev8"><a name="08030581002378"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It would be hard to deny that such a capability did not make the UK a world power of significance, as one would expect from a country with one of the largest defence budgets in the world. Observers might well then be looking back at the Brown years as those when the seeds were finally laid for a renaissance of British Maritime power and global presence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para17"><a name="08030581002320">As my noble Friend the Minister with responsibility for defence equipment and support said loud and clear in an article for Plymouth&#146;s <i> The Herald</i> last week, Devonport, its naval base and its dockyard are central to that future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para18"><a name="08030581002321">Let me deal specifically with Devonport&#146;s role. I am pleased to see in her place on the Front Bench my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) in her role as Whip. Devonport will be the only yard in the UK with the capability to undertake important work on nuclear submarines. I am certain that our prudent Prime Minister and our Chancellor of the Exchequer are not going to replicate the &#163;1 billion investment in the infrastructure that was made in the D154 dock any time soon. The dockyard has two more refuelling refits on the Vanguard class submarines, Vigilant and Vengeance. Thereafter, there will probably be two, if not three, life extension refits on the Vanguard boats, pending introduction of the new deterrent, for which Parliament gave the go-ahead for the design stage last year. That equates to 12 to 14 years&#146; work for a Babcock Devonport work force of more than 2,500 people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para19"><a name="08030581002322">In parallel, the yard&#146;s unique facilities mean that the dockyard will be there to carry out deep maintenance periods on the Trafalgar class&#151;wherever they are based&#151;because of the docking constraints at Faslane. There is also the de-fuelling programme, so it is nonsense to talk of our dockyard being in danger under current Government policy, as the contracts in hand amount to more than &#163;1 billion over the next 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para20"><a name="08030581002323">Of course, deep maintenance work on surface ships will be essential to help with the peaks and troughs of the submarine work load. Irrespective of base-porting issues, as it moves to complete the terms of the business agreement with Babcock for the purchase of the dockyard during the course of this year and as it seeks to agree these matters with the other major marine companies through the surface ship support alliance, Ministry of Defence commercial arrangements will need to recognise that. As the new carriers are built, Rosyth&#146;s capacity will be fully occupied, allowing further surface ship refits to be allocated to Devonport&#151;an issue to which I will return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para21"><a name="08030581002324">We are, of course, already home to the Navy&#146;s biggest amphibious ships, Albion and Bulwark. Plans are under way to move Royal Marine assets into the south yard. With that, the naval base can become a centre of excellence for amphibious warfare. We are also home to the Navy&#146;s hydrographic surveying squadron&#151;five ships that do vital work in charting the world&#146;s oceans. With the Met Office in Exeter, the Hydrographic Office in Taunton&#151;both MOD agencies&#151;and the fast developing, world-class marine science partnership based in Plymouth itself, our region has a cluster of complementary activities in marine science and engineering that can only grow with  <br>

climate change, which is such a strongly emerging challenge. We are bidding strongly to become the home for the new marine management organisation, which will come with the marine Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para22"><a name="08030581002325">Since the Conservatives closed Portland naval base in the 1990s, we have been home to Flag Officer Sea Training and its staff. As First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathon Band says:</p>
<a name="80305-0025.htm_brev9"><a name="08030581002379"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is the quality of our people that underpin all that the Royal Navy does: dedicated; motivated; well trained; and loyal. Their determination, courage and selfless attitude has been displayed time and again.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para23"><a name="08030581002326">FOST is what gives focus to that. It puts through their paces not just British warships, but foreign warships from numerous navies. Plymouth&#146;s hosting of scores of warships each year from every corner of the globe is a hugely valuable asset. However, if Devonport is to continue to provide its excellent service to the Navy, key considerations must be respected. I have made them clear in countless meetings with Ministers at both the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury, and I hope my right hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that the messages have sunk in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para24"><a name="08030581002327">First, there is the constant need to ensure that the strategically important nuclear work force is maintained. Skills, expertise and experience must not be allowed to atrophy, or to be lost in the periods between submarine refits. As I said, it is vital for Devonport to secure sufficient maintenance and refit work on surface ships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para25"><a name="08030581002328">Secondly, there is the importance of respecting our nuclear covenant. Devonport is currently home to operational nuclear submarines, to those undergoing refit and to those awaiting disposal. The people of Plymouth have always been supportive and understanding of that, but they will not tolerate Devonport without a broader thriving defence sector. Stripping out the fleet base-porting and warship refit work and leaving only submarine work is not acceptable. Apart from the need for such work to maintain the skills base, we must gain positive benefit and local economic prosperity through a broad base of surface ship work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para26"><a name="08030581002329">Thirdly, Plymouth must remain an operational base for the Royal Navy. Refits and maintenance are not enough. In 1997 I inherited from my Conservative predecessor a constituency that contained the poorest ward in England, which was not unrelated to the careless way in which the Tories had allowed the dockyard to be run down in the 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para27"><a name="08030581002330">I think the message has been received that the MOD must play its part in removing jobs from the overheated south-east, which includes Portsmouth. I know that the MOD is delivering on its targets, but I know from my work in the Select Committee on Defence that it could do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80305-0025.htm_para28"><a name="08030581002331">As I have said, I am grateful for the countless meetings to which my right hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues have agreed, but I am sure he will not be surprised to hear that I have a list of questions to put to him. Satisfactory answers to those questions would help us to chart the way forward for Devonport in the immediate future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para0"><a name="08030581002332">First, following the naval base review we need assurances that all possible help will be forthcoming to enable surplus land to be released quickly, along with  <br>

the support and investment that will be necessary to deal with its decontamination. For decades we have complained that the MOD is slow when it comes to dealing with land release. On this occasion Project Roundel has been introduced in double-quick time, but we need to know that it will continue to proceed rapidly, and in a way that maximises benefit to the local economy beyond the term of the current base commander, Commodore Simon Lister, who has done so much to make this happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para1"><a name="08030581002333">Secondly, assurances have been given by the naval base review team leader to the Devonport task force group, which I chair&#151;and at the recent meeting between my right hon. Friend, Plymouth Members of Parliament and trade union leaders&#151;that work will continue to be done to assess socio-economic issues associated with the follow-through from the naval base review, and any issues arising from the base-porting of ships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para2"><a name="08030581002334">Will my right hon. Friend confirm that detailed information will be available to enable a full and transparent assessment to be made of any socio-economic impact that arises from any of the changes? How near are we to knowing where we are on base-porting issues? Is the date days, weeks or months away? Can he scotch the rumour unleashed among others last week that FOST will be moved from Plymouth?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para3"><a name="08030581002335">My final question&#151;for now&#151;concerns the future surface combatant. I know that it is still at the very early initial-concept stage. Can my right hon. Friend tell us something about the role of those vessels, and will he ensure that serious consideration can be given to a role for Devonport in leading in-service support for them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para4"><a name="08030581002336">Plymouth&#146;s defence sector remains vital to our local economy, and as a city we need to be on the front foot to ensure that it remains vibrant. I believe that, as Babcock Marine has established its headquarters in Plymouth, we have every reason to be confident not just about naval base activity and our traditional role in submarines but about new as well as traditional ways of supporting the Royal Navy, and the many activities associated with its surface ships of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para5"><a name="08030581002337">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to present those issues to the Minister, and I look forward to hearing his response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para7"><a name="08030581002340">Devonport, along with the other naval bases at the Clyde and Portsmouth, will continue to provide the support that ensures that our Navy remains one of the best in the world. The defence industrial strategy laid down a challenge to the UK maritime industry to reduce its overheads and invest in the facilities and skills needed to meet the future demands of the Royal Navy. It was clear that we could not rely on industry alone to achieve the necessary rationalisation. Therefore, in September 2006, we launched the naval bases review. After a period of analysis, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced in July of last year that all three naval bases were to be retained and optimised. That decision secured the futures of the naval bases and remains the position today. Since that announcement, work has been progressing at each of the naval bases to improve the efficiency of the support provided. Going forward, this implementation work has now been incorporated into a single programme: the maritime change programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para8"><a name="08030581002341">Industry has a big part to play in the rationalisation, as Devonport has seen through the acquisition of Devonport Management Ltd by Babcock Marine. That is an important step in the managed rationalisation of the UK maritime industrial base. Along with the formation of the joint venture between BAE Systems and VT Group, it is a key component in ensuring long-term balance in supply and demand after the carrier. It will also help to embed the right behaviours and benefits into ship-build and support programmes as we move to through-life solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para9"><a name="08030581002342">Devonport is playing an integral part in the maintenance and upkeep of the Royal Navy surface fleet. Babcock Marine has recently completed the successful upkeep of the Type 22 frigate HMS Cumberland, and is currently undertaking a similar overhaul of the Navy&#146;s helicopter carrier, HMS Ocean. Babcock Marine, along with Fleet Support Ltd at Portsmouth, is working closely with the Ministry of Defence to allocate future upkeep packages through the auspices of the surface ship support project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para10"><a name="08030581002343">In addition, Devonport is a vital element of the UK&#146;s submarine programme. Babcock Marine is providing direct support to the Navy&#146;s submarine flotilla; for example, a significant milestone was recently achieved when HMS Victorious was successfully refloated in her dock. That was a significant step in a complex three-year project to refuel and refit the submarine. We have to be realistic, however, and must not lose sight of the fact that the number of ships requiring maintenance and repair has been reducing, and in the future as the older classes of submarines leave service and we introduce more capable vessels requiring less maintenance, it will be inevitable that fewer refits will be required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para11"><a name="08030581002344">I know that my hon. Friend has been working hard with other stakeholders in Plymouth to develop further the city and build for the future. It is only right that its future should build on the success of its maritime past. While I know that the potential loss of jobs recently announced by Babcock is disappointing, there is still, as I have said, much to celebrate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para12"><a name="08030581002345">I can assure my hon. Friend that through the maritime change programme we will continue to work closely with Babcock Marine to devise an optimal programme of submarine and surface ship work in  <br>

order to maintain what is a most valuable skill base. I can also reassure her that I, my ministerial colleagues and officials in the Department are fully aware of the local feeling in Devonport about the mix of submarine and ship support work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para13"><a name="08030581002346">As my hon. Friend knows, we are committed to making further investment in Devonport over the next few years. This includes the approval of a &#163;180 million investment to upgrade nuclear refitting facilities and to support the decommissioning of nuclear submarines. There has been recent discussion in various quarters that some of the Royal Navy vessels based at Devonport might be moved. I want to reassure my hon. Friend that we have not taken any decisions to change the base-porting arrangements for ships or boats at Devonport, or at the other two naval bases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para14"><a name="08030581002347">As my hon. Friend is aware, the Department is undertaking a planning round. In it, we always consider a number of different options, many of which are not taken beyond initial consideration. I stress that no decisions have yet been made, and while I am unable to give an indication of the timetable for those decisions, I can reiterate the assurances that I have given to my hon. Friend on other occasions that I am committed to keeping her and others informed throughout the process. As the maritime change programme moves forward, we will continue fully to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including the trade unions and other Government Departments, as well as those locally in the south-west, as more detailed plans become available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para15"><a name="08030581002348">As my hon. Friend said, it is important that the Department does not take decisions without understanding the socio-economic and environmental impact of any changes at any of the naval bases. I can assure her that my officials and I will be as open as possible with her and the local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para16"><a name="08030581002349">To answer my hon. Friend&#146;s other questions, Project Roundel&#151;the sale of land at the Devonport estate&#151;is at an early stage and it is too early to determine the time scales for disposal. However, I can confirm that our intention is to work closely with the local authority in a way that benefits the local economy. I can understand her concern that we move that project forward as soon as we are able.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend confirm that that will proceed quickly, and that the change of base commander will not affect the speed at which it happens?</p>

 As I said, I cannot give a time scale, but it is not my intention to delay the process. As I also said, I will be as open as I can with my hon. Friend going forward. We do not want to delay the process; we want to move forward with it as quickly as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para17"><a name="08030581002352">The future surface combatant is expected to build on the capabilities of the existing Type 22 and Type 23 frigates. This capability includes delivering maritime force protection, providing maritime security to deployed forces, global maritime reach and maritime support to civil organisations. The FSC is at the early stages of concept design and the detailed user requirements have not yet been defined, so I am afraid that I cannot give my hon. Friend the assurances she requested. However, I can assure her that there are no reasons at the moment why Devonport should not be considered to have a role in the support of these vessels.</p>

<p><a name="st_o628"><a name="08030581002353"><a name="80305-0026.htm_spnew2"><a name="08030581004591"><b>Linda Gilroy:</b>
 In concluding, could my right hon. Friend confirm my understanding that Babcock Marine, which has just purchased our dockyard, is the leading surface ship support supplier in the UK and has an extremely high reputation with the integrated project team at Abbey Wood, with whom it deals?</p>

<p><a name="st_o629"><a name="08030581002354"><a name="80305-0026.htm_spnew3"><a name="08030581004592"><b>Mr. Ainsworth:</b>
 It most certainly does, so it is well placed to bid for this work, but as I have said, it is early days and I cannot offer the confirmation that my hon. Friend doubtless wants me to offer. I know that she will keep badgering me until I do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80305-0026.htm_para18"><a name="08030581002355">Finally, I take the opportunity to reiterate that we have no plans to close any of the naval bases, including Devonport. It would be wrong, however, if we did not continue carefully to consider how best to support the Royal Navy and to ensure that waterfront activity is delivered in an efficient and sustainable manner.</p>

 On the support to the Royal Navy, will the Minister confirm that there are no plans to move the flag officer sea training from Plymouth?</p>

 At the start of my speech, I said to my hon. Friend that there are no plans to move FOST from Devonport. I am happy to repeat both that and my pledge to keep her, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport and other local stakeholders, including the local authority, trade unions and others who represent the community in Plymouth, as informed as I am able as these important decisions go forward. If I did not do so, I am sure my life would not be worth living.</p>
