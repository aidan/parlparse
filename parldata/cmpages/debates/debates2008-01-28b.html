In addition, the former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon.

 I also welcome the right hon. Gentleman to his new post. There are plans for a film festival in my constituency, and I hope that there will be enough funding to go round. May I emphasise that it is essential that funding in the creative industries, particularly film, goes to the regions, especially as ITV is currently pulling back from regional news and investment? Therefore, any extra money that goes into film and television in the regions is important.</p>

 I entirely agree. As I mentioned in my previous answer, we have made money available over three years to support film festivals in all parts of the country. The hon. Gentleman will know that last year&#146;s summer of British film, where funding was made available to support the use of digital screens, was another great success. In a changing broadcasting world, where there is lots of global content, regional and local programming is increasingly important to people in the UK.</p>

 The annual school sport survey shows that, although the disparity in participation in sport between girls&#146; schools and boys&#146; schools is narrowing, there remains a need to reduce the gap further. Key to achieving that is to provide further sporting opportunities that respond better to girls&#146; needs and abilities. That is why we are investing an additional &#163;100 million to offer physical education and sport to all pupils aged 5 to 16, and three hours for those aged 16 to 19.</p>

 I welcome the progress the Minister is making in this area, but does he not share my concern that 1 million children still do not participate in two hours of sport a week? The Government&#146;s own most recent figures show that they are failing to meet targets to increase the number of women participating in sport.

 I cannot see how 86 per cent. can be a failure, so we are clearly doing very well on school participation, but we want to do more, especially with girls. We must be careful that girls are not stereotyped by participating in certain sports: instead, we have to broaden the offer. We are doing that by, for instance, working with the Youth Sport Trust, and looking at whether we can introduce dance and creativity. I wonder whether the hon. Lady saw the news today that Kelly Holmes is looking at steps such as the wearing of loose-fitting clothes as opposed to tight PE skirts, to make people feel better about themselves and get more involved in sport.</p>

 I join other Members in welcoming my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to his new role; he is a great choice for the job. On the issue of girls&#146; and women&#146;s participation in sport, it is understood that there is a bias in national funding, from the top to the bottom, in favour of sports played by men and boys, and that needs to be looked into. Members of the national women&#146;s football team do not even receive salaries; they have to do other jobs. That is not an encouragement to girls. Will the new Secretary of State make it a priority to address that imbalance in funding from the top right down to the grass roots, which are so important?</p>

 This is an important point. We have been trying to ensure that the fastest increase is among girls playing football, and to ensure, through the Football Association, that we have an elite league and investment in women&#146;s football. As I said earlier, through the Women&#146;s Sport and Fitness Foundation, we are trying to ensure that we stop any imbalance and promote opportunities for girls and women. A dance review is taking place, so the future looks good, but we must ensure that we get to those hard-to-reach groups.</p>

The busiest place in a young offender institution&#151;and, indeed, a prison&#151;is the gym, and we must try to channel that activity into sport.

 There is only one sport in which girls and boys participate equally in England and Wales&#151;swimming. However, Paris has more 50 m swimming pools than England and Wales put together. That is partly because it is very expensive for local authorities to build and maintain swimming pools. Will the Government consider building more 50 m pools and making sure that funding comes from central Government, rather than local government?</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend has been speaking to the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) about 50 m pools. We clearly need to see investment in sports infrastructure, and we are proud of our record over the past 10 years. It is important that local authorities play their part. We want them to have facility strategies, so that they can work out what is required in their areas. We hope that the sports partnerships can help them to build more pools, if that is what is required.</p>

 May I start by welcoming the new Secretary of State to his post? The two greatest barriers to increasing female participation in sport are a reluctance among girls to take part in the conventional school sport offer, and an appalling post-school drop-out rate. Given the Government&#146;s reorganisation of Sport England, will the Minister be absolutely clear about whether the responsibility for increasing the number of girls doing dance, yoga and the like lies with Sport England, or has been transferred to the Department of Health?</p>

 Increasing participation is a target across government, but what is important is that we make sure that all Government Departments can contribute. On participation, we are working very closely with the Department for Children, Schools and Families and with Department of Health to make sure that there are no gaps for people to fall through. However, the question of where the responsibility will lie depends on the outcome of the Sport England review, which we hope will take place toward the end of February. The review will doubtless make sure that we do not let girls and hard-to-target groups fall through such gaps.</p>

Does she realise that the MLA&#146;s proposal to freeze the funding will result in the loss of five front-line, important jobs?

 First, I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks about the success of the scheme&#151;we all think it is an incredibly successful scheme. Of course, it is another mark-up for a Labour Government, because we introduced it in 1997. Secondly, rumours abound about a loss of staff, but that has not been approved by anybody and is a matter for the scheme itself. It has received not only a bit of inflationary funding from the MLA, but extra funding from the British Museum, so I am unsure why those running the scheme feel the need to make a cut.</p>

Two very valuable golden coins from his reign were recently unearthed by an east midlands farmer and they have joined the 330,000 discoveries in the portable antiquities scheme collection.

 I would love to see the coins to which my hon. Friend refers. I have been privileged to see a number of the finds for which the scheme has been responsible.

 As we are discussing archaeology, I remind the Minister that the scheme was started in 1996 by the Conservative Government.

 The hon. Gentleman is being selective in his use of statistics. The MLA&#146;s budget has not been cut: it has risen with inflation. However, we have chosen to prioritise within its budget the funding for the renaissance programme, which will ensure that we can conserve, and build on, the great advances that we have made in our regional museums. That is important for all sorts of reasons, not just because we want to conserve those very good collections. Regional museums can provide the first experience of museum visiting for those who cannot travel to the national museums. If children go to museums, they are much more likely to go as adults, so I do not apologise for making that a priority.</p>

Members on both sides of the House agree that it is a good scheme that should continue. However, it should still be reviewed, because that is the responsible thing to do.</p>

 The new Secretary of State has a lot of experience of comprehensive spending reviews. In the 2004 review, the Government set a target for the growth of the tourism and creative leisure industries. By 2007, no mention was made of tourism at all. Why was there that change in Government priorities?</p>

As he will appreciate, such a representative would have enormous weight in that process because of the money that the Arts Council wields.

I read it not as an attempt to extend the reach of the Arts Council into every organisation, but as a sensible attempt to ensure clarity throughout the system and consistency in how decisions on arts funding are taken. However, there is, of course, an opportunity for debate to take place about this very important report for the future of the arts. If the hon.

Such targets can be made part of the local area agreements that local authorities are currently striking. The hon.

That amounts to a total public funding commitment of just under &#163;8.1 billion to build the venues and infrastructure needed for the games.

 While I share the Minister&#146;s enthusiasm for the Olympics, does she share my belief that the finances need to be utterly transparent? Last November, the permanent secretary in her Department said that most, if not all, of the contingency fund would have to be spent because of the complex and high-risk nature of the project.

 There is no need to publish a revised budget. The point that the permanent secretary made to the Select Committee on Public Accounts was accurate&#151;at this stage in the development of a highly risky construction project, the only safe assumption is that the contingency will be fully used. However, the further assessment of the budget for the ODA has shown that there is an 80 per cent. probability that the Olympic park will be developed for less than &#163;8.1 billion, a figure that includes the contingency. The finances are under control and transparent, and I have made clear commitments to ensure that the House is updated on the budget at six-monthly intervals.</p>

I congratulate the young athletes in the talented athlete programme and I commend the Northamptonshire champion&#146;s fund, of which she has been such a powerful advocate.</p>

 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a personal statement to the House. The Committee on Standards and Privileges has today issued its report on the complaint made against me for employing my son as a researcher and parliamentary assistant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80128-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0801285000151">I will not delay the business of the House by going through the contents of that report, as it is publicly available. The Committee was entitled to reach the conclusions that it did and I have accepted its criticisms in full. I unreservedly apologise to the House for my administrative shortcomings and the misjudgments I made. In my submissions to the Committee and the commissioner, I set out my case and I leave it to hon. Members to form their own judgment of my conduct. I should like to make it clear that throughout the investigation the commissioner acted with absolute courtesy and the Committee afforded me every opportunity to explain my position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80128-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0801285000152">In apologising to the House, I would also like to apologise to my constituents and to the Old Bexley and Sidcup Conservative association, which has been so very supportive to me and my family throughout a very difficult period. The House will comprehend the impact that this matter has on me personally and also on my family. I have let them down very badly indeed, and no judgment from any quarter could be more harsh than that which I apply to myself.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It saddens me to raise this point of order. Part of your role is to uphold the rights of Back-Bench MPs; part of my role as a Back-Bench MP is to uphold the rights of my constituents and to hold the Executive to account. On 10 September, I wrote to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Despite seven reminders since then, I have not received a reply as of 10 minutes ago. Will you call the First Lord of the Treasury to come before the House and explain what is happening with Members&#146; correspondence?</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am having some difficulty understanding how motion No. 1 on today&#146;s Order Paper can be in order. It appears to have been made under Standing Order 15(2)(b), in so far as it is a motion to be moved by a Minister of the Crown</p>
<a name="80128-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0801285000740"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to the effect that any specified business may be proceeded with at this day&#146;s sitting...until a specified hour&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80128-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0801285000156">namely 10 o&#146;clock. Since motion No. 1 is such a motion, whether it says so or not, it should be taken not now, but at 10 o&#146;clock. However, if it were taken at 10 o&#146;clock, it would have no effect, because it would be too late. Therefore, in my view the motion seems to be out of order.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Could you tell the House whether the effect of motion No. 1, if passed, would be to make it impossible for more than one amendment to motion No. 2 to be taken? Obviously, motion No. 1 is a timetable motion for today. There are various amendments on the Order Paper, including ones tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends. I have been led to believe that it might not have been open to you to select them even if you had been so minded, because they would have been precluded by motion&#151;</p>

 Order. I will stop the hon. Gentleman there. It was indeed open to me to select the amendment that he is questioning, but I did not select it. Therefore, the matter before us is the business of the House and the amendment that I have selected.</p>

This is a straightforward motion that is procedural in nature. If the House agrees to it swiftly, we will have around six hours to discuss the Government&#146;s proposed approach to the important scrutiny of the European Union (Amendment) Bill. That discussion will give hon. Members the opportunity to debate the substantive business motion in detail. At that time, I will make the case in favour of a structured, themed approach to scrutiny of the Bill. A themed approach will ensure that we can cover the range of issues arising from the Lisbon treaty.</p>

 Will the Minister explain why he seems to be wasting time on a motion on the 10 o&#146;clock rule? We always finish at 10 o&#146;clock on Mondays unless the business is suspended. If, by chance, we are still talking at 10, it will be up to the Government Chief Whip to rise to his feet and move that the question be now put. I cannot anticipate your ruling, Mr. Speaker, but it is likely that that would be granted. We could have this debate every Monday. Is this an elaborate attempt on the part of the Government to demonstrate how generous they are with their time?

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes a fair point. The important point, however, is that the hon.

 This motion seeks to limit debate to 10 o&#146;clock tonight, which in view of its importance is quite improper. The whole country is interested in our constitutional relationship with the European Union.

That shows, of course, the lack of publicity given by the BBC, because of its bias and probably as a result of the EU&#146;s funding of the BBC. The soft loans and other funding amounts to some &#8364;256 million over the past five years alone. That shows the importance of our having an unlimited debate in this House, so that people in this country can understand the importance of the question. I am certainly against the motion and I urge the House to vote against it so that Members can debate the matter for as long as it takes and we can get publicity and understanding in the country on its importance.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. In the light of the vote that we have just had, may I ask you to interpret Standing Order No. 32, on the selection of amendments? Only the main motion and one amendment have been selected, which does not seem enough to keep us going until 10 o&#146;clock, the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) notwithstanding. Could you confirm that if time passes very slowly and the debate looks like coming to a premature end, you have the power to make a further selection of amendments during the debate?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right&#151;I do have the power when a debate is in progress to allow what is known as a manuscript amendment, but I am not going to do that this evening, so he need not worry. It has been my experience in the long time that I have been in the House that the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) is certainly able to keep things going until 10 o&#146;clock&#151;in fact, beyond, if necessary. I thank the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) for his deep concern, but I do not think that he has anything to worry about.</p>

We know that they claim that the nature of the European Union (Amendment) Bill is not a constitution, but a treaty, and therefore we do not need a referendum. The Prime Minister told the country that this would be fully debated in the House of Commons, but we then realised that it will be debated for a set period of time only and the Whips are on.</p>

He deservedly has a reputation for courtesy, but frankly this situation is not good enough. On a number of occasions I have asked the Prime Minister at that Dispatch Box whether we would have proper time for this series of lengthy debates without a timetable motion. I am not suggesting that the Prime Minister said that he would not have a timetable motion&#151;he evaded the issue; he did not say that we would have one. The motion before us is so constricting and constraining that it will be impossible for the treaty to be properly debated in this House, and those who have a preference for parliamentary scrutiny over referendums, as some do, will be denied their proper opportunity to debate the issues.</p>

 After opposing a private Member&#146;s Bill on the issue tooth and claw, the Government were instrumental in ensuring that there was no agreement on a European directive on temporary and agency workers on 5 December last year. I note from the list of topics that there is no session provided to discuss the social and employment aspects of the treaty. Why is that, given the importance attached to those issues on the Government Benches? What day may issues such as the directive on agency workers, or indeed working rights generally, be discussed?</p>

 Of course, it is for you, Mr. Speaker, to decide which amendments will be in order on which day. However, the Government understand that the two themes that would lend themselves to the type of debate that my hon.

Those would be the most appropriate opportunities to raise the issue of agency workers.</p>

 The Minister will realise that one of the most important debates that we had when he and the Foreign Secretary appeared before my Committee was on the charter of fundamental rights. It is clear that there is a wide divergence in the legal and political opinion of the posture taken by the Government and whether it is significant, sustainable or damaging to labour relations. In the interest of labour relations and many people in this country, the charter of fundamental rights deserves a separate day for debate. I notice that the amendment tabled by the Opposition includes a day on the charter combined with other subjects. The question whether the Government&#146;s position on the charter negates it or allows it to be applied in a way that would be useful to working people is fundamental.</p>

 On the question when the charter could be debated, I refer my hon. Friend, who speaks with great experience on such matters, to my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme. The fact is that the United Kingdom has neither sought nor achieved an opt-out on the charter of fundamental rights, which will apply in every member state of the European Union.

 Does the Minister accept that even those of us who are not unhappy about the treaty but do not believe in referendums are unhappy about the timetable for the same reasons as many who have doubts about the treaty?

Can he not realise that this debate ought to be at least as long as the debate on the Maastricht treaty, and that we should have a proper debate on transport, not least because the environmental connections with transport are crucial to the next generation?

The Government, in the motion, have adopted an approach that focuses on themed debates, and have taken a different perspective from Opposition spokesmen. With your agreement, Mr. Speaker, we expect the debates on the environment, climate and development to allow ample opportunity for debate about the European structures relevant to those themed policy debates. That is reflected in some of the amendments that have been tabled, and the same applies to the single market and human rights and issues such as co-decisions and moves towards qualified majority voting.

Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has touched on the main point: the Government propose that a great deal of time should be spent on general debates and that one and a half hours should be spent on specific amendments, which is a radical change to the way in which we normally conduct a Committee of the whole House. We have lots of general debate on Europe, and if one allows four hours in which any comment on Europe or climate change is in order, the debate will go all over the place. We will then consider specific amendments, when we can address the detail. Just one and a half hours will be devoted to all the amendments on a subject, and most amendments will not be debated or voted on&#151;I suspect that that will simply set off the upper House, which will debate them all over again.

The Government think that four and a half hours of open debate on themes and one and a half hours of debate on specific amendments is the right mix. Opposition Front Benchers have reached a different view, but according to a similar principle&#151;they have suggested three hours of open debate and three hours for consideration in Committee.</p>

The Bill contains the essential elements to give effect to the Lisbon treaty in the UK and to give effect to the commitments that the Prime Minister has given to this House. In his post-European Council statement on 22 October, the Prime Minister made it clear that the Government would, first, oppose further institutional change over the lifetime of this Parliament and the next, and, secondly, provide for parliamentary control over future use of any amending provisions that would alter the constitutional balance between the UK and the EU.

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80128-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0801285000735">Let me turn to the need for a structured consideration of the Bill. The approach that we set out in the business motion ensures that we have a structured debate around the key themes of the Lisbon treaty and enough time to debate the relevant amendments. The Government are clear that the best way to achieve that is through structured consideration in Committee, with debates organised around those themes. As the House knows, Bills implementing amending treaties are short, and in the past Members have had to be ingenious to construct selectable amendments to enable debate on a given treaty. As a result, the structure of debates has often been confusing. In this business motion, we aim to guarantee that Parliament can scrutinise the Lisbon treaty. The bulk of the treaty will be incorporated into UK law through clause 2. The motion enables Members to debate the benefits of the Lisbon treaty for the UK and the international community through a series of themed debates on substantive motions. The House will, in addition, have plenty of time to consider amendments, following the usual procedures for Committee of the whole House. A clear structure of that type also means that we have sufficient time allocated to discuss the key issues and general principles as well as detailed questions.</p>

 In drafting the motion, we also looked with great care at the provisions for previous Committees. There are lessons to be learned, to which I have already alluded, from previous EU debates on the timing and structure of parliamentary scrutiny. Committee proceedings lasted four days on the Single European Act, five days on the treaty of Amsterdam and just three days on the treaty of Nice. Of course, with great hesitation I refer to the organisational debacle that was the Maastricht treaty process, which lasted for 23 separate days.

I took part in the Maastricht debates as a Minister, and the Minister&#146;s description of the problem is a complete transformation of history. The problem for the Government was that the House, as a whole, would not allow us to waive the 10 o&#146;clock rule. We could bring debates to an end only when we could get a closure, which was rarely. Only when everyone had spoken themselves into exhaustion could we get a timetable at all. That was inconvenient for the Government, which I suspect is what has weighed most heavily on the Minister&#146;s mind. It meant that the subject matter was chosen by the Members of the House, who argued about it for as long as they decided. We moved on from subject to subject as the House allowed us.

Paragraph (6) provides a mechanism for the motion to be amended or supplemented at some later stage in our proceedings. That deals with some of the points that hon. Members have made.

 Usually, the following day is when the provision comes into effect, but the point remains: if there were a nuclear incident that threatened the principal cities of this country, that would clearly meet all the criteria for an emergency debate.

Delaying an emergency debate until the first business on the following day shows that it has precedence over the business that the Government are so insistent on protecting, because Standing Order No. 24 is conceived for something of immediacy and great peril or something that meets the other criteria, and it should not be set aside by the motion.</p>

only they would be able to introduce a motion to override and contradict the motion before the House today. The discretion over timing that resides solely with the Speaker would therefore be removed. The Minister&#146;s desire to be flexible would depend entirely on the wishes of the Government at the time, and not on Mr. Speaker.

The Government&#146;s statement on the reform treaty contains no section on energy, but there is a long section on the role of Parliaments in which we are told that national Parliaments will be given a direct say in the EU&#146;s law-making procedures for the first time.

 My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) has made an important point. The Government frequently put on statements to delay and thereby compress a debate on a main subject later in the day. Given that the Minister has tried to reassure us throughout his speech that there will be time for the House to debate these important issues, will he give an assurance on behalf of the Government that there will be no attempt to make statements on matters that are not of the greatest importance to the House?

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We have already heard from you, very helpfully and clearly, that this motion prevents Mr. Speaker, in the usual course of business, from allowing an emergency debate under the relevant Standing Orders concerning the correct timing of such a debate. Would that also apply to the timing of a statement, or would it still be completely in the gift of the Government to interrupt vital scrutiny of this Bill with a statement or many statements of their own choosing&#151;whether or not there happens to be an emergency&#151;just because it suits their political agenda to do so?</p>

As I understand it&#151;I do not want to tread on the Minister&#146;s ground&#151;the Government&#146;s motion envisages that if there are statements or Mr. Speaker grants an urgent question, the time devoted to consideration of this Bill is protected.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sorry to build on that, and the House agrees entirely with your interpretation. The problem is, however, that the Minister uses conditional language such as &#147;may be&#148;. He has to give a commitment to the House that he is prepared to move the 10 o&#146;clock motion, for example, on the day of business in question. Is there a commitment to do that?</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I notice that on allotted days 1 to 8, there is indeed protected time for debate. However, there is no protected time on allotted day 9, and on day 11&#151;the very important day on which we can debate clause 8 and the referendum&#151;reference is made simply to the moment of interruption; there is no protected time period. Am I right in thinking that if, on the day when we will debate the very important issue of a referendum&#151;the most important, in the eyes of many&#151;there were two Government statements and the normal rules of the House were in place, we could have a very compressed debate?</p>

 I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that the Government fully intend, where necessary&#151;because of a statement or matters of that nature&#151;to extend the moment of interruption. The situation is also set out in the table regarding themed days; reference is made to there being four and a half hours after commencement, and one and a half hours after commencement on specific days. It is important to make that point very clearly. This is about protecting a core number of hours each and every day, and I give the House the very clear commitment that the Government intend to protect the opportunity to scrutinise both the Bill and the treaty in great detail. When it is necessary to have a statement&#151;Members on both sides of the House acknowledge that on occasion, such things are important&#151;the timetable is protected.</p>

 It cannot have escaped the Minister&#146;s notice&#151;I am sure that this is deliberate&#151;that on all the other days, there is indeed a fixed period of protected time for this House, except on the day when we will debate clause 8 and the referendum. The Minister might have noticed that that is probably the single most controversial thing that we will talk about. No amount of protected time is allocated for that day, and we are simply relying on the Minister&#146;s good nature to protect the time. The House would be much more comfortable if day 10 and, in particular, day 11 had a protected number of hours of business. I should be grateful if the Minister tabled an amendment to that effect.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister. Nobody could criticise him for his performance this afternoon&#151;he has tried to give way whenever possible. He has been on his feet, although he has been up and down, for almost an hour and a half, so how can he tell the House with any degree of conviction that an hour and a half, or even four and a half hours, is long enough to debate important constitutional and controversial issues? He has needed his hour and a half. If we were dealing with an allocated time, no Back-Bench speeches would have been made&#151;there would have been no speeches other than the Minister&#146;s&#151;and that illustrates what a tight rein the Government are placing on the House.</p>

 As I said&#151;about 45 minutes ago&#151;the issue is whether the right balance on themed days is four and a half hours and one and a half hours or, as the Opposition Front-Bench team suggests, three hours and three hours. I have indicated, on nearly a dozen occasions, the Government&#146;s intention to be flexible. Where the temperature and will of the House is behind altering the balance, we would be minded to do so.

As the Minister will know, I have tabled two new clauses&#151;one on the Bill of Rights, which goes to the heart of proceedings in this House and the importance to be attached to them, and one on the supremacy of Parliament, which is also extremely important.

The Foreign Secretary probably anticipated better than others the difficulty that would arise. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) just made a valid point. The Minister has taken an hour and a half to respond to valid and legitimate interventions &#151;and not only from Opposition Members&#151;but the same time is meant to be allotted to the consideration of amendments on vast tracts of the Bill. He said that he would be sensitive to the will of the House and flexible on the time, and he should concede&#151;although he will not&#151;that the will of the House as represented by those hon. Members in their places today is that this motion should be withdrawn and replaced with one that shows greater consideration of the wishes of many hon. Members.</p>

 We certainly do not agree with the motion, and we will vote against it.

We are no fans of the procedure employed in the motion or of the constraints that it sets on debate. We will vote to lift some of those constraints, and we will vote against the motion.

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80128-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08012820000007">In his speech, the Minister achieved a remarkable feat, for which I envy him: in a debate on European matters, he achieved complete unanimity between my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). I have striven for years to bring that about, and it has taken only one and a half hours of procedural shambles from the Government finally to achieve it. For a Minister who said that he was going to use these debates to create divisions in the Conservative party, it is not exactly an auspicious beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80128-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08012820000008">The Minister also performed a number of interesting U-turns in the course of his speech. On the motion to which the Government ought to have given so much thought, and to which they were so attached that they put it on the Order Paper for approval, he now says that they will revisit the time allocated on a daily basis. However, the debates on the treaty start tomorrow. The debate on the charter of fundamental rights, which his hon. Friends rightly asked him about&#151;the motion calls them debates on human rights&#151;are next Tuesday. He said that he would be flexible and perhaps place new motions on the Order Paper about the matter, but he does not have very long to do so, given the timetable that the Government have adopted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80128-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08012820000009">The Minister conceded to my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) that on day 11 the time for debate will be protected. Day 11 may of course include the important debate on a referendum, and given the Government&#146;s flagrant breach of their election promise on that subject, that is a welcome concession. However, his biggest U-turn of all was on a policy matter. He completed the Government&#146;s 180 turn of the past seven months by saying that the Government had neither sought nor claimed to have achieved an opt-out from the charter of fundamental rights. Many of us remember Mr. Tony Blair, in his last week as Prime Minister, standing at the Dispatch Box and saying:</p>

At the same time that the Prime Minister made his commitment to very detailed discussion, Government spokesmen attempted to soften up the press by indicating that there would be 20 days of debate on the Floor of the House. That figure was reported in the Sunday newspapers on 21 October, directly after the Prime Minister&#146;s press conference on 18 October.

In the same manner, the Government encouraged the belief to grow that there would be 20 days&#146; debate in the Commons on this treaty and that 20 days was a lot of time. In fact, 20 days is not so long for a measure that by general agreement fundamentally restructures the European Union, creates the important new positions of the European President of the Council of Ministers and the high representative for foreign affairs, removes national vetoes in dozens of different areas and provides for its own subsequent amendment without the passage of a further treaty.</p>

Even leaving aside the Government&#146;s previous spin that there would be 20 days of debate and the statement in the House by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport that there would be 15 days&#146; debate, the scale of what is proposed, the breadth of the matters to be discussed and the controversy that is likely to be generated in many areas all mean that 12 days of six-hour debates do not constitute the detailed discussion and consideration with great precision to which the Prime Minister pledged the Government.</p>

 The Opposition amendment has some merit, because it suggests allocating more time on some of the detailed matters. In particular, the Opposition, unlike the Government, propose to debate the charter, which is at the core of the concerns held by me and many other Government Members. However, the right hon. Gentleman is following the Government in allocating time to what are effectively generic Government motions. Would it not have been better if he had entirely broken with that principle and stuck with the tradition of the House on debating Bills, which is to allow the debate to take place on amendments and not on Government motions?</p>

 I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. In framing our amendment, however, we tried not only to meet the anxieties expressed on both sides of the House, but to come up with a proposal that was acceptable to the Government and to Government supporters, and our amendment is a genuine attempt to come up with such a proposal. In the course of his remarks, the Minister conceded that it might be better to split the six hours between three hours of generic debate and three hours of amendments, which is the proposal in our amendment. The amendment appears to have been successful in that the Government have accepted the arguments for the changing the balance of debate. Given his views, however, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will, like me, want to vote against the motion in its entirety, if the Opposition amendment is not carried.</p>

It turns out not to be a British commission of bishops, nor even one that includes the majority of our Churches or even the established Church of this country, as the Second Church Estates Commissioner, the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell), will no doubt know. It is a commission of EU bishops that meets in Brussels and has received funding from the European Union. The fact that it is in favour of the treaty is no great surprise and the fact that the Foreign Secretary felt bound to bring it up as one of his principal arguments to the House of Commons shows that we need a great deal of time to subject to scrutiny the assertions made from the Government Dispatch Box.</p>

debates on the treaty through to the end of February&#151;all, so far, borne out by what has been given to the House&#151;but gave no such notice to the House in general until last Wednesday. Perhaps the interval until the publication of their proposals was caused by chronic indecision in Downing street, the root of most mishaps for Ministers at the moment.

 That illustrates how strongly Members in all parts of the House feel about this. I will not come to any immediate judgment about my hon. Friend&#146;s proposal, certainly not without consulting my Front-Bench colleagues, but I think that if the Government were defeated on their motion they would have to consider all the options, including the House sitting as a Committee of the whole House in the normal way, and including the Opposition&#146;s proposals. They would do well to do so, because many of their own Members are deeply concerned about what they have proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08012820000057">Let me illustrate the importance of additional time in just one or two of the areas where our amendment proposes it. First, we propose two days of debate on justice and home affairs. The Government have allocated one day in their procedure motion, but we believe that two days is the bare minimum for such an important subject. The treaty would introduce wide and profound changes to the EU&#146;s powers in terms of justice and home affairs. The measures on justice and home affairs are these: a common EU policy on asylum, immigration and external border control</p>
<a name="80128-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="08012820000282"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;based on solidarity between member states&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08012820000058">in article 61 of the new treaty on the functioning of the EU; in article 61g, measures by qualified majority voting to ensure administrative co-operation between national police and criminal justice authorities and the Commission; and in article 61h, a move to full co-decision on investigating financial links to terrorism&#151;co-decision, I need hardly remind the House, would mean the Commission having the sole right of initiative over legislation and the European Parliament amending or blocking legislation. In article 62, there is a common policy on visas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08012820000059">Article 63 sets out the common asylum policy in more detail. It includes for the first time the basis for &#147;uniform standards&#148; rather than minimum standards for asylum&#151;a change that was unsuccessfully opposed by the British Government while the constitution was being negotiated. In article 63a, the new common immigration policy is similarly set out, with new powers for the EU on legislation concerning third country nationals and the abolition of national vetoes&#151;again, unsuccessfully opposed by the Government while the negotiations were going on. Article 63b contains the principle of fair sharing of responsibility over asylum, including its financial implications for member states, with potentially far-reaching consequences. These are all meant to be debated in one day&#151;tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08012820000060">Articles 65 and 68 deal with civil justice, giving the EU new powers to pass laws on &#147;effective access to justice&#148;,</p>

Articles 69a to 69g revolutionise the EU&#146;s role in criminal justice and policing. They give the European Court of Justice full jurisdiction over that area and extend the European Commission&#146;s right to initiate legislation at member states&#146; expense, as well as widening the EU&#146;s remit in this area to include mutual admissibility  <br>

of evidence, rights of individuals in criminal procedure, and rights of victims of crime&#151;and, of course, national vetoes are abolished. The EU would be able to pass laws establishing minimum definitions of criminal offences and sanctions in eight areas. Needless to say, the Government had objections that were overridden while that was being negotiated.</p>

 Let me just finish the description of what is covered in this one day of debate, as the Government propose it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08012820000066">Article 69d includes one of the profoundest changes of all&#151;the right of Eurojust to initiate investigations, as well as the legislative basis to expand its role and new powers on cross-border investigations. Article 69e provides for the establishment of a European public prosecutor, despite the Government&#146;s once adamant opposition to any mention of such a post in the treaties. Article 69f expands the powers of Europol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08012820000068">Those are just the criminal justice and home affairs issues in the main body of the treaty, notwithstanding the highly questionable protocols that the Government have agreed to. The Minister says that there will be line-by-line scrutiny&#151;he said it again on television only this lunchtime. I looked at the treaty earlier. On my reckoning, there are 13 pages covering the areas that I have described&#151;with 40 lines a page, that is approximately 520 lines. The Government propose 360 minutes for the examination of those lines tomorrow&#151;less than 45 seconds per line. That is the line-by-line scrutiny that the Government propose.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is giving a most excellent description of what is going on. Does he agree that many of those provisions, if not all, would require an Act of Parliament that had to go through all the procedures in this House and in the other House?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If any British Government proposed to change legislation in almost any of the areas that I have described, that would require a full Act of Parliament going through all the necessary and normal procedures in both Houses of Parliament.</p>

 While I agree with the right hon.

Members will wish to point out that the protocol on these matters sets out a transitional period after which the arrangements are changed and after which this country may be faced with financial penalties if it does not decide to opt into many of those arrangements. We may have different views about that, but the point of our discussions today&#151;the hon. Gentleman and I may be united at least in this respect&#151;is that we need plenty of time to discuss such far-reaching measures before they slide through this House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o361"><a name="08012820000073"><a name="80128-0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="08012820000335"><b>Mr. Clappison:</b>
 My right hon. Friend is making an extremely convincing point. Do we not need a very great deal of time to discuss the extent to which the protocol purportedly protects us from the extended jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice&#151;a profound change that extends the jurisdiction of the ECJ to the judicial home affairs arena? Have we not seen, through the work of the European Scrutiny Committee, that the protocol that is supposed to protect us is full of holes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08012820000078">We need time to discuss these matters because the opt-in arrangements to which the hon.

We are therefore handing huge powers to the Executive just by agreeing to the Bill.</p>

 Would my right hon.

That is why we need hours of time to consider this grave step that takes away the people&#146;s right to change their minds and have a better Government.</p>

I think that the House is getting the point that when one looks at the scale and detail of what is being put forward in the treaty, six hours of debate&#151;four and a half hours of it a generic Second Reading-style debate&#151;is not adequate to discuss many of the subjects.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his generosity. In contradistinction to the flavour he is getting from some of the interventions, I am getting the impression that many hon. Members have not looked at the source materials and are basing what they say on rumours and misinformation that is being peddled. For example, the right hon. Gentleman just agreed with the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) about the ratchet mechanism, whereas the treaty enables competences to be transferred back to member states.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the current Government are on the brink of even asking for large numbers of competences to be returned to nation states, he will be waiting for a very long time.</p>

All the things that I just read out about justice and home affairs are items that are in the actual treaty. Let us look at the provision in the Government&#146;s procedural motion to have one day&#146;s debate on all aspects of foreign policy and defence. In our amendment, we have set out that those should be separated&#151;there should be a day on foreign policy and a day on defence. The treaty establishes a common defence policy; has weighty provisions on arms procurement; allows for structured co-operation that could have the profoundest implications for the future of European defence; and creates a mutual defence guarantee for all member states. Those are changes to which the Government had numerous objections during the negotiations, but objections on which they gave way. To all appearances, we are entering into a new military alliance, and yet that will not even be granted a full day&#146;s debate, or even six hours&#146; debate, on the Floor of the House.</p>

separate identity; the EU gains its own legal personality&#151;a move the last Prime Minister described as &#147;potentially damaging&#148;; and we see the establishment of a single President of Europe, about whom we spoke last week, whose appointment is already causing tremors in Downing Street. I notice that in the meantime it was reported in today&#146;s newspapers that one friend of the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="80128-0012.htm_brev7"><a name="08012820000287"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tony is a big candidate for any big job, but we think he has important work to do in the Middle East.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08012820000095">All those provisions are in the treaty. It sets out for the first time all of the EU&#146;s competences vis- -vis the member states and does so in a way that changes the balance between them, with subtle but important implications. It is our firm view that the balance of powers between member states and the EU merits at least a day&#146;s debate, as proposed in our amendment. On national Parliaments, a point raised earlier, this treaty for the first time may impose an obligation on this House in relation to an external institution&#151;a profound constitutional innovation and one about which the European Scrutiny Committee has raised serious concerns. The Committee has said that it remains</p>
<a name="80128-0012.htm_brev8"><a name="08012820000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;concerned that the provisions on the role of national parliaments are still cast in terms in which a legal obligation can be inferred, despite the undertakings given by Ministers; and...that, given its constitutional significance, this is not an issue where any ambiguity is acceptable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08012820000097">Clearly, that issue needs to be debated and, given that the Government think that such ambiguity on the matter is acceptable, the least they can do is explain why during several hours of debate on such a constitutional innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08012820000098">It is also extraordinary that the Government do not wish to discuss the new protocol on national Parliaments and subsidiarity, a point to which the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) just referred. Many of us believe that it is probably unworkable, but I am surprised that Ministers do not want to take the opportunity to extol its potential benefits to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08012820000102">We are, of course, in favour of debating such topics as energy and international development, but it has to be said, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) pointed out, that the relevant treaty provisions are thin. Let us debate them, but the Government should not pretend that the provisions relating to them require more parliamentary scrutiny than the highly controversial implications of the charter of fundamental rights, the future role of national Parliaments or the distribution of competences between nation states and the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08012820000103">So why are the Government proposing to give less time to those matters either than was previously advertised or than is genuinely required? Is it because they have a vital, heavy and ambitious legislative programme that will be disrupted by an extra six days of debate on this treaty? Of course not. Is it because they are worried that any more sitting days will increase the workload of Parliament to an intolerable extent? No. Is it because they do not want certain parts of the treaty to have an entire day of debate in their own right because people inside and outside Parliament might notice what is being done in their name? That is nearer the mark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80128-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08012820000104">The more detailed consideration there is, the more clearly the treaty will be exposed as the almost identical copy of the constitution on which the people of Britain were promised a referendum. Every detailed examination of what is in the treaty has failed to support the Government&#146;s arguments that it is fundamentally different, as the reports from the European Scrutiny Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee have shown. Further proof of another reason has emerged over the weekend. As we have repeatedly said from this Dispatch Box, this treaty&#146;s importance relies not just in the clear-cut extension of the EU&#146;s powers or abolition of national vetoes but in the processes it sets in train. The document leaked at the weekend shows that EU leaders plan to make a series of important decisions&#151;on subjects such as the role of the EU President; the structure, operation and field of action of Europol; the new powers of Eurojust; the rules governing the European public prosecutor; the powers of the new operational committee on internal security; the nature of structured co-operation in defence; the role and power of the EU Foreign Minister; the organisation and functioning of the EU diplomatic service; and other subjects, too&#151;only after the ratification of the treaty in those countries that are called difficult countries, such as the United Kingdom.</p>

There could not be a more cynical approach to the conduct of Government policy, deeply lacking in openness, transparency or honesty. The Government&#146;s concern throughout has not been to listen to the public or Parliament but to do their best to exclude both from any decision making about the European Union.</p>

 The House will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to speak for the same length of time as the previous two speakers. However, I want to make some important points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08012820000109">First, as a proud Labour MP, it has never been my wish to interfere with the Government&#146;s intention to legislate on particular matters, although we have disagreed from time to time. I have been driven into some unusual situations by that. I have had doubts about such a motion on only one previous occasion, but I am afraid the Minister has not convinced me that this motion makes adequate provision for debates such as those that I and many other Labour colleagues want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08012820000110">I have already intervened several times, so the House may have gathered what my objections are, but I shall quickly run through them now. The motion provides for eight days during which we will discuss clause 2. In effect, the Bill is a single-clause Bill. The treaty&#146;s effects on UK legislation are included in that clause. Most of the amendments will be tabled during those eight days, but the days have been divided in an unusual way. The House will not go into Committee for the first four and a half hours of each day while it is scrutinising the Bill. That is a constitutional novelty. On Friday, I will have been in the House for 12 years and so I suppose that I am a relatively junior Member, but in those 12 years I have never seen the scrutiny of a Bill involving a generic debate, determined by the Executive, for the first three quarters of the day, with the House going into Committee only for the last 25 per cent. of the day&#151;the last hour and a half, in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08012820000111">The first problem with the form that has been adopted is that not only is it a constitutional novelty but it allows the manipulation of the debates by the Executive to their advantage. The themes that have been determined by the Executive are clearly intended to exemplify what they see as the beneficial aspects of the treaty. However, many other aspects of the treaty will not have the same beneficial effects on the UK. The Government have deliberately set about creating a set of debates on themes that are intended to exemplify the beneficial effects of the legislation and the treaty, but that is not how legislation ought to be scrutinised in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08012820000112">The second and equally important problem with this way of proceeding is that we know that generic debates&#151;Adjournment debates and other debates on Government motions&#151;are largely dominated by the speakers from the two Front Benches. We have just seen  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="28 Jan 2008">

an example of that. The debate started three and a half hours ago, and I am the first Back-Bencher to speak. The four and a half hour generic debates will be dominated by those on the two Front Benches and it is clear that the voices of Back Benchers will not be heard in the way they would if the House were in Committee, where they could seek to amend the legislation and thereby affect the treaty. It is clear that the miserable one and a half hours each day might be dominated by a series of Divisions, while the four and a half hours will be dominated by the Front-Bench spokespeople and, in particular, by the Executive. That is not the way in which the House should proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08012820000113">It seems that such a process will also distort the character of the debate. It is clear that the division between those who sit on the Front Benches is about the role of the nation state and national Parliaments vis- -vis a superstate or federal states. That is clearly an important debate for the House, but other voices, on our side at least&#151;and I am one of them&#151;want to raise another critique of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08012820000114">Let me briefly exemplify the kind of debates that we should have, but which are excluded by the motion. Many of us have accepted that the economic powers that in the past were coterminous with the nation state are now supranational and even global. It is therefore inevitable that if we want to attempt to control the effects of those economic powers, we must have some supranational co-operation. The argument in favour of a Europe of the peoples that attempts in some way to control the power of those global corporations has been won.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08012820000115">We want not a liberal, market-driven Europe but a social Europe. However, the terms of the motion exclude the possibility of our having that debate. The debate will largely be between those who speak from the two Front Benches and it will be about the nation state as opposed to the superstate, whereas we want a debate about a liberal Europe as opposed to a social Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08012820000116">That brings me to the subject of what the Minister has denied is an opt-out. I want to speak about the charter of fundamental rights. When the previous Prime Minister, Tony Blair, went to negotiate the treaty, we were told that the red line would not be crossed&#151;the charter would not be allowed to create judiciable rights in the United Kingdom. When he had finished the negotiations and had been on the phone to the then occupant of No. 11, he came out and said, &#147;We&#146;ve secured an opt-out from the charter.&#148; Those were the words he used, both on the record and in briefings to the press. Now the Minister denies that an opt-out has been secured. That needs to be debated because the charter of fundamental rights is central to the sort of Europe that is being constructed. Will it be a liberal, market-driven Europe, where inequality is intensified and companies are allowed to move across the globe with no accountability to the work force or the nation states? Will it be a Europe where the interests of ordinary people are secured by the charter of fundamental rights? In our debates, there is no opportunity to test whether the Minister was right to deny the opt-out or whether Tony Blair was right to say that there was an opt-out.</p>

 The Viking and Laval cases, which were determined in the European Court of Justice recently, clearly signal that we should hold a debate on a neo-liberal Europe, where corporations can move across the continent uncontested by trade unionists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08012820000119">Let us consider title IV of the charter of fundamental rights, from which the Minister claims that there is no opt-out whereas Tony Blair said that there was. That needs to be debated. Page 173 of the treaty refers to the United Kingdom, ostensibly led by a social democratic Government, and Poland, which is hardly a social democratic country. Articles 1 and 2 clearly contain an intention to ensure that the UK and Poland are exempt from most of the justiciable rights in title IV, which is entitled &#147;Solidarity&#148;. Paragraph 2 of article 1 states:</p>
<a name="80128-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="08012820000288"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80128-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08012820000120">What is this amazing title IV, which the programme motion excludes from debate? I shall not go through it in detail because you would rule me out of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. However, it is important to explain why I do not find the motion in its current form acceptable and why I am frankly tempted by the Opposition amendment. Many colleagues are also tempted as they consider how to vote. Title IV gives workers throughout Europe the right to information and consultation within an undertaking. It gives trade unions the right of collective action and bargaining. It grants a right of access to placement services, a protection in the event of unjustified dismissal and a right to fair and just working conditions. How can the Government have said that the treaty&#146;s solidarity clauses cannot be incorporated into UK law?</p>

So far, there has been almost no serious commentary or analysis of important questions, which have to be resolved.</p>

The trade unions are concerned by the UK Government&#146;s apparent decision to exempt the UK from title IV of the charter. If the media are not adequately reflecting our views, it is essential that the House at least structures its debates to allow Back Benchers such as me and others to express their desire for a more social and less neo-liberal Europe than the Government currently envisage.</p>

If the opt-out, as I insist on calling it, continues, that gives a clear signal to the ECJ that the Government entirely accept the argument that there is such a hierarchy and that the rights of trade unionists and others hold a lesser place than the rights of capital to move freely across the European Union.</p>

That is our position and we do not resile from it. We also had an exchange, which is now familiar, about whether we should have a referendum on the treaty or on the wider issue. The House knows the positions: the Government said that there should be no referendum, the Conservative party wants one just on the treaty and we want one, once the treaty is agreed, on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the European Union.

am sure would be accepted by those on the Conservative Front Bench, to the Minister for Europe and the Deputy Leader of the House that we sit down after tonight&#146;s proceedings and do what we should have done in the first place: negotiate not a perfect solution&#151;we are in an imperfect context&#151;but a much better solution. Such a solution would not only allow debate about the substance, but allow the legislature to decide the important issues and propose them to the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08012820000146">Of course we can do that thematically, by taking, for example, the charter of fundamental rights one week and justice and home affairs, which are currently on the agenda for tomorrow, another week. However, the decision should be led by the legislature, not the Government. We know what the Government&#146;s position is. The Committee stage of parliamentary proceedings is not the time when Governments should make their proposals; it is when parliamentarians from the Government Back Benches and all Opposition parties should test them by amendments and come to a conclusion.</p>

 Leaving aside for the moment the question of a referendum&#151;although we would be interested to know what the hon. Gentleman would say on that&#151;would he also agree, speaking from his party&#146;s point of view, that it is important that such matters as new clauses, in particular those on saving the Bill of Rights and the supremacy of Parliament, for instance, should be properly debated as well?</p>

 Absolutely. I shall come back to that, although I do not want to make a long speech, which might disappoint colleagues&#151;over the weekend, I contemplated using motion No. 1 or motion No. 2 as an opportunity to make a record-breaking speech, which would have been a very long speech indeed. I think that I am second in the parliamentary league table&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Only second?&#148;] I was overtaken, sadly. My speech was from the days of trying to resist the abolition of the Greater London council, when I spoke from the then Labour Opposition&#146;s Front Bench, much to the chagrin of the Labour party, which had deserted its post. However, I decided not to do that today, because I thought that a collection of arguments from throughout the House making it clear that the proposed procedure was unacceptable would be better.</p>

 Although the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s suggestion would mitigate the worst part of the Government&#146;s proposals, what was wrong with the traditional way of handling such a Bill, on the Floor of the House? Is that not the way forward?</p>

 That would certainly be a way forward. Unless there had been agreement that the new system was better than the old system, it would probably have been better to keep the tried-and-tested system. I do not belong to the dinosaur tendency, which says that we never change our procedures. Indeed, I welcomed the Minister&#146;s suggestion that we try to be thematic. That seemed a welcome initiative and I do not resist it just because it is a new idea&#151;if we did that, we would never make any changes to the procedure in this place at all. However, it might be better to go back. Indeed, if we defeat the Government&#146;s motion tonight, that is certainly where we will be, with the normal procedures. That is a better starting place than the proposal that has turned  <br>

out to be totally inadequate to the task ahead of us, even though it might have been attempted in good faith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08012820000151">I want to deal with some of the specific subjects that have already been identified as having been missed from the provisions on the allocation of time. We can have lots of inter-party knockabout on these matters, but, to be fair, all parties agree that there is a common interest in debating certain sections of the treaty for roughly the same length of time. However, the Opposition are making an extra bid for certain other sections to be included, and everyone has spotted the fact that the Government are trying to rush things through far more quickly than is justified. I shall come back to that issue, which I hope deals with the point raised by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08012820000152">Certain matters are not provided for in the timetable, and are perhaps not commonly agreed to be valid subjects for debate. They are not the central issues, but they relate to the economy, social services and public services. Adoption rights and aspects of family law, for example, are not unimportant to people, and we ought to have an opportunity to debate them. There certainly ought to be an opportunity to discuss the role and legal status of EU institutions. The Conservatives get themselves wound up about that and misrepresent the case. It is not the great monster that they pretend it is, and I shall be happy to take them on in that regard. Many organisations have legal status. The Universal Postal Union, for example, has legal status. The treaty is bringing the situation up to date by proposing that certain new structures should have legal status. So this issue is not a monster, but we should still debate it properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08012820000153">There is also a good debate to be had on the distribution of competencies between the EU, as it will be, and the national Parliaments. The treaty actually gives national Parliaments more say, not less, in that regard, although one would not think so if one listened to the Tory party. For the first time, the treaty explicitly provides a right to leave the European Union as opposed to staying in it. I would be happy to debate that, because it shows the merit of the treaty&#151;</p>

 It is not a red herring. It is an absolutely central proposal in the treaty&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is not even a matter of fishing policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08012820000156">There is also a suggestion that we should have further debates on the role of national Parliaments. I should be happy to add all these topics to the agenda. There is also a strong case for devoting more time to debating the central issues, including foreign policy and defence. The treaty proposes changes in structure, which I welcome. For example, it is a good idea to have one person responsible for foreign policy, rather than a Commissioner and another senior official.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08012820000157">There are many good things in the treaty, and they are big enough issues to warrant debate, as are the issues that are on the agenda for tomorrow, for which the time allowed is inadequate. There should be an opt-out in relation to justice and home affairs, and the Government have negotiated just such an opt-out. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg), now our party leader, argued strongly for that, as did  <br>

He will also make that argument, which is one that I have advanced all the time. Those matters are rightly not part of our commitment at the moment. There is a proper debate to be had on what could happen to make them part of our commitment, however.

I have made the point that the scrutiny should have come first, before we dealt with the Bill. However, we support the Bill because it will allow the United Kingdom to make the treaty part of UK domestic law. Without proper scrutiny, however, some of the proper questions that the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) and other colleagues want to ask cannot be asked. Such questions could well throw up issues that, by definition, scrutiny is designed to reveal. We have never given anyone a blank cheque but, at the end of the day, the Government of any country have the executive responsibility to seek to negotiate treaties with other countries. If we had been the Government, the result would have been different. Unfortunately, we were not elected to form a Government last time, but I hope that, before the hon. Gentleman and I have finished our time here, the Liberal Democrats will have formed a Government. He will then be able to hold us to account.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We should scrutinise everything in the treaty in detail. He says that he supports it because, overall, he believes that it is good for Britain.

 I believe that the final judgment about whether the United Kingdom should be part of the European Union should rest with the British people in a referendum. On the treaty, however, given the structure of the document now before us, I do not believe that there could be a valid debate or decision by the British people, as it would be limited to the matters in the amending treaty. Because most people in Britain did not take part in the last referendum in 1975, and because this is still a big issue, we would welcome and value an opportunity to have a referendum on the big question of whether the United Kingdom should stay in the European Union, and we hope that Parliament will agree to provide that opportunity once the treaty has been agreed. I hope that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and other colleagues will support that proposal. Out there, the British public are not concerned about the details of how many Commissioners there are. They are interested in the big question, and that is what we ought to be voting on.</p>

 There is a very simple answer to that question. The hon. Gentleman is right. At the last election, all three major parties said that they would give the British people a vote. His party said that it would do so within six months; the other two did not specify a time. At that stage, it was understood that the proposal was that there would be a totally new, all-encompassing, once-and-for-all document&#151;a new constitution for Europe. In all the time that I have been here, I have always said that big constitutional matters should be the subject of a referendum. Subsequently, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, the proposal did not get through the referendums in France and the Netherlands. As a result, it went back to the drawing board.

 I was being distracted, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall just finish my sentence, then I shall follow your stricture absolutely. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the treaty, he will see that it is not a new constitution for Europe. It consists of amendments to existing documents. That is the fundamental difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08012820000182">I shall turn to the substantive reasons why the motion should be defeated. First, it does not allow enough time for debate. This is a 291-page document. There were 23 days&#151;162 hours and 45 minutes&#151;allowed for debate on the Maastricht treaty. In its breadth, this is more of that order than some of our previous, more minor debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08012820000183">Secondly, if we pass this motion, there will be a clearly flawed provision that would allow Members to initiate emergency debates and decided by Mr. Speaker or by you, Madam Deputy Speaker, only at the end of the day&#146;s business. That is nonsense; by definition, these matters should be dealt with at the beginning of the day&#146;s business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08012820000184">Thirdly, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who is no longer in his place, and others made an important point earlier&#151;that the Government&#146;s intention of giving clear notice, which is good, has resulted in our having to conduct a debate first and deal with amendments later. That is not the right way round because it means that the Executive go first, with Back Benchers and the Opposition parties having the chance to participate only later and with limited time. Logically, we should be able to see what the amendments are, have a general debate on the issues and vote at the end. There are better procedural ways of achieving the same objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80128-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08012820000185">My fourth objection is the split between four and a half hours for general debate and one and a half hours for amendments. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West is right to say that we are unlikely to table millions of amendments, but some hon. Members will table them and he might even table the odd one himself&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>We may well need more than one and a half hours to deal with amendments, so the motion is unacceptable in providing only 30 hours in total for all amendments before we reach Report and Third Reading. The Opposition&#146;s proposals would allow 66 hours&#151;clearly an improvement in doubling the time, which is why we said we will support it&#151;but we must provide sufficient time to deal with all the amendments.</p>

It is nonsense, too, to assume that Report stage will not happen because there will have been no amendments. Only six hours are programmed for Report and Third Reading.

We are witnessing ridiculously authoritarian control over this timetable. If this is the most important measure before us&#151;I am not necessarily saying that it is&#151;and if it must be debated on the Floor of the House because of its constitutional importance, it must have all the time it needs for full debate. We need to make that time; we do not sit in Parliament as long as we used to and Liberal Democrat Members are ready to make the time available.

 Having listened with great interest to the last three and half hours of debating over the business motion, I am delighted to have the opportunity to support my hon. Friend the Minister for Europe. I am well aware that the procedure proposed to handle the European Union (Amendment) Bill is novel and I am also well aware  <br>

that some hon. Members view that novelty as enough in itself to damn it. That is not my view. As you will be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have always been strongly in favour of the work of the Modernisation Committee and I commend the Government on this occasion for having given considerable thought to what they view&#151;a view that I share&#151;as a better way of dealing with the double set of issues that Parliament needs to debate.</p>

 I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend, but I seem to have missed the great body of demands for changes of this kind. Why does she believe that this procedure has been introduced suddenly for this particular and rather important Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_o425"><a name="08012835000003"><a name="80128-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="08012835000083"><b>Ms Hewitt:</b>
 I was just going to make a point that effectively responds to my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention. What Parliament needs to consider on this occasion is both the treaty itself and the Bill to give effect to it. It is the treaty that contains the real matters of substance that this House and certainly my constituents are most concerned about, whereas the Bill&#151;an extremely short Bill, albeit one with some important procedural content&#151;simply gives effect to it. It is therefore very wise and imaginative of the Government to come forward with a procedure that allows Parliament fully to debate the substance of the treaty itself&#151;which is not of course amendable by this Parliament&#151;by organising a series of themed debates, while also allowing time, as must properly be required, for debates on amendments to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o426"><a name="08012835000004"><a name="80128-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="08012835000084"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 May I suggest that evidence of demand for change, which my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) asked about, comes from the existence of our new Public Bill Committees? That may not provide sufficient evidence for my hon. Friend, but we have changed our procedures in order to have a more general start to them, including the taking of evidence, if necessary. Subsequently, those Committees move on to amendments&#151;very similar to the procedure proposed to the House tonight.</p>

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, who also made a very good point earlier. I have always supported that sort of special procedure for Bill Committees. Many, many years ago when I was general secretary of the organisation that is now called Liberty, I gave evidence to a Standing Committee which I believe I am right in saying was the first to make use of such procedure in dealing with Bills. I well know from my mail box and conversations with constituents that they are interested in many aspects of the substance of the Lisbon treaty. They want to speak to me about rising energy prices, to which, of course, the liberalisation that is so urgently needed in the European Union is one of the major responses. They want to talk about climate change, about human trafficking, and about the welcome cuts in mobile phone roaming charges and other benefits to consumers that have come, and will come in future, from the European single market. It is on all those and many other issues that the themed debates will allow us to reflect.</p>

 I shall certainly want to discuss that if I am called when we come to debate the amendments that will doubtless be tabled on the issue of the referendum. At this stage, I will simply make the point that the Lisbon treaty is different in nature and in substance from the constitutional treaty on which I, and other Members, promised a referendum.</p>

I believe it was at the 2006 Conservative party conference that the party&#146;s leader said it was high time his party stopped &#147;banging on about Europe&#148;. Those were his exact words. He said that the Conservative party had been banging on about Europe and, not surprisingly, losing the attention of the public as a result. We have heard from so many Members this afternoon that same obsession with procedure, that same nit-picking, that same&#151;in many cases&#151;belief in conspiracies whenever Brussels is mentioned, which has characterised the British Conservative party&#146;s attitude to Europe for two decades or more, and which contributed so much to their expulsion from government.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker. One of the reasons why I support the programme motion so strongly is that I am certain that, in the days and weeks ahead, it will give us an opportunity to probe in much more detail the Conservative party&#146;s attitude to the European Union, to Britain&#146;s membership of the European Union, to the Lisbon treaty, and to their conservative and centre-right political colleagues in the rest of the European Union, from whom they now find themselves entirely isolated. I think I am right in saying that the only ally that the Conservative party has among its European Union counterparts is the Czech Civil Democratic party, the ODS, which is both in favour of the treaty and against a referendum.</p>

 Part of the argument this evening is that we are not being given sufficient time in which to scrutinise the treaty that is before us. If we were given more time, the right hon.

 I think the hon. Gentleman overestimates the amount of time that is required in the House to expose the contradictions in his party&#146;s attitude to the European Union. The amendment that he supports seeks six more days for debate, and more time within each debate for amendments to the Bill. However, as has been made clear this afternoon, the amount of time that the House will have for substantive debate on both the treaty and the Bill will depend very largely on the number of points of order from Conservative Members. I hardly think that good use has been made of the generous amount of time that has been made available for debate on the programme motion.</p>

 Is my right hon. Friend surprised that the Opposition amendment which has been selected seeks more time in which to discuss European Union issues&#151;more time in which the deep divisions within the official Opposition over our membership of the European Union can be exposed?

heard so much from them this afternoon has an even worse effect. It compounds a problem about which Members in all parts of the House are increasingly concerned: public disengagement from Parliament itself. I am perfectly happy to see the Conservatives showing once again their true colours on Europe, and we will have many more opportunities to debate that following the programme motion. What worries me is that the kind of debate and the kind of points of order that we have heard this afternoon lead the public&#151;my constituents and, I think, everyone else&#146;s&#151;not just to switch off their television sets should they happen to stumble on the parliamentary channel, but to switch off completely from voting.</p>

Two Bills that we debated then, ad infinitum as it seemed at the time, will always remain in my mind: the industrial relations Bill that the Heath Government introduced in 1970 and the Bill that took this country into the Common Market, as it was then called&#151;both of which my right hon. Friend and I gladly supported, and would do again.

I believe that it is almost always wrong to curtail debate in this Chamber, although I accept that a Government, who have a mandate from the country, do at the end of the day deserve to get their business through. However, within a year of this Government coming to power, we had moved towards the automatic timetabling of every Bill. Now, whenever a Bill receives its Second Reading, the next motion on the Order Paper is that that Bill shall be timetabled. We are told when it will leave this Chamber, when it will come out of Committee and when its Report stage will finish. If our hours were open ended, that would not be so bad, but as it comes side by side with the change in parliamentary hours many pieces of proposed legislation go to the other place having been very imperfectly scrutinised here, and sometimes with whole sections of them not having been debated at all.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman not in danger of being a little selective in his recollections? He and I remember past years&#151;certainly the 18 years when his party was in Government&#151;and, without being partisan, is it not true to say that there has been a steady decline in the freedom of the House, as there has been an increasing use of Whips, and of timetable motions such as the one we are debating? That is not new to this Government; there is a process that we can catalogue. Also, the hon. Gentleman said there were great debates in former years, but is he not being unfair to the excellent debate of last Monday? I heard some fantastic speeches then, including one from the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who is a scarce bird on his party&#146;s Benches because his views on Europe are very unpopular with other Conservative Members.</p>

However, if anything might have made me waver and return to my former belief, it would have been the Prime Minister saying, &#147;There will be no timetable.

It is better, because it provides for six more days, but that allocation still is within the constraints of time. It divides the six hours into three and three, rather than four and a half and one and a half, and in most subjects that is probably better. However, it is still a very imperfect instrument, and I would much rather, as my hon.

 In stating that conclusion, does my hon.

 Of course it is, and I did refer to this issue in passing while my right hon. Friend was briefly out of the Chamber. I am one of those who are midway between the party&#146;s official position and his. I find much of this treaty acceptable, and some of it I do not. However, the fact is that if it is going to be debated in a parliamentary forum, and if the people are not to be given the chance to have a say&#151;as I believe they should, because of the precedent that has been set&#151;there must be the fullest possible debate and scrutiny. The right hon. Member for Leicester, West talked about people becoming disillusioned with Parliament. They are disillusioned, not mainly for the reasons to which she alluded, but because Parliament has indeed been emasculated.

If, as a member of the Whips Office or a Cabinet Committee, someone manages to decide when their Bill is to be debated and how long for, who will sit on the Committee to debate it, when it will come back to the House and what will happen to it when it reaches another place, that gives them considerable advantages and, in some instances, can determine whether the Bill will get on to the statute book. When Members of Parliament are confronted with a timetable motion, they must ask themselves who will benefit from the procedure. They must ask who will get the advantage from ensuring that this House, which contains myriad different views on the political implications of this treaty, debates the matter at sufficient length for the people outside this House to understand the implications of what we are doing.</p>

She felt that was not a serious way of proceeding to examine the substance of the debate, yet it is exactly what Members of Parliament are supposed to do. We are supposed to ask the Minister handling the Bill why they think that they have given us sufficient time closely to examine what is in the legislation. We should ask why the Minister thinks we are so worried about not having sufficient time to debate it.</p>

I can honestly say that it was a good idea that we were paired, because we did not agree on anything. The reality is that the House of Commons ought to examine the transfer of powers, the behaviour and rights of sovereign Governments, the constant and encroaching demands of European institutions across the board and the way in which those institutions introduce directives and regulations, and decide what will happen in so many of our basic industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08012835000060">I am concerned because the Labour party has always fundamentally believed in the free and fair treatment of human rights, yet in the chase for management control we are doing exactly those things that I would find wholly unacceptable in a Government of any other colour. It therefore behoves us to make it clear why we are so concerned tonight. The Minister for Europe is an engaging young man, and he perhaps gave us a little hint as to what the reasons are. He said that during the Maastricht debate the Chamber had been the resort of two or three lonely souls. If any individual Member of Parliament is not able to raise their own views either in here, even in an empty Chamber, or elsewhere in the House and demand that they are answered by a Minister, I will know fully and finally that we have come to the end of our democratic representation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08012835000061">I say to Ministers that of course it is more convenient to be able to restrict debate and it is always more comfortable for them to get their legislative programme on to the statute book in the way that they want, but they are saying to the House that they have changed the procedure, they are going to have thematic debates and hon. Members will be able to vote on their amendments afterwards&#151;how very convenient.</p>

That is what makes the law, that is what we are here to do and that is where our responsibility lies. Those who genuinely think that they can manage a matter of this importance, whatever one&#146;s view, as though it were an agenda for a business meeting, betray their commitment not only to the House of Commons but to the democratic system.</p>

This Parliament did not create itself overnight. It took many hundreds of years before we reached the stage where we were able to do that on an equal basis and in a responsible way that makes the world outside listen to us and talk about the mother of Parliaments. That, to me, is what matters. I came here many years ago because I believed that the House of Commons was the place where we took responsibility for writing, debating and understanding the laws, and for looking after the interests of our constituents and our voters. Those who bring forward a blatant piece of management, such as this timetable motion, seek to undermine that responsibility and it does them no credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08012835000065">This debate is essentially about our constitution, our freedoms and liberties and our procedures. The former Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), had, in the fat years of new Labour, grown used to seeing this place merely as a Chamber for public announcements. That is what we have become and that is what we reduce ourselves to. How can the Government conceive of such a new procedure to address fundamental propositions that are to become the law of this land in a process that seeks to bind us and to override, in a sense, parliamentary sovereignty, or the sovereignty of the people? They do not trouble themselves to stop and ask, &#147;But who do we represent?&#148; If I tell people something, how do they protest against it? I will have to turn round and say that it is put in a tablet that rises far beyond this Chamber and is more important than us here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08012835000066">To construct something such as this motion is shaming for a Government. They have lost their rationale and sense of purpose, and in doing so they make us open to being an object of contempt. God save the health service after the speech by the right hon. Lady, the former Health Secretary. What was she saying? She has had many chats with her constituents who apparently say that they want to hear Parliament discuss thematic schemes. Perhaps they do, but I have constituents who also want the death penalty back and who want all manner of things discussed. Such things are reflected in the motion before us, because it refers to a charter of rights. Among those things is the supremacy or otherwise&#151;I do not know where it stands in this&#151;of the European convention on human rights. We are charged, as was rightly said by my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire and the noble lady, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> It is true, she is noble. She reminds us of why we are here. We noted and then, I am sorry to say, largely ignored the exposition by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). It is so creeping to support the position of one&#146;s Government on something that he, as a solicitor representing a client, would not accept as the basis for a deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08012835000067">I remind the House that the most intelligent breakdown of the issues at stake, to take just home affairs and justice&#151;which we are supposed to consider tomorrow&#151;was made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). His exposition should be sent to every Member of Parliament. Someone also made the observation that many of these contentions would, under our normal processes, have to be introduced as individual measures in the form of a Bill, but they are now all rolled up into one.</p>

In the 18th century, the slogan &#147;no taxation without representation&#148; held a strong power. He did not even understand the constitutional basis, but he tried to tell us about the management of the Maastricht Bill. He also told us&#151;we heard it time and again from those on the Front Bench&#151;about Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s rebate. He was 14 at the time. Do he and the others behind this motion really know the history of their country? Do they understand the vitality and vigour with which the Crown had to be captured?

Friend the Member for South Staffordshire said, the Government now even try to equate their systematic guillotining of every Bill with the years of Mrs. Thatcher. I used to follow the issue closely, but it does not need to be followed closely any more because there is now a sledgehammer beating away at our traditional liberties. If we are personalising the debate to one Prime Minister, we could say that Mrs. Thatcher guillotined about 42 Bills. That required some 63 guillotine motions, because in those days it was necessary to show respect to the other place. When it accepted an amendment, we had to consider it. This impatient Government will have none of that. After an hour or an hour and a half of debate, they bat Lords amendments straight back.

The question should be what business do we have to do, and then we can ask how many hours are necessary to consider it. Ministers seem to think that 36, or even 50, hours of discussion of a Bill, even one that covers such a range of issues, is wholly adequate. Almost every free contributor to this debate&#151;by which I mean even the good fellows who try to support their Front-Bench colleagues through thick and thin&#151;must know that this has gone too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08012835000073">All three parties, and now the Scottish Nationalists, the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and now even the Welsh Assembly, want a referendum on this issue, but the one thing that the Government promised is not in the motion. We do not know whether a referendum amendment will be selected. It should have been a Government amendment to honour their promise, but everyone knows that they are hoping it will not appear on the Order Paper. Every hon. Member knows that millions of men and women will think, in the back of their minds, that their representative asked for their vote predicated on the undertaking that if this treaty were approved, the people would be the ultimate determinants of its fate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80128-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08012835000074">The failure to respect that undertaking is a big breach of a solemn understanding. It troubles the Liberal Democrats, as we have heard. They have constructed a new theology on the point, and we all heard the remarkable contribution by their leader. He said that he would vote against the Government on a referendum clause, except if they were going to lose, in which case he would vote with the Government. These are matters of high principle,  <br>

and the knockabout sounds childish and trivial, but that is why this House is marginalised too often&#151;it is not even held in contempt, but marginalised. We have become the backcloth for the Executive to parade around our Parliament, the country and the world. The House no longer engages in debates of substance, such as whether these general thematic debates should take precedence over the very substance of the Bill&#151;the clause stand part debates and so on that should inform the general debate. We should hear the arguments and then have the general debate. That was a point well made by the Liberal Democrat spokesperson. We have things the wrong way round.</p>

As colleagues know, Malta has enormous problems as a result of illegal immigration and human trafficking in the Mediterranean by organised criminals; those problems stretch beyond the resources of that small country. If there was not European co-operation to help that small nation address the serious, important human tragedies that affect many of those illegal immigrants&#151;if we did not seek to address those problems on a pan-European basis&#151;it would not only be irresponsible, but would worsen our difficulties in places such as the constituency of the hon.

Through our co-operation with Malta, we found out that she had claimed asylum in Malta four years ago. She had to be deported to Malta, her first port of call. We already have that sort of co-operation, but we need to explore the issue further in the time for debate on that theme, which I think is sufficient.</p>

 Of course I accept that point. Most importantly, the treaty makes it crystal clear that the UK will be able to choose whether to participate on justice and home affairs measures, which cover visas, immigration, asylum, judicial and police co-operation, and criminal matters. A debate of substance ought to take place on that, and I can certainly see the argument for it being partly the subject of a themed debate.</p>

My constituency springs to mind; it is a significant energy user because of the chemical industry there. We need a proper, structured solution to the unfairness in the energy markets across Europe; nowhere is that felt more keenly than in north-west England. The Lisbon treaty provides the EU with a dedicated legal base from which to tackle the liberalisation of the energy market, so that we can promote renewables and so on. That must be good. That is a powerful reason why energy ought to be the subject of part of the themed debates. I could take the House through the other sections of the motion, but in fairness to other colleagues who want to speak, I shall not.</p>

Of course, Members on both sides of the House must scrutinise the Government, but we must also accept that we have a growing volume of constituency duties.

The most significant difference is that the official Opposition&#151;the Fidesz alliance, which is a Conservative grouping&#151;agreed with the Government that the treaty should go through. There was no attempt by the Opposition to oppose the treaty just because they were the Opposition: they took a responsible approach as a result of negotiations that took place not in a few hours on the floor of the Hungarian Parliament but over a number of years, and began with the process that resulted in Hungary&#146;s accession to the EU&#151;in which I played a small part.</p>

I suspect that as the rest of the countries undertake their own procedures, there will be a spectrum of approaches. However, there will not be many countries, if any, that spend more hours than us dealing with the matter in their debating chamber. There are many other types of Committee process. On reflection, when we look at this in future, perhaps we will see whether there are any lessons to be learned from the processes adopted elsewhere.</p>

 For someone who is labouring the point, perhaps I should resist giving in, and stop taking any further interventions from the hon. Gentleman.

The Minister said that it would give an opportunity to debate all the issues. What opportunity? Perhaps the Minister will address the point when he replies to the debate. What opportunity would we not have if we did not have this form of timetabled debate? What opportunity would this form of debate give that we would not have even if we were discussing amendments rather than having thematic debates? The answer, of course, is that there is no such opportunity. The Minister gave the game away when he said that the motion was to test the Government&#146;s policy on the EU generally. The debates are not about that: they are for testing how the treaty will be implemented into United Kingdom law. Under the Government&#146;s motion, we will spend less time discussing that than what the Government want to discuss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08012837000051">As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) pointed out, the motion will put the Minister at the Dispatch Box in prime time, at the beginning of every day of debates on the treaty, as the discussion of amendments never would. That is a coincidence, of course; I am sure that the Minister will discover that only as the debates unfold. The Minister will be allowed to speak generally on topics of his own choosing instead of having to address amendments tabled by hon. Members. The Government have clearly been driven to table the motion for presentational reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08012837000052">Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) told me quietly in the Chamber that a great deal of thought must have gone into how the debate should be structured. I imagine that the spin doctors&#151;although the Prime Minister pretends that he does not have any&#151;had quite a say in the drafting of the motion. They would have been saying, &#147;Look, if we go into a Maastricht-style debate, we&#146;ll lose control of the agenda. How can we control the news agenda?&#148; They will control it by having the themed debates; each day, the Government will know exactly what they can say. They will make the case that they want to make, rather than address subjects raised by amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08012837000053">The thing about amendments, unless they involve the Government clearing up their own mess in a Bill, is that the Government have to answer points made by people who are not in the Government. The beauty of the procedure that the Government have chosen is that the first three hours of every day will be spent debating subjects that they have chosen. It is the complete reversal of how a Committee stage should operate.</p>

 I fully endorse the Minister&#146;s sentiment, but I would like to make two points. First, if we wanted to elevate the discussion in this country about the general principles of the treaty, we would make sure as a House that we honoured the promise that we all made at the last election&#151;to have a referendum. However, the Government have for some reason abandoned that promise. I suspect that that has something to do with the fact that they do not really want to have a debate about the substance of the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08012837000056">Secondly, I put it to the Minister that the debates on the Maastricht treaty began with the public being alienated and disengaged from the process in Parliament, but as the treaty was scrutinised in such detail, as the disputes were inevitably covered in the press and on television, and as those disputes were often on matters of very close voting, they began to command public attention and to change public opinion, because in the end the detail of the law matters, as well as the principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08012837000057">I do not want to go on incessantly but just to make the point that the idea that the Government are doing something kind to the public and to this House by seeking to impose their agenda and control the agenda is complete nonsense. They want the opportunity to control the agenda, they are taking the agenda away from more impartial witnesses such as the Speaker&#146;s Panel and the Clerks so as to determine the order of events, they are unnaturally restricting the debate on the implementation of the treaty, and in the end they are not only strengthening the case for the other place to have extended and protracted debates on all the matters that will inevitably remain undiscussed in this House but strengthening the case for a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08012837000058">It is an irony that the very part of the procedure on day 11 that we hope will allow maximum time for debating the very important question of the referendum is itself being restricted, because the Government do not want discussed the fact that this treaty is almost identical to the constitution. That is the substantive point that the Government are running away from. I ask anybody who disputes that to explain to this House, in the limited time that we have available during these debates&#151;perhaps the Minister can put it in a few words to encourage us to vote for his motion&#151;just what, in a word, is so substantially different in the way that this treaty will operate from the way that the constitution would have operated. I cannot see it; I do not think that anybody can. Yes, we may have different architecture&#151;different pillars, girders and construction&#151;but in the end the building will be the same. Unless the Government can make the case that this treaty will lead to substantially different outcomes than would have arisen from the implementation of the constitution, we will know that their whole position is, frankly, a lie.</p>

so-called themed debates of crucial issues that need to be addressed. To my mind, the most crucial issue is the implementation of the treaty into United Kingdom law. All that those themes amount to is a collection of discussions that could have taken place in a generalised Adjournment debate of the kind that we had just before Christmas.</p>

It is made that much worse because the new clauses are stuck at the back end of this operation and are to be dealt with on the same day, with only a moment of interruption, as the referendum clause. That means that essential questions that need to be examined will not be, such as the implications for the supremacy of Parliament and the fact that, once the treaty has gone through, based on previous examples, there would be no reversal of the acquis communautaire and no way to reverse it except through the condition set down in my new clauses about</p>

I am concerned that under the Government&#146;s proposals, such matters will be dealt with at the end of our considerations without proper time for discussion, so it is more than likely that they will be pushed out by discussions on the referendum. If the supremacy of Parliament itself is to be put at that stop-end, there is very little future for this Parliament at all.</p>

Looking at the manner in which the motion has been put forward, it is impossible to find any rational reason in the context of discussion. Discussion was the system described by Bagehot, whom I think could still be regarded as one of the greatest authorities on Parliament and the constitution, if not the greatest. He said that we have a parliamentary system that is government by parliamentary discussion, and that responsible government is decided by votes on decisions, which rest on confidence and trust. Is this government by discussion? No. Is it responsible government? No. Is there confidence and trust? No, no, no. Implementation of law is not implementation of policy. In the context of procedure, I also cite Main&#146;s &#147;Ancient Law&#148;, where it was said that justice is to be found in the &#147;interstices of procedure&#148;. It is not possible for us to do justice in this House under a procedure of the sort before us today.</p>

today is a true corruption of our democratic system&#151;a reduction of Bagehot&#146;s description of government by discussion to a farce. Another great constitutional commentator, Sir Courtney Ilbert, stated</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08012844000008">That was said in the 20th century and repeated in an important, authoritative text recently, which stated that things are the same today as they were when Sir Courtney Ilbert made his comment. The Stuarts were very little different, hence the rebellion that took place against them in the civil war, and that continued even after 1660, with the removal of James II and what led to the beginnings of our modern system of government. Those are the issues at stake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80128-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08012844000009">Anyone who thinks that analogies with the 17th century are inappropriate should remember that the powers being arrogated today by the Prime Minister and the European Union&#151;a thoroughly undemocratic body&#151;are in no way different from the kind of powers arrogated by the Stuarts in their own time. Indeed, the secret treaty of Dover was made in return for money that was received from the French explicitly in order to prevent Parliament from being recalled so that there would be no proper discussion. That was what it was all about.</p>

Such consideration is only profitless for those who do not see what is at stake as the Bill is rammed through by the Whips without proper discussion.

Now, we are going back, like ectoplasm, into a dark age through reverting to procedures that override our fundamental freedom of speech and proper discussion, which is the means whereby the people can be governed.

If we consider the length of some of the speeches that we have heard today, it is difficult to see how we shall properly be able to scrutinise and debate the large number of amendments that are going to be tabled after the generic debate that will take place each day that these matters are to be debated in the House. The Government have been dishonest. They let it be known last October that there would be 20 days of debate. That figure was leaked in the national broadsheet newspapers. The figure then came down to 15 days, and we now know that it is to be 12. Even then, there will be limits placed on the length of the debates.

Members have said. A huge number of amendments have already been tabled, and there will certainly be many more. We will simply not be able to do them justice, and the House will be abdicating part of its responsibility in expecting the other place to debate the issues that we do not see fit to discuss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80128-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08012844000037">Not long ago, the House was given far too little time to debate the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. Indeed, the Leader of the House admitted that too little time had been given and promised to learn the lessons of that experience. As we look at the motion before us today, it seems that those lessons were not learned&#151;or, if they were, that they were discarded rather too easily. The Opposition proposal for an extra six days of debate therefore has much to commend it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80128-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08012844000038">I also approve of splitting the time much more equally between debating the detail and what have been termed the more thematic debates. I shall not seek to compete with the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), whose comments carried a great deal of weight, but I rather share her sentiments. Since I became a Member of the House, I have heard a number of Ministers say that the purpose of the law is to send out a message. Well, it is not. Our purpose is to pass laws, which have to be debated in detail. As other hon. Members have pointed out, what happens to people charged with a criminal offence or facing the civil courts will not be decided on the basis of principles, themes or thematic debates. It is the detail and the specific points of law, and hence the quality of the job we do here in Parliament, that makes the difference. That is why it so important that we have enough time to debate these issues in detail.</p>

in a parliamentary democracy, with the clear implication that it is here and in the other place where these matters should be debated. If we follow that through, those who argue that we should not have a referendum, but should debate these issues in this House should surely want us to have adequate time and flexibility to do so. The Government are trying to have it both ways. They say that it is inappropriate to have a referendum because these matters should be debated in Parliament, yet when it comes to the parliamentary debate, the Government are not prepared to give Parliament the time and flexibility it needs.</p>

Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) say earlier that he agreed that the Bill and this treaty did have constitutional significance. Indeed, he said that in arguing why these matters should be debated in a Committee of the whole House. Therefore, it is surely incumbent on the Government to allow a full and proper debate.</p>

 As the record will show, I said that we have always taken the view that if legislation has constitutional significance, there should be a referendum.

Paragraph (4) of the business motion deals with Standing Order No. 24, on which you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, made an interesting ruling. I come back to it not because I believe it is extraordinarily likely on the balance of probabilities that our debates on the treaty will throw something up that will require a debate under that Standing Order, but because an important point of principle is at stake. I suspect that if the motion is passed tonight, it will not be long before other programming motions are presented containing the same clause, and I think that that would be a retrograde step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80128-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08012844000044">I stand to be corrected by the Minister, but my reading of Standing Order No. 24 and the motion suggests that the motion makes a significant change in removing not just Mr. Speaker&#146;s right to make decisions on whether we should have debates, but the right of a Member to rise at the start of business and apply for a debate under the standing order.

Given that on most of the allotted days the hours of business are protected, it would surely be appropriate for the debate on the standing order to take place at the start of business on the following day&#151;or, if Mr. Speaker decided that it was sufficiently urgent, later the same day&#151;and for proceedings on the treaty to commence afterwards. I feel that given the frequency with which such urgent matters arise, if a matter were important and urgent enough for Mr. Speaker to see fit to grant a debate, it should take precedence over discussion of the treaty.</p>

Indeed, it might not be this Minister who happened to be at the Dispatch Box on a future occasion; it might be one of his hon. Friends, who might not be so reasonable. I think that Members would be much happier if paragraph (4) were not there, and it would be helpful if before we embarked on tomorrow&#146;s business, another business motion were tabled removing it.</p>

Both have said that there is insufficient time for this matter to be debated. We have heard that the extra six days is a mere pettifogging addition that the hon. Gentleman will spurn.

There appears to be no time limit for day nine; the motion does not even say that the business will run until the moment of interruption, although I assume that that is the case. Day 11 is the critical day, the day on which the Minister himself said we were likely to be given a vote on a referendum, but as things stand the business could be compressed heavily by Government statements.

That would be 54 minutes to debate articles dealing with the whole range of policy and law on asylum, illegal immigration and co-operation between Governments.

issues of migration and asylum, and crime and justice. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has just spoken about that eloquently, so I shall not repeat what he said. I merely point out that he informed the House that that impossible task insults our very democracy.</p>

In respect of that matter, article 3 of the consolidated version of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union states:</p>
<a name="80128-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08012844000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Union shall...have exclusive competence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08012844000074">Fishing is an important issue, and we should be given an allotted day to debate it. The common fisheries policy has virtually destroyed our fishing industry. Under CFP rules fish conservation has been decimated, and more fish are thrown back dead or landed illegally than are landed legitimately. Britain provides three quarters of the fish stocks and two thirds of the waters but gets only one eighth of the fish by value. We should programme business to debate that matter on a specific day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08012844000075">The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) talked about the importance of debating transport&#151;rail, air travel and space policy&#151;and that should be given a specific dedicated debate. Employment and industrial relations issues should also be given specific allotted time, as should the charter of fundamental rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08012844000076">As I have said, the Opposition amendment is far from ideal, but it is designed to recommend itself to the Government. I hope that they will examine it, accept the good sense that it contains and go through the Lobby with us to support it tonight. They should do so because it offers six additional days&#146; debate on particularly important areas. It offers this House the opportunity to debate, in specifically allotted time, asylum and immigration separately from justice and crime matters. Given the importance that asylum and migration have for our constituents, we should examine them specifically. Those things put enormous pressure on our public services, infrastructure and housing, and deserve to be examined specifically on a separate allotted day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08012844000077">The amendment also offers a specific allotted day to discuss the economy, social security and public services, which are important matters, and another to discuss foreign policy. Given the changes that this constitution&#151; that is what it is&#151;forces on this country, and particularly the impact that an EU Foreign Minister will have on our foreign policy, we need a specific allotted day to debate that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08012844000078">The amendment also offers a specific day to discuss the new EU President and the EU&#146;s legal personality, and another to examine the structures of the European Union and the distribution of competences between the EU and member states. In particular, it offers a specific allotted day to debate the provisions concerning national Parliaments. That brings me to the subject of the referendum. My constituents, like every other Member&#146;s constituents, were promised a referendum on the constitution by the three main parties. This is the constitution, and we deserve and we need a referendum on it. It is a matter of trust. The Labour party will have to answer to those constituents when it presents its manifesto at the next election for the lies that it told in its manifesto in the last election.</p>

 Today&#146;s debate essentially revolves around one question&#151;whether the Prime Minister will keep his word and Parliament will be able to debate this treaty in any depth. As has clearly been shown by Member after Member, the Government programme for the Bill is just a parliamentary gesture and not what was promised to this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08012844000080">First, we had the broken promise on the referendum, and now we have a broken promise on detailed scrutiny of this momentous Bill in this House. Ministers seem not to want to listen to anyone. The European Scrutiny Committee has reported that the treaty was negotiated in a way that could not have been better designed to marginalise the role of national Parliaments. Now Ministers, through this motion, are setting out to marginalise Parliament all over again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08012844000081">The Government are losing the people&#146;s trust on so many issues, so what do they do on this critical issue? They effectively ignore the public, the trade unions, their own Back Benchers tonight and the Select Committee, and plough on regardless. That is borne out by the debate. Of the 15 contributions so far, only three have supported the Government and one of those was the Minister for Europe himself. I shall return to the subject of his contribution, but I wish to comment on the other contributions we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08012844000082">My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) made another powerful contribution to the debate, as I am sure the whole House will agree. Among other things, he pointed out the absolute absurdity of attempting to debate the extremely complex provisions on criminal justice and home affairs that are embedded in the treaty in just one day. The very idea that we can debate 27 amendments on that subject in 90 minutes tomorrow evening is itself a farce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08012844000083">The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) was representative of the frustration felt among Labour Members about the way in which this is being handled. He directly criticised the Government&#146;s approach and he made the point that not enough time will be made available for Back Benchers&#146; contributions. For his own reasons, he highlighted especially the charter of fundamental rights and criticised the Government for failing to mention it in their motion&#151;something that we attempt to rectify in our amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08012844000084">We then heard from the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), who surprised the House twice over&#151;first, because he spoke for less than half an hour, and secondly, because he said that the Liberal Democrats would vote against the Government tonight. That is a welcome change with regard to this treaty. He also said, generously, that his party would support our amendment. He made the case for the importance of detailed scrutiny of the Bill, and we look forward to enjoying his support in the Lobby tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08012844000085">We then heard from the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), who accused us of nitpicking over procedure. That seems to be at variance with the Prime Minister&#146;s promise that the House would be allowed to debate the treaty line by line and in detail. I ask her and her colleagues who support the Government whether they want the House to debate the treaty in detail or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08012844000086">We then heard from my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), who brought his considerable experience in the House to bear on the debate. He pointed out, wisely, that the Prime Minister&#146;s pledge to put Parliament back at the centre of our national life is completely at odds with the motion before the House. He was followed by the redoubtable hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who asked a crucial question: whom does the business motion most benefit? She powerfully answered her own question&#151;it benefits the Government, and not the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08012844000087">We then heard a passionate speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who pointed out to the Government that Parliament&#146;s standing in the eyes of the public can only be undermined by initiatives such as the Bill, and I entirely agree. We then heard from the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), who said that timing was more important than time. That is an interesting observation, given that a major leak from the Slovenian presidency today revealed that there are about 30 unanswered questions on how the treaty will work in practice; that is embarrassing timing for the Government.</p>

Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) pointed out that the motion was designed more from the point of view of news management than for the convenience of the House, and I entirely agree. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) gave us an historical tour d&#146;horizon of English and British law. He memorably described the Government&#146;s position as a fetid sludge. I have a funny feeling that we will hear from him again once or twice as the debates continue. I may be wrong, but I would encourage the House not to bet against me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08012844000089">We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton), who rightly mentioned his long service in the House, and who referred to, among other things, the weaknesses in the Government&#146;s red lines. My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) doggedly challenged the Minister on the lack of protected time on the day when we debate the referendum, and got a concession out of him; I shall return to that point later. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made an important point that reinforced what my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks, said about the severe lack of time in which to discuss the key provisions on criminal justice and home affairs. My parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), rounded off the Back Benchers&#146; contributions by reminding the Government of their pledge on the referendum, among other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08012844000090">I now come back to the Minister&#146;s contribution. He was courteous to take so many interventions, but despite his courtesy he completely failed to convince the House of his argument. He gave a commitment that on the day we debate the referendum, the business will be protected. That commitment was not in the Government&#146;s motion, and we therefore welcome it. On timetabling, he said that the Government would be flexible and would look at matters almost on a daily basis. Given that we begin debating the treaty in detail tomorrow, if he really wants to be flexible on a daily basis, the best thing that he can do is withdraw the Government&#146;s motion tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08012844000091">The Minister really got into trouble over Standing Order No. 24. After frequent interventions and points of order, it was eventually established that if the Government&#146;s motion is passed tonight, and if an emergency occurs on a day when the House is debating the treaty of Lisbon as set down in the programme, the decision on whether to have a debate under Standing Order No. 24 will effectively rest with the Government and not with you, Mr. Speaker. That is a considerable change to our established procedures. It took a long while to wangle that from the Minister, but eventually he admitted it, and that is another reason to vote against the motion.</p>

<p><a name="st_o503"><a name="08012844000092"><a name="80128-0020.htm_spmin0"><a name="08012844000135"><b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon)</b>

 The Chief Whip shakes his head; he should read the ruling given by Mr. Deputy Speaker in <i> Hansard </i>tomorrow. The matter does not rest there. The Government&#146;s case for avoiding a referendum rests largely on providing &#147;detailed parliamentary scrutiny&#148; , as they put it, of the Lisbon treaty in the House, but the Minister completely failed to justify the abandonment of the referendum pledge, on which almost every Member to the House was elected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08012844000094">The marginalisation of Parliament is even more disturbing given the leak of a confidential Slovenian EU presidency strategy paper today. It sets out a raft of areas in which the detail of what the treaty will mean in practice has yet to be decided. That applies to decisions on the exact role of the new EU President and the high representative; on the powers of Eurojust and Europol; and to the exact meaning of the solidarity clause should an EU member be subject to a terrorist attack. Those are the very areas that Parliament should wish to scrutinise, yet the process in which the Government have collaborated is designed to avoid exactly that scrutiny. How can the House question the details of the role of the new EU President, if those details are still being worked out? Effectively, as the think-tank, Open Europe, has argued, we are being asked to trust the Government to sign a blank cheque. I do not think that we should sign it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08012844000095">On one level, the Government have already lost the argument about the treaty. Almost every impartial observer has concluded that in substance it is essentially the same as the EU constitution, and that it will mean a substantial increase in the EU&#146;s powers. The programme motion is an admission of the extent of the Government&#146;s defeat. It cuts time for debate on matters of genuine importance in the treaty&#151;justice and home affairs; the EU President; the EU Foreign Minister; the EU&#146;s new legal status; changes to defence arrangements; and the profound changes to the treaties&#151;to a minimum. Instead, it ekes out time for talk about other subjects, some of which are important in their own right but to which the treaty makes very little difference at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08012844000096">Ministers are behaving rather like a student who, when asked a question to which he does not know the answer, gives an answer to a completely different query.

Our amendment to the motion would give the House the bare minimum of debate that the Bill merits. It would ensure that, as promised by the  <br>

<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 123</b><br>
Government, there would be 20 days of debate in the Commons. Instead of the absurdity of trying to discuss the vast and far-reaching changes in justice and home affairs in one day, we would have at least two days to do so. Let us remember that the Government&#146;s position is that the establishment of a common EU asylum policy and a common EU immigration policy by treaty does not even merit a day&#146;s debate in itself, which is indefensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08012844000097">The amendment would allow greater consideration of the major changes that the treaty will make in foreign and defence policy, including the role of the EU Foreign Minister, the diplomatic service, the loss of vetoes in foreign affairs, and the creation for the first time of a common European defence policy. Those issues surely merit more than one day&#146;s debate. The amendment would provide two days to consider the profound legal changes that the treaty effects such as the granting to the EU of its own legal personality; the abolition of the intergovernmental status of criminal justice; and the declaration on the primacy of EU law. The amendment would allow some debate on the distribution of powers between EU and member states brought about by the treaty, yet the Government, according to the motion, think that such discussion is completely unnecessary, even though the treaty, for the first time, lists the EU&#146;s areas of competence and their nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08012844000098">The amendment would ensure, too, that the charter of fundamental rights and the British protocol pertaining to it are debated, whereas Ministers, who are already very sensitive on this issue, clearly did not want the charter even to be mentioned in the programme for debate. The amendment would allow some discussion of the treaty&#146;s effects on national Parliaments. The European Scrutiny Committee has repeatedly drawn attention to the obligations that the treaty places on the House, but Ministers seem to think that there should not be any debate about that, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para29"><a name="08012844000099">Our amendment rectifies a basic structural flaw in the Government&#146;s programme. One and a half hours to debate amendments is practically unworkable. It prevents detailed discussion of the treaty, and as anyone remotely familiar with European treaties knows, the details matter. In our view, 20 days is not enough to do justice to the treaty. A case could easily be made for more debate and, as confirmed by the House of Commons Library, Maastricht, by comparison, was debated for 29 days. The programme motion, however, offers less than half that time. We have sought to allow the House to vote for a programme that simply holds the Government to their original word. The amendment would not wreck the Bill; it would simply allow the House to do the job that the Government promised that it would do in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para30"><a name="08012844000100">The whole story of the treaty is shabby: it was cooked up behind closed doors; it was rammed through to avoid public debate, with almost any deal being struck to evade the people&#146;s verdict in a referendum; and it was signed in circumstances of considerable national embarrassment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80128-0020.htm_para31"><a name="08012844000101">The Government know that they are losing the argument. To take one recent example, this week&#146;s Charlemagne column in <i> The Economist</i> stated:</p>

 The Lisbon treaty is the fifth such treaty since the United Kingdom&#146;s entry into the EU in 1973. It is good that procedures for scrutiny evolved and improved with each of those treaties. In the past, Governments of all complexions sought to use guillotine motions to organise discussions on Bills to implement EU treaties, if necessary.</p>

I have heard what hon. Members have said about the lack of time and the bids for more time to debate amendments and themes, and I have a great deal of sympathy for such bids and arguments. One is tempted to say, &#147;God save us from experiments and innovations when it comes to the proceedings of this House.&#148; I have been here long enough to know that, but I also know that the more straightforward business motion for the Nice treaty was adopted without debate. Today&#146;s motion represents a significant innovation in procedure, and it is good that we have the opportunity to debate it fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0801296000010">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary set out the scope and nature of the Lisbon treaty on Second Reading, when he made it clear that it will improve the way in which the EU works. It will adapt the EU&#146;s institutions to a Union of 27; it will ensure that the voices of Europe&#146;s nations are heard more loudly in foreign policy; it will bring national Parliaments into day-to-day EU decision making to strengthen subsidiarity; and it will focus the EU on the big external challenges, such as climate change and migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0801296000011">If the treaty is unique, then it is in this regard: it marks the end of the long process of institutional reform&#151;if the treaty is ratified around Europe, then that process is well and truly over. It will make valuable changes, and it will turn Europe from institutional reform to the real priorities of its citizens. We need to reflect that balance in our discussions in this House, which is something that the programme motion provides.</p>

There will be two days of debate on clauses 3 to 7, which will include discussion of the passerelles. Time will also be devoted entirely to discussing amendments to the Bill. Furthermore, a full day will be set aside to discuss clause 8, as requested by the Select Committees. </p>

It is established practice when a Bill is in Committee or on Report to group amendments by theme. The motion provides a more structured and themed approach to the Committee stage. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Europe made clear in his opening statement, it is important that, as with amending treaties, thorough scrutiny of the legislation is conducted by debate in Parliament, not by referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0801296000016">There is an important case to be made: the Lisbon treaty is good for Britain and good for the British people.

The Government&#146;s structured approach to the Committee stage will enable the House to debate both the provisions of the treaty and the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0801296000017">The new, so-called themed structure should make the process of scrutinising the Lisbon treaty much more open and accessible to the whole House.

Will he meet us on that?</p>

 There is room for flexibility on the balance of time in each of the debates; I certainly would not deny the hon. Gentleman the justice of that. It is possible, and I shall try to explain how it might come about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0801296000020">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) quoted &#147;Erskine May&#148; at length. Long ago, Governments began to evolve programmes of business in response to public need and, increasingly, to democratic pressure. As the process developed, questions of balance between business and time&#151;the commonplace of modern procedure&#151;became acute as never before. Thomas Erskine May&#146;s fertile, if cautious, procedural imagination was there to help him to find solutions. He said that organisation was not less essential in a senate than in a factory. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who quoted May at great length, will agree that he should come to terms with that piece of wisdom.</p>

<p><a name="st_o510"><a name="0801296000021"><a name="80128-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0801296001287"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 I concluded my remarks on that matter by quoting from the current edition of &#147;Erskine May&#148;; there was no departure on the fundamental principles of government by discussion.</p>

 We could talk at great length about the editions of &#147;Erskine May&#148;, but I have just quoted the hon. Gentleman a bit of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0801296000023">Some right hon. and hon. Members have said that only amendments should be taken, but that would hinder the consideration of the treaty. The Bill is short and general; amendments cannot target treaty innovations adequately. We are concerned that we should scrutinise the treaty as well as the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0801296000024">My hon. Friend the Minister for Europe began to describe the flexibility that was mentioned a little earlier. Paragraph (6) of the motion gives the House the flexibility to alter the balance between themed debate and amendments, and between different days. Until as late as the rising of the House on the sitting day before an allotted day, the Government will be able to respond to requests to allow more time on themed debates or more time on amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o512"><a name="0801296000025"><a name="80128-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="0801296001289"><b>Mr. Jenkin:</b>

 No, I will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0801296000027">The response would take the form of a motion amending the business motion&#151;specifically, amending the table. Provided that that amendment did not reduce the overall time for debate on the treaty of Lisbon, the question would be put forthwith, and would therefore not disrupt business unduly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0801296000028">The supplementary business motion amending the table to the business motion can be taken under paragraph (6) of the business motion. As I said, if it does not reduce overall time, it can be tabled as late as the night before the relevant allotted day.</p>

 No, I will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0801296000031">Hon. Members asked about the provision in paragraph (4) of the business of the House motion, which prevents an emergency debate from taking place on the day allotted to the treaty until after the conclusion of proceedings on the treaty. They complained that that was a novel way of proceeding that takes the initiative in the matter of emergency debates away from the Speaker, but that is not true. This is not a new provision in substance at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0801296000032">The existing provisions for programme motions under Standing Order 83I(4) already provide for delaying emergency debates until after the end of programmed business. Paragraph (4) of the motion simply replicates that for the proceedings on the treaty. The only reason that the motion had to make express provision for this instead of simply applying Standing Order 83I(4) is that when the House agreed to the present sessional experiment changing the arrangements for emergency debates under Standing Order 24, it failed to make the necessary consequential amendments to Standing Order 83I(4). Paragraph (4) of the motion therefore makes the necessary provision to make the existing procedure for programmed business work for proceedings on the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0801296000033">Of course, if some extreme emergency arose so that the House desperately wanted to abandon business on the treaty for the day and proceed to the emergency debate, it would be open to the House to conclude the day&#146;s proceedings on the treaty very fast and get on to the emergency debate. In those circumstances, the Government would consider&#151;</p>

It is true that, as drafted, the motion does not guarantee any particular number of hours of debate on any of those days. The length of debate will be determined by the moment of interruption in the normal way.

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0801296000046">The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) alleged that there is not enough time to debate the substantive issues in the treaty. He backed that up with a raft of allegations and familiar scare stories&#151;we have heard it all before. Let me take just a few examples. In relation to justice and home affairs, he said that the treaty will give Eurojust the right to launch prosecutions in this country. That is completely wrong&#151;it will not have the power to initiate prosecutions. Eurojust is not a threat. In June, the Home Affairs Committee concluded in a report:</p>
<a name="80128-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="0801296001257"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Eurojust provides an excellent example of what can be done to build mutual trust between practitioners and through them Member States in one another&#146;s systems. This kind of contact and practical co-operation is absolutely critical in enhancing trust and co-operation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80128-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0801296000047">But the right hon. Gentleman never lets the facts get in the way of a good story. He also alleged that we do not support the creation of a European public prosecutor. That is absolutely right&#151;we do not. That is why we have ensured that we have retained unanimity, with a UK veto, on the creation of a European public prosecutor. If a smaller group of countries wishes to go ahead with that idea, it will not affect the United Kingdom unless we choose to opt in.</p>

 Presidential elections in Lebanon have been postponed for the 13th time. The country has been without a president since 23 November last year, and the next possible date for Parliament to meet is 11 February. That means more than 11 weeks of failure to agree on a way forward, and political paralysis. It is, by common consent, the worst political crisis since the civil war in the country ended in 1990. It also has the potential to spill on to the streets of Lebanon, with unknown consequences for the country and, perhaps more important, for the wider middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0801296001221">That is not a fanciful statement. We can confirm our worst fears by noting recent events. Yesterday eight opposition supporters were shot dead in street protests in Beirut. Accusations abound: some say that the army bears responsibility, and there is also talk of &#147;unknown gunmen&#148;. Amal, the political party representing the protesters, says that it is not yet clear who is responsible, but the situation remains very tense. I know that troops are on the alert for any further violence, although I understand that calm has returned to the streets of the capital to some extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0801296001222">As if that were not enough, last Friday a senior police officer who was involved in investigations of recent assassinations was himself assassinated, along with three others, two of them totally innocent civilians. In the past three years there have been 30 bombings in Lebanon. Since UNIFIL&#151;the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which is supposed to be patrolling the southern border&#151;arrived in the country in September last year, there have been three attacks on its forces and six soldiers have died. A car bomb recently struck a United States embassy vehicle. Although, fortunately, no one from the embassy was injured, three innocent bystanders were killed. On the eve of President Bush&#146;s visit to the region earlier this month, two rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. While there is confusion over whether Hezbollah or one of the Palestinian parties was responsible, it will be ominous if that is repeated, and even more ominous if we see an increase in the number of rockets going into Israel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0801296001223">In the past two years, four Government Members of Parliament have been assassinated, and during that time no one has been arrested or charged with any of the crimes. Since the period of instability began, opposition supporters have blockaded the Parliament and launched regular demonstrations in the capital. Indeed, yesterday&#146;s events began as a demonstration against power cuts in southern Beirut. There was a transport strike last week and there are, of course, constant threats of civil disobedience and a campaign to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0801296001224">Sadly, early hopes that the Taif agreement introducing the confessional system of politics and how Parliament operates would deliver strength and stability in the country have been dashed. The reasons for that go back a long way&#151;many complex issues are involved&#151;but the reality is that we can see in more recent events how the spiral towards conflict has happened. In 2004, the  <br>

<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 140</b><br>
Syrian authorities rammed through an extension to ex-President Lahoud&#146;s term of office, causing great consternation. In 2005, Prime Minister Hariri was assassinated, which further&#151;and intensively&#151;polarised the country. That led to a popular backlash. Elections following his assassination brought in the 14 March coalition and led to Syria&#146;s withdrawal, but the hopes at that time for a fresh start and a new initiative were dashed in 2006 with the invasion of Israeli troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0801296001225">It is estimated that 1,200 Lebanese and 160 Israelis died during that invasion. Unfortunately, Hezbollah, which was the cause of the instability in southern Lebanon, was able to claim victory as the defender of Lebanon. That enhanced not only its position in the wider middle east but its role in Lebanon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0801296001226">That enhanced role following the invasion led to Opposition demands for a blocking majority in the Government of Lebanon. That was not possible; indeed, it should not be possible, and we must stand up for the right of the Government to govern. However, the consequence of not agreeing that was the withdrawal of the Opposition, and political paralysis has followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0801296001227">The prospects of avoiding further instability are bleak. Prime Minister Siniora, who has led the Government during the recent period, stated a few days ago that Lebanon is going through the most difficult and dangerous of times. That is saying something for a country with Lebanon&#146;s history. I do not think it is going too far to say that civil conflict remains a genuine possibility. The question I pose tonight is: what can Parliament, and more importantly the Government, do to help? International pressure to resolve the instability is crucial&#151;pressure to keep up the dialogue, and to keep insisting that the parties to that dialogue be prepared to compromise to find a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0801296001228">The United Kingdom is well placed to assert such pressure. We play a prominent role in both the European Union, which should be doing more, and, perhaps more importantly, the United Nations Security Council. The UK has a unique experience in the middle east, and although it might be surprising to some, on the basis of my experience it is clear that the UK has prestige in Lebanon, even now after the Israeli invasion, which can be brought to bear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0801296001229">Ministerial visits are always welcome in Lebanon as showing a commitment to that country and to finding a way forward. The Prime Minister&#146;s representative, Michael Williams, has recently visited, as has the Minister, and it is important that we carry on doing so. It would show solidarity and help to keep up the pressure if Ministers were able to visit over the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para11"><a name="0801296001230">I understand that Prime Minister Siniora has requested the opportunity to come to the United Kingdom to report on the situation. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on that request and expedite such a visit. I know that Prime Minister Siniora wants to keep the UK in touch with what is going on in his country, and to elicit its support to help ensure the quickest possible resolution of the conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para12"><a name="0801296001231">There appears to be a developing consensus around the election of General Michel Suleiman as a possible next President; we have to build on that. Although the process has been difficult, it is critically important that there appears now to be cross-party support for that,  <br>

and we need to do what we can to ensure that it leads to the rest of the package necessary to resolve the conflict. In my estimation, the mediation of the Arab League is a positive development in this regard. Although it has so far been unsuccessful&#151;we understand the intensity of the differences between the political parties in the country&#151;it is the only game in town at present. If we are to find a way forward, we need to get behind the work that the Arab League is doing not only in finding that presidential candidate, but in leading toward a Cabinet of national unity that can take the country forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para13"><a name="0801296001232">I hope that the Minister is alert to the need for United Kingdom support in finding a solution in Lebanon. I hope, too, that he is giving every assistance to the process that will need to be gone through&#151;the hard negotiations that will have to take place&#151;to deliver a solution in Lebanon. However, through his contacts in the United Nations and the European Union, and through the very good relationship that I know exists with the French authorities, who have played such a prominent role in the country, he must be aware of what is happening and what more can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para14"><a name="0801296001233">That is the essential question that Parliament wants to ask: given the concerns in the international community about the decline into conflict in Lebanon, what more can we do not only to resolve the situation in that difficult country, but to ensure that we do not see a developing conflagration in the wider middle east? Given the other negotiations going on in trying to develop a dialogue between the different parties, Lebanon really does not need to be a negative at this point. Will the Minister reassure us that everything is being done to help in that situation?</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) for raising the issue of Lebanon. We have shared in a number of debates in the past couple of weeks, and I know how passionately he feels not just about trying to stop the conflict, but about finding solutions to the frozen conflicts that have been going on for so long. I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the situation in Lebanon and on what the United Kingdom is doing to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para15"><a name="0801296001235">First, I am sure that the House will share my deep concern about the deteriorating security situation in Lebanon. As my hon. Friend told us, yesterday saw protests that left at least seven people dead. It is essential that all political leaders urge their supporters to remain calm and respect the rule of law. The UK is investing &#163;600,000 to train and equip the Lebanese armed forces to help them maintain public order and security during civil disturbances, while respecting human rights and limiting the risks of escalating violence. I hope that the reports that my hon. Friend has heard are not true&#151;I cannot believe that the Lebanese army is responsible for these deaths. It has acted incredibly responsibly over the past 12 months. We have teams on the ground in Beirut delivering the training to which I referred. We hope that this will have a direct effect on the Lebanese Government&#146;s ability to preserve law and order amid the current tense political environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para16"><a name="0801296001236">I also condemn utterly Friday&#146;s bomb attack in Beirut, which killed and injured several people, including Wissam Eid of the Lebanese internal security force. I express my sympathy and condolences to the families of those killed and injured. Captain Eid was involved in the investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, and his death must not be allowed to derail that important investigation or the work for justice in that case. A stable and prosperous Lebanon is an important component of our wider objectives of preventing conflict in the middle east and combating the threat of international terrorism in the region and, indeed, in the United Kingdom. A peaceful Lebanon is also crucial for all the communities in Lebanon, be they Christian, Sunni or Shi&#146;a. Resolving the current political crisis, combating extremism and supporting the Government of Lebanon in their efforts to promote security and stability are, and will remain, high priorities for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para17"><a name="0801296001237">I visited Lebanon last month to talk to political parties on both sides, to try to understand more closely the nature of the disagreements and to encourage the sides to work for a compromise. During my visit, I met politicians from the March 14 Government and the Opposition, and the head of the Lebanese armed forces, General Suleiman, who is the only candidate for President upon whom both sides can agree. I urged all parties involved to take advantage of the ongoing mediation efforts, and to work towards the election of a new President and the formulation of a functioning representative Government as soon as possible. I remain hopeful that a deal can be done, but it was clear from my discussions that a gulf of misunderstanding and mistrust lies between the sides. It is essential that all sides are able to overcome that in the interests of all communities in Lebanon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para18"><a name="0801296001238">I also went to see what remains of the Nahr El Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon. The camp was devastated by three months of intensive fighting last summer between the Lebanese armed forces and the extremist group, Fatah al-Islam. The sight would have reminded you, Mr. Speaker, of pictures of Stalingrad after the huge battle in world war two. I had never seen such devastation. I saw terrible devastation after the Israel-Lebanese&#151;or Israel-Hezbollah&#151;war of a year last July. It was an extraordinary sight. As somebody said to me there, Fatah al-Islam is neither Fatah nor Islam, but it is a very dangerous group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para19"><a name="0801296001239">The visit highlighted to me the suffering of those civilians caught up in the fighting&#151;30,000 of them in that camp have been displaced&#151;and, most of all, the bravery of the Lebanese army, which suffered the killing of more than 150 soldiers during the fighting last summer. We ought to remember that the country is awash with arms. When the so-called Fatah al-Islam went in there&#151;we do not know where it came from; it could have been Syria, but it might have been other places&#151;it did not have to take guns, cannon, grenades and rocket launchers, because those things were already there. They had been put there by Yasser Arafat&#146;s forces many years previously. Fatah al-Islam easily outgunned the Lebanese armed forces when they went to try to restore some degree of order to that area. It is a warning to all of us that this is an extraordinarily dangerous place. It is a tinderbox that could easily catch fire. Indeed, it remains a cause of deep concern, and it is an area in which the UK is looking to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para20"><a name="0801296001240">Palestinian refugee camps are also, of course, a breeding ground for extremists who seek to destabilise Lebanon and the wider region. I do not believe that those extremists have much support among the majority of Palestinians, or among the wider Lebanese population, but they are nevertheless seeking to strengthen the foothold they have among a small minority. We are working in camps at the grass roots level to counter that radicalisation. We are also working with the UN and the Government of Lebanon to counter the fundamental causes of the radicalisation by improving the physical, legal and economic conditions of the refugees, which are pretty appalling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para21"><a name="0801296001241">If I may, I shall give the House a brief update on the current political situation in Lebanon and its implications for the country&#146;s security and stability. As my hon. Friend told us, President Lahoud&#146;s mandate expired on 23 November 2007. Since then Lebanon has been without a president. Parliamentary votes to elect a successor have been delayed 13 times. Both the governing March 14 coalition and the Opposition have agreed on General Suleiman as candidate for the presidency, but the Opposition coalition are insisting on a package deal, involving not only agreement on a president, but on the distribution of seats in a Cabinet in a new national unity Government. That raising of the stakes has made getting an agreement even more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para22"><a name="0801296001242">It is essential that both sides continue to work to resolve their differences free from outside obstruction and interference. In particular, we call on Syria to respect Lebanon&#146;s sovereignty and its independent democratic institutions, as stated in numerous UN Security Council resolutions. Syria&#146;s actions in Lebanon, and its unacceptable internal human rights record, highlight the regime&#146;s lack of respect for democratic norms. In past months, we have seen a worrying deterioration in the human rights situation in Syria, with activists being detained simply for holding a meeting calling for greater democratic rights. There are reports that those activists are now being held in poor conditions. The use of torture also remains a serious concern, and there are several reports of other suspects dying during interrogation. We call on Syria to address that situation urgently. The British embassy in Damascus, working with other EU missions, continues to press the Syrians to improve conditions in general, as well to raise individual cases of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para23"><a name="0801296001243">The international community has a role in supporting Lebanese leaders to resolve the crisis. We have consistently supported efforts by France and the Arab League to help the Lebanese find a way out of the current impasse. My visit was aimed squarely at supporting those efforts, and at getting Lebanese leaders to take the necessary difficult decisions, in the interests of all the people of Lebanon. I remain firmly convinced that a deal is within reach, if the political will is there. We must continue to support and encourage those efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para24"><a name="0801296001244">Most recently, the Arab League has led international efforts to promote a resolution.

I pay tribute to Amr Moussa, the Arab League Secretary General, who subsequently visited Beirut in a renewed push. I hope that his  <br>

initiative succeeds and I urge the Lebanese leaders to seize the opportunity that Amr Moussa&#146;s leadership provides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para25"><a name="0801296001245">The UK is taking practical steps to encourage a resolution. We have been working closely with international partners, particularly with our partners on the UN Security Council and in the EU, to provide political support to mediation efforts. As well as my visit, the UK special representative to the middle east, Michael Williams&#151;an experienced diplomat&#151;visited Lebanon last year to help promote a resolution. Of course, the British ambassador in Beirut, Frances Guy&#151;a very talented and dedicated ambassador&#151;continues to meet the key political figures regularly. In addition, we hope that Prime Minister Siniora will visit London in the near future. I agree with my hon. Friend that it would be an important visit.</p>

 I am very heartened by what my hon. Friend has said so far. I hope that either the Prime Minister&#146;s representative or a Minister from the Foreign Office will be able to visit the area in the near future to show that solidarity. I understand that an application has been made on behalf of Prime Minister Siniora, and I hope that my hon. Friend will ensure that it is expedited, so that we can show our solidarity with the Government of Lebanon.</p>

<p><a name="st_o532"><a name="0801296001247"><a name="80128-0023.htm_spnew3"><a name="0801296002406"><b>Dr. Howells:</b>
 I can certainly give my hon. Friend that undertaking. I have great regard for Prime Minister Siniora, who is a very brave man. He has never flinched from the responsibilities of his post and we would very much like him to visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para26"><a name="0801296001248">I pay tribute to the peacekeepers of the United Nations interim force in Lebanon. My hon. Friend mentioned the fact that some of them had died in attacks in the past six or seven months. They were cowardly attacks&#151;there have been roadside bombs, and innocent bystanders have been killed. I am afraid that such attacks have been replicated in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is a pattern to them, and it is very worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para27"><a name="0801296001249">The British embassy in Beirut is monitoring the security situation closely, and advice to British citizens in the country is, of course, regularly updated. I know that my hon. Friend will pay tribute to the tremendous job done by our people in Lebanon, and to our armed forces for the job that they did in July 2006. They faced a huge exodus of British and other citizens from Lebanon, while bombs and rockets fell all around. They did an enormous job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80128-0023.htm_para28"><a name="0801296001250">Finally, I turn to the practical assistance that the UK is providing to the Government of Lebanon to help them in their efforts to promote security. First, we continue to work closely with the Lebanese Government to implement UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the conflict in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. Our focus is on working with the Lebanese to improve their border security and prevent the illegal flow of arms across the Syria-Lebanon border. To date we have invested &#163;800,000 in training and equipment to improve Lebanon&#146;s border security. I went there to see it for myself. A good job is being done in the north of the country, but the terrain is very difficult. It is ideal terrain for smugglers; they smuggle not just guns but all kinds of mat&#233;riel across the border.</p>
