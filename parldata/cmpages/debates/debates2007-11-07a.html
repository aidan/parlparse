 With permission, I would like to make a statement on the situation in Pakistan, which I am sure the whole House will agree is dangerous, fast-moving and important to us in Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para2"><a name="07110717000022">The House will have followed in the news the unfolding events since the weekend. In brief, on 3 November, President Musharraf declared a state of emergency and the suspension of Pakistan&#146;s constitution. He has issued a new provisional constitutional order, the two key features of which are as follows: first, the suspension of constitutional articles guaranteeing security of the person, safeguards on arrest and detention, freedom of movement, assembly, association and speech, and equality of citizens; and secondly, the removal of the Supreme Court&#146;s authority to issue any order against the President, Prime Minister or any person exercising powers or jurisdiction under their authority, or to challenge the PCO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para3"><a name="07110717000023">In addition, the President has issued separate ordinances to tighten up regulations for print and electronic media, forbidding them from criticising the Head of State, military or judiciary, showing bodies of suicide bombers or their victims or broadcasting anything</p>
<a name="71107-0001.htm_brev0"><a name="07110717000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para4"><a name="07110717000025">Another effect of the PCO is to suspend all the Supreme Court judges pending their taking of a new oath of allegiance. We understand that fewer than half of the present bench of 19 judges have taken the oath. The former Chief Justice and 14 of his colleagues have been dismissed. Hundreds of other civil society leaders and political activists have been detained or placed under house arrest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para5"><a name="07110717000026">I have today spoken to our high commissioner in Islamabad. He and other members of the high commission staff, and other partner missions and embassies, are in close touch with civil society and other political figures who are the subject of restrictions and we are expressing our concerns to the Government and all relevant authorities at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para6"><a name="07110717000027">I am sure that the whole House shares the Government&#146;s grave concern at these developments. The Government of Pakistan say that they are temporary. It is vital that they are so. We are very much aware of the terrorist threat with which the Government of Pakistan have to grapple and which President Musharraf has cited in justification for his decision to suspend the constitution. The bombings over the last two weeks&#151;in Karachi, Rawalpindi and elsewhere&#151;have resulted in the murder and injury of hundreds of innocent victims. We have deplored those attacks and reiterated our support and determination to work in partnership with the Pakistani authorities to counter this menace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para7"><a name="07110717000028">However, since the weekend, we have seen actions from the Government that have set back the process of democratic transition which is essential for the future stability and security, as well as for the sustainable development, of Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000029">I have made clear our concerns on the telephone to Pakistan&#146;s Prime Minister Aziz and Foreign Minister Kasuri, as well as speaking to Opposition leaders Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, and indicated what actions  <br>

<notus-date day="7" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>7 Nov 2007 : Column 131</b><br>
we now expect the Government to take. Specifically, we call on the Government of Pakistan to do the following: first, to declare now a specific date for January elections and implement the necessary conditions to guarantee that they are free and fair; secondly, to release all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary and human rights activists, and pursue energetically reconciliation with the political Opposition; thirdly, to honour the President&#146;s commitment to step down as chief of staff by 15 November; and fourthly, to relax restrictions on the Pakistani and international media, including the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000030">The stability and development of Pakistan matter to the UK. Pakistan is a vital partner for us in tackling the serious threat of terrorism and extremism against UK targets in the region and at home. We also need to work closely with Pakistan in promoting stability in the wider region, not least in Afghanistan, and in tackling a range of serious issues such as proliferation, drugs, migration and the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para10"><a name="07110717000031">It is not the moment for discussing the separate incident in northern Afghanistan yesterday, but it is right that I mention it. It led to terrible loss of life&#151;the current number is around 40, including five Afghan Members of Parliament. Suffice it to say that I am sure that the House is keen to express its horror at and condemnation of those terrible attacks on Afghan democracy. However, as I said, they are a separate matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para11"><a name="07110717000032">For the medium and longer term in Pakistan, we are convinced that democracy and the rule of law are prerequisites of stability and development in the country. Such stability is essential for economic growth. There has been much positive development in recent years. We have enjoyed a successful partnership between Pakistan and the Department for International Development. We are looking forward to the implementation of a new, expanded programme of co-operation from 2008 to 2010, which includes a focus on partnership in education. In total, that amounts to a doubling of our overseas aid. We do not want those positive developments for the poorest members of Pakistani society to be put at risk now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000033">Our concerns are shared by Pakistan&#146;s other friends. I have been in touch with European counterparts and spoken to the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and to Javier Solana, the EU&#146;s high representative. There is a unanimous view from the international community that democracy, human rights, political freedoms and constitutional rule are the allies of security and stability in Pakistan. There is also a unanimous view that President Musharraf has very important responsibilities to fulfil his commitments at this vital time for Pakistan. We are following developments closely and seeking to co-ordinate our response so that our own vital interests are not damaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000034">The situation also raises important issues for the Commonwealth. We look forward to a meeting of the Commonwealth ministerial action group next Monday in London, which has been convened to discuss the situation in Pakistan. Leaders will also have the chance to discuss the issue at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Uganda later this month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para14"><a name="07110717000035">The friends of Pakistan know that it is a critical time for that country. I acknowledge that that is particularly worrying for British citizens of Pakistani heritage and the Pakistani community resident in the UK, but it matters to us all. We hope that they will recognise our actions and that they, too, will use their contacts through family and business to make the case for democracy and the rule of law that we have been trying to articulate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="07110717000036"><a name="71107-0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="07110717000605"><b>Mr. William Hague (Richmond, Yorks) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Foreign Secretary for making that timely statement. It is a crucial time for Pakistan and its relations with the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. So many issues bind our countries together. With a million British citizens claiming Pakistani heritage and our extensive trade links, Pakistan is a crucial ally and partner of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para15"><a name="07110717000037">I absolutely agree with the Foreign Secretary that strengthening democracy in that country is the best way in which to guarantee its security, stability and prosperity for the future. Against that background, the Government&#146;s response to the draconian measures taken at the weekend has, so far, been the right one. The Foreign Secretary&#146;s representations and requests: that elections should go ahead in January on a free and fair basis; that General Musharraf should resign as head of the army by 15 November; that political prisoners should be released, and that restrictions on the media should be lifted, have the Opposition&#146;s full and strong support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para16"><a name="07110717000038">That said, of course I have several questions, and the first is about elections. The Pakistani Government have given three different accounts so far of when elections will be held. When does the Foreign Secretary expect them to reach a decision? How highly does he rate the chances of elections being held in January? Will he confirm that the Department for International Development is providing &#163;3.5 million to support the electoral process in Pakistan, and that he will continue to press on the Government of Pakistan the need for elections to be free and open and for the result to be upheld? What has he said to the Government of Pakistan about the continuation of British development aid and its doubling in the next three years, which hon. Members of all parties welcomed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000042">Following the Foreign Secretary&#146;s conversations with Opposition leaders, what assessment has he made of their intentions? What assessment have the Government made of the number of people who have been detained so far and does the Foreign Secretary know whether any UK nationals have been detained? He referred to his discussions with other Foreign Ministers and the clear and united message from the international community about the course that the Government of Pakistan should now follow. Does he know who will represent Pakistan at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Uganda to receive that clear and united message?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000043">I have a final set of questions on the overall security situation. The Foreign Secretary expressed his horror at yesterday&#146;s terrorist attack in Afghanistan, a sentiment with which we absolutely concur. We are concerned that the instability will affect the Government of Pakistan&#146;s ability to control the volatile border areas with Afghanistan. We are also concerned about the risk that the Taliban and al-Qaeda elements there will seize the opportunity caused by instability in Islamabad to step up their cross-border operations into Afghanistan. What assessment have the Government made of the risk of a spillover into Afghanistan and of the impact of recent developments on our continued co-operation there? What is the Foreign Secretary&#146;s assessment of the security situation in the North West Frontier province and Waziristan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000044">Such considerations underline the fact that the future stability of Pakistan is not only of vital interest to the United Kingdom, but an important matter for the whole world, because of Pakistan&#146;s central role in the fight against terror, its relation to events in Afghanistan and its possession of nuclear weapons. Is it not the case that we need Pakistan as our ally, but we need it as a free, democratic and stable one?</p>

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="07110717000045"><a name="71107-0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="07110717000606"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the content, tenor and tone of his comments and questions. Let me start where he ended. The position of Pakistan is vital for the whole world, not just for Britain, and a free, fair and democratic Pakistan is the best guarantor that the voice of the moderate majority that I believe does exist there is properly heard. That is an issue that goes far wider than bilateral relations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para23"><a name="07110717000046">Let me also say by way of introduction that the unanimity across the international community to which the right hon. Gentleman referred is important and that the unanimity in the House is important, too. For obvious reasons of history, this country has an important voice, which is heard by both the Government and the people of Pakistan. It is wholly welcome that there should be cross-party agreement on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000047">Let me quickly run through the issues that the right hon. Gentleman raised. In respect of when the elections will happen, I have made the point to the Government of Pakistan at the most senior levels that it is massively in their interests to provide clarity about that now. He asked whether I would like to predict whether the elections would take place in January. The best thing to say is that they must take place in January and that the most suitable time is 15 January, which is when they have been set for. That is an important message. He is also right that the elections must be free and fair. That is certainly what our funding is determined to achieve and what the independent electoral commission must seek to achieve, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para25"><a name="07110717000048">In respect of development aid, I do not believe that this is the time for threats. However, the right hon. Gentleman will know that the agreement that we have with the Government of Pakistan for development aid includes criteria in respect of human rights, and that is right. The consequences of the actions that have been taken, if they continue, would have to be taken into consideration in an obvious and sensible way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para26"><a name="07110717000049">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the end of emergency rule and predicting the timings for that. The sooner that happens the better. I would not want to  <br>

associate myself with the prediction of two or three weeks that was issued yesterday. However, some of the relaxations in the media that have been introduced in the past four or five years, which I have seen for myself, have been some of the most positive changes in Pakistan over that period and it is seriously detrimental that they should have been set back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para27"><a name="07110717000050">In respect of my conversations with Opposition leaders in Pakistan, I have emphasised to them both that statesmanship on their part will be very important and that their followers will be looking to them. Mrs. Bhutto is planning a series of protests. Obviously it is important that they are organised in a way that maximises the safety and security of her followers, which I know is an important issue for her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para28"><a name="07110717000051">I do not have any specific evidence about UK nationals. I have heard about people who have spent time in the UK, for example as students, being detained, but obviously we are monitoring the situation carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para29"><a name="07110717000052">There has been no indication yet, as far as I know, of who will be the Pakistani representative at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, but it will obviously be for other Heads of Government to decide on any consequences for Pakistan, should the current situation continue over the next two or three weeks as the Commonwealth Heads of Government gather.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para30"><a name="07110717000053">The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s final point, on the situation in the North West Frontier and the federally administered tribal areas, deserves a much longer discussion. This is a long-standing issue, and the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), who is a former Foreign Secretary, has written about it at length, with wisdom and insight. It would be wrong to say that we have seen any short-term spillover of the situation in Pakistan into the border area. However, there is far too much safe refuge for Taliban fighters across the border. Also, we have to recognise that Pakistan itself has suffered serious loss of life in trying to patrol that area. There are between 85,000 and 90,000 Pakistani frontier troops on the border, and I think that I am right in saying that the Pakistani frontier corps has suffered 1,000 losses in the border area in the past year, although I am happy to be corrected if that figure is not quite right. Pakistan is suffering losses, and when I met Government representatives there in July, they were keen to impress on me that, while there could be debates about tactics, they did not want us to doubt their commitment to putting men in harm&#146;s way, as they have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para31"><a name="07110717000054">As I have said, this is a major issue for our strategy in Afghanistan, and the Prime Minister said yesterday that he will make a statement on Afghanistan next month. That will provide an opportunity to revisit this issue, but I am happy to find others as well.</p>

Pakistan does not comply with the democratic values set out in the Harare declaration, and if there is no speedy return to civil liberties, no release of political prisoners and no setting of a date for elections, will my right hon. Friend bear it in mind that one of the sanctions that might be pursued, is, sadly, the renewed suspension of Pakistan from the Commonwealth?</p>

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="07110717000056"><a name="71107-0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="07110717000608"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 My hon. Friend speaks with authority on this matter, as Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He is absolutely right to say that suspension is one of the sanctions available, and it will no doubt be discussed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting if there is no change in the situation. One cannot help but note the irony of the fact that the Harare declaration is about good governance and human rights. It was indeed in Harare, however, that the declaration was first promulgated, and it is important that all members of the Commonwealth adhere to its contents.</p>

 I welcome the Foreign Secretary&#146;s statement and, like the shadow Foreign Secretary and the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I echo his sentiments about yesterday&#146;s tragedy in Afghanistan. As he said, that is an issue that we shall need to debate in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para32"><a name="07110717000058">The Liberal Democrats recognise the serious internal security challenges that Pakistan faces, not only now but over many years. Like others, we condemn the suspension of the constitution by General Musharraf as totally inappropriate and unacceptable. Similarly, we understand the importance of the United Kingdom&#146;s relationship with Pakistan, at all sorts of different levels, not least in relation to security. However, that cannot continue to be a justification for tolerating the abuses of the promises that General Musharraf has made over many years to restore his country to democracy. Notwithstanding what the Foreign Secretary said earlier about threats, will he confirm that we will take action, along with our allies, against Pakistan if the elections do not proceed as originally promised?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="71107-0001.htm_para33"><a name="07110717000059">Does the Foreign Secretary also agree that General Musharraf, in addition to his democratic failings, has also failed the security tests that his countrymen and women and the international community have set for him? Does the right hon. Gentleman therefore accept that, at this crucial moment, on the grounds of principle and pragmatism, Britain and the rest of the international community should not simply settle for the return of a façade of constitutionalism in Pakistan?</p>

I am sure that he would want to join me in saying that any action would have to be very careful to distinguish between the Government of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan.

talk&#151;although I am not accusing the hon. Gentleman of engaging in it&#151;about what actions we should take. I know that he would accept that any action must be targeted against the perpetrators of the actions that we deplore. We must ensure that the people of Pakistan do not suffer. It is worth noting that the country spends less than 2 per cent. of its national income on education, which makes our educational aid very important. Longer-term discussions are necessary about the path of development that Pakistan sees for itself.</p>

Gentleman called the security test, it is important to re-emphasise how challenging are some of the security dilemmas faced by any Government in Pakistan. When I met President Musharraf in July, he told me not to doubt his determination on security, but to engage with him in debate about tactics. He mentioned the 90,000 troops&#151;troops of the frontier police, not the mainstream army&#151;that he has placed on the border. There is a range of issues about how they are deployed and many whys and wherefores. Rather than saying that the measures have been a success or a failure, it is better to say that further work unquestionably needs to be done, notwithstanding some progress that has been made. We want to ensure that we work with a Government of Pakistan who have a democratic mandate, because that is the best way of taking forward the security agenda. I would also say that the governance of FATA&#151;federally administered tribal areas&#151;is a long-standing issue of governance for Pakistan. We need something more than a military solution if we are to make progress in those areas. On its own, a military solution is not enough.</p>

That concern exists notwithstanding the many useful things that President Musharraf did in his earlier years as president. Will my right hon.

Will he agree that the process of transition in Pakistan will be difficult and dangerous, given the history of that country, the role of the army and its possession of nuclear weapons? In particular, will he learn from the experience of 1979, when western pressure on the Shah, for understandable reasons, led unintentionally not to democracy and the rule of law but to an extremist, Islamist regime in Tehran, with all the problems that the international community now faces? That is not an argument against reform in Pakistan, but it does mean that the west should not seek to destabilise that country as a whole, as that could have incalculable consequences.</p>

and democracy and security, is obviously a delicate one. There are always temptations to say that security comes before democracy, but as he implied, that is dangerous. I am glad that he referred to a transition to democracy, so that we are clear both about the end goal and the fact that there will be steps towards it. If there is a positive outcome in the next few days and weeks in respect of the January elections, I hope that the House will not believe that the Pakistani folder is therefore closed. Some difficult steps remain in the days and months ahead, up to elections and beyond. We are in a unique situation, with President Musharraf&#146;s commitment to resign as the head of the army and to lead in a civilian capacity. He has said that he wants a transition to democracy, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan reasserted that to me on the telephone on Monday. It is right to say, however, that the transition needs to be careful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="71107-0002.htm_para3"><a name="07110717000072">Some 10 per cent. of the Pakistani population voted for parties that, in some quarters, are alleged to have extremist links or leanings. My judgment is that those people and many others are looking for a path that is respectful of Pakistan&#146;s religious heritage but that is also committed to modernisation of the country. It is incumbent on the mainstream parties to speak to those aspirations and to ensure that those people are not driven into the hands of extremists. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree, democracy is our ally in that process. The worst thing would be for extremists to be able to claim that there is no other way than extremism for people to have their say, and that they should turn away from the ballot box. That is why democratic rules and elections are important in the short term, as well as building democratic institutions in the longer term.</p>

Although I am not a fan of military dictators, may I also remind my right hon. Friend that President Musharraf appointed Maleeha Lodhi&#151;a woman&#151;to the high commission in London, and has reserved one third of the seats in the National Assembly, the regional assembly and local authorities for women?

Someone referred to the events of 1999, but there have been changes that have been welcome both for Pakistan and for the wider international community. The key is to build on those. The tragedy of the last few days is that we threaten to set back those changes rather than building on them, which is what we need to do.</p>

 Do we not have to be unambiguously in favour of democracy rather than slightly ambivalent about dictatorship? If there are to be free and fair elections in Pakistan, is it not important that the following two preconditions are met: that the Government honour the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly, and that the independent electoral commission must be genuinely independent, must have some power and, most importantly, must have enough resources&#151;so that it can put in place an accurate electoral register, for instance?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. Let me expand on what he said about the independent electoral commission. One criterion is that it must be genuinely independent. As well as having full roles, it must have people policing those roles who are, and are seen to be, independent. That matter has been raised with me by Ms Bhutto and also, publicly, by other opposition politicians. We must ensure that the elections are seen through, and I agree with my hon.

 The Foreign Secretary has acknowledged some of the extreme pressures that have led to these unwise decisions. Another pressure is the continuing running sore of Kashmir, an overwhelmingly Islamic province. Last year&#146;s Mumbai bombings made clear the extent to which it acts as a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda. Does the Foreign Secretary not agree that one of the ways in which we can strengthen moderate voices in Pakistan is by encouraging India in the modest steps that it has taken over the past two or three years towards engagement on that issue?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point might have had more purchase some years ago. I have been encouraged over the past few years&#151;certainly since the engagement between President Musharraf and former Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and the composite dialogue they established&#151;that the discussion of Kashmir has been put in a much safer box. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it remains an issue for many people, not least in our country, but saying that it is currently a running sore creates the danger of giving the impression that it causes more problems than it does. Emotions are high and it remains an important issue, but we should recognise the steps that both Pakistan and India have taken to address that issue in a sensible fashion.</p>

 It gives me great pleasure to open this debate on the Gracious Speech. That speech outlined a number of Bills and proposals, led by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and myself, which will affect the lives of the British people in many ways. Among them are the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which has just been presented, the counter-terrorism Bill, the draft citizenship and immigration Bill, the draft constitutional renewal Bill, and proposals in respect of party finance and expenditure. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will of course deal with those issues for her Department directly when she speaks later today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para3"><a name="07110717000098">This is a legislative programme that builds on this Government&#146;s record over the past almost 11 years&#151;11 years that have seen record investment and improvement in the national health service, 600,000 fewer children in poverty and 6 million more people in work. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Thank you very much. All these are facts, so I look forward to cheering from both sides. Over those 11 years, crime is down by a third, police numbers are up by 12 per cent., and there has been a 300 per cent. increase in the money invested in services for victims and witnesses. Some 1.5 million cases were brought justice just last year, and the chance of being a victim of crime is lower than at any time in the past 26 years. In those 11 years, we have greatly modernised and strengthened our constitutional arrangements&#151;and, through that, our democracy&#151;by strengthening Select Committees, through freedom of information, data protection and human rights legislation, through devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and through the removal of the vast majority of hereditary peers from the House of Lords.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall make a tiny bit more progress. I was reflecting over the weekend about quite the extent to which this country has changed for the better since my first speech from the Treasury Bench on the Loyal Address in May 1997. Although I do not claim that every speech that I have made in the past 10 and half years has stood the test of time, I was accurate when I said:</p>
<a name="71107-0003.htm_brev3"><a name="07110717000556"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Laws can help to shape more tolerant values and a better society.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 19 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 387.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07110717000103">I do not pretend that things are better for everyone. Each person who is a victim of crime&#151;there are still too many&#151;remains 100 per cent. a victim of crime, and each person out of a job remains 100 per cent. out of work, but overall our country is a better place, and this Government have led the way in that achievement. Three quarters of the British people are optimistic about the future for their families, a recent and interesting poll for the BBC tells us. Some 93 per cent. of us say that we are happy in our family lives, which is a considerable improvement on earlier such findings. The pollsters expressed surprise at the findings, but I do not. The country is more prosperous, safer and better educated. So much for the claims of a so-called &#147;broken society&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07110717000104">Something else has changed fundamentally. This did not happen under a Conservative Administration, although it easily could have done. It is something that the Conservatives had every chance to do in their 18 years of office, and something for which they needed no resources. Black Wednesday did not affect their opportunities to do this, yet they singularly refused to act. I am speaking about the way in which people are treated in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para6"><a name="07110717000105">When we came into government section 28 was, disgracefully, still on the statute book&#151;people who were gay or lesbian were told by the state that they had dangerous tendencies&#151;there was the running sore of policing in a multiracial country, and the fester of the appalling murder of Stephen Lawrence and the abject complacency of the investigation into it. The Conservative Administration sat on their hands about all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para7"><a name="07110717000106">In contrast, we acted. We have made the changes to address inequalities and to help make our country more tolerant. We abolished section 28, equalised the age of consent and established the Lawrence inquiry&#151;not only that, but we saw that almost all its recommendations were implemented. We introduced legislation to outlaw religious and racial hatred, just as we are now inviting the House to make incitement to hatred based on sexual orientation a criminal offence. We introduced a further, and in my judgment even more fundamental, law to help shape the tolerant values and better society of which I spoke 10 and a half years ago: the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000107">The European convention on human rights, on which our Act is based, was drafted by lawyers who were British and who happened to be leading Conservatives&#151;men such as David Maxwell-Ffye, later the distinguished Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor. The incorporation of convention rights into domestic law was first called for in this House by Conservatives in 1987. Furthermore, following changes to the 1998 Bill based on the Opposition&#146;s concerns, the Conservative Front-Bench team wished it well as it passed into law. I am not surprised, for the convention and the Act enshrined British values, developed over centuries of our common law, with a pedigree that stretches back to the Magna Carta, providing remedy in British courts, to be heard by British judges.</p>

<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="07110717000108"><a name="71107-0003.htm_spnew4"><a name="07110717000642"><b>Dr. Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b>
 Is the Secretary of State aware that something that has bothered people on both sides of the House, not least the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is the inability to remove from this country foreign criminals who pose a danger to other members of society? Given Italy&#146;s success in passing new legislation to allow it to do that without affecting its human rights legislation, do the Government have any intention of doing the same thing to protect our society from foreign criminals who pose a threat to people here?</p>

<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="07110717000109"><a name="71107-0003.htm_spnew5"><a name="07110717000643"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 May I say to the hon. Gentleman that I am, of course, aware of this concern and we are trying to deal with it? I think that I am right in saying&#151;I shall correct the record later if I am wrong&#151;that Italy was one of the three countries with which we joined in an action before the Strasbourg Court to seek an amendment to the Chahal judgment, which has nothing to do with the Human Rights Act because it dates back to 1996. Italy faces exactly the same restrictions. There is a reason, in principle, for these restrictions, which I hope nobody in this House suggests should not be in place. That is that civilised countries should not outsource murder and torture and should not send back&#151;albeit terrible&#151;terrorists or criminals&#151;to nations where there is a high and well-evidenced risk that they will face torture or death. The argument is about whether sending back a particular criminal to a particular country would pose that risk, and I am grateful for the intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000110">I recognise that the Human Rights Act has had to operate in a more difficult and complex environment than was anticipated in 1997. Therefore&#151;my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has flagged this point up&#151;we now need to draw out explicitly those responsibilities that have always been implicit within the convention and the Act. That is why the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) and I will publish a draft Bill of Rights and responsibilities which will build on the Human Rights Act&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Well, if the Conservatives are now saying that they will build on the Act and not detract from it, I welcome that, but it is a very different approach from the one taken by the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

&#147;will not resile&#148; from the convention itself. They appear to justify that approach on the ground that, as the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) said, they want to deport more foreign terrorists and criminals&#151;as do we. Let me offer them this unsolicited, but entirely accurate, advice. Far from making it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals, the Conservatives&#146; approach would make it more difficult, because it would restrict the flexibility of the UK courts. If, as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, they went down the route of the German Basic law&#151;which they say would give them a greater margin of appreciation&#151;they would end up with the opposite result to that which they seek. Any study of what happens in Karlsruhe, where the German constitutional court is based, shows that the German courts are more restrictive in their decisions on whether to deport foreign terrorists and criminals, and start from a higher base than do we or the Strasbourg Court. That would make deportation more difficult, not less difficult.</p>

 When the Lord Chancellor links responsibilities to rights, is he implying that someone other than a court of law can say to an individual that they have not behaved sufficiently responsibly to have the right of free speech, or of assembly? How can rights be made contingent on responsibilities, or responsible behaviour, unless a court decides that someone has committed a crime?</p>

 There are two aspects to that issue. In general terms, most&#151;although not all&#151;rights are contingent on duties and responsibilities. There is a vast body of jurisprudential study behind that. Secondly, there are some rights that are fundamental in a free and democratic society, such as the right to a fair trial and the right not to be tortured or sent&#151;in our judgment&#151;to death. Those are fundamental rights that arise from the fact that individuals are human beings, and they are a mark that separates a free and fair society from any other.</p>

when asked whether a Conservative version of a British Bill of Rights would make it easier to deport suspected terrorists to countries that might torture them, he replied on the record that he did not think that it would. We are grateful to him for that clarification; I hope that he has told the shadow Home Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="71107-0003.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000127">The answer to the hon. Gentleman, which he understands&#151;I do not say that condescendingly&#151;is this: in the convention, there are some rights on which there is very little margin of appreciation for any nation that adheres to the convention. That includes article 3, which is the basis of the Chahal judgment. On others, there is quite a wide margin of appreciation. The whole argument, originally led, in 1987, by the former distinguished Conservative Member the late Edward Gardner in a private Member&#146;s Bill in favour of incorporation, was that if we incorporated the provisions our courts would be able to adjudicate on them&#151;and, yes, to gloss them, to use the hon. Gentleman&#146;s phrase. That is what they have sought to do.</p>

However, in our judgment there are other areas in which, entirely consistently with the convention, the practice of Strasbourg and the margin of appreciation, greater discretion could be given&#151;for example, in respect of article 13 on remedies, which is not incorporated, and of article 17, which deals with the abuse of rights and has not been developed as much as it should have been. That could be done without detracting in any sense from some of the fundamental rights, which I mentioned to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), that go with being a human being and nothing else.</p>

 While my right hon. Friend is talking about rights and responsibilities&#151;I hope that I am not taking him too far away from his speech&#151;may I ask him about victims, particularly children, who cannot express either rights or responsibilities and who are victims of domestic violence? Can we as a Government look cross-departmentally at how we can help them further? I know that we have gone a long way, but there is more that we can do for them as regards their rights and responsibilities; perhaps he, and my right hon.

Following the decisive votes in the House in March, all-party talks on the future of the House of Lords continue. A further meeting is planned for next week. In any event, I am determined that we give effect, in time, to the overwhelming opinion of this House for a wholly or mainly elected second chamber.</p>

More than that, it would fatally undermine the Westminster Parliament and unravel the Union.

It was precisely his concerns about the unworkability of so-called English votes for English laws that led Gladstone, who had proposed a similar plan during the course of the second Home Rule Bill in 1893, to withdraw that plan at the final moment. Chief among the many flaws was the impossibility of discriminating between what Gladstone described as the Irish and the imperial issues. When he finally gave up, he said that it</p>

 Would that matters were that simple, but what happened in 1893 remains pertinent, because the House faced exactly the same problem then. Of course, the territorial extent of a Bill can be described&#151;as the Government have done with the devolution legislation and many other Bills that have come before this House&#151;but it is much more difficult to determine its effect. The Chair would be embroiled in constant arguments about whether a measure whose territorial extent was confined to England would have a direct impact on Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.</p>

 In a moment; I want to quote to the hon. Gentleman what the leader of the Scottish National party has said. It was claimed yesterday that Scottish nationalists had always refused to vote on &#147;English-only&#148; issues, and up to a point that is true. During deliberations on the higher education Bill that introduced student tuition fees, the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) and his party&#151;and my former colleague Tam Dalyell, who had entered into a similar self-denying ordinance&#151;said that, in territorial terms, the Bill affected England and Wales only. However, they added that they intended to vote on the measures in the Bill because they would have really serious effects on public spending in Scotland that would not be covered by the Bill&#146;s territorial extent restriction. The proposal that we are discussing, Mr. Speaker, would mean that you would be embroiled day after day in arguments about whether a particular clause of a particular Bill would affect England alone, or Scotland or Wales too.</p>

There could be a federal Parliament; that is fine&#151;that is the Liberals&#146; position and it would work, although it would break up the Union&#151;but it would end up with two Cabinets in one, trying to operate both United Kingdom legislation and decisions as well as England ones.

 Unlike the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart), I am a Unionist.

Not the slightest instance of such a situation occurs to me; nor is it the case that every measure, on both sides of the border, has public expenditure implications for the other side. The Lord Chancellor is doing what his colleagues do: he is trying to elevate a great constitutional principle&#151;the defence of the Union&#151;when he is actually defending the partisan interest of his party, because he thinks it is possible that there could be a Labour Government who lacked an English majority.</p>

In the mid-1950s, the Conservatives won not just half the seats in Scotland but half the popular vote. How many Scottish MPs are Conservative these days?

Much of the doubling up has been made possible because we have introduced internal sanitation in all cells. As for the hon.

The difference is that we paid for those plans and have continued to expand the number of prison places, and we will continue to do so.</p>

I do not believe that anybody wants that to happen here, but if it were to occur, it would mean not 80,000 prisoners but 400,000, and not 140 prisons but 700, which would be more than one in every constituency. That would not be in the best interests of the lawful people of the United Kingdom. If there is agreement on that point, then I hope that we can reach a consensus on the consequences of that agreement. That means that we should jail dangerous offenders and repeat offenders, but we should continue with the programme that we have been following for the past 10 years to make better use of community sentencing.</p>

As the House will know, in March 2006 Sir Hayden Phillips was asked to undertake a review of the matter by the then Prime Minister. Sir Hayden published his final report in March 2007, which set out the broad principles for a reformed system of party finance and spending. He was subsequently asked to chair inter-party talks with the aim of securing a broad consensus around the practicalities of a new system. I regret to tell the House that those talks were suspended last week after the Conservative party&#151;it alone&#151; proved unwilling to negotiate on a draft agreement put forward by Sir Hayden. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> That is true.</p>

I want to make it clear that the suspension of Sir Hayden Phillips&#146;s talks does not mean that the problems with the existing regulatory regime have vanished, and it should not be an excuse for inaction. As indicated in the Gracious Speech, I will shortly bring forward proposals on the regulation of party finance and expenditure and, in particular, on how we can end the problem of the spending arms race, which is the central driver of the other problems that we face. I note that the Leader of the Opposition yesterday emphasised the connection between state funding and donation caps.

Why are the Government wasting billions on ID cards, when the IT can be corrupted by terrorists using a gadget costing &#163;100? Why, with 2,000 individuals threatening our security, are the Government wasting so much energy on a control order regime that monitors 14 terrorists and is so ineffective that seven have escaped, most without trace? Why the fixation on extended detention without trial, which I suspect will be the main issue today, without a shred of evidence that we need longer? Such a change will cut off vital co-operation from local communities and we have emergency powers to deal with the nightmare scenarios that Ministers keep speculating about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="71107-0005.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000201">Before coming on to the proposals from the Home Office, I inform the Lord Chancellor that we agree with a number of proposals from his Department. But I have to say that they read rather like an indictment of Labour&#146;s record over the past 10 years. There is a Bill to guard against the politicisation of the civil service. We look forward to learning from the Government&#146;s experience. There will be reform to require greater parliamentary scrutiny of war-making powers. The former Foreign Secretary is uniquely well qualified to guide us through that. There will be a review of the ban on protestors outside Parliament, but presumably not on hecklers at Labour party conferences.</p>

We heard his numbers; the truth is that violent crime has doubled. They can argue about the figures all they like. The public know the reality on our streets and they have lost all trust in what Ministers say. The single most important measure the Government could have announced today would be to cut the red tape that ties officers to their desks. The Home Secretary claims that the Government have cut 9,000 forms, but when we asked her only two weeks ago to list them, she could not. So I do not expect much of Labour&#146;s fifth major review of police red tape that is due in the new year.</p>

I understand that the Lord Chancellor is warming to the idea of direct accountability. Perhaps he can clarify his position&#151;or the Home Secretary can do it for us&#151;by telling the House in clear terms whether locally elected police commissioners will be the next policy his Government try to pinch from the Conservative party.</p>

It does not exist&#151;it is not there. Secondly, it is misleading because the Government have said that the points system, which is already in place, is not about setting a limit on immigration. The Home Office, in a burst of honesty, said that it could not predict the numbers.

Only this week, we have heard from the head of MI5 about the growing number of terror suspects&#151;a threat level rising faster than our capacity to monitor it. My party believes that we need a renewed effort across all parties to confront and scale back the terrorist threat. We will join the Government in supporting every effective and appropriate measure with that aim in view. We have called for the introduction of post-charge questioning for two years. We hope that the Government will take swift action on the matter. We shall look closely at arrangements for using DNA in terrorism investigations, and at the workability of proposals for monitoring those convicted of terrorism offences after their release, with the Government&#146;s woeful track record on enforcing control orders firmly in mind.</p>

We intend to bring forward concrete proposals in the context of the Bill to ban fully Hezbollah&#146;s activities in Britain, to take action to ensure that charities are not used to finance groups engaged in terrorism and to review the Government&#146;s confused approach to banning extremist organisations that preach hatred and violence against this country. We want to see a zero-tolerance approach to those involved in terror.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="71107-0005.htm_para17"><a name="07110717000210">I had intended to avoid commenting on the question of intercept evidence today in light of the cross-party review that is under way. However, since there was no mention of the review in the Queen&#146;s Speech, and since the Home Secretary felt able to brief newspapers that she was hardening against any change in the law, I no longer feel so restrained. Foreign intercept evidence is already used in British courts. Intercept is used in nearly every US prosecution of organised crime and terrorism. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and US prosecutors say that intercept is more often than not the decisive evidence that leads to a conviction. Using intercept will be cost-effective because where used it often results in an early guilty plea and encourages co-operation with the police. The Director of Public Prosecutions, the last Attorney-General and senior officers in the Met have called for intercept to be used in the courts.</p>

 I shall deal with the Home Secretary&#146;s sotto voce comment of &#147;Thank goodness&#148; because she appeared to imagine that we had picked the number out of the air. It is the longest time for which people can be held without charge in the free world. That is hardly a matter of pride for the Home Secretary to pick on, so we shall come back to her shortly.</p>

Instead, they presented an argument that 90 days might be necessary if certain circumstances came to pass. The result was the Government&#146;s defeat in the House for the first time in 10 years because they persuaded almost nobody.</p>

The Home Secretary said on the radio this morning that three terabytes of data were involved&#151;I will challenge her about that in the coming weeks. The plot raised problems of evidence gathering. It involved information from a foreign intelligence agency, which, of course, slows things down. The police had to move earlier than they would have chosen, before all their evidence was gathered, because the threat was thought to be imminent.

The comments did not pursue the real issue, which is when the evidence became available. I asked the Home Secretary about that two or three weeks ago when I met her to discuss components of the counter-terrorism Bill on which we could agree because we want it to be as consensual as possible. I asked whether she could give me details about when the evidence was gathered. We have called her office twice since then, but have received no support. If she intends to be consensual, I look forward to seeing the evidence. I have been told by a source whom I believe to be reliable, but I do not want to rely on one person, that, in at least one case, the primary evidence for charging was available at 14 days.

Three were released, after spending 28 days in cells. That is what someone would get for a severe act of violence in this country. Three innocent people spent 28 days in cells. I make that point carefully because I asked the Metropolitan police whether those people were under control orders or surveillance, or whether the police had further suspicions of them. They were innocent of any charges put to them. <i> [Interruption.] </i>If the Lord Chancellor wants to correct me, I am happy for him to do so, but he cannot give the impression that, because people were locked up for 28 days, they might not be innocent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07110717000226">We must face up to the problem that we could detain someone who started out being a great patriot and supporter of the British state. However, at the end of the time in prison, having done nothing to deserve being there, that person would not be a patriot and supporter of the British state&#151;at least, it would be understandable if that person were not. We do not want to create a recruiting sergeant for terrorism in our over-enthusiasm for repressive measures, which we do not need.</p>

 I agree with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point. However, I ask him to stop using the phrase &#147;the longest detention period without charge in the free world&#148; because he does not compare like with like. It is possible in countries such as France and Spain&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>There are different systems&#151;that is my point&#151;but people are detained for considerable periods. My anxiety about the current position is that, the police, when they are watching potential terrorists or people whom they believe might be terrorists, may act too early or too late because of concentration on the 28 days. That may put us at greater risk than necessary.</p>

 I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. The raw truth is that comparisons are not easy. We are now considering non-Commonwealth countries&#151;</p>

 Of course. However, two points arise. First, in the coming weeks, a serious comparison will be published on a stage-by-stage basis of all the countries in what we would term the free world. The hon. Gentleman will find that we are, sadly, at the top of the league. Secondly, there is the interview after charge. In the investigatory magistrates structure, they charge and continue to interview and investigate, but there is a point of charge. When considering the 90-day debate, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) and I were briefed on the matter. We were shocked to hear that the Government had not considered relaxing the system that I outlined and were happier to go for 90 days&#146; detention without charge than to make a smaller, more technical and less intrusive change in the law.</p>

 The Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, was interested in what happened to the three people who were released at 28 days. The Government had the option of applying for control orders if they did not believe that they had enough evidence to charge but were concerned that the people were a danger. If they had successfully applied for control orders, that might be evidence that 28 days was not sufficient, but if they did not believe that it was appropriate to apply or if they did not succeed in getting control orders, that is evidence that there was no basis in that case for going for longer than 28 days.</p>

 I am sympathetic to many of the points that the right hon. Gentleman is making. I was one of those who opposed 90 days. Does he agree that one of the great mysteries is where the suggestion for 90 days came from in the first place? In May, at a conference in front of 200 lawyers in Birmingham, I asked the Director of Public Prosecutions where the pressure for 90 days was coming from. His response was, &#147;It isn&#146;t coming from us and it isn&#146;t coming from the police.&#148;</p>

 I think that that point answers itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07110717000235">At the end of all this, there has been no case at all in which 28 days has prevented a subject from being charged. Indeed, we would know if there had been one, because of the control order sign that would have come up. The next question is whether the police could have gathered the key evidence more quickly than they did in each of the terrorism cases. I spoke to some senior members of the police team that ran the investigation to which I have been referring. My strong impression was that the investigation was well run and that the team did a capable job. It clearly did all that was necessary in the time available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07110717000236">The question that must be answered in that context, however, is: if the police had needed to do the investigation faster, could they have done so? As a test of that, I asked the police whether they instituted three-shift working for the evidence-gathering process. Did they work right round the clock? &#147;No,&#148; they said. I asked them whether they directed in any forensic or IT staff from other forces. &#147;Not necessary,&#148; they said. I asked the police a number of other questions, about the techniques and management of the evidence-gathering process. It was quite clear that there were ways&#151;we shall talk about them on Second Reading&#151;of accelerating some aspects of the process when that became necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07110717000237">So to summarise, in no case to date has the 28-day limit created a problem. Furthermore, it is almost certain that the evidence-gathering and sifting can be accelerated if the necessary resources are provided.</p>

 Before the right hon. Gentleman leaves that topic, I want to raise the problem of encryption of electronically held documents and the difficulty of getting into them during the time available, which is put forward repeatedly. Indeed, that was the main argument put forward on the previous occasion on which we debated the issue two years ago. I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman can answer this question. Under both the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, there is provision for orders to be made requiring that people who are held should give up the encryption on their computers. If they do not do so, they may be held in custody while those computers are de-encrypted. Why is that not sufficient in those circumstances?</p>

 The position is sharper than that. As has been said, under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 there is a requirement to give up the password. Also, I think that I am right in saying&#151; because I volunteered this to the Government during the debate on 90 days&#151;that we agreed to double the length when the case involved terrorism. The hon. and learned Gentleman is absolutely right. If passwords are withheld, a charge can automatically be brought against the individual concerned.</p>

My question is closely related to the one that my right hon. Friend has just answered. The only other aspect of the Government&#146;s case which we keep hearing is that vast quantities of computerised material have to be gone through. However, it is not at all clear whether such quantities, assuming that they are not encrypted, are vast quantities of rubbish concealing a few important nuggets of information or vast quantities of vital information. It is hard to see why there have to be gigabytes of vitally important information, let alone anything larger. Therefore, the vast quantities of material are presumably rubbish covering the important bits. In that event, it would always be possible for terrorists to pile on more and more gigabytes to conceal the bits that matter. There might therefore be no end to the amount of time for which the Government could require people to be detained in order to go through it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o120"><a name="07110717000241"><a name="71107-0006.htm_spnew11"><a name="07110717000721"><b>David Davis:</b>
 My hon. Friend has a point. The number that the Home Secretary bandied around this morning was three terabytes or 3,000 gigabytes, which would work out at about 100 gigabytes a suspect. I recommend that hon. Members go and look at their computers. If, like me, they keep everything for ever, I recommend that they look at their lifetime of gathered data. I doubt whether those data would come to anything like 100 gigabytes or even 25 megabytes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07110717000242">One of the questions that will be put to the Home Secretary&#151;not now; we shall give her notice of it&#151;is whether the vast quantities of data that she has talked about involve just the capacity of the disks or whether they involve all the software on those disks, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Windows and so on, all of which is checkable and removable in an instant. Then we shall see whether the problem is really what it is cracked up to be. If the Government want to look at the issue properly, the serious problem is not the encryption or the sheer volume, but the issue of foreign language translation. I hope that we shall talk about that in practical terms when we come to the main debate on the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07110717000243">The House should not forget that cross-party co-operation delivered a range of new offences to enable the police to charge anybody&#151;and I mean anybody&#151;involved in a terrorist plot. That was done at great length, at our suggestion and, to give them their credit, the Liberal Democrats&#146; suggestion, in the debate on 90 days. Acts preparatory to terrorism, encouragement to terrorism, dissemination of terrorist publications, and terrorist training offences, in addition to the pre-existing offences of possessing information for terrorist purposes, recruiting for terrorist training and inciting overseas terrorism&#151;all are criminal offences. What has been lacking is the determination to make the full use of the law and that powers that we have already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07110717000244">The previous Home Secretary understood those arguments and came up with another scenario, in the earlier stage of the discussion. He said, &#147;Okay, we can cope with one Heathrow reasonably easily, but what if we had five all at once? We&#146;d be overwhelmed.&#148; That is the circumstance under which, we argue, the Government should invoke the state of emergency provisions in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. The definition is very simple and involves an emergency that poses a serious threat to the public, overwhelming the Government&#146;s ability to defend the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07110717000245">The powers in the 2004 Act are quite sweeping and include the power to hold without charge for up to 30 days, over and above any period under existing legislation. So, in a state of emergency&#151;but only in a state of emergency&#151;the Government already have the power to hold for 58 days. The scenario described by the previous Home Secretary involved 50 airliners coming under attack. That is clearly a state of emergency. Such a power would of course require the Government to justify their action after the event to both the House of Commons and the courts, but they say that they want proper scrutiny and control over the process. For such an incursion of liberty, that is a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000246">The Government complain about that process, which they designed, remember. They say that it would alarm and panic the public&#151;this from a Government who habitually issue blood-curdling assessments of the threat, describing it as the biggest threat since the second world war. I consider that objection to be unutterable nonsense, first, because it underestimates the British public, who withstood 3,000 deaths under the Northern Irish troubles and who faced that many deaths in a single night at the height of the blitz; secondly, because the public would expect a state of emergency if 50 airliners were about to be blown out of the sky; and thirdly, because there would be no immediate need to declare such a state of emergency, as the Government would have 28 days before they ran out of time under the counter-terrorism Bill. In that time the state of the nation would be all too clear to the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000247">The Home Secretary has suggested that that demonstrates that we accept the principle of the need to go beyond 28 days. That is a facile argument. It should be clear that we do not accept the need to extend detention without charge based on either the evidence of the operations to date or the most horrific hypothetical scenarios so far dreamt up by Ministers.</p>

Friends on the Front Bench will forgive me, I want to touch on one or two of the Bills in the Queen&#146;s Speech that are not within their remit. There are many things in the Queen&#146;s Speech that my constituents will welcome, including the Climate Change Bill and the energy Bill. At long last, we are getting serious about the environment, although there is still a long way to go. I note that many of the most respected experts suggest that we should aim for a 75 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, and I hope that the Government will keep that matter under review. I appreciate, however, that there is a fine line to be walked between what is deliverable and what is desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000260">Our targets on renewables are very modest, and I wonder whether we could be a bit more ambitious in that regard. I note that the new Co-op headquarters in Manchester is 98 per cent. energy self-sufficient, and that ought to serve as a role model for other business developments. On recycling, despite undoubted progress we are barely scratching the surface. The amount that we throw away remains astonishing to me, and it is still impossible to recycle plastic in many parts of the country. We seem depressingly reluctant to take on the supermarkets and the packaging manufacturers, and it is a mystery to me why we cannot require a deposit to be paid on bottles and plastic bags.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="71107-0006.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000261">I welcome any measures in the Bill on pensions and employment to improve the lot of agency workers and those who are on the minimum wage. There is a growing divide in this country between two classes of employee: those who qualify for holiday pay, sick pay, occupational pensions and all those other things that we used, quaintly, to associate with civilisation, and those who do not. Increasingly, many of the latter are immigrants, and nothing causes greater resentment among the indigenous population than to see their once secure jobs undermined by the cynical importation of labour from cheap labour economies. Those of us who have done well out of the past 20 years need to bear in mind the fact that there is a class of people whose standard of living has not improved in that time. A bus driver told me recently that his earnings had not yet got back up to the level that they had been in the late 1980s before the deregulation of the buses.</p>

I speak as one who once had some responsibility in the Government for aviation, and the aviation industry in particular has had its own way for far too long. There is almost no limit to its demands. It wants more terminals, more runways and more airports, and it is time for the Government to muster the courage to stand up to it. I hope that this Bill is not intended to pave the way for a return to &#147;predict and provide&#148;.</p>

We need issue-driven, rather than money-driven, politics. Nor do I accept the argument that there is a legitimate parallel to be drawn with trade union political funds.  <br>

In my view, we missed an opportunity in 1998, important though the legislation that became the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 was. In 1998, the Opposition were short of money, so they just might have been prepared to negotiate more seriously on lower limits. When we have closed the Ashcroft loophole&#151;I appreciate that this may not be too agreeable for my right hon. and hon. Friends&#151;perhaps we could take another look at the so-called communications allowance that we awarded ourselves earlier this year, which I found hard to justify as it gives an unfair advantage to incumbents. I notice that it is attracting increasingly unfavourable comment.</p>

As we have just heard, it seems that it will include yet another attempt to increase the period for which terror suspects can be held without trial. In my time, it has gone from three, to seven, to 14 and to 28 days&#151;to say nothing of the abortive attempt a while ago to raise it to 90 days. I shall listen to the arguments, as I did last time, but they are going to have to be a darn sight stronger than they were last time before I become convinced of them.</p>

I quoted what the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, told me in front of an audience of 200 lawyers. I believe that the only possible conclusion is that it has more to do with politicians than with the needs of practitioners. I have no doubt that a policeman or someone from the security services can be wheeled out to say that the extension is absolutely necessary, but the case has not been demonstrated.

 Oh, yes&#151;a much safer seat. I noted the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s quotations from Ronnie Flanagan, Stella Rimington and Peter Clarke, all of whom urged caution on this issue. We should take them very seriously. When the introduction of 90 days was attempted, it was a truly friendless measure. I noticed that even the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Lord Condon, voted against it in the other place. It really is time that the Government got the message on this. They may well find that the answer lies in post-charge questioning, but given that most terrorist suspects are likely to refuse to respond to questions, I am not sure that that will take us very far either. At the end of the day, when it comes to convicting terrorists&#151;I am as keen on that as anyone else; indeed, in years gone by I had rather better luck in doing so than some whose job it is to catch terrorists&#151;there is no substitute for hard evidence.</p>

Again with all due respect, I have to say that some PPSs are a downright menace, scurrying around inventing things to do, planting questions, even planting supplementaries&#151;and sometimes neglecting even to tell their masters that they have planted them in the first place! It has reached the point where the Government are no longer able to fill Select Committee vacancies without appointing PPSs&#151;something for which we rightly criticised the principal Opposition party when it found itself in a similar position. I have mentioned the 56 PPSs, but that is to say nothing of the half dozen party vice-chairmen who have suddenly appeared from nowhere or the special envoys for the rain forest, the World cup and all the rest of it.</p>

That being so, it is all the more curious that the Government appear so determined to reopen the vexed debate about the period during which the police can detain any of us without charge, and that she seems to have made such a beeline for an issue that is divisive, wrong in practice and wrong in principle.</p>

It has been suggested on several occasions that he might have needed more than 28 days of questioning. That is absurd&#151;the clock starts ticking when someone is formally detained.

As she knows, we have long advocated the more aggressive use of plea bargaining to garner information on terrorist masterminds. As she also knows, there is still a strong case to clarify the way in which the Crown Prosecution Service uses the so-called threshold test so that charges may be brought in the first place, even if all the evidence has not been fully gathered.

I ask for that Bill to contain a requirement for those who entered the country as husbands or wives for permanent settlement not to be allowed to act as sponsors of wives or husbands from abroad until they have acquired British citizenship&#151;that is, five years after entry. At present, on gaining indefinite leave to remain, an incoming spouse or applicant can leave the spouse who sponsored him or her, immediately acquire a second</p>

It is estimated that only 3 per cent. of women are literate in the Mirpur area of Pakistan, where the overwhelming majority of the Pakistani community in places such as Keighley originate. It is therefore not surprising that primary schools in my constituency, along with those in many other northern towns and cities, face the challenge of 95 per cent. of their annual intake being unaware of the existence of English as a language when they first go to school.</p>

From the very beginning, the level playing field that ought to be the right of every child is being denied to them. Such children are discriminated against by the tradition of their own community, and the results can be seen later in their lives.

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000321">The roots of extremism in the United Kingdom stem from feelings of alienation and disenfranchisement, not in the impoverished and less literate communities but among people who, despite the impediments, have struggled to take advantage of education. It is the sense of having had to struggle, face the obstacles and perceive the differential between the bulk of a migrant community and what could be achieved that sows the seeds of extremism. What the analysis of those radicals does not accept is that, to a degree, many of the obstacles and segregation are self-imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000322">It is here that the alienation, resentment and radicalisation mature and fester: here is the source of home-grown extremism. I am not suggesting that the learning of English is a quick remedy for extremism, but ensuring that English is spoken to such an extent that everyone has the chance to compete and play an active and equal role in the economy and society will serve to alleviate the problems associated with alienation and segregation. Spoken English must be a prerequisite for anyone from outside the EU seeking to enter the UK, for the benefit of both the UK as a whole and, especially, the migrant communities. I therefore hope that that requirement will be contained in the draft Bill on immigration and citizenship.</p>

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. She has, rightly, persistently raised this issue over a long period, and I have the greatest respect for her. When I was the Foreign Office Minister in charge of the visa system I visited the visa office in Mirpur. There was a long queue of applicants clutching forms for United Kingdom visas. I stood in front of the queue and asked, &#147;Does anyone here speak English?&#148; Not a soul moved; no one in that queue of about 100 people spoke English. That struck me as remarkable given that they all wanted to come to England.</p>

Young people must know their rights, have the opportunity to receive an education that is not impeded, and have sufficient maturity to play an active role in determining their future. The threat of marriage for the sake of family honour or agreement, rather than for the interests of the young person concerned, cannot be allowed to deprive that young person of their right to an education and to fulfil their true potential. Having had two excellent marriages, it grieves me to see marriage being used simply to get around immigration controls. I look forward to a measure to increase that age limit to 21 being contained in the draft Bill on immigration and citizenship. Denmark and Norway have already taken decisive action in that regard, which has been broadly welcomed. A measure such as the one I propose would, of course, have to apply to spouse entry from all parts of the world.</p>

that clause was removed in Committee in this House. As far as I can tell, however&#151;I apologise if my research has been incomplete&#151;there does not exist on the record in this Chamber an extended account of the overwhelmingly strong case for the admissibility of such evidence. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), the shadow Home Secretary, went some way towards remedying that omission in his excellent speech of today, and I propose to add to what he said in order to remedy it further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para17"><a name="07110717000333">In so doing, it would be wrong of me not to recognise that the Government have, in response to a suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, set up a committee of Privy Councillors to examine this issue. I am delighted that one of its members, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), is present. I have submitted evidence to it and hope to meet its members shortly. I also hope that they will report in time for their conclusions to be reflected in one or other of the Bills to which I have referred, and that they will report in favour of admissibility. I propose to devote the rest of this speech to an attempt to explain why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07110717000334">It is remarkable that we appear to be one of only two countries in the developed world that does not allow the product of interception to be used in evidence in criminal trials&#151;and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden pointed out, even that statement needs to be qualified. It is perfectly possible to rely in a prosecution in this country on intercept evidence obtained in another country. If incriminating conversations are intercepted by, for example, the Dutch authorities, the product of such interception can be&#151;and, indeed, has been&#151;admitted in evidence in the courts of our country. Only the product of evidence that has been intercepted by our own agencies cannot be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para19"><a name="07110717000335">What is the reason for that surprising state of affairs? The Government have advanced a number of reasons for their continuing opposition to taking the necessary measures to effect a change, despite their acceptance of its desirability in principle. First, they say that such evidence is likely to be ineffective in securing the conviction of terrorists. Secondly, they say that it has, thus far at least, proved impossible to devise safeguards that are strong enough to protect sensitive methods of investigation from disclosure to criminals or suspected criminals who would exploit and abuse that knowledge thereafter. Thirdly, on occasion reliance is placed on the alleged burdensome nature of the procedure which would have to be followed if such evidence were to be used in court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000336">That third reason can be dealt with swiftly. The extra time and effort involved must surely be worth while even if only a small number of terrorists, or other serious criminals, are convicted as a consequence. The same point answers the first objection. It is inconceivable that intercept evidence could never help to secure a conviction, and it is not necessary to secure a large number of convictions to make the change worth while. After all, the Government have gone through judicial hell and high water to protect their system of control orders, yet there are only 14 such orders currently in existence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000337">No, the main argument against allowing such evidence to be used is the second of the three arguments that I identified: the risk of disclosing sensitive methods of  <br>

investigation, which would then weaken our ability to protect ourselves from terrorist attack. If that risk were real, it would certainly have to be given great weight, but I contend that it is perfectly possible to identify procedures that would eliminate the risk altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000338">Two possible routes could be used. I have for some time been attracted by the model set out in the report of the Newton committee, which examined this subject in 2003. Paragraph 224 of that report stated:</p>
<a name="71107-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="07110717000573"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Another approach to the problem of confronting the suspect with specific accusations and evidence, without damaging intelligence sources and technique, would be to make a security-cleared judge responsible for assembling a fair, answerable case, based on a full range of both sensitive and non-sensitive material. This would then be tried in a conventional way by a different Judge. In our view this approach could be well suited for use in this limited context.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para23"><a name="07110717000339">Lord Lloyd, on the other hand, believes that the existing procedures on public interest immunity, as set out in part 25 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005, provide sufficient safeguards without the need to go as far as to devise the admittedly novel procedure referred to in the Newton report. I have recently become persuaded that in this, he may well be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="71107-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000340">However, there is a further long-stop safeguard that would also be available, and that seems to me to provide a complete answer to the fears about disclosure that appear to be exerting such a mesmerising influence on the Government. It is always open to the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw any particular prosecution. If, despite all expectation, the judge in a case ruled that a particular piece of sensitive evidence should be disclosed to the defence, the DPP could stop the case and withdraw the prosecution. I see no reason why, in reaching that decision, the DPP should not consult all the relevant agencies. The final say on the evidence to be disclosed would therefore not be left to a judge; the final say would be that of the DPP, which would surely be a complete safeguard against any damaging disclosure. That point seems not to have been understood by the Government.</p>

I do not see how withdrawing a prosecution can possibly amount to a breach of the ECHR, of the &#147;equality of arms&#148; principle or of any other principle. The Government have never answered that point. I do not believe that it can be answered.</p>

I think that is now well and truly worn-out because I think most people are aware of that. It does not stop them still talking but they are aware of the methodology so that is a lightweight argument. The next point which I had reservations about was the true logistics about transcribing the material, where you could go into reams of material. Again, that is a fairly moot point now, given that you can be very selective about the things you are going to transcribe if you are very precise on your investigation and focused. I think I am moving, as I know ACPO is, to a conclusion that in a selected number of cases, not just for terrorism but also for serious crime, it would be useful.

way. My parents&#146; generation did not fight&#151;and in some cases die&#151;in the last war for the national health service, the repeal of section 28 or many of the other entirely laudable and worthy things mentioned during the Lord Chancellor&#146;s speech. Indeed, if we had given in to the blandishments of Herr Hess at the beginning of the war, we would probably now have a perfectly acceptable national health service&#151;providing, of course, that one is not Jewish, black, gay, Serbian or any of the other persecuted minorities who came to this country and received here the security and freedom for which we are famous. I echo what the right hon. Gentleman said: that this House should give up the smallest part of those liberties through our collective gritted teeth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07110717000350">I have said that I am zealous, but I am not a zealot on this subject. If the Government persuaded me that the risk to my constituents, or any other constituents, of mass murder and terrible crime was so great and they asked me to subscribe to a reasonable period of extension in order to assuage or minimise that risk, I would agree with them and vote for them because I would regard that as no more than my duty, however zealous I may be about my mainspring in politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07110717000351">The burden that the Government carry in these circumstances is a high one. This is not simply a question of the balance of probabilities&#151;whether something may or may not be better. A high burden is involved when we are discussing liberties of this nature, including the ultimate liberty: the liberty not to be incarcerated without trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07110717000352">I accept that we are in a position of considerable risk, which has inevitably been increased by our foreign policy during the past seven years. The risk was increased by our decision to invade Iraq, but that does not mean that it has any bearing on whether it was right or wrong to invade; if I had believed that the invasion of Iraq was legal and necessary, I would have voted for it, notwithstanding the additional risk that would undoubtedly have been incurred. We must understand that, and I mention it only because we face an additional risk and we must take it into account.</p>

We have all considered the Butler report, some have done so in more detail than others, and we realise that the speech may deserve respect, but it is not holy writ. Therefore, we must examine the primary facts in order to decide whether the Government have crossed the high threshold in persuading us that this is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07110717000354">The Government have not done so on this occasion, for the most prosaic and obvious reason: they have not brought forward a single example in which the existing regime has failed us. The last time that we debated this, the then Home Secretary said that he had consulted his advisers, the National Technical Assistance Centre, and their advice was unequivocally that 14 or even 28 days is not enough time adequately to investigate heavily encrypted material. He said that almost exactly two years ago. In the ensuing time, there has not been one occasion on which the 28-day period has not been sufficient for the decryption of that material. If they came forward and said that they could cite four verifiable cases&#151;I am not talking about names&#151;in   <br>

which we have been severely embarrassed and worried about our position, I would take a different view, but they have not done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000355">I am sceptical about consultation on this matter, because I do not see what there is to be consulted about. The new Home Secretary brings a new, human and attractive face to her office, somewhat in contrast to those who have held it during the past 10 years. It is important that the new face should not be cosmetic. There is a feeling that consulting on this issue has a cosmetic ring to it. The principle is clear: we should not give away this liberty unless we are certain that it is necessary to do so. The Government must persuade this House as to whether it is certain to be necessary on the basis of the evidence that they have. It is as simple as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000356">The scepticism extends to the unavoidable fact that we are now told that a period of 56 or 58 days, substantially less than before, is necessary for the police and the agencies to do their job. If that is the case, why were we Whipped two years ago to vote for 90 days? The threat has not receded since, so if 90 days was necessary then, it is necessary now. The unanswerable conclusion to draw from that is that these figures are not based on scientific analysis by the police or the agencies but represent the greatest number of days that can be got past Westminster. Ninety days did not work and the consultation period is, in truth, a draw-down process to see how close one can get before the weaker people who believe in this will give way. It is a bad way to do business, particularly on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07110717000357">May I deal briefly with the encryption problem that lies at the root of this, because I simply do not understand the approach? In the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and other statutes, offences are specifically made and orders may be made compelling those who are suspected of crime or who are arrested to give up their encryption. They must provide the passwords or make the encryption legible and readable in English. If they do not do so, the power exists for them to be imprisoned. If a contempt of court is involved, that imprisonment can be endless. I simply do not understand why this power cannot be employed in order to solve precisely this problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07110717000358">Finally on this issue, what is wrong with the holding charge? It is used throughout criminal jurisprudence and there is nothing improper about it. A simple example is that when someone is found in possession of an offensive weapon, for example a knife, which is believed by the police to have been the weapon used in a murder and the murder cannot be proved until one has had the knife forensically examined, the holding charge for the possession of the knife is a perfectly reasonable way to proceed. The person is kept in custody while the necessary investigations are carried out. In dealing with terrorism, a wealth of offences can be used, not least possession of material likely to assist a terrorist. That provision is drawn so wide that in certain circumstances &#147;Scouting for Boys&#148; could be a part of such material. I am not suggesting that &#147;Scouting for Boys&#148; would be the basis for a holding charge, but possession of any material&#151;if one does not have any material, there is not much of a case&#151;could form the basis for a holding charge while investigations take place and that would not inhibit subsequent inquiry and interview. For these purposes,  <br>

one does not even need a new Bill allowing interrogation after charge, which I would agree with in a spirit of reconciliation on this particular issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000359">I shall move to a short piece of the Queen&#146;s Speech that disturbed me and will disturb many judges and practising lawyers. It has little priority, because it follows provisions on transport and employer relations. It says:</p>
<a name="71107-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="07110717000575"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Legislation to reform the criminal justice system will continue to be taken forward, with the aim of protecting the public and reducing re-offending.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000360">I say to the Minister, in one simple, compendious sentence, that we do not need any more legislation to reform the criminal justice system. To put a slight gloss on that, I can say that what would be desirable would be a large and compendious Bill that had as its purpose scrapping most of the legislation that has been passed in the last 10 years in the cause of so-called reform of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07110717000361">In the last 10 years, the Government have suffered from legislative hyperactivity syndrome in respect of criminal justice matters. I have been to the Home Office only once. I went there briefly to see a Minister who subsequently fell from grace: these things happen. I did not explore the building, but in my mind&#146;s eye I can see a vast, probably subterranean, room&#151;similar to that immortalised by Roald Dahl in &#147;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#148;&#151;out of which are churned ever more impenetrable subsections, deliberately designed to cause dismay and chaos in the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07110717000362">The figures are interesting. In the whole of the 19th century, 34 Acts were passed that affected criminal justice. In the first half of the 20th century, there were 15. In the second half of the 20th century and up to this date, there have been 48, of which 35 have been passed by this Government. It is something of a feat to pass, in 10 years, more criminal justice Acts than were passed in the whole of the 19th century. Some 400 new offences have been created and 500 new sentences. Some of the figures that are kited are far higher, but I have removed from the count old offences that have been retreaded as new offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07110717000363">Why has that happened? Have our citizens become more venal or wicked in that period? No. As the Government never tire of trumpeting, accurately, crime has fallen steadily and consistently in the course of the last 10 years. We are therefore confronted by an extraordinary rule of mathematics, for which a knowledge of higher calculus is presumably necessary. It is that the fewer crimes are committed, the more crimes it is necessary to create. We will eventually reach a point on the graph at which the crimes are so few and the new offences so many, that every person arrested will be able to have their own personalised, hallmarked crime that can bear their name in perpetuity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07110717000364">Behind that crass state of affairs lie some uncomfortable truths that we need to understand. As this is the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, I can range a little wider into history to try to explain why we have had that wholly unnecessary blizzard of legislation and the dire effects that it has had on the administration of justice. The reason has nothing to do with jurisprudence or penology, but entirely to do with politics. Let us reflect on the remarkable fact that before the 1970s no manifesto of any major party contained any reference to crime and punishment. The reason for that was the widely held and wholly accurate  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Nov 2007">

<notus-date day="7" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>7 Nov 2007 : Column 183</b><br>
perception that crime and punishment were not the business of politics, but of theology. Wickedness was not something that the House of Commons could control. We could have some effect on some of the areas that might give rise to crime, such as housing, impoverishment, indolence&#151;if necessary&#151;and educational deprivation, but on major areas of society, such as the mass media, the family, God and religious beliefs, it was rightly believed that this House had very little jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07110717000365">All of that changed in the 1970s, for two reasons. First, we embraced sociology as a science, rather than simply an enjoyable pastime. Secondly, the Conservative party perceived a wonderful political truth that they could use to devastating effect. The Labour party has always been the party of civil liberty&#151;the reason that I joined it&#151;partly because of trade union emancipation and partly because of a more liberal, Bloomsbury-type approach to society. The Conservatives perceived that they could gain an enormous political advantage. It was not difficult to portray that wonderful aspect of the Labour movement as meaning an approbation of the sinner and an indifference to the victim and it worked extraordinarily well. From the 1970s onwards, our reputation for being soft on crime was one of the albatrosses that were hung around the emaciated neck of the Labour party. It did us terrible damage, until the advent of new Labour. One of the precepts of the new Labour project was the essential need to outflank and eventually ambush the Tory party on the issues of law and order and to display a muscular, populist, Murdoch-pleasing legislation, running to hundreds of sections to persuade the people of our credentials. So has begun a Dutch or even worse auction on crime and punishment, and penology. It has done us no good at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07110717000366">Indeed, positive harm has been done to the criminal justice system. So manic has the process been, that many offences, and an even larger number of sentencing rules and rituals, are simply incomprehensible to those who pass them, those who receive them and the victims who hear them being handed out with a sense of stunned disbelief. A typical example is to be found in a Bill that is before Parliament at present. A couple of years ago, a gentleman called Sweeney committed an exceptionally serious assault and had a sentence passed on him that was totally inappropriate for the crime that he had committed. It was an insult to the victims and an affront to justice, and it caused an avalanche of criticism in the press of a perfectly good judge. As the judge carefully explained, he had no choice but to pass that wholly inappropriate sentence as a result of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, one of the great products of the Willy Wonka room in the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000367">As a result of the outcry, we now have, enshrined in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, an attempt to rectify the Sweeney problem. I shall read out a little of the provision, and I hope that the House will try to follow along. Clause 12(2) states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000369">The process that I have described has caused chaos in the criminal courts and repeated injustice in respect of victims and the sentencing of offenders. I invite the Minister or the Secretary of State to attend judicial seminars, as I do in my capacity as a recorder of the Crown court. It would be a pleasure to see the Minister there anyway, but I would invite her to appear before the judges, who, even to this day, remain members of the best cadre of such professional people in the world. I would like her to experience their raw anger and incredulity at the byzantine processes, the ludicrous homilies and mantras and the wholly inappropriate sentences that they are forced to wheel out day after day to burnish the Government&#146;s populist credentials.</p>

 We have just heard a telling speech from the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews). My only qualification of it is that he could have made it with greater comfort from the Liberal Democrat Benches. In voting against the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, for example, he would have been in no danger of remonstrance from our Whips, because we were deeply opposed to those provisions&#151;and are, indeed, to the plethora of multiplied criminal justice legislation to which he so rightly referred. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. and learned Gentleman has a good record of voting against his own party, but it would be much more comfortable for him to vote as part of a party in which his position was ideologically acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="71107-0009.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000374">The hon. and learned Gentleman also touched on something to which I hope all parties will listen: the danger of the politicisation of the criminal justice argument. The corollary of the process that he described, in which new Labour sought to outflank the Tories, is that opponents have to be described as soft on crime and drugs. Most of the leaflets that I have seen that have accused the Liberal Democrats of being soft on crime or drugs have been produced by the Labour party, which was confusing opposition to the practice of the sinner with opposition to legislation that does not deal with the problem that it is supposed to address.</p>

supporting sensible measures. However, everyone in politics must get away from dismissing civil liberties-based opposition as if it were support for conduct that civil libertarians believe either is not to be regulated by the state or is being addressed by measures that do such grievous harm to civil liberties that they should not be supported.</p>

 I wholly agree. Legislation is for defining the law and determining what is and is not an offence, not for sending signals. Ministers can make speeches to send signals as much as they like, but they should not use the legislative process or criminal justice to do so.</p>

I want to question the increasing tendency on the part of the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor, who did it today, to qualify liberty by reference to responsibility&#151;they say that with freedom comes responsibility. Of course we want people to behave responsibly; society runs a great deal better if they do. Ministers are fully entitled to promote responsible behaviour and I hope that they will do so by example as well as sermon. However, one cannot qualify liberty by reference to behaviour other than by the use of the law to determine what is a crime and what loss of liberty follows conviction for it. If a person commits a crime, they lose some of their liberty&#151;through a custodial or community sentence, or the loss of money as a result of a fine. Their liberty is rightly affected by the fact that they had committed a crime and broken the law. However, outside penal institutions, rights cannot be made contingent on general good behaviour; they can be limited only by the due process of the law. We cannot have some kind of people&#146;s soviet ruling whereby someone loses a measure of their free speech because they have failed to help with the scout troop or to use their time and energy to help the parish council in the litter-clearing exercise that was rightly undertaken. There are lots of good things that people should do and that I want them to do&#151;I am involved in encouraging and supporting voluntary organisations&#151;but  <br>

However, the pulpit is the place for that, not the statute book, which must contain a clearly defined understanding of what can be determined by law. For that we go back to something that the Prime Minister was ready to quote: John Mill&#146;s essay &#147;On Liberty&#148;.

The Justice Committee is to take evidence on devolution 10 years on, including the English question and the issue of the regions, given that we now have a situation where much power is exercised at regional level without any democratic accountability. These are not questions that admit of easy solutions; indeed, with every solution come new questions and problems. We have recently heard from Conservative Members arguments about what was called in the 19th century the &#147;in-out&#148; principle&#151;English votes on English laws. Some people outside this House argue strongly for an English parliament. My party has traditionally argued for regional assemblies. Everyone is trying to address a genuine problem, which must be done in the context of a United Kingdom in which England is much larger than the other units&#151;so large that when looked at from my end of the country London is further away than it is from much of Scotland. Purely London-based solutions do not necessarily answer this. The Justice Committee is holding a major inquiry on devolution 10 years on&#151;not to review how it has worked in Scotland, because we see that as the province of the Scottish Affairs Committee or, in the case of Wales, the Welsh Affairs Committee&#151;but to see how it has affected the United Kingdom as a whole. One consequence of that is that we will need to look pretty closely at the situation in England.</p>

In Northumberland, we had a referendum in 2004 to address the question of, first, whether there should be regional assemblies and, secondly, whether there should be one or two unitary authorities to govern the whole county of Northumberland, at present served by a county council and six district councils. People voted by a substantial majority not to have a regional assembly, so we are not having one. People voted by a substantial majority to have two unitary authorities, not one, so we are going to have one. The Government have decided that because certain  <br>

stakeholders they chose to consult&#151;namely, the chief constable and the north-east chambers of commerce&#151;would like one authority, that outweighs the vote of the people who voted in the referendum. Those stakeholders were chosen by the Government and, almost without exception, cover areas much larger than the one or two authorities that are under discussion&#151;it is much more convenient for them to deal with fewer authorities, not more, and they tend to look at it that way&#151;but their votes carry more weight than those of the people who voted in the referendum. The Government still have quite a bit to learn about how to apply the principle of strengthening the relationship between Government, Parliament and the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07110717000391">Another issue that will be considered in the course of this Parliament is that of judicial appointments. The Government recently, quite rightly, changed the judicial appointments system&#151;a reform that I strongly supported and that the Committee examined, and is monitoring, in detail. Some of the objectives are not initially being met and problems have arisen. There have been significant delays in judicial appointments and difficulty in ensuring that we are getting diversity by the proper and accepted route of identifying candidates for judicial office who are fully suited to it but come from a wider background than has been the case hitherto. The new system is gradually bedding down, so it may not be a good idea to make fundamental changes again so soon, although I fully accept the argument behind the Government&#146;s changes, which is to minimise ministerial, and therefore potentially political, involvement in judicial appointments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07110717000392">The Government are considering this against the background that they are still in conflict with the judges following the creation of the Ministry of Justice. There is still an unresolved dispute between Ministers and judges about whether it was created on a basis that will protect judicial independence, particularly in a situation where the Department to which they relate has in its brief the prison system&#151;that all-consuming, voracious eater-up of Government money. Judges rightly fear that the functioning of the judiciary could be impaired, financially and more generally, by being co-located with the prison system. The Government did not have much alternative to setting it up on the basis that they did, but they were wrong not to have sought to resolve the dispute beforehand. For the Lord Chief Justice to read in his Sunday papers that there was going to be a Ministry of Justice was clearly no way to go about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000393">In their paper on the subject, the Government talked about the judiciary in Parliament and the question of confirmation hearings. My Committee has been firm in its opposition to the idea that we should hold confirmation hearings for the appointment of judges. We have all looked at the American experience, which might be sufficient to put us off, but there are more compelling theoretical reasons not to do it. In this country, we choose judges not according to the views that they hold but according to their ability to set aside those views and make objective judgments. It is therefore irrelevant if a judge is of a rather conservative disposition or a rather liberal one&#151;we want to know whether he can make judgments according to the law that are not unduly influenced by the dispositions that he might have.</p>

 I am sympathetic to the position that the right hon. Gentleman and his Committee have taken, but it involves a growing difficulty, particularly as a consequence of the Human Rights Act 1998. The decisions that judges are being asked to make are increasingly political in flavour. Given that, for example, they now have to decide on issues of proportionality, which were traditionally always reserved for elected Members of Parliament, is it not understandable, and perhaps inevitable, that their views will be seen to be relevant? Is that not a particularly damaging consequence of the new responsibilities that have been entrusted to the judiciary?</p>

 I wonder whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman is still feeling the pain of the many judgments against the Home Office during the time when he was Home Secretary. In so far as there may be truth in what he says, there is another reason not to have confirmation hearings&#151;to ensure that we continue to have a process of choosing judges for their objectivity, not one in which we seek to place in position judges who might give the result that particular Governments want at particular times. The process that he attributes to the Human Rights Act was always likely to go on anyway, but in Strasbourg rather than in our own courts. I am rather more confident of the ability of our own judges, against the background of our tradition, to be as objective as it is possible to be in the kind of situation that he describes than I am about a mixed panel of judges who come from very many different traditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000396">Another problem arises from the changes that the Government have made&#151;that we will be plucking from the House of Lords the Law Lords, who without any doubt made extremely valuable contributions to debate, although in the constitutionally difficult situation that, until they resolved that they were not going to do it any more, they were potentially framing legislation on which they might subsequently pass judgment. That has not been the practice in recent years because they decided to absent themselves from issues on which they might give judgment or cases on which they had previously spoken during the passage of the original legislation. We will lose from the House of Lords that ability to learn how things will affect, or have affected, the judiciary. Following discussions that I had with the past and present Lord Chief Justice, my Committee has successfully developed the solution that judges from every level should appear before the Committee, which then reports to the House on the evidence that they have given on issues such as how the judiciary is coping with the pressures on it or the working of particular pieces of legislation. Such questions are divorced from the political process, and we have posed them in an atmosphere that enables judges to give valuable evidence without feeling that their position is compromised in any way.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Law Lords&#151;and former Law Lords&#151;make an extremely valuable contribution, but the Committee took a strong view on the matter, believing that either no justices of the Supreme Court should go to the second Chamber in retirement, or that all of them should. In other words, the Government should not be allowed to pick and choose from among Supreme Court judges as it might be thought that those judges were waiting to see whether they would get the rather attractive retirement option of being appointed to the second Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07110717000399">My inclination is that no Supreme Court judges should be so appointed, and indeed that we should continue to employ them for as many years as we reasonably can. Sometimes we get a bit too precious about age restrictions in the judiciary. In earlier years, when we had 85-year-old judges, we may have gone to the other extreme, but we may have got a little too fussy about judges who may still be able to render active service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07110717000400">The Government seem to be groping for an alternative to confirmation hearings. They have looked at the idea of post-appointment hearings, but I think that they would be an unnecessary formality. My Committee takes evidence from judges when it is relevant to what we are doing, or when we sense that judges want to give evidence about a particular matter. I see no benefit in bringing a judge before the Committee for an evidence session just because he happens to have been appointed head of the Queen&#146;s bench division in the past two or three months. There is no logic in that, and it risks formalising what I believe is developing into a fruitful and effective process, by which judges at every level&#151;from the Lord Chief Justice to lay magistrates&#151;give evidence about every aspect of the work of the courts when it is most valuable and appropriate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07110717000401">The Government should forget confirmation hearings and not try to construct some alternative to them.

The Prime Minister, who comes from a good Scottish Presbyterian background, is anxious to divest himself of involvement with them. The Government said that they were going to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor, but they have had to take a step back&#151;literally, in the case of the way that the latest Lord Chancellor stepped backwards from the throne yesterday. They forgot that the Lord Chancellor appoints about 1,000 people to various ecclesiastical posts.</p>

All the parish representatives were unanimous in their praise of the Downing street officials who manage the task. We were told that those officials were very careful in identifying a parish&#146;s needs and in following up to make sure that their judgments were correct and that the people appointed had appropriate support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="71107-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000406">We then spoke to three bishops to see what they thought. Each had a completely different view about what should be done with the patronage if it were taken away from the Lord Chancellor and was in some way handed over to the Church. So we were confronted with people who thought that the present system worked extremely well, and with three bishops who could not agree about what system should replace the current arrangements. To me, that does not seem like an environment in which a reforming Government can move very easily, and I therefore counsel them to be a bit careful. As a non-conformist, I can well understand the arguments of principle, but it was a fascinating evidence session. Before Ministers take the matter much further, I hope that they will sit down and read the evidence that was given on that occasion.</p>

Moreover, it is clearly impossible to ignore the scale of donation to the Conservative party, something that the Liberal Democrats have experienced only to a much more limited&#151;and occasionally controversial&#151;extent.</p>

I am very disappointed that the all-party talks seem to have broken down at the moment, and I do not think that any party can have a veto on progress in this matter. However, whether the Government are able to make progress will depend on whether they can retain a broadly even-handed approach. The Government will have to get legislation through both Houses of Parliament, and they do not have a majority in the other place. Cross-Bench peers, as well as my colleagues, will be looking for evidence that the Government are bringing forward a settlement that is reasonably objective. If that settlement cannot be achieved by means of a formal agreement among the parties, the Government will go ahead and legislate. I would not criticise them for doing so, as no one should have a veto on this matter, but they would be successful only if the basis of the legislation were widely seen to be objective.</p>

I also remind the Government that they will have to return to the question of electoral reform, and that they have still not fulfilled their commitment to publish a document that they have been preparing for I do not know how long. I have no great hopes for the document, as I suspect that those who wrote it were looking over their shoulder the whole time. However, we cannot look at the British constitution from a basis of principle, as the Prime Minister wants to do, without asking the question: does the system ensure that the opinions of voters are fairly represented in Parliament in a way that enables government to be conducted in an orderly and consistent manner? Such questions must be addressed and that means looking at electoral systems.</p>

The Government have an opportunity, but they are being seriously neglectful of a situation that affects many of our constituents.</p>

It is only through phone calls from Departments and offers of extra help that we can deal with things that the system should be capable of coping with already. The Government must return to that matter, and the Committee will continue to monitor what they are doing on that and other issues.</p>

 Like other Members, I welcome the chance to take part in the debate on the Gracious Speech and to speak about security.</p>

I worked for a couple of years at the Home Office as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the current Attorney-General, and to those who trivialise the threat of terrorism, I say, &#147;Think again&#148;. This country is under serious threat. I have no time for the conspiracy theorists who say everything is got up by the Government and the security services: national security is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000424">One measure I welcome in connection with making our nation and our communities feel safe is a unified border force. North East Lincolnshire, where Cleethorpes is located, sounds like a nice, rural area, but that is misleading. We have one of the biggest and busiest ports in the country at Immingham, where, as with the other Humber ports of Goole and Hull, a phenomenal amount of freight traffic enters the UK. All too often, those of us in that part of Lincolnshire feel a bit forgotten in debates such as this one. When we talk about national security and border forces, we probably naturally think of our large cities, such as London, and ports such as Dover, but the sheer volume of traffic in places such as Immingham means that we need to consider the area seriously in any debate about national security. I shall be keen to see how a unified border force will pan out in areas of the country such as the one I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000425">In addition to our ports, we have an airport in my constituency. Increasingly, people trying to enter the UK clandestinely are avoiding some of the more &#147;traditional&#148; ports of entry. I have forgotten the length of the UK coastline&#151;I knew it when I was at school&#151;but it is phenomenally long. People are using smaller ports and airports to try to enter the country clandestinely, which has implications for national security. If it is easier to enter the country through those ports and airports, people who want to target the UK could use them, so I hope that Ministers will ensure ample security coverage outside the main cities and the southern coast ports of Britain.</p>

According to the British crime survey, crime has decreased, but we would probably all say that people feel no safer in their communities. People&#146;s sense of personal security depends largely on what happens when they open their front doors, what people see when they walk down the street, what happens in their workplaces, what they read in national and local newspapers, what they see on the local news and what they hear on the radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07110717000427">I worked as a journalist for many years before entering this House. I do not know whether other hon. Members agree, but I feel that in recent years our local and national media have focused more and more on crime. Journalists must report the news, but whenever I open a local newspaper, it seems to me that there are many more terrifying banner headlines compared with when I was younger. That gives the impression that the law has broken down in all our communities, which is not the case, because it is usually a minority who hold a community to ransom through their lawless behaviour. In many ways, politicians are also responsible, because we always talk about crime, and there is almost an arms race on who can introduce the toughest legislation. I am not blaming a particular party, because we are all complicit in a situation in which crime has gone down but people do not feel commensurately more safe and secure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07110717000428">Last night, through the wonders of satellite television, I watched the local news from my area, &#147;Look North&#148;, which included yet another report of an attack on Humberside fire and rescue. When the fire brigade was called out to deal with an arson attack on an estate called the Willows, it was deliberately attacked. What sort of people would do that, given that four firefighters had lost their lives just two days earlier? The thugs involved broke into properties and removed fixtures and fittings, to which they then set light, and when the fire brigade arrived, they deliberately attacked it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07110717000429">Following that report, and similar reports in the past couple of weeks, people have contacted me to ask what the Government are doing and to suggest the need for legislation, but legislation has been introduced. The Father of the House introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on attacks on the emergency services, and it became law. Those provisions came into force in the past couple of months, and people need to be reminded that they exist. When people saw that news report, however, those provisions did not make them feel any safer, because they saw the break-ins and arson attacks&#151;it was all very graphic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07110717000430">In my part of the country, people are worried about antisocial behaviour, and I guess that people are worried about it up and down the land. People do not feel safe if, when they walk out of their front doors, they see graffiti and broken windows, or if there is noise at night. In that case, they feel that crime has taken hold, which makes them more fearful, although crime has gone down.</p>

ratification of crime statistics, no parallel information is gathered in relation to antisocial behaviour, graffiti and other matters that people worry about. Although crime is falling, we do not have the data to reassure people about other matters that alarm them about the quality of their lives and the security of their homes.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes some valid points. Although the police are judged on how they deal with antisocial behaviour, the gathering of statistics on behaviour that often stops short of the criminal is not particularly robust, and perhaps we can consider that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07110717000433">I am afraid to say that North East Lincolnshire and the area covered by Humberside police was rather late to pick up on the national agenda&#151;on police community support officers, for instance. I know that some people argue that we need more warranted officers, but when PCSOs were on offer, I and other Members of Parliament for the area urged the police authority to go down that route. Unfortunately, the police authority did not agree, so it was one of the last parts of the country to get community support officers. That may have fed into people&#146;s feeling that they are not safe, despite the fact that crime is going down. They are beginning to see the community support officers on the street, and I am pleased that the current chief constable has worked hard to pull the situation back because we started so very late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000434">I raised the matter with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), who kindly visited the constituency and met people who were troubled by antisocial behaviour. He came up a couple of months ago, and I think that he found the visit very instructive. When he was being questioned by victims of antisocial behaviour, I found it interesting that people were again saying, &#147;Why don&#146;t the Government do something?&#148; It was similar to the response to the attacks on the fire services. He responded, &#147;The Government have done this, and have done that.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000435">We should consider how well councils, the police and other organisations with which we work to tackle antisocial behaviour and crime are using the powers available to them. There are two unitary authorities in my constituency, and one of them is certainly a lot further behind the other in using the powers available to it&#151;when one has experience of two neighbouring authorities, one can compare and contrast. I want the Government to give people a bit of a push to use the powers that are already available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000436">Probably only a minority of people are responsible for the antisocial behaviour in our communities, and they hold us to ransom. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill is a carry-over Bill, but I welcome one particular aspect of it&#151;the extension of crack house closure powers to deal with premises at the centre of serious and persistent disorder or nuisance regardless of tenure. That is vital. Whether councils are slow to act or not, they have powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, as do registered social landlords and housing associations. However, there was a gap in relation to private landlords and owner-occupiers. I am pleased that the powers are now available to tackle that part of antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07110717000437">Literacy and numeracy are linked with criminality and antisocial behaviour. It is a sad fact that the majority of people who commit serious crimes in this country have very poor literacy and numeracy skills. The same goes for the whole prison population, and we have to tackle that problem by taking a more integrated approach. I do not know how many Members saw it, but there was an instructive documentary on TV. People will think that I spend all my time watching TV&#151;in fact, it is rather rare that I do, but this documentary was very instructive. It was called &#147;Last Chance Kids&#148; and I think it was filmed in Barking and Dagenham; it was certainly that part of the world. It was about a primary school that focused on ensuring that every child gained some ability to read in a year. The head teacher had given herself a year to try to improve such skills. It was instructive to note that young boys with the poorest literacy and numeracy skills were the most disruptive in the class. Antisocial behaviour, which could lead to more serious behaviour, was therefore beginning in primary school. The pupils were bored and, as they progressed through the school, they had no connection with what was happening, so they became disruptive in the classroom and in the playground. They began to bully. By the end of the year, the head teacher had managed to get all the children reading, and their behaviour improved enormously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="71107-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000438">We must therefore consider such matters when we discuss criminal justice and antisocial behaviour. Drug treatment orders are currently available when someone is convicted of a crime, but should not we consider numeracy orders? That might sound a bit trite, but prisons do not tackle offenders&#146; literacy and numeracy. We must examine that in greater depth. Literacy and numeracy could be improved, for example, through offender management when people are released from a custodial sentence or in other ways. However we do it, we must make people who commit crimes literate and numerate. If we are to break the cycle of criminality, we must give them the necessary skills, which start with the most basic&#151;literacy and numeracy. I would love tests to be conducted on those convicted of a crime to assess their skills.</p>

John Ellis. It featured in <i> The Sunday Times </i>magazine a few weeks ago. Like the head teacher in the east end who was trying to get some of the toughest kids and those with most difficulties reading, Space takes some of the most challenging young people in our community and tries to break the cycles of antisocial behaviour and criminality. It is achieving astounding results with some of those challenging young people. We must get people reading and improve people&#146;s skills. I hope that the Government&#146;s agenda and some aspects of the Queen&#146;s Speech will contribute to that, but it is not easy to do. It will take a generation because it has to work through society before we genuinely experience the impact of such policies.</p>

covered the worst and best places to live in Britain. North East Lincolnshire came out as the sixth worst place. That was based on all sorts of statistics. We are a coastal area, with infrastructure problems; we are remote and so on. However, if a local authority and other agencies are trying to get investment and bring in teachers and doctors to their remote urban area, they do not need Phil and Kirstie going around saying that it is the sixth worst place to live in Britain. I am sorry to say that Grimsby regularly features in a book called &#147;Crap Towns&#148;&#151;I am not sure whether that is unparliamentary language. Barrow upon Humber in north Lincolnshire has been judged an excellent place to live. It is, therefore, not all bad news, and Cleethorpes beach has blue-flag status, which is wonderful.</p>

The council wants to change the name of the local authority from North East Lincolnshire to Grimsby. It makes no sense to use all that money to change the name of the local authority, which is well described by North East Lincolnshire, because that is where it is. The money could be better used in tackling antisocial behaviour, for example.</p>

I might even get some answers, now that one of them has walked back in. Thanks to changes that the Government introduced, I recently had to spend some time on jury service.

If we are to achieve justice and deal with victims, we have to do something about people&#146;s perceptions of victims and how they should behave in court. We need a far better explanation of what constitutes consent in cases involving sexual offences. We also need much more simplicity in saying what &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148; means, which does not necessarily have to mean beyond all doubt.</p>

As she rightly said, the solution to antisocial behaviour is not more legislation but good old-fashioned policing. I am not even convinced by the antisocial behaviour order procedure, as it is not being enforced and breaches are treated with complete contempt.

I am currently in limbo, because the Department of Trade and Industry no longer exists and its Select Committee was wound up at the end of the last Session. We were supposed to have a seamless transition to the new Committee. I am not sure whether the Committee chaired by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed still exists&#151;</p>

The Lord High Chancellor, to give him his proper title, spoke briefly about that during his speech today. I would have liked to have asked him what he meant by an increased role, as I have seen only rather limited proposals for confirmatory hearings, which have their limitations. In a way, Select Committees have that power anyway. We certainly enjoyed our de facto confirmatory hearing with Lord Jones of Birmingham when he appeared before us in his role as the new trade Minister. I am not sure whether he enjoyed it quite so much, but we certainly had a good time. There also seem to be proposals for increased debates on Select Committee reports, which would be good. All too often, such reports are written and then simply gather dust. However, Select Committees already have power to revisit reports and to reopen inquiries if they are dissatisfied with the progress that is being made, so I shall be interested to see exactly what the increased powers for Select Committees will involve.</p>

That could be quite a challenge to Secretaries of State, who will be expected to lead those sections of Question Time. That will be good. I am puzzled, however, by the draft legislative programme. I had not realised, until the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed told me, that an item had been quickly and peremptorily dropped from it, and I agree with him about the importance of the coroners Bill.

them. So far as I can tell, only one of those Bills exists in draft, which is unfortunate. The Government need to think again about whether pre-empting the Queen&#146;s Speech in July actually serves any useful purpose. Certainly it was too late for the old Trade and Industry Committee to examine the Bills proposed in the draft legislative programme, because we just could not organise a meeting in time following the very late announcement. Some of the Bills from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform are very welcome, but I do not see the point of the preliminary announcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000457">My main subjects today are not confined to the Home Office or, indeed, to the Ministry of Justice. I apologise to Ministers, but I intend to use the latitude of the second day of the Queen&#146;s Speech debate to range more widely over issues relevant to tomorrow&#146;s debate on local government, next Tuesday&#146;s debate on education and Wednesday&#146;s on the economy. As the hon. Member for Cleethorpes suggested, many issues need a more holistic approach. I hesitate to use that word and I am struggling for a better one, but joined-up is equally a clich&#233;&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, a broad approach; I am grateful for that suggestion. I refer to issues that cannot easily be pigeon-holed into individual days of debate or departmental responsibilities. Competitiveness, skills, climate change, security and energy supply&#151;these are issues in respect of which many Departments have a role to play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07110717000458">I suppose that my overarching concern&#151;I noticed it in this Queen&#146;s Speech as I have in previous ones&#151;is that the Government seem to be addicted to legislation, regulation and interference rather than just effective administration. Why cannot Government Departments, Government organisations, public services and local authorities be left to get on with the job and do things better rather than this constant shuffling of the pack? I am thinking of what will be the Trade and Industry Committee&#146;s last ever publication, which comes out tomorrow. It deals with public procurement. There are some very important recommendations in that report, but as far as I can tell none requires new legislation to make them work. I suggest one motto for the Government: &#147;Doing less better&#148;, which would be a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07110717000459">Let me deal with issues that specifically concern the Home Office and, to some extent, the Department for Work and Pensions. I am thinking of the scandal over recent immigration statistics. We do not need a criminal justice or immigration Bill to deal with the problem; rather, we should let Departments do their jobs better. One of our recent Select Committee reports&#151;&#147;Europe moves East&#148;&#151;drew attention to the woeful inadequacies in immigration statistics and suggested mechanisms available to the Government to provide better and more accurate estimates. It does not require legislation to improve the position; it requires the Government to get on with the job of running government more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000460">I had intended to quote the Select Committee report at length, but I will not do so. I hope that the Government will respond thoughtfully to our suggestions for better statistics, which are really important not just for public services but for the whole future of the UK economy&#146;s competitiveness. We need to know with greater certainty how many immigrants are over here and we need to know their long-term intentions. How many of them will remain here and  <br>

how many will go back to their home countries, taking with them the skills and good will for this country that they fostered while they were here?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000461">I would like the Home Office to think very carefully about one particular issue in the report. There is evidence that central and east European migrant workers who come here to work in the agricultural sector rapidly move on to higher skill jobs elsewhere or to other jobs that they find more congenial. The agricultural sector, and particularly the horticultural sector, is thus short of people to pick and pack produce, which has potentially serious consequences for the availability of British food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07110717000462">On Saturday, I talked to a farmer who is cutting his strawberry crop by half because he does not believe that he can find the workers to pick his strawberries. He is going back to arable farming over large areas of his land. At precisely the time when British consumers are demanding more products, that is a very unwelcome development indeed. I hope that the Government will think again with the utmost care about the abolition of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. We still need Ukrainians, Russians, Bulgarians and Romanians on those tightly monitored and well organised schemes to ensure that we have the people in place to provide British consumers with the British food that they want to eat. Again, however, that does not need new legislation; we just need to use existing legislation better. Indeed, perhaps ironically for a Conservative, I think that it is better not to scrap a piece of legislation that is already on the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07110717000463">Another example of where further legislation is unnecessary relates to education. We are getting an education Bill, but it will not sort out the most pressing education issue facing my constituents. I have given notice to the two other Members concerned that I would be raising this matter. I am pleased to see one of them in the Chamber, but I appreciate that as a Whip he is not able to respond to the comments that I am about to make. Worcestershire&#146;s rotten funding deal is what disadvantages our children and our schools. We need to close the gap between ours and the better funded authorities&#151;a gap that has grown in both absolute and relative terms over the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07110717000464">I observe in passing how great it is to have the time to debate the Queen&#146;s Speech, but what a shame that we are not debating the comprehensive spending review or the pre-Budget report. In &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, the Government said that debates on those statements were literally automatic and should be an important part of this House&#146;s scrutiny of the Executive. We seem to be denied the chance of a debate on those issues this time round, however, so the Queen&#146;s Speech is the next best vehicle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07110717000465">I am disappointed that the current Home Secretary&#151;a Worcestershire Member of Parliament&#151;who will be replying to the debate, was not able to address the unfair funding gap for Worcestershire when she was a Schools Minister. I am even more disappointed that she chooses to attack the local education authority for the cuts that it is obliged to make to local services as a result of the unfair funding deal that she was not able to address. The hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) is shaking his head. He and I had quite a strong exchange recently about the issue of school balances. It is utterly outrageous that the  <br>

Government ever planned to tax schools for making prudent provision for future financial years. Of course excess balances need to be treated with considerable concern, and reduced where possible. Many schools in Worcestershire, however, must save up across the end of a financial year for things that other schools, in other parts of the country, take for granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07110717000466">The idea that schools would lose money automatically for making prudent provision was an outrage. I was disappointed that the hon. Gentleman originally supported that policy. I am glad that the Government had a change of heart, and I hope that he now admits that the policy was wrong. I disagree with his comment that the county council is awash with cash. We do not need new legislation in the Queen&#146;s Speech to address the huge financial problems that the county council faces in finding &#163;25 million in savings. The Government have the power to put that right now, but instead Ministers and Government Members prefer to attack local people, head teachers, governors and councillors for their attempts to deal with the unfair situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07110717000467">That leads me to another future concern. We do not need a health and social care Bill to address the looming crisis in Worcestershire and around the country of the growing number of elderly, mentally impaired patients suffering from dementia and a range of other diseases of old age. The Government have given the NHS a 4 per cent. increase this year and have given local authorities less than 1 per cent. Let us guess whom they will blame when local councils have to make cuts that the NHS does not have to make, and when those elderly people pay the price. They are setting councils up to fail, and they will blame councils. The blame, however, lies with the Government. We need not a health and social care Bill but a better balance between the different parts of the care system. It is one of my overall themes that many of the problems that we face need not new Bills but a new Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000468">The other main theme of my speech is that we are at the 11th hour on a number of issues. Time is running out on many issues of concern to my Committee, which I hope will be the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee in a few days&#146; time. Such issues include: a skilled work force for the future; a secure energy supply; and a competitive, flexible Europe. Those issues are addressed by Bills in the Queen&#146;s Speech, but given that the question of liberty has so rightly dominated this afternoon&#146;s debate, the Government are approaching too many of those problems with unacceptable authoritarianism, burdened with a legacy of complacency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000469">I shall be briefer on the following subjects than I had hoped, as they are not strictly relevant to today&#146;s debate, but let us take the example of the energy Bill. I will probably support that Bill in the Lobby, subject to its precise detail. How could any Conservative oppose a measure to cut carbon emissions, secure the best energy mix for the UK, encourage the private sector to fund, construct and operate new nuclear plants, assist private sector investment in gas supply projects and create a framework for private sector cash to be channelled into carbon capture and storage projects? What worries me,  <br>

<notus-date day="7" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>7 Nov 2007 : Column 204</b><br>
however, is that the Government have come to the subject so late. A legacy of complacency makes the Bill desperately overdue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000470">The current energy review flows from a missed opportunity&#151;the 2003 energy White Paper. The writing was on the wall then, but the Government chose to ignore it. A realisation of the serious future energy gap that we face has kick-started the new energy review process, which has been under way for two years. Three consultations on nuclear power have taken place, but still no formal decision has been taken on whether to give the go-ahead. The public&#146;s perception, I am afraid, is that it is just a rubber-stamping exercise, and that is not helped by the fact that the nuclear installations inspectorate has already begun a public consultation on potential reactor designs, before the Government&#146;s announcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07110717000471">The Government should, say, two years ago, have made a more honest, rapid and prudent declaration that they wanted new nuclear power stations and pressed ahead then with the measures necessary to deliver them: persuading the public of the need; dealing with the nuclear waste legacy; and above all, creating a stable price for carbon. The Government still express confidence in the EU emissions trading scheme, and I hope that they are right. I am glad that they have reserved the option of taking additional powers should that scheme not deliver the price for carbon, but it is crucial not just for nuclear but for renewable energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000472">The only area in which there seems to be progress is planning. I am delighted that the Government are trying to deal with that issue, but I worry that they may not be getting the methodology quite right. I am particularly worried about the fact that they are paying no attention to renewable heat and not enough attention to combined heat and power; but those are subjects for another debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07110717000473">Some people say that we need to be, in John Howard&#146;s memorable phrase, &#147;alert but not alarmed&#148; about future energy supplies, but I am becoming a bit alarmed. More than 30 per cent. of our supply will shut down over the next 20 years, and all our nuclear power stations except Sizewell B, as well as many older coal-fired stations, are due to be closed. There is a real sense of a lost opportunity. This energy Bill should have been in the Queen's Speech two or three years ago, and I am sorry that it is so late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07110717000474">I had to laugh recently when I read &#147;Energy Markets Outlook&#148;, published by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The Minister for Energy, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), commented that the report suggested the existence of</p>

necessary clarity and enabling public inquiries to take place in a much shorter time. I hope that this Bill is the right one, but I am very apprehensive about it: I fear that it will take a sledgehammer to crack a nut, destroying local accountability in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para29"><a name="07110717000477">The hon. Member for Cleethorpes raised another issue that is directly relevant to the debate. The education and skills Bill is potentially very important because, as she said, there is a strong correlation between criminality and low levels of educational attainment. Ask any magistrate, and he or she will say that that is true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07110717000478">Skills shortages in the UK work force are now chronic. Only about half our population have the equivalent of national vocational qualifications at level 3 or higher, and 31 or 32 per cent. have qualifications at level 1 or lower. Those are not the qualifications that the modern economy needs; it requires qualifications at level 3 or higher. One in four maths teachers are not specialists, but they are teaching maths because of shortages. The number of A-level physics students has declined by 38 per cent. over the last 17 years, while 26 per cent. of state secondary schools have no physics specialist and 12 per cent. have no chemistry specialist. One in six British adults does not have the literacy skills expected of an 11-year-old, and 50 per cent. of those people do not have that level of functional numeracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para32"><a name="07110717000482">The centrepiece of the education and skills Bill is the extension to 18 of the minimum school or training leaving age. I feel that that is an authoritarian approach from an authoritarian Government. It does not address the real issue, which is how we can motivate young people to want to be trained and how we can upskill the current work force. That is where we desperately need to improve our game. As I said earlier, employers now see level 3 as a benchmark. Countries in central and eastern Europe, behind the old iron curtain, have much higher levels of vocational and academic qualification, which give them a sharp competitive edge in the difficult world that we now face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71107-0012.htm_para33"><a name="07110717000483">I think that the Bill sets the wrong agenda. We should not force people to do things that they do not want to do; we should encourage them to want to do those things. I agree that the number of NEETs&#151;those not in education, employment or training&#151;has risen to a scandalous level under this Government over the past few years, from 160,000 to 220,000, but we should encourage young people to stay in education rather than forcing them to do so. I wonder what would have happened if Richard Branson had been commanded to take A-levels in English literature and philosophy, rather than going off and making his fortune. I do not think that compulsion is the right way in which to deal with such an important issue.</p>

Broken families, welfare dependency, inner-city deprivation and discrimination are all symptoms of a broken society. The Government are appearing to be tough on skills shortages when they should be tough on the causes of skills shortages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07110717000485">The last Bill to which I shall refer&#151;I shall make it six rather than seven, in view of the time&#151;is the European treaty Bill. I think it is a matter of trust that there should be a referendum on the European treaty. Trust is the paramount reason. Almost every Member was elected on the promise of a referendum on the treaty. The treaty is the constitution by another name and we should, on the grounds of honour and trust alone, have a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07110717000486">I have another major concern, however. Europe must face up more than it has done to the consequences of globalisation and an increasingly competitive world. I discern in this new treaty all the old instincts of the old Europe, such as the instinct to centralise&#151;to take power away from countries and communities and to impose on them regimes that are not necessarily those required to survive and flourish in a competitive world. </p>

The Government have a long and proud record on tackling those issues and can boast that they are firmly on the side of the victim and want there to be strong communities that can live in harmony without the fear of crime stalking the streets. They have gone some way towards achieving that. Since 1997, overall crime has fallen by a third. Car crime and burglary rates have more than halved. Adult reoffending rates have fallen. There have also been reductions in people&#146;s fear of crime and perceptions of antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07110717000491">Neighbourhood policing has a key role to play in building confidence in the fight against crime in local areas. That is why every community will by April next year have a neighbourhood policing team working with local people to focus on the crime issues that matter to them. I have seen that for myself in the village of West Cornforth in my constituency. I was recently involved in a neighbourhood policing exercise in that village. Agencies were working together to clamp down on antisocial behaviour blackspots and looking out for signal crimes such as graffiti that they could tackle at an early stage before things got out of hand. The youth project there has also helped to give responsibility to young people, and given them ownership of how they organise and run the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07110717000492">As a consequence of neighbourhood policing, proactive local agencies and a community not scared to face challenges, antisocial behaviour has fallen significantly in the area. In Sedgefield, crime is more that 20 per cent. below the national average. Neighbourhood policing is helping to secure that. In West Cornforth, a balance has been struck between providing something for young people to do through the community youth drop-in centre while, at the same time, policing in a firm but neighbourly way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000493">There is still more to do, however. That is why I am pleased to be involved in the Committee stage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. Its provisions will help tackle crime on the estates where I grew up in Sedgefield, and elsewhere. Violent offender orders will allow courts to impose post-sentence restrictions on those convicted of violent offences. The Bill will extend the existing crack house powers to tackle premises at the centre of serious and persistent disorder or nuisance, regardless of tenure. There will be new powers to deal with nuisance or disturbance on NHS premises. The creation of youth rehabilitation orders will provide community sentences for children and young offenders. These provisions will, once again, place the Government on the side of the victim and the community. However, our approach to ridding our communities of crime needs to be holistic and to offer a balance&#151;as shown in West Cornforth&#151;between punishing the criminal and providing potential offenders with the opportunity of not offending, stopping them in their tracks, especially when they are young, turning them around and setting them on a different course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000494">We all hear in our constituencies of young people who might be causing problems on estates, standing on street corners being a nuisance. We hear of young people on the streets, in back alleys and elsewhere, drinking illegally. However, this is not an issue for public houses; rather, it must be addressed by shopkeepers and supermarkets, where it is perhaps possible to buy 20 cans of beer for &#163;10. On occasion, young people get somebody aged over 18 to go into a supermarket to buy &#163;10-worth of beer, so that they can drink it outside.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right&#151;Durham constabulary has a very good record on this issue, including in my constituency. However, the responsibility needs to fall on shopkeepers and supermarkets, as well. There has to be a combined initiative in cracking down on this problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07110717000497">I have always thought that, before we start criticising young people, we as a community must offer them the opportunity to do something else other than stand on street corners. That is why the Bill introduced in the Gracious Speech to use money from dormant bank accounts to invest in our communities, especially in youth services, is a tremendous idea. Giving young people something to do in their spare time is surely more productive than their becoming frustrated and taking out that frustration on local communities. My approach is this: if young people want to use youth centres, that is fine; if they do not, that, too, is fine. However, if they choose the third option&#151;being disruptive in their community&#151;the police and local agencies should have the powers to ensure that that disruption is stopped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07110717000498">However, it would be wrong to give the impression that all of today&#146;s young people want to cause trouble&#151;they do not. Just the other day, two young people, Grant Parker and Georgia Howe, came to my constituency office to ask for support in starting a youth forum in Newton Aycliffe. I will support them. They want to gather together a group of young people to talk about the changes that they would like to see in their area, and to get across the very valid point that a lot of young people do a great deal of good in the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000499">Last week, I visited 1407 air cadet squadron in Newton Aycliffe, which consists of 54 young people between the ages of 13 and 20 from Newton Aycliffe, Chilton and elsewhere in the constituency. They are commanded by Flying Officer Karin Scott, and they have won the Lindisfarne trophy in two out of the past three years because they are seen as the most outstanding air cadet squadron in the north-east. Their squadron is one of many throughout the country. They learn to fly, sit for a diploma in public service&#151;equivalent to four GCSEs&#151;and take part in the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. Many of them wear the millennium volunteer badge because of the work that they do in the local community. Their funding arrangements are fragile, and they are not treated the same as Army cadets. That is an issue for another day, but I wanted to highlight the work that they do as an example to us all. I am proud that they are a part of my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07110717000500">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill will be another laudable addition to the statute book and it will make sure that the police have the powers to ensure that our communities are safe. Given the activities undertaken by the communities themselves, I believe that great progress can be made in securing a safe environment for all our people. I must add at this juncture that the Bill is yet another piece of legislation protecting our people that the Opposition voted against. They talk tough&#151;and then vote soft. They voted against the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Police and Justice Act 2006. When they were in government, crime doubled, violent crime rose by 170 per cent., robberies  <br>

increased by 400 per cent. and convictions fell by a third. It gets worse. They cannot even make up their minds on whether they want to punish offenders. As for the Liberal Democrats, they have said that they definitely do not want to punish offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07110717000501">In Committee on the afternoon of 25 October, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and their colleagues moved an amendment to clause 9 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The clause was on sentencing. Their amendment addressed the purpose of sentencing and proposed to delete the phrase &#147;the punishment of offenders&#148;. They saw the purpose of sentencing not as being to punish offenders. I had been an MP for just three months at the time and was amazed to be sitting in a room with legislators who were seriously considering removing from a Bill on criminal justice the fact that the main purpose of sentencing an offender was to punish him or her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07110717000502">The amendment was put to a vote. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and his one Liberal Democrat colleague voted against punishing the offender. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough and his colleagues abstained; they could not make their mind up whether they wanted to punish the offender or not. The voting patterns of the Opposition on that day took talking tough and voting soft to a new dimension. They have now entered the realm of not only voting soft, but talking soft. Their approach to criminal justice is bizarre and bears no relation to the needs of the community that we represent. I, like the rest of my Labour colleagues, voted to keep punishment as an integral part of the criminal justice system. We now know that no matter how much the Opposition parties talk about crime in future, they either do not want to punish the offender or cannot make up their mind about whether or not they want to do so.</p>

 I am listening to what the hon. Gentleman says with great interest. Is he aware that we are now on 29 criminal justice Bills since 1997? Does he feel that plenty of talk has gone on in this Chamber over the past 10 years and that legislation has been used as a proxy for real action to tackle the serious problems faced in the streets in his constituency and in mine?</p>

 One need only examine our good record on crime over the past 10 years to see the results of those Bills. The number of crimes has been cut by a third over that period. We have a proud record, and if something takes five, 10 or 20 Bills, that is the approach we should take.</p>

 That is right, and the Liberal Democrats are now saying that they do not want to punish someone who has committed a crime. It is also fair to say that we need reform; part of sentencing must be reform and rehabilitation to protect the public and ensure that the offender makes reparations. However,  <br>

let us remember that for every crime there is a victim. If we say that punishment plays no part in the criminal justice system, the British people have every right to laugh in our face, and the offender is given every reason to reoffend. I am pleased that Labour Members are on the right side of the argument.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson). I am sure that all the emotions that he has expressed could be reflected by all of us in our constituencies, but perhaps in slightly different ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07110717000508">I want to talk exclusively about the Government&#146;s proposals to increase the maximum period that terrorist suspects can be held from 28 days to 56 days or beyond. May I start by asking the Minister exactly what has changed since we went through this difficult, painful and unnecessary process 18 months or two years or so ago, when the Government, apparently supported by elements of the police force and the security services, were saying that we needed to hold terrorist suspects for 90 days, rather than for the 56 days that is now being discussed? Has the threat changed? Has it diminished? Are we likely to be investigating less complex cases in future? I do not think so. When I listen to the head of MI5, the Home Secretary or the Government generally, or to my rhetoric, it is clear to me that the threat is just as complex. It is thus hard to understand why the Government can reject accusations that this is a political issue rather than one that is bent upon the protection of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07110717000509">The issues of plea bargaining, post-charge questioning, and the use of holding charges and intercept evidence have arisen. I declare an interest, because I have been involved in all of those activities practically in fighting the IRA, albeit a few years ago. I understand all of these matters and have employed them. But none of them is particularly significant. I respect the words of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) about the use of intercept evidence, but if one talks to practitioners about any of those measures, they will say that they are certainly useful, but they are not a silver bullet that can put terrorists away without further reference. If such evidence becomes suddenly admissible in court, it will not mean that charges and accusations can be cleared up with the snap of the fingers. They are useful tools, but they are not the pre-eminently important issue with which we are dealing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07110717000510">I therefore ask the House not to be distracted. Whatever the Government say&#151;I am totally on side in trying to reach some consensus on this difficult subject&#151;about post-charge questioning and the like, they are but placebos when compared with the main issue of the extension from 28 days to 56 or beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07110717000511">I have been involved at the sharp end of a similar sort of problem and I have railed against the windbags, the bureaucrats and the politicians&#151;those who do not daily face criminals and terrorists or deal with the problems that arise from their activities. It is hard for police officers and members of the security services to understand why a bunch of card-carrying civilians do not say, &#147;Yes, you can have whatever powers you need. If you say you need them, we will grant them, because  <br>

the one enduring liberty that stands above everything else is the ability to live in peace and without threat.&#148; It is therefore hard to understand why Parliament stands in the way of granting those powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000512">I can sympathise, and even empathise, with the stand that many in the police are taking. I respect the fact that the Government have advanced some sensible solutions for judicial review for those being held without charge every seven days, and other forms of review, including debate in Parliament, of those being held for longer periods. That is sensible, liberal and laudable. Any of those solutions should work, but if we look at the lessons of history, we will see that they will not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07110717000513">Whatever we do and whatever we say, if we extend the period of detention before charge, our enemies&#151;wrongly, in my view&#151;will label it internment. Would it be internment? Would it bear any resemblance to what went on during the war years, when Italians and Germans were held? Would it bear any resemblance to what I saw in the 1970s in Northern Ireland, when it was predominantly Catholics who were held? Of course not. It bears no resemblance whatever. But would that stop our enemies claiming that it was internment? Absolutely not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000514">If we hand that weapon to Islamist fundamentalists, those who would damage this state not just physically, but morally and politically, we would do ourselves a grave disservice. We would immediately lay ourselves open to further alienating the community from which the majority&#151;although not all&#151;of the problem stems. It is crucially important that the British Muslim community is kept on side in its entirety&#151;or as close to its entirety as we can get. If we consider what happened in the 1970s in Northern Ireland, we see that the one word &#147;internment&#148; would&#151;I believe, having listened to the evidence given to the Home Affairs Committee&#151;alienate good, honest, loyal, properly religious and truthful Muslims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07110717000515">Secondly, and probably even more damagingly, anything we do to damage the flow of intelligence from the relevant communities will turn off our only important weapon in fighting the people whom I am talking about. We can rely on information, observation and analysis, but none of that equates to proper, hard intelligence. Believe me, anything that we do that damages our touts, informers or resources, or that alienates people who are giving information, will damage the fight against terror.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000516">My next point harks back to what I saw being done in Northern Ireland. The more we take technically innocent people and allow them to be locked up for up to, let us say, 55 days before being released without charge, the more opportunities we will give our enemies to contort the truth, exercise black propaganda against us and twist facts. There is plenty of precedent for that sort of thing; some would say that a number of incidents from the past two years already fall into that category. Once such things happen, those individuals who have been held without charge for that lengthy period will become recruiting magnets for Islamist fundamentalists and totems for radicalisation, just as the IRA used its ex-internees for such purposes in the 1970s in Northern Ireland.</p>

 I support the Gracious Speech. Like the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), I shall touch on a number of constituency issues. The first is the welcome inclusion in the speech of the commitment to affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07110717000519">I have described my constituency as a rural one with urban problems. It covers a rural area with two medium-sized towns and a number of former mining communities. Since the late 1990s, there has been a problem in those former mining communities: it has been difficult for young people to get on the property ladder, given the restricted social housing. If people want to stay in those villages, as many do, there is a real problem, as they can no longer afford to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07110717000520">Although I welcome the commitment on affordable housing, I question whether&#151;and I shall return to this theme in another context&#151;the answer is to set up something called the homes and communities agency. My heart sinks when the Government announce another initiative whose answer to a problem is to set up an agency to sort it out. As one proud to have been a local councillor for 12 years, I think that we need to give more powers back to local government to tackle affordable housing. We do not need to try to reinvent the wheel by setting up an agency that will try to sort out all the problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="71107-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07110717000521">I have been critical of some local government in Durham and I continue to be so when it does things wrong. However, it is accountable to local people and, if new local housing is to be built, councils should be the vehicle not only for providing that directly but for doing so in partnership with housing associations and the voluntary sector. There are some good examples of where that can be done. I would rather it were spearheaded by local councils, along with local Members of Parliament, than yet another agency be set up, which, if it is anything like what we have had so far as regards a Whitehall-centred view of the world, will take little interest in what local people want. Moreover, local councils are democratically accountable, whereas another agency will not be. Nevertheless, the commitment to affordable housing is very welcome.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071107/debtext/71107-0014.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07110717000522">I also get a sense of foreboding from the idea that the new settlements are going to be called eco-towns. I am not a signed-up member of the anti-eco tendency, but I wonder whether that is just another label that will be slapped on a poorly designed initiative that will get all the money rather than that money being directed into former mining housing in my villages, for example, and into local councils where it will do the most good. I am not sure that many of my constituents are bothered about what type of house they live in, or what it is   <br>

called, as long as they have one. A better way forward might be to invest money to things such as home insulation for existing housing stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07110717000523">Another welcome aspect of the Gracious Speech is the commitment to education. My constituency has some obvious social problems. South Stanley is in the top 20 most deprived wards in the country. Despite that, the local secondary school, led by a dynamic head teacher, Janet Bridges, is doing fantastic work not only in raising A to C grades to over 50 per cent. but in tackling the issue of pupils aged 14 or 15 who suddenly want to drop out of the education system. I would be completely opposed to trying to tie them into education until the age of 18 if it was just about trying to put them through the mill of examinations. The proposals are welcome because they will allow those people to stay in education and training, not suddenly drop out of the system as is happening now. I ask Ministers who will be piloting this piece of legislation to come to Stanley school of technology and look at the work that Janet Bridges is doing in trying to keep some very difficult cases in the education system. It may not be the system that we all recognise, based on trying to get exams, but it is about ensuring that people leave school with some basic life skills. That is important. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson) said, in constituencies such as mine the problems of crime and antisocial behaviour involve exactly the kinds of children who are dropping out of the education system and cannot see that they have a place in the world. I am a big believer in the idea that people need what I call a place in the world. The first thing that most people ask when they meet someone is, &#147;What do you do for a living?&#148; That is difficult for a person who does not have a job or has no hope of getting a job or meaningful training. The commitment has to be seen as a great opportunity for communities such as mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07110717000524">Alongside that, we should be trying to raise aspirations. Stanley has one of the lowest education staying-on rates anywhere in the north-east. I do not accept that its pupils are in some way less intelligent than those in other parts of the north-east&#151;we just need to ensure that they, and their parents, are given opportunities and aspirations to stay on until university and go further. That is why I am pleased that Durham county council&#146;s latest proposals for academies look to bring sixth-form education back to Stanley, which is long overdue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07110717000525">I turn now to the proposals on the NHS. Two weekends ago, <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> carried a four-page spread about how bad the service is. It spoke about how terrible it is that long waiting lists mean that people have to travel as far as India to get operations. Interestingly, most of the people mentioned lived in the south-east of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07110717000526">I was elected in 2001, and the disgrace then was that waiting times for orthopaedic operations at my local hospital&#151;which used to be the local workhouse&#151;were in excess of two years. Because mine is a former mining area, a lot of people need such operations, but there will no waiting lists at all for them later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07110717000527">In my constituency, we have a fantastic new community hospital and a general hospital that cost &#163;97 million. Last week, I met representatives of the local primary care trust, which has earmarked money  <br>

for the new Stanley health centre&#151;the fifth new GP or NHS facility in North Durham in recent years. That is a fantastic achievement, but the Government need to concentrate on the good things that have been done, and to tackle the bad management that can still be found in some parts of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07110717000528">With the greatest respect to Ministers, I do not believe that we need the proposed care quality commission. That would be yet another quango, and what would it do? In my previous life as a councillor, I found that local councils were very good at doing such things as improving the care offered in residential care homes. Local environmental health departments looked after matters such as the quality of food and health and safety in such homes. In my capacity as chairman of the environmental health committee in my area, I more than once had to sign documents to close down residential care homes, but I am not sure that anything will be gained from having yet another commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07110717000529">Moreover, if the Government really want to empower local people and local government, they should give them more responsibility. Local people can scrutinise local NHS services and hold the relevant bodies to account. As an electorate, they also have what no commission or quango ever has&#151;that is, the power to hang a sword of Damocles over the heads of the people charged with running services. If those people do something wrong, they will get voted out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07110717000530">Although I believe that local government should have a larger role in the NHS, we should also celebrate what has already been achieved. We in North Durham and the other Durham constituencies can be very proud of our record in that record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07110717000531">I also welcome the local transport Bill proposed in the Gracious Speech. For once, I believe that the Government have listened to calls from me and others to give more responsibility to local councils. People in my constituency rely on bus transport, but two companies&#151;Arriva and Go North East&#151;have monopolised that provision in the north-east of England. Those companies are able to remove routes that they consider to be unprofitable, or to ask for subsidies from the county council to run a service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07110717000532">For people without a car who live in a village such as Quaking Houses in my constituency, access to a bus is a necessity, not a luxury. I recognise that mass employment is not going to return to North Durham&#151;those days are long gone&#151;but we do need good transport links to jobs along the A1 corridor, on Tyneside or down in Teesside. Since deregulation, however, bus companies have been able to cut routes willy-nilly, and I welcome the proposals in the local transport Bill to give councils more control over such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07110717000533">I must mention the Go North East bus company, if for no other reason than to annoy it. It has continually taken routes away and left communities high and dry. Peter Huntley, its new managing director, seems to be quite an honest individual in many ways. When he was accused at a public meeting of not caring about the performance of bus services, he replied that his responsibility was to his shareholders. Some companies are interested only in profit rather than in social needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07110717000534">Mr. Huntley wrote to me in the summer asking to meet me, apparently because I had single-handedly upset his company&#146;s profitability. I replied, &#147;No problem&#148;,  <br>

but about two days before the meeting I was sent a briefing note that I was clearly not supposed to see. It claimed that my continued criticisms and my standing up for my constituents were severely damaging the business and set out how the company was going to sort things out. I wrote back pointing out that if I was seen as the problem there was not much point in meeting. I hope that the proposed Bill gives councils the right to take on operators such as Go North East and deal with them.</p>

It was also mentioned today by my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield and is important in some of the small communities and villages in my constituency where there is no leisure provision except the local youth centre or the village hall, so I welcome the proposal to claim dormant bank accounts and direct the money to youth facilities, such as Chester-le-Street youth centre, which does fantastic work but needs investment. The early assignment of such funding is important.</p>

When the minimum wage was introduced, the Conservatives were all doom and gloom and said that it would lead to more unemployment. In the north-east, 111,000 people are better off owing to that legislation and nearly 60 per cent. of them are women, so anything that can be done to bear down on what I admit is a minority of rogue employers who are still trying to flout the rules will be welcome.</p>

We live in increasingly difficult times when both parents work and people have to look after aged relatives and children, so I welcome the fact that the Government are taking flexible working seriously. If it is done properly it can lead to better productivity, as more enlightened employers are aware. I used to be a full-time GMB official and many years ago the Littlewoods organisation&#146;s extremely flexible approach to care and facilities for its largely female work force improved productivity.</p>

Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) to claim that those proposals are one of his great ideas, but we need to keep reminding people, and reinforcing the argument, that when the Conservatives had the chance to vote for proposals on paternity leave, they voted against them. We need to remind people of the fact that the Conservatives voted against measures such as the minimum wage, which has given an economic boost to many families in my constituency. We need no lessons from the Conservatives about decent employment rights.</p>

Over the past few years, immigration from the aspirant countries of eastern Europe has led to more employment and has filled labour gaps&#151;even in the north-east we could not get people to fill certain jobs. The proposed points system is the correct approach in looking at the skills we actually need. The right hon. Member for Witney says that we need to have a grown-up debate about immigration.

recognise that whether we like it or not we are a nation that has been built on immigration&#151;from 1066 onwards. It is the Victorianised view of Britishness that skews that argument. In most communities, immigration has not only led to economic benefits, but enriched the culture.</p>

When I was growing up in the South Yorkshire coalfield, I went to school with many children who had Polish-sounding names. After the second world war, when the communists took over in Poland, many Polish people stayed and worked in the coal mines of South Yorkshire, where they integrated well. It is important to recognise that Polish immigration is not new and that it can add to the economic good of this country, rather than detract from it.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that there are many hidden histories in the UK of people who have come to this country to work and who have integrated. Is he aware that in the Victorian era a lack of workers in the Fife coalfields was met by people from Lithuania?</p>

 I did not know that, but local communities across this country provide similar examples. In the north-east of England, for example, there was mass immigration from Ireland in the 19th century to build roads and railways, and Ireland also provided a lot of the labour for the Durham coalfields and the Tyne shipyards. If we are to have a grown-up debate, we must recognise that history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07110717000543">There is an onus on people who say that we have had enough immigration and that it should stop to say what the number should be. Any artificial cap would be a mistake. For example, students studying in this country provide positive benefits not only by bringing cash to Durham university and other universities in the north-east, but by allowing people to understand the culture of the UK&#151;in many cases, people who have studied here are great ambassadors for the UK when they return to their countries. If we are going to have the debate, we should put it in its proper historical perspective, and people who want to talk about numbers need to say what the numbers should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07110717000544">I want to discuss two issues that were omitted from the Queen&#146;s Speech. When the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) raised the issue of a coroners Bill, I was not pleased by the Lord Chancellor&#146;s response. The Lord Chancellor implied that only the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk wants such a Bill, but many Labour Members want to see its introduction. The Bill exists in draft form, and it is long overdue, because we need to bring up to date the archaic coroner system in this country. The draft Bill followed an excellent report by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which we debated earlier this year in Westminster Hall. The Bill would provide an opportunity not only to bring the coroner service up to date, but to tackle some issues that affect our constituents.</p>

it is properly investigated and the statistics, which can influence the debate, are kept. At the moment, the problem is that the sudden deaths of young people are investigated differently in different jurisdictions. Such cases are, for example, sometimes put down to drowning. In areas in which coroners are proactive, there is not only support for families, but the death is registered as a cardiac death. That is important because CRY estimates that eight young people a week die of sudden cardiac failure, and only a coroner system where such information can be held centrally will allow us to argue the necessary case for screening in the health service for young people who do sports. I hope that there is time during the Session to introduce a coroners Bill because I and many others would welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07110717000546">Finally, I was a little concerned that there was nothing in the Queen&#146;s Speech about our covenant with the armed forces. There has been a lot of talk about the way in which we treat the men and women who serve in the forces, and their families. The Government have a good track record on delivery in this area, but we need a grown-up debate on the covenant&#151;a point that the Royal British Legion and others have raised. A Bill or even a White Paper that addressed the matter would have been welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07110717000547">We need to consider what the Government should do and what charities should do. If people join the armed forces, we need to think about what they should expect from the Government if they are serving abroad, or the minimum standards for things such as housing. It appals me, having been involved in the report of the Select Committee on Defence into armed forces housing, that the Ministry of Defence can say that it is satisfactory when an emergency repair takes two days. If someone in local government had tried to claim that, they would have been shot. An emergency repair should be done within hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07110717000548">We need that debate and we must focus on what should be provided for servicemen and women, and their families. It is not just a political problem. Senior generals have turned a blind eye to the matter and concentrated a lot on equipment and warfighting. They have not considered the support we should give to members of the armed forces and our families. The matter is put into clear perspective when people are severely injured or dying abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07110717000549">With those remarks, I welcome the proposals in the Gracious Speech.

 I am sorry that the Lord High Chancellor has not returned to his place, because I wanted to welcome him to the Chamber in his plain clothes. We all enjoyed seeing him in the full garments of his position yesterday, but I wonder whether he noticed the comments made on television by his predecessor, Lord Falconer, who observed that he was not wearing a wig. He said that that was like wearing pyjamas with no top. I hesitate to say any more on this matter, because I know that Mr. Speaker has also elected not to wear a wig on many such occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07110724000003">The Government must surely be worried that the former Lord Chancellor is growing to be an increasingly effective media commentator. Indeed, some of us might observe that he has become a loose cannon thundering around on the Government&#146;s deck. I suggest to the Lord High Chancellor and the Prime Minister that it might be a good idea to have a further conversation about the former Lord Chancellor&#146;s pension if he is to be shut up, and made to stop giving advice about the Government&#146;s lack of vision&#151;much of it no doubt unwelcome to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="71107-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07110724000004">There is much that we can welcome in the Gracious Speech. However, it was striking that the Lord High Chancellor dwelled so little on the Government&#146;s proposals and focused so much on ours. That is the mark of the current Government. He chose to focus first on our original proposal, which the Government have adopted, to introduce a British Bill of Rights. It was difficult for Conservative Members to understand his exact point when he criticised us for proposing something that the Government now wish to introduce. Indeed, when he wrote about the issue recently in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, he simultaneously called for a debate and accused anyone who questioned the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 of regressing into narrow xenophobia.</p>

 Did my hon. Friend notice that the Lord Chancellor referred today to the British judiciary?

that now. Perhaps they can explain the exact difference between their position and ours, given that they appear to have adopted our policy to introduce a British Bill of Rights. We have yet to see of what it will consist. Until we do that, it is difficult to judge the merits of the Government&#146;s proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07110724000010">Similarly, the Lord Chancellor dwelled on proposals that formed no part of the Queen&#146;s Speech. They are our proposals to tackle the imbalance in the constitutional settlement that the Government introduced in the form of Scottish and Welsh devolution. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the right hon. Gentleman seemed preoccupied by that and fiercely criticised our proposals for English votes for English laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07110724000011">I have two points to make in return. First, the Lord Chancellor should take care when citing Gladstone. Gladstone&#146;s answer to the problem was to reduce the representation of Irish Members of Parliament. If the right hon. Gentleman prays Gladstone in aid, perhaps he will state whether his answer is similar. Secondly, we have heard his objections to our policy on the English question of giving Members of Parliament representing English constituencies the decisive say on English laws, so I have a simple question for him: what is the Government&#146;s answer to the problem? It cannot be acceptable simply to take the advice of the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and not ask the West Lothian question in the first place, which seems to have been their position so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07110724000012">In the 1990s, the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues realised, just as we came to realise, that the threat posed to the Union, which he spoke so much about, came from English Members of Parliament imposing unpopular laws on Scotland. He should understand that the threat to the Union today does not come from giving English Members of Parliament the decisive say on English laws. That threat comes from Scottish Members of Parliament having the decisive say on English laws. That is the imbalance that has already arisen and which was created by the Government&#146;s devolutionary settlement. It is no good for the Lord Chancellor simply to criticise our proposal. He must come forward and say how he proposes to address that imbalance, which has weakened the Union. Our position is that we wish to see the Union strengthened, and it can be strengthened only by giving English Members of Parliament the decisive say on English laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07110724000013">So fixated was the Lord Chancellor on our proposals that he talked very little about the Government&#146;s own. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill&#151;one of the Bills that have been carried over into this Session&#151;barely received a mention. However, hon. Members in all parts of the House were critical of what has been described as the Government&#146;s legislative incontinence&#151;other words were used, too&#151;in constantly resorting to more legislation and laws, in the belief that that is the way to address the problem of crime in this country. The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) criticised the Government&#146;s drive for more legislation, while my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) said that they were addicted to legislation. He offered some good advice, which is that they should concentrate on doing less better.</p>

Reoffending rates have soared, despite a succession of criminal justice Bills. The Government have signally failed to deal with the problem of reoffending. Indeed, I shall argue that there is no way we can deal with reoffending unless we deal with the problem&#151;the crisis, indeed&#151;of overcrowding in prisons.</p>

We agree about giving Parliament the power to make treaties or approve going to war, abolishing the royal prerogative in that regard. Indeed, our democracy taskforce, chaired by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), proposed those very measures. We welcome legislation to underpin the independence of the civil service, whose independence has so often been compromised under the Government&#146;s stewardship in the past 10 years. We welcome that legislation, because it is three years since the Government published the draft Civil Service Bill and seven years since they said that they were committed to such legislation. If we are at last to see it, that will be welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07110724000017">We welcome the review of the restrictions on protests in Parliament square. We all agree that a better balance is needed in that respect. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have expressed concern about the noisy, static and semi-permanent demonstrations that interfere with people who are seeking to work in and around the House. There are, however, legitimate concerns about the unwarranted restrictions on liberty that were imposed by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, and by the order that brought in the tight restrictions on demonstrations in Parliament square.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07110724000018">In that context, I have one question for the Home Secretary: will she clarify the proposal in the consultation paper for the &#147;harmonisation&#148; of the laws governing the right to demonstrate in the designated area around Parliament square and those relating to demonstrations elsewhere? I imagine that the objection that has prompted the Government to review the provision relates to its impact on civil liberties and, in particular, to the fact that the public have to seek the permission of the police to demonstrate. Without that permission, even the most peaceful demonstration will fall foul of the criminal law. I am sure that that is the objection that the Government are seeking to address. However, if the effect of their proposals were, through harmonisation, to extend the provision to demonstrations outside the purview of Parliament square and its environs under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act, that would be a step in the wrong direction that would lead to serious deprivation of civil liberty. I would be grateful if the Home Secretary clarified what &#147;harmonisation&#148; means in that context.</p>

all waiting with bated breath to see what will be in this statement of British values and what it will add to our British way of life. Perhaps it will be the Prime Minister&#146;s newest and most notorious phrase, &#147;British jobs for British workers&#148;. Will that be enshrined in the statement of values that the Government will propose? As the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) said last night:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07110724000028">Conservative Members are highly sceptical of the Government&#146;s attempt to describe a statement of values, but until we have seen it, how can we possibly judge the worth of that aspect of the constitutional renewal package? If, as we saw yesterday, the Government are clueless about their vision, how can they credibly set out a vision for the whole country? As the Labour-supporting historian, Tristan Hunt said:</p>
<a name="71107-0015.htm_brev5"><a name="07110724000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Rather than wasting time on a statement of inevitably vacuous values, ministers should focus on bedding down the reforms they have introduced... Given that the government is having enough trouble setting out its own vision, it really doesn&#146;t need to take on the country&#146;s as well.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07110724000029">Thus we have a citizenship Bill, a citizenship review and a statement of values, but at least we have them, even if we have absolutely no idea what will be in them. That is better than the position on the coroners Bill, which is missing altogether from the Government&#146;s legislative programme. As several of my hon. Friends have observed, it was in the Government&#146;s draft legislative programme and it deals with an important issue. The Government promised the House a Bill on that subject four years ago and we are still waiting for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07110724000030">Here is a summary of the Government&#146;s Queen&#146;s Speech proposals so far: we have a coroners Bill that is dead on arrival; we have a Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill whose clauses are dying by the day as the Government are removing them, even though the Bill has barely been published; and we have a citizenship Bill that is with us only in spirit. Is it not clear that this is a Government with the life drained out? They are bereft of new ideas and making policy on the hoof. The single thing that characterises this Government is surely their incompetence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07110724000031">The Lord Chancellor barely touched on the issue of prisons. So busy was he attacking our constitutional proposals that it no doubt suited him to gloss quickly over the present situation in our prisons. There is surely no greater index of the Government&#146;s incompetence than their management of the prison system. They have systematically ignored successive warnings about overcrowding, failed to provide sufficient prison capacity, and presided over appalling overcrowding in our prisons&#151;a quarter of them now have cells that are doubled or trebled up. That shows the level of overcrowding, which is impacting on the prison system&#146;s ability to rehabilitate prisoners and deal with them properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07110724000032">What is the Government&#146;s answer to the problem? It is not to provide short-term emergency capacity&#151;certainly not: we have heard nothing about that. Their answer, which was instituted just as the Lord Chancellor took office with the Prime Minister alongside him, was the early release of offenders. About 8,500 offenders have now been released early as a consequence of that scheme, often before even the halfway point of their sentence.  <br>

Of those, 1,500 have been violent offenders, and 120 crimes have been committed by offenders who should have been safely behind bars. What does that say about the Prime Minister&#146;s claim that he wished to punish criminals? What does the Home Secretary have to say about the fact that 292 prisoners have been released from three prisons adjacent to her constituency in Redditch&#151;more than in any other town in England and Wales apart from Doncaster?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07110724000033">Prisons are full to bursting point, and the Government should now tell us what they are going to do about that. Instead, we see precisely the wrong approach from them. Rather than providing sufficient capacity, they seek to fetter judicial discretion and prevent the judiciary from sending people to prison. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill would remove the ability of magistrates to suspend sentences. The Prisons Minister has suggested that he will consider giving guidance to the judiciary to reduce the use of custodial sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07110724000034">We have a straightforward position: sentences should fit the crime, not prison capacity. It is up to the Government to ensure sufficient prison capacity to enable the judiciary to hand down sentences in accordance with the crimes presented to them. It is telling that judges are increasingly speaking out about the way in which their hands are tied in that respect. Newspapers reported this week that a frustrated judge, Timothy Mort, complained that he felt forced to hand down a suspended sentence and let an offender go due to the growing overcrowding in Britain&#146;s prisons. He said to the defendant:</p>
<a name="71107-0015.htm_brev6"><a name="07110724000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the current climate, when the prisons are full, I will have to suspend your sentence&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07110724000036">Perhaps the worst aspect of the Government&#146;s early release scheme, which will see 25,000 offenders released in a full year, has been that at least 500 of the offenders released so far have been foreign national prisoners. So much for the Government&#146;s pledge to remove those foreign national prisoners back to their country of origin. Not only have the Government failed to do that but they have released them early. How will the Government rebuild trust in politics if they make such pledges and then renege on them in such a grotesque manner?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="71107-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07110724000037">Another issue on which the Lord Chancellor did not say as much as we expected was that of party funding. The Government have said that they are committed to a fair and transparent system of political party funding that does not disadvantage any party. How can they say that with a straight face? We regret the collapse of the cross-party talks on funding, but let us be clear about the cause of that collapse: the cause is the fact that the Labour party cannot kick its dependency on trade union funding. We support a comprehensive cap on donations, to apply to individuals, companies and trade unions. The Labour party, however, is unwilling to give up the &#163;8 million of affiliation fees.</p>

The Home Secretary now has an opportunity to reconsider her view on the matter. The commissioner&#146;s position has become wholly untenable. Although we can talk as much as we like about measures to deal with the terrorist threat facing the country, there will be no confidence among Londoners or his staff while he remains in place.

We argued at the time that a close and genuine look had to be taken at the use of intercept evidence, and we hope that that remains the case. It is clear, as my right hon. and learned Friend and others said, that intercept evidence is used in international practice in dealing not just with counter-terrorism, but with serious crime such as gangland crime.

On the one hand, this Queen&#146;s Speech sets out proposals that will considerably increase the time that people can spend in custody without being charged&#151;effectively, a form of internment. Simultaneously, it sets out measures that seek to reduce the prison population. The Government are seeking to let people who have been convicted of serious crimes out of prison before the end of their sentence not just for ideological reasons, but because they have failed to provide sufficient prison capacity. That is indeed a rich irony, and I contend that this is an uncomfortable position for any Government to be in, but a particularly uncomfortable one for a Government led by a Prime Minister who lectured us just two weeks ago about the importance of liberty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="71107-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07110724000062">This Government have demonstrated in every other respect that they do not have the interests of the victims of crime at heart. We have seen the end of custody licence and the early release of criminals, 18 days before the end of their sentence. We have had automatic release after half a sentence has been served, and the restriction of the use of open-ended sentences. I understand that the Home Secretary objects to that, but that the Lord Chancellor has proposed that those sentences be restricted. Perhaps the Home Secretary could set out her position on indeterminate sentences for public protection. There was also the extension of summary justice&#151;taking cases out of the courts and putting administrative justice in the hands of police officers. Moreover, more than 1,000 serious offences have been committed by tagged criminals. Cars have been given to prisoners in open conditions, including 33 murderers. Magistrates have been stripped of their sentencing powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="71107-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07110724000063">The story of this new Government is that they are introducing measure after measure that is softening their stance on crime, and they are doing so for one reason: their incompetence in failing to provide adequate prison capacity. Recidivism rates have been driven up, and re-offending has increased by 10 per cent. The costs of crime have grown enormously and it is time for a fundamental change of approach. Regrettably, we will not get it from this Queen&#146;s Speech or in the next two years.</p>

It is of course right that over the past two years the Metropolitan police and others have worked hard to learn the lessons of the tragic events of 22 July 2005, but responsible politicians should set that in context.</p>

Violent crime has been cut by 31 per cent. Burglary and car crime have been halved. The chances of being a victim of crime are at their lowest levels for 25 years. As my right hon.

Earlier this week, I was able to circulate draft clauses on key elements of the Bill to shadow spokesmen and to the Chairmen of the Home Affairs Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights.

the decision to provide the opportunity for police and investigators to go beyond 28 days in that pre-charge period.

As I have explained, we are seeking to achieve a consensus on that. Moreover, I see the argument as being about whether, and how, we provide the ability to extend detention beyond 28 days. It is not about whether a period of 56 or 90 days, or whatever maximum might be determined, is appropriate.

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that, if the detention period is to be extended beyond 28 days, the House should have compelling evidence that it is absolutely essential? Will she bear it in mind that the 28-day period was agreed without a vote once the 90-day proposal was defeated? No one in the Commons voted for less than 28 days and, despite its misgivings, the House of Lords likewise agreed to extend the existing 14-day period to 28 days. That shows that a consensus exists about the matter that, in my view, it would be quite wrong to break without compelling evidence. So far, I have not seen any such evidence, and I assume that that goes for all Members of the House.</p>

The background is that the Government went for 90 days but had to settle for 28 days, which, in my recollection, was a figure more or less plucked out of the air. If we are to reach a rational solution to this important question, the Government must consider how to put together some evidence for the length of time that might be required in a complex, difficult, multi-defendant case. At the moment, the Home Secretary sounds like somebody negotiating the price of a commodity, inviting her critics to put up the first offer, whereupon she will try to bargain to get more. This is a question of civil liberties, and that is not a sensible way to approach a big issue of criminal justice.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham was right when he discussed the need for a grown-up debate. I am therefore pleased that the Conservative party has taken on that issue in recent days by disciplining parliamentary candidates and ridding itself of anything that might smack of racism.

Friends raised the issue of the exploitation of migrant labour, and it is crucial that determined enforcement is given the appropriate priority. This morning, I visited Communications house, a local enforcement office in London, where I spoke to staff about how they are cracking down on abuse in the system and targeting rogue employers of migrant labour. Across the country, there have been 3,700 successful operations to tackle illegal working. That vital work would have been slashed by Opposition Members, when they went into the last election calling for the immigration budget to be cut in half. Instead, we have doubled our enforcement effort and have 1,000 additional staff in border control. It is no good their talking tough on immigration, if they are not willing to invest in making it work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="71107-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07110724000120">We are delivering a fair, firm and effective process for determining eligibility, processing applications and clamping down on abuse. We will go further, as we have heard, in making sweeping changes to Britain&#146;s migration system. From early next year, the points-based system will help us to do that, and we will work closely with the migration advisory committee and the migration impacts forum to give us the balanced analysis we need on the skills gaps we have to fill and the impact of immigration on our public services.</p>

Conservative Members like to think they talk tough on immigration, on crime, and on counter-terrorism, but they want to scrap the ID card scheme that is fundamental to helping to control immigration and to protect our citizens. A little over a month ago, they published figures saying that they will cut the costs for ID cards for foreign nationals as well. They claim that they will spend the savings on prison places, a border police force, and drug rehab. Unfortunately, if one looks at their figures, it becomes clear that they cannot get anywhere near the money that they would need for these commitments. They will not save anything like &#163;250 million from scrapping ID cards, as they claim. Even if they could, it would cost that much to fund just the prison places that they say they want to build, never mind the port security and drug rehab plans that they have announced.</p>

But they need to do more than tighten up their figures if they want to be taken seriously. They need to get their story straight. Do they support the biometric ID card scheme for foreign nationals that we are introducing next year, or do they not? If they do, why are they planning to cut &#163;40 million of set-up costs for the scheme? Until they can tell us unequivocally that they back ID cards for foreign nationals, their position is nearly as ludicrous&#151;nearly, but not quite&#151;as that of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to have a debate on the fraudulent transfer of land titles of people&#146;s houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07110724000129">Before I uttered a word, the debate has illustrated two important points. First, it shows the power of Parliament to hold the Government to account. Merely by putting down the debate on the Order Paper, you, Madam Deputy Speaker, have persuaded or provoked the Government to take action, which they previously seemed reluctant to do, to attempt to prevent the sort of fraud to which I want to draw the House&#146;s attention. Secondly, the debate demonstrates constituents&#146; power, through their Members of Parliament, to influence Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07110724000130">I first encountered the sort of fraud that we are considering when a constituent came to my surgery and told me that he had let a property to another gentleman, who immediately downloaded the deeds of the house and copied the owner&#146;s signature from the deeds on to a power of attorney, which purported to give the tenant the right to transfer properties on behalf of the real owner. The first transfer that he undertook was that of the ownership of the property that he was renting into his name. Having duly registered that transfer with the Land Registry, he went to a mortgage provider, took out a mortgage for &#163;140,000 and, two days later, left the property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07110724000131">My constituent only discovered some time later that the fraud had been perpetrated, when the mortgage company, finding that its mortgage was in default, had sent in the bailiffs who tried to repossess the property. The new tenant had warned the owner that that had been happening, and then the owner&#146;s nightmare began. He had to convince the Land Registry that he was the true owner. To do that, he had to prove that the signature on the power of attorney was not his but a forgery. Having done that, he had to convince the Land Registry that he had properly investigated the tenant&#146;s references before letting the property. I do not know why that should be a concern to the Land Registry, but he was able to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07110724000132">Even when the owner had persuaded the Land Registry that he was the true owner and that the power of attorney and the transfer were fraudulent, it refused to accept liability for a long time or to return to him unencumbered possession of and title to his property. It argued that, because he had not informed it of his change of address, he had in some way contributed to the problems because any letter that it sent to him did not reach him. In addition, when he went to see the police and notified them that the fraud had taken place, they initially refused to investigate, saying that he was not a victim of fraud, that the mortgage company, if anything, was the victim and that they, therefore, would not register it as a crime. Furthermore, they told him that they did not investigate frauds involving only one person and less than &#163;1 million. I am happy to say that, after months of effort, the police began to take the matter seriously and, more important, the Land  <br>

Registry, perhaps after and because of my intervention, agreed to accept liability for the fraudulent transfer of my constituent&#146;s property and to pay off the mortgage and return the deeds unencumbered to him. It has not yet done so, but I am confident that it will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07110724000133">It is alarming that the case does not appear to be unique. My constituent discovered that the gentleman who had fraudulently stolen his property and the &#163;140,000 mortgage on it subsequently went to Southampton and perpetrated a similar fraud. He did likewise in Cambridge before being arrested and, unfortunately, released. After he had transferred some of the money into gold, which was sent to Dubai, and transferred other money directly to Pakistan, the fraudster left the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07110724000134">The only solicitor to whom I mentioned the fraud is a friend who happens to be a partner in a leading London firm of solicitors. He immediately said, &#147;Oh yes, we&#146;re involved in similar cases.&#148; After being in business for more than 150 years, the firm has suddenly discovered that the fraudulent transfer of title deeds is an issue. In particular, there is one fraudster who committed a dual fraud. First, he rented property. In this case, he did not use a power of attorney, but he was able to use the utility bills that he received as a resident of the property to help him to establish ownership and residence and fraudulently transfer the property into his name.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07110724000135">Emboldened by that, the man continued to occupy the property and pay the rent and the mortgage, and tried to perpetrate a similar fraud on the landlord&#146;s own home when he discovered that the landlord would be out of the country for a period during the summer. Happily, the first fraud was discovered before the second could be completed, and the hope is that it has been aborted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07110724000136">When I asked the Minister what the total number of such frauds was, he said that no record was kept of the total number of attempted or successful frauds, but there have been no fewer than 70 frauds over the past three years where the Land Registry has accepted responsibility and paid out on them. I understand from the excellent &#147;You and Yours&#148; programme that the total amount paid out on those frauds was of the order of &#163;25 million. We are therefore talking about a serious problem that has a substantial impact on the public purse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07110724000137">All those with whom I have discussed the issue, both victims and solicitors, have urged me to make it public. They have done so not primarily because they are concerned about the treatment that they have received&#151;although in some cases they are angry about that&#151;but because they want to ensure not only that others who discover that they have already been the victim of such fraud do not experience similar treatment from either the Land Registry or the police, but that in future such frauds are prevented altogether and that the public purse should be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07110724000138">One person said to me, &#147;We always talk about an Englishman&#146;s home being his castle, but it seems to be possible to wake up and find that it&#146;s someone else&#146;s property.&#148; Another said, &#147;We talk about things being as &#145;safe as houses&#146;, but they&#146;re only as safe as the title deeds.&#148; They have a number of concerns about the  <br>

issue. They want to ensure, first, that others do not experience such problems. They hope that the Minister will give an assurance that when such frauds are discovered in future, once the ownership is shown to be truly that of the victim they should not be forced to encounter the sort of problems and delays that my constituents experienced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07110724000139">Secondly, the people I have spoken to want to be sure that the Government will not spend any more effort denying that the problem of such frauds exists, but instead spend more effort in preventing them from happening in future. Thirdly, those concerned are worried on behalf of the taxpayer, who has had to pay out millions of pounds already, with perhaps more in the pipeline. They do not share the complacency of Ministers, who seem to be saying, &#147;What&#146;s &#163;25 million, given that the Land Registry has perhaps upwards of &#163;1 billion of revenue over the same period?&#148; As a former Treasury Minister brought up in the school of &#147;Look after the pence and the pounds will look after themselves&#148;, I believe that if Ministers are not prepared to look after the millions, the billions will not look after themselves. Ministers should have acted earlier to stem the loss, not waited until you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and Mr. Speaker put the issue on the Order Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07110724000140">Fourthly, we want to know why the police are so reluctant to investigate such fraud unless it involves more than &#163;1 million. In the fraud that my solicitor friend&#146;s company was dealing with, the total value of the two properties was in the order of &#163;1 million or more. However, because they were in different police districts, the police seemed reluctant to pursue the issue thereto. It sounds as though Government targets or some such factor are distorting sensible policing. If that is not the issue, and the police simply do not have the resources or the ability to pursue such fraud, should it not be referred to the Serious Fraud Office?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07110724000141">Indeed, one of my constituents has pointed out that, in most cases that we know about, the money has ended up in the middle east or Pakistan. Surely we should be doubly careful to ensure that this kind of fraud will not be used to fund extremist or terrorist movements, even if it has not been so used in the past. That alone should be a reason for the Serious Fraud Office to be involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07110724000142">I mentioned that the scheduling of this debate had provoked the Minister to announce that, as of the beginning of yesterday, it would no longer be possible to download deeds of properties from the Land Registry online. In future, people will have to approach the Land Registry either in person or by post, unless they are registered professional solicitors. We want to be sure that that measure will do the trick. I am afraid that, on its own, in might not be sufficient to do that. Naturally, we hope that it will, but this could be a question of too little, too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07110724000143">The measure will clearly stop signatures being downloaded from the Land Registry and being copied to obtain powers of attorney or used for other purposes connected to this kind of fraud, but it is extraordinary that such a unique personal identifier as a signature was ever made publicly available in this way. Should not the Government investigate whether other documents are available online from which signatures may be obtained, and consider whether those signatures could be redacted  <br>

out, so as to allow the documents to remain available for public use? I certainly do not want to stop public access to any documents unnecessarily, but it might be sensible to arrange for any signatures to be excluded from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07110724000144">Also, there should be special checks where powers of attorney are used, not least where the beneficiary is the person exercising the power of attorney. The same is true when solicitors cited on a document are not registered with or known to the Land Registry. That was the case with the fraudulent power of attorney that was used to defraud my constituent. The firm of solicitors did not exist, but its name was on the documents and no checks were made. Furthermore, someone has contacted me to ask whether the change that has been made will mean only that the same frauds that have hitherto been perpetrated online will continue to be perpetrated by post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07110724000145">I am worried that the Government have been more concerned to defuse the issue by making a change speedily, ahead of this debate, rather than, as I would have hoped, by announcing a proper inquiry into the measures necessary to prevent this kind of fraud and carrying out a proper consultation into the issue. A consultation has been taking place into other aspects of the Land Registry, but it has not focused on frauds of this kind. If a proper investigation were carried out, we could be sure that comprehensive measures would be taken to ensure that the public and professionals still had maximum access, at the lowest cost, to the data necessary to carry out legitimate property transactions, while ensuring that an Englishman&#146;s home remained his castle and nobody else&#146;s. I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the House to respond to the debate. I hope that he will give me the assurances that I have asked for, and that a proper examination of this problem will be carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07110724000148">Turning now specifically to fraudulent transfers of land, the Land Registry takes fraud very seriously and gives the highest priority to countering fraudulent registrations. It has a central role in the property conveyancing process and it deals with a great quantity of registration work every day, which is fundamental to this country&#146;s property market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07110724000149">It is important to put out the right figures, as they help to place these frauds into context. There are currently more than 21 million registered titles. In each of the last three years, the Land Registry received around 5 million registration applications, of which around 4 million were to register transfers for value and mortgages. That was in addition to even greater numbers of applications for searches and for official copies of the registers, plans and other documents that the Land Registry holds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07110724000150">Sadly, no system has yet been devised that is immune to fraud&#151;and that applies to the public and the private sector. What the Government must do&#151;the right hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention to it&#151;is to remain always and constantly vigilant. When fraudsters find a way into the system, we must react quickly and rapidly to stop them, which is precisely what happened in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07110724000151">Regrettably, forged transfers occasionally get through the registration system and a property owner finds that, through no fault of their own, as in the case of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituent, someone else has wrongfully been registered in their place. Where that happens, the true owner will normally be entitled to be put back on the register as the proprietor. If for any reason that cannot happen&#151;it might be the case where an equally innocent buyer has bought the property from the fraudster&#151;the owner will be entitled to compensation from the Land Registry for any financial loss that they have suffered. In any event, under the statutory compensation scheme established by the Land Registration Act 2002, any costs incurred as a result of the fraud will be recovered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07110724000152">Over the last three years, the Land Registry has paid statutory compensation as a result of fraud on a total of 70 claims&#151;15 in 2004-05, 31 in 2005-06 and 24 in 2006-07. The total amount paid on those claims was approaching &#163;12.5 million, of which more than &#163;8 million was paid as the result of one very serious fraud. The Government do not take these sums lightly and neither does the Land Registry. We are not complacent about this at all. As a former Treasury Minister, however, the right hon. Gentleman should be aware that this is not taxpayers&#146; money. The Land Registry operates as a trading fund and, as such, the money comes from fee payers who use its services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07110724000154">Although the numbers of frauds are relatively small, the fight against fraud is recognised by the chief land registrar and the Land Registry board as a top priority. It has a robust anti-fraud strategy in place and it will  <br>

keep that strategy constantly under review, revising it as it deems necessary. The Land Registry has always had measures in place to help detect and prevent the registration of fraudulent applications. In accordance with its anti-fraud strategy, it is reviewing and revising them with a view to strengthening the protection provided. It is doing so in the context of the increase in, and apparently changing nature of, fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07110724000155">In the past, the Land Registry&#146;s experience of property fraud was that it was most commonly of a domestic nature. The more recent experience, to which the right hon. Gentleman has alluded, has been of fraud carried out by professional criminals who target properties of people who are unknown to them. It would clearly be inappropriate, as I hope that he will understand, for me to give details of the specific measures being implemented by the Land Registry. I can say, however, that it is working with the police and other relevant organisations to refine its strategy and develop expertise in this field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07110724000156">In all its anti-fraud activity, however, the Land Registry must strike a careful balance between, on the one hand, making information accessible and facilitating the conveyancing process and commerce and, on the other hand, ensuring that there are appropriate safeguards in place to prevent fraud. Everyone would join me in regretting that the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituent was one of the unfortunate victims of a forged transfer of property.</p>

<p><a name="st_o217"><a name="07110724000157"><a name="71107-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="07110724000232"><b>Mr. Lilley:</b>
 I am grateful to the Minister for his response so far. Now that deeds can no longer be downloaded from the registry, will the signature be redacted out when they are transmitted through the post, or will that still be available to potential fraudsters if they obtain the deeds in that way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o218"><a name="07110724000158"><a name="71107-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="07110724000233"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 If I may, I will write to the right hon. Gentleman on the question of redaction. He raises an important point about the availability of other official documents online, and the possibility of redacting out signatures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07110724000159">This is a complicated issue that also has implications for commerce and trade. The right hon. Gentleman intervened at an appropriate moment, because, as I was saying, a careful balance must be struck between the interests of the property market, which is important to the economy and well-being&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) is making gestures from a sedentary position&#151;polite gestures, I hope. I will write to the right hon. Gentleman on the issue of redaction of signatures online, in other areas and through the post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="71107-0018.htm_para28"><a name="07110724000160">The right hon. Gentleman raised several specific questions relating to his constituent&#146;s case, and the Land Registry has written directly to him on that case, which has now successfully been brought to a conclusion. We all regret that it happened in the first place, and that certain procedures had to be followed that protracted the process of restoring his constituent&#146;s position. There are, of course, lessons to be learned from the case, as there are from all such cases. Those are being learned, and we will continue to be extremely vigilant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="71107-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07110724000161">It might be appropriate if I repeated at this point some advice that the Land Registry gives to property owners. Every proprietor of registered land must give the Land Registry at least one address to be entered on the register. That is the address to which the Land Registry will send any communications that it needs to send to the owner. It is important that that address is one at which the owner will receive the communications, and that that address is kept up to date as an address at which such communications can be received. That is crucial in helping to prevent fraud. Owners who so wish can have up to three such addresses on the register, one of which can be an e-mail address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="71107-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07110724000162">As we know, there has been recent public and media concern about the public availability of information from the Land Registry over the internet. Particular concern has been expressed about the availability in that way of copies of mortgages, which have on them the signature of the owner, and in some cases the mortgage account number or amount borrowed. The Ministry of Justice recognised that concern in a statement issued jointly with the Land Registry on 13 August. The public availability of Land Registry information was debated in Parliament as long ago as the late 1980s, and the register has been open since December 1990. The Land Registration Act 2002, which took effect in October 2003, extended the open register by making copies of mortgage deeds and leases available in addition to the register of title itself and other relevant documents. That was the subject of widespread public consultation at the time and was debated extensively in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="71107-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07110724000163">It is important that the public have a legal right to inspect the register of any title, and any documents that are filed in the Land Registry in relation to any title. There are a number of reasons for that. The open register assists the buying and selling of houses and land and other transactions with land. It assist business and commerce. It enables anyone to find out who owns a piece of land, which can be invaluable in, for example, cases of nuisance or neighbour disputes. It can itself be a safeguard against fraud, because it is transparent: no one can represent themselves as owning a property that is registered to someone else. In many other countries in the European Union and beyond, land registers have been open for much longer than they have been in England and Wales. In fact, an open register is the norm in countries with a land registration system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="71107-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07110724000165">There are a number of ways in which information can be obtained from the Land Registry. For instance, a written application can be made by post or in person at a Land Registry office, and information is available through Land Register Online, which was launched in 2005. The service has proved very popular with the public, and it supports the Government&#146;s aim of making public information available electronically. However, owing to concerns that have been expressed about the availability of documents online&#151;particularly the fear that it may have the potential to facilitate fraud&#151;the Land Registry conducted a review. As part of that review, it engaged in discussions with the Home Office, the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office and the Council of Mortgage Lenders. I hope that, despite what he said in his opening remarks, the right hon. Gentleman now recognises that the process has been continuing for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="71107-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07110724000166">The outcome of the review was the Land Registry&#146;s decision to remove all documents from the Land Register Online service. The decision was put into effect at midnight on Monday, since when it has not been possible to view documents online in that way. As a result documents will be less readily available, and the Land Registry will have clearer audit trails to people who request the information. The documents will continue to be available through other means&#151;for example, a written application made by post or in person at a Land Registry office&#151;and will be available to solicitors and other registered business users who use the Land Registry Direct service.</p>
