 I congratulate my hon.

Although Boxing day is a public holiday in England and Wales, by and large it is not in many continental European countries. I know that he understands that the seasonal break is an important time for Network Rail to take possession of busy lines to undertake essential maintenance. Although that will mean that there will be no access to destinations such as Manchester international airport this year, there is evidence of growth in travel over the Christmas and new year period, with 23,000 more trains running in 2008 than in 2007.</p>

We had to assess whether, in the current economic situation, it would be right to impose that cost on the industry, and we decided at this stage not to gold-plate the requirements, which will need to come into force by July 2011. Of course, that does not stop companies fitting the markings themselves.

In 2006, there were 183; the number fell to 176 in 2007; and it fell to 148-an almost 16 per cent. reduction-in 2008. Indeed, the number of accidents involving HGVs has fallen further. The steps that we are taking in respect of all HGVs, including foreign-registered vehicles, include an additional £24 million for the Vehicle and Operator Service Agency to undertake further checks on international lorries to ensure that they are roadworthy.</p>

 I think that the right hon. Gentleman made a similar allegation last year about the DFT interfering with what Somerset county council wanted to do, and he was wrong then, too. There are a number of ways in which one can obtain funding for transport projects. First, there is the £1.3 billion of capital funding, which has no strings attached whereby we could stop local authorities from doing what they want. Secondly, there is the revenue support grant: again there is no ring-fencing, and no project is subject to criteria. Thirdly, there are local transport plans. The right hon. Gentleman would expect us to be responsible to the taxpayer for contributions of more than £5 million. This is not about box-ticking; it is about ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent properly and we get value for money. I am sure that he would welcome that approach.</p>

 One of the problems in doing what the hon.

On funding, the hon. Gentleman should be aware-if he is not, I am again happy to undertake to write to him to educate him-that any major funding scheme below £5 million needs no approval from the Department for Transport.

 The hon. Gentleman has obviously taken his line from his Front-Bench colleague the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers), in terms of the idea that there is only one part to the Government's road safety strategy. It is blatantly clear that that is not so. Our strategy is centred on education, enforcement and engineering. Let me point out that last year, excessive speed remained a contributory factor in 26 per cent. of all deaths on our roads. Although we have had a 14 per cent. reduction overall, which is part of our strategy, excessive speed had an effect in 26 per cent. of cases, involving 600 individuals. I make no apology whatsoever for giving local partnerships the choice in taking forward measures that will help to save lives, which all the evidence indicates happens with speed cameras as part and parcel of the approach, or one tool in the armoury.</p>

As a consequence of her representations, the agency has asked the Severn River Commission to consider the feasibility of introducing a variant of the season tag, which would be suitable for regular car-share groups.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for her helpful question. In the last 13 years, we have introduced a rural bus subsidy scheme that gives more than £15 million each year to subsidise buses that otherwise would not be profitable to run.

 This Government have transformed support for working parents since 1997-doubling maternity pay, introducing paternity pay and leave, more than doubling good-quality affordable child care places and extending statutory maternity leave from 14 to 52 weeks. Most recently, the Prime Minister has announced new flexibility for working parents, whereby from April 2011, if a mother wants to return to work six months after the birth, the other six months of her leave can be taken by her partner with three months of it paid. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is consulting on the administration of this scheme to make it as accessible as possible for both employers and employees.</p>

 It is clearly very important to split child care leave between mothers and fathers, not least because if a potential employer is confronted with a man he wants to employ and a woman he wants to employ, he will be unable to discriminate against them if one is capable of having six months leave and the other is equally capable of having that leave if his partner becomes pregnant.

The Government's response has been published and the Committee considered it this morning. He mentioned pre-appointment hearings, no doubt in the context of the appointment of the Children's Commissioner and the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families. Since we introduced this new opportunity for Select Committees to play a part in the appointments process, which gives Select Committees more scope for action, there has been the appointment of the chair of the Statistics Board, as well as hearings on the appointments of the chairs of the Care Quality Commission and the House of Lords Appointments Commission and the chair-elect of Ofcom. There have also been a new Information Commissioner and chair of the Office for Legal Complaints. I have to hand a long list of all the pre-appointments hearings, which I could read out, but the point is that Select Committees are playing their part in pre-appointment hearings. However, it remains the case that under the structure that is in place the final decision is still for the Secretary of State. That is, no doubt, illuminated by the questions asked in the pre-appointment hearings.</p>

Sir Michael Scholar, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, is again calling the Government to account for abusing statistics-this time the official figures for greenhouse gas reductions, which he described as exaggerated. Elsewhere, the energy efficiency figures have been described as "grossly" inflated. We must have accurate figures on such issues if we are to do a good job. Perhaps it was the complacency occasioned by this abuse of statistics that allowed so many Members of this House last night to refuse to allow this House-this Parliament-to enter the 10:10 campaign. Will the Leader of the House find an opportunity for this House to debate that again? Perhaps Labour Members will then be able to repent at leisure and decide that they would like this House to join a movement that is crossing the country at the moment.</p>

May we make that the subject of one of our debates over the next couple of weeks?</p>

Although numbers vary around the country and, happily, some forces are still increasing their numbers, other forces are substantially reducing them. The number of police in Avon and Somerset has decreased, and this week we have heard that Somerset county council is, disgracefully, reducing its funding for PCSOs by a quarter. I cannot believe that it is right to cut front-line policing. That flies in the face of what people across the country expect, so may we have a debate on the issue at the earliest opportunity?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman talked about bank lending practices and bonuses. We take the view that banks must be both building up their capital reserves to make sure they do not pose the risk that they did in the past and ensuring that they lend fairly to help businesses to recover and the economy to start growing again. Lending issues are very important indeed, and the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have made it clear that the Government's position is that there can be no return to business as usual on bonuses. There will be a debate on the economic recovery later this afternoon and that will provide an opportunity for the hon. Gentleman and other hon.

It is difficult at the best of times to be bringing up a family when one's husband is away from home, but it is even more important if they are in a dangerous situation in Afghanistan. We need to pay tribute not only to our armed services but to their wives and families. That is why I am working with Ministers across Government to ensure that we recognise and support the contribution that armed services wives and families make to the defence forces.</p>

 We obviously keep under review the balance between the work that Members of Parliament do in the House of Commons and the work that they do in their constituencies. We should not go along with the view that the sole preoccupation of a Member of Parliament once they are elected is to be in Westminster, sitting in the Chamber or working in our Committees. We must recognise, acknowledge and support the work that is done in constituencies. In this day and age, it is no longer good enough for people to be elected and to say to their constituents, "See you again in five years." They expect us to be working in our local communities and that is why we need to have recess time as well as times when the House is in session.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="91022-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000334">The world economy is forecast to shrink by 11/4 per cent. in 2009-the first time it has contracted in 60 years. To fight the global downturn, we, with countries around the world, have stepped in to support our economy. In the 1930s, Governments failed to act, with disastrous consequences. Unlike the Bourbon monarchy and today's Conservative party, we have learned the lessons of the past, which is why we took unprecedented action to put more money into the economy, to help to support families and businesses now, to protect jobs and to ensure a sustainable recovery.</p>

 When the recovery starts-I hope it is starting even now-one of the principal difficulties faced by small businesses will be the need for working capital. The Economic Secretary will be aware that the Chancellor has already announced means by which small businesses' cash-flow difficulties can be addressed during the recession, in particular, through the deferment of taxes. The right hon. Gentleman made it clear that that included national insurance and other payroll taxes, but I can think of no other payroll tax than pay-as-you-earn. Is PAYE included in those provisions?</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="09102229000336"><a name="91022-0006.htm_spnew38"><a name="09102229001161"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that more than 150,000 businesses have already benefited from the flexibilities operated through the business payment support system. That system, which covers payroll taxes and deferment of VAT payments, has been widely welcomed by industry and is a major success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="91022-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000337">In the terms of today's debate on securing the recovery, the fact that the downturn is global has meant that we need global action, as well as action on the home front. That is why the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have led the G20 in taking action to stop banks failing, agreeing to strengthen the international financial system, and taking other measures to help to secure the global recovery. Politics is about judgment. Government is about taking decisions. As a Government, we could have allowed Northern Rock to fail; we could have decided not to take powers through the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 to manage the crisis and not saved Bradford &amp; Bingley; and we could have made the political judgment that what was needed was the complete deregulation of all mortgage markets. They would have been the wrong decisions to make in order to protect jobs and people's savings, yet they were the exact policies that the Opposition advocated at the time.</p>

The region has had a very tough time during the economic recession, suffering more than many others in the economy, and that is why it is fundamentally important that we continue to up our skill levels in the west midlands and, more broadly, throughout the United Kingdom.

That will be fundamental to underpinning our country's economic future. As we set out in the Budget, following almost a decade of rising capital investment, net investment next year-£36 billion-is close to that spent in 2008-09; and in 2011-12, well into what we hope will be a recovery, it will be close to that spent in 2007-08. That investment, which would be cut if the shadow Chancellor had his way, is providing much-needed support to thousands of UK construction workers. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have a warped sense of priorities in wanting to give a £200,000 tax cut to the 3,000 wealthiest estates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="91022-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000376">It was, and continues to be, the right judgment to support families, businesses and jobs to get through the downturn as soon as possible and in the best possible shape. It was also the right decision to prevent the collapse of the banking system, because the impact of a collapse on households and businesses would have been catastrophic. It is right, too, to invest in Britain's future. But we also have to make the tough decisions to take action on the deficit once the recovery is secured. We must live within our means, because money will be tighter in the years to come, and that means that choices will be even more important. We have already set out a responsible reduction plan to halve the deficit over four years, we have announced tax increases for those on the highest incomes that will take effect once the economy is growing again, and we will take the tough decisions on public spending for the years ahead. We are determined to take a responsible approach to reducing the fiscal deficit that will not damage the public services on which people rely. We will cut costs and unnecessary programmes, but continue to invest in front-line services. These decisions will be based on our values of fairness and responsibility. We will continue to make the right choices for recovery and for Britain's future.</p>

Now his policies would kill the recovery, cutting support at the worst possible time for the economy and for people in Britain. Winston Churchill once said:</p>
<a name="91022-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09102229000860"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="91022-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000378">Judged by that yardstick, the shadow Chancellor is a success. However, I think that the general public will increasingly want to question his judgment over the coming months, and we certainly relish that debate.</p>

 That was an extraordinary speech from the Minister, full of quotes from Winston Churchill without quite the style to match them. He provided an incredible example of retro-politics. It is as though he has gone back to the position that the Government held back in the spring, which was to deny the fact that there were any problems with public sector borrowing and the public sector deficit. Indeed, his only mention of the C-word-cuts-was in relation to Conservative policies rather than his own. As was confirmed by the Prime Minister's conference speech, we seem to have gone back in time to when the Government's own figures strongly laid out the fact that cuts would have to be made.</p>

Too often in the past 18 months, the Chancellor and his helpers have sought to avoid debate or tried not to be here for the debates held in Opposition time. My right hon.

 I think that my hon. Friend is rather harsh. I can understand Labour Members' unwillingness to attend given that when Ministers are asked perfectly straightforward questions they do not give an answer. I asked the Minister a perfectly straightforward question about PAYE, and he avoided answering it. Why should Labour Members turn up? They have got the message and gone elsewhere.</p>

We have already heard from one Member about that. Members will be especially aware of the appalling level of youth unemployment, which features prominently in the House Library briefing on economic indicators published earlier this month. It is massively higher than in the previous recession. In the early 1990s, 19 per cent. of those aged 16 to 17 were unemployed. Now that figure is 34 per cent. The figures are higher today also for those aged 18 to 24. As we have said in previous debates, the cost of this recession in youth unemployment has been severe, and getting young people into work will be one of the priorities for the next Conservative Government.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that perfectly reasonable question. I shall come on to describe how we can both put the public finances back in order, or on the right path, and do something to help the economy along.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000390">Regionally, the unemployment picture varies. According to the Library, the biggest percentage rises in unemployment have occurred in the west midlands and the south-west, by 71 and 72 per cent. respectively year on year. Those of us who remember the past two recessions will find it interesting that the west midlands now has the highest rate of unemployment of any nation or region of this country, at 10.5 per cent. The north-east is at 9.5 per cent., and London is third at 9.2 per cent. The latter two regions have shown smaller increases, meaning that both are suffering from the longer-term blight of unemployment during the years of economic growth of the 1990s and this decade-yet another sign that Labour failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000391">To return to the question of when the economy will start to grow again, we have always said that we expect growth in 2009. Nevertheless, even the predicted quarterly growth of 0.1 or 0.2 per cent.-we will know the figure for sure tomorrow-would mean that the economy has contracted by 4.7 per cent. year on year. That is no cause for celebration. Moreover, whether or not there is small quarterly growth tomorrow, the figures are already overshadowed by the appalling Government borrowing numbers that reached us on Tuesday. Britain borrowed £14.8 billion in September, the highest total ever for that month, capping off a third quarter of astonishing profligacy by the Exchequer. That is overspending of almost £500 million a day. That is like each taxpayer in Britain coming home every day and saying that they have just gone and borrowed another £20, without any sense of when the previous day's £20 will ever be repaid, let alone the interest on the previous borrowing.</p>

net borrowing was a massive £128 billion, up from an already high £47 billion in the year to September 2008. The public finances have been whacked by a double whammy of falling tax receipts and rising Government spending. Tax revenues have fallen 10 per cent. to £219 billion from £244 billion in the past six months, while Government spending has risen by an inflation-busting 4.8 per cent. from £266 billion to £279 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000393">Labour Members may claim that those appalling figures are not relevant to the question of economic recovery. I believe the Minister was saying that the deficit was somehow an entirely separate matter from whether Britain will have a proper economic recovery, but the two are very much linked, as I shall explain in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000394">How can we secure a sustainable recovery? As we have said repeatedly this year, there are three essential aspects of any recovery: fiscal responsibility, monetary activism and supply-side reform. First, on fiscal responsibility, we need urgently to get a grip on our public finances. That much is obvious, except to the Prime Minister and Labour Front Benchers. That is vital in its own right, but it is also important when considering how to keep interest rates down, which will be a crucial part of our economic recovery. Huge Government borrowing will eventually push up interest rates, and the most recent figures that I have seen for the quantitative easing programme suggest that far more gilts and other fixed-income securities have been bought back than issued so far this year. Once QE has been wound up, as it must be in due course, we will need to keep a careful eye on the gilt market and other markets in which the UK might find investors for Government debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000395">Our deficit is the worst of any major country. The Government sometimes say that we do not need to worry, as Government debt in the UK as a percentage of GDP at 59 per cent. and rising is still below that of Japan at 188 per cent., Italy at 116 per cent., Germany at 78 per cent. and France at 77 per cent., and only marginally above the rate of the United States at 54 per cent.</p>

 I am not saying that, I am saying that QE will have to come to an end when the timing is right. Some of the tactical and practical details of QE are best left to the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000398">To return to the deficit as a percentage of overall GDP, the crucial point is that if we divide the percentages that I mentioned by each country's domestic savings ratio, we find that we are actually in a far worse position than other countries, and possibly even than Japan. All that is before we consider any of the off-balance-sheet stuff. For some time we have had the problem that the UK gilt market is greatly exposed to weak domestic savings. Unless British households can start saving in a way that they have never done before, gilt issuance will depend on foreign demand.</p>

rates are headed-are much higher than short-term rates. In fact, the multiplier of long-term rates, at about eight times the level of short-term rates, may be at a record level. As I have said before from the Dispatch Box, it is worth remembering that a 0.5 per cent. increase in interest rates is far more significant when rates are low than when they are high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000400">The market has already anticipated substantial rises in interest rates, and even before any such rises have taken effect, the Treasury itself projects that debt interest will rise from £22 billion to £67 billion per annum. Obviously that bill will rise substantially if interest rates rise significantly. That is another reason why fiscal responsibility is so important for our economic recovery. If the Government continue to borrow uncontrollably, not only will the interest rate bill rise substantially and potentially unsustainably but the public sector will crowd the private sector out of the credit market. Members of all parties rightly urge the giving of more credit to small and medium-sized enterprises, but that will be made much harder if we do not get a grip on the public finances, because the state will crowd the private sector out of the market.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will let me speak, the shadow Chancellor laid out pretty clearly a menu of different things that a new Conservative Government will introduce. He did not at any point say that it was an exclusive list, but it was intended to give a direction of travel and to show the rough, overall approach that a Conservative Government would take. It is too early to lay out one's plans in full, not least because we do not know what appalling inheritance we are likely to have. That is partly a result of the Government's failing to face up to the simple facts of the budget deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para13"><a name="09102229000413">As I said, we have also published longer-term proposals for the economy, entitled "Reconstruction: Plan for a Strong Economy". When it comes to supply-side reform, no single policy can achieve everything, but we have begun to set out a programme of reform that I believe will be no less radical than the one that restored the UK's economic competitiveness in the 1980s and in  the 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09102229000414">We need to save and invest more for the longer term, and achieve a model that is both greener and more sustainable. Most of all, we need to send a powerful signal that Britain is still open for business. With the right combination of monetary activism, fiscal responsibility and supply-side reform, we can rebuild confidence in the British economy and take full advantage of recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09102229000415">That is the Conservative strategy for the recovery. It is the only sustainable route from austerity to prosperity.

That is not to say that they are not culpable for the reasons we arrived in that position-that is not today's debate-but they were right to restore stability in the financial system. The real test now is whether that simply leads back to business as usual, and after being rescued the banks go back to big bonuses and ever more innovative instruments, and we start the whole merry-go-round again, or whether we come out of this with a refreshed banking system that is more responsive to the needs of commerce and industry.</p>

My argument is not about utility versus casino, but about the two separate cultures that are required in such institutions. If they are mixed together, one simply gets the worst of all worlds.</p>

"Narrow bank" is also difficult language, but such banks would have a separation of functions and would be more commercially viable.

That is of course nothing to do with the Government and carries its own risks in the future. We have seen the first minuscule shoots of hope appearing, but there is a real danger of a double dip. I remember the recession in the early 1980s, when the brakes went back on in 1981. That was too soon, and we went back into recession. It would therefore be wrong to end the fiscal stimulus too early. There is a balance of risk, but there is a larger risk in ending the financial stimulus too early than in ending it too late.</p>

The deficit then was larger, but it was mostly dealt with by being inflated away, and that is not an option that is open to us this time. It is clear that cuts, and quite large cuts, are needed in public spending, but there is a difference between cuts in public spending that have a direct impact on front-line services and cuts in expenditure planned for the future, such as ID cards-an expenditure that we do not need to make. My hon. Friends have suggested that the Trident programme is another area for cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="91022-0008.htm_para24"><a name="09102229000431">The really important thing is to get the recovery going to improve the employment situation. We need employment that comes from sustainable jobs, and such jobs will be grown by business, not created by the Government. The Government's job is to create the conditions under which business can flourish, but it will be business that actually creates the jobs. As we move to recovery, we need to put in place the mechanisms to assist businesses to grow, and I outlined some of those in the debate on Monday. The creation of mechanisms by which small businesses in particular can obtain access to affordable finance and capital rank at the very top of what is required. The Government have a track record of ineffective schemes for business. Businesses, especially SMEs, want a properly functioning, fair and well-regulated banking system. We would create the fertile conditions that would enable British business to lead us into a secure recovery.</p>

 I remind the House that I have business interests in manufacturing and investment management, but I am obviously not speaking on their behalf today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para0"><a name="09102229000433">In the debate on Monday, I said that we needed to make the banks more competitive and change banking regulation at the bottom of the cycle, which is where we are now. Unless we make the banks work, we will not have a sustainable recovery. I drew attention to the grotesque distortion in the economy, in that we have very easy money at very low rates of interest for the public sector, created by quantitative easing, but a dreadful shortage of money, and high interest rates for those who can get money for the private sector. That is why we will not have a vigorous and sustained recovery such as those in China and some other big economies around the world. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind and that the Government will do something about it, because we all want to see more jobs, more prosperity and a quicker return to the levels of economic activity of a couple of years ago. We will not get that unless we fix the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000434">There is another huge imbalance in the British economy that has to be adjusted in the years ahead if we are to have a return to prosperity and sustainable growth. The big imbalance that the Government's policies have allowed to occur is that we are borrowing too much, consuming too much and importing too much, but saving too little, investing too little, making too little and exporting too little.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000435">Let us start by looking at the parlous plight of manufacturing. The sector has been squeezed and squeezed under this Government. They came to power with the best of intentions. They said that they wished to reverse the long-term trend downwards of manufacturing as a proportion of our economy. They said that they wished to reverse the balance of payments difficulties that had been experienced from time to time under Governments of both political persuasions in the previous 30 years. The Prime Minister, as an Opposition spokesman, used to specialise in going through the balance of payments figures every month and drawing attention to what he thought were unsatisfactory levels of excess imports over exports, especially in manufacturing. Well, the deficits that we were then running were tiny in comparison with the monumental deficits that we are now seeing month after month. We cannot go on like this. It is most important that activity is shifted away from consuming, importing and spending into producing, making and selling abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000436">The Government have not been good for manufacturing, which is now only 13 per cent. of our total economy. However, I am pleased to say that we have some fine companies and good performance in certain sectors. Two sectors in which British performance has been good are pharmaceuticals and aerospace and defence engineering. Those two sectors have some characteristics in common: they employ a lot of talented people, they spend a lot on research and development, they have high returns on sales in normal times, and they have a lot of public purchasing, providing them with demand and activity for their factories. NHS purchasing is an important element of the demand for the leading pharmaceutical companies  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09102229000437">One of the things that is most disappointing is how little intelligent purchasing there is in other areas to provide that kind of enthusiastic support-not a free lunch or subsidised purchasing-to sustain more industries on the back of the huge sums that the Government are spending. For example, we have had a substantial train investment programme in recent years, much of it financed by public subsidy. Much of that work has gone abroad. Was it not possible for Ministers to apply competitive purchasing but ensure, as other countries do, that those purchases benefit domestic manufacturers and create opportunities for people to set up and make things here in the UK? Why is it that so many quango chiefs, civil service chiefs and Ministers run around in foreign-manufactured cars? Surely competitive products can be found from the extremely good British factories. Many of them are owned by foreign companies, but that does not matter. The important point is that they employ people in this country and the value is added here. Why are we not able to make more intelligent use of our purchasing?</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that apprenticeship schemes are enormously important as a source of training for businesses and to enable young people to enter the work force? Because of the bureaucracy that businesses, especially manufacturing businesses, are under, they are unable to take on vital new apprentices to do the jobs that my right hon. Friend describes so accurately.</p>

 I am sure that that is one of the constraints. Businesses always need more skilled people at all levels. A better system for apprenticeships might well help. One of the additional constraints at the moment is that businesses cannot raise money. They cannot borrow cash or get working capital out of the banks because we have a lopsided banking system that is channelling huge sums of money into the public sector, but not into the private sector. They cannot borrow the money from the commercial banks because of the mistaken policy, and they are not getting the money in turnover because they are not getting the benefit of the orders. Every time that public sector cash is spent on an import, it is not doing the good that it could do if it was spent on a domestically produced product, because it means that we are still keeping people on the dole, untrained and unable to produce that good.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman's exposition of what he thinks should be done is interesting, but when he was a member of the previous Government, we had similar problems with apprenticeships. During the last recession, under the previous Government-I worked for Rolls-Royce at the time, so I know a little about this-the first casualty was always the apprenticeships. We talk about companies such as Rolls-Royce, and aid for them. The previous Government talked about lift-off aid-or something like that-but this Government brought in tax credits for companies such as Rolls-Royce and so helped them with research and development.</p>

 I am sure that we could improve on the apprenticeship schemes in place under the Conservatives, but the lamentable truth is that they are not working now. We have had 12 years of this Government. We have less manufacturing as a proportion of our economy. We have a worse situation for manufacturing orders than I have ever seen in my life, affecting most manufacturing business that I talk to. I was at a Royal Society event last night, meeting a lot of manufacturers and talking from the platform. They all reported dire situations for orders a few months ago. I am pleased to say that there is some evidence that the situation is beginning to lift off the very bottom, but it is still way behind what it reached at peak levels.</p>

 I do not want to get into a ding-dong with the right hon. Gentleman, but there were very few apprenticeships under his Government, particularly in the 1980s. All the apprenticeships budgets were cut. I notice that he did not really go into the issue of tax credits for companies such as Rolls-Royce. I can remember taking a delegation to meet one of his Ministers in the 1980s. I also remember the works convener saying, "You're going to have a lot of very expensive shelf-stackers because of how you are trying to assist companies such as Rolls-Royce." That is why we brought in tax credits.</p>

 I want to live in the present and look forward to the future, not wallow in the past, but if we are talking about the past, I must say that there was a lot more manufacturing then than there is today.

 The primary reason for that haemorrhaging, not just over the past 11 or 12 years, but over a much longer period, was an over-inflated exchange rate for the pound. We now have a more competitive pound. We need to sustain that competitive element in the value of the pound. How does the right hon.

 That is the nearest to flattery that I am going to get from Labour Members. I was about to say that the sharp devaluation of the pound last year and the little wobble in the pound in recent weeks are positive for those who wish to export, but negative in many other ways. They are causing much more price inflation in this country than anywhere else in the free world and have, of course, cut our living standards massively, because if we import a third of all that we need, and our currency falls in value by one fifth, we can see immediately that we will have lost an awful lot of purchasing power and will all be much worse off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000450">So far, the export recovery is not nearly as vigorous as one might hope for, or expect, given that we had a devaluation of more than one fifth about a year ago. We are not seeing the follow-up that we would like to see. Why is that? I think that it is because of the points that I am making: manufacturers are not getting the orders or the financial support from the banks because the system is so skewed and asymmetrical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000451">Many businesses and manufacturers, because they cannot get the banking cash and are having to conserve and generate their own, are saying, "I'm not going to get many orders anyway, so I'm going to keep my prices up.

 In addition to that, does my right hon. Friend agree that the problem is with the red tape that businesses in this country suffer from as a result of this Government focusing not on jobs and prosperity, but on bureaucracy?</p>

 I was going to come to that; it is on my list of things that need fixing. We need access to working capital and more domestic orders to provide the volume that lowers the unit cost. We also need to keep control over the tax and regulatory burdens because most international businesses now look globally and do so on the numbers. They look at the costs, the cash flows and how easy it is to do business in each location. They do not have a romantic attachment to one country. I wish that they did-I wish that they shared my romantic attachment to my country and wanted to see success here-but they do not. They will look at the numbers and put the plant, the new jobs and the new projects in the place where they think that the numbers make sense. If the regulatory burden is too high, they will score that against the particular country-and regulation is a cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000454">Labour Members like to portray me as the man who would have no regulation at all, but that is a grotesque distortion. I have strongly urged stronger regulation of certain things in banking, and of course we need strong safety regulations in manufacturing. However, the overall balance is wrong. There is too much regulation overall. It means that there is too much cost and that we have fewer jobs as a direct result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09102229000455">Some voices on the Labour Benches have taken up an idea that I have launched into the public debate in recent years, which is that we should have regulatory budgets here. They have been adopted in Holland very successfully. The Dutch budgets do not go as far as I would like, because they just concentrate on the Government and regulation costs, whereas I also want them to include the impact cost on the businesses being targeted. However, the model is there and I urge the Government to do it, even at this late stage in this Parliament, because the sooner the signal is sent out that we want to start to curb and limit regulatory costs on businesses, the better it will be for generating new jobs here.</p>

but also the United States, recover, we will be able to export. My concern-this was the question I asked the right hon. Gentleman originally-is this: when our economy begins to recover, it is likely that the exchange rate will appreciate, losing the advantage that we have had, so how do we prevent that from happening?</p>

 Given the amount being printed and the amount that the Government want to borrow, we are in for a weak currency, unfortunately. I do not think that that is the worry; the worry is whether we get the response. That is the issue that I am trying to address. That was a good way for the hon. Gentleman to influence my speech. The answer is that we will not get enough of a response for import substitution or direct export unless we get these things right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000458">People have to have access to capital and land with planning permission, and to the right kind of factory space, with the right kind of floors, loadings and eaves heights, so that they can do modern manufacturing in a good environment. They need access to the skilled people, young and old, and they need very high-quality engineers and other such people to go in, take the risks and develop the products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09102229000459">The world's manufacturers know how to drive a process for quality. We can make expensive items out of a high-cost labour base, and I am not one who wants to drive down wages. I want staff on high wages who are well rewarded and motivated because they are skilled. We do not need many of them, but we need to use them intelligently in successful manufacturing. In good manufacturing, labour costs might be only 10 or 15 per cent. of total selling price, so it is not the main driver. It is not impossible to run really good manufacturing out of a UK, US or German base, as we can see in many examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09102229000460">I am conscious that others wish to join in this very short debate. My conclusions are that we need to give every sensible incentive so that we can have this massive shift out of consuming and borrowing and into producing and making to tackle the balance of payments deficit and the very large deficits across the economy. We have the groundwork for that, with the large devaluation brought about by an incredibly sloppy money policy and by printing so many pounds. We must not throw that away or waste it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09102229000461">The early evidence is that the reaction is not strong enough. That implies that the Government need to look at the availability of people, of buildings and land, of planning permission and of orders. If, for example, the Government had an energy policy that they could announce and activate, that would trigger a large number of orders for all kinds of things in the energy sector, but we have had dither and delay. If we had a proper transport policy that was more clearly defined, that could also trigger the sort of orders that we need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="91022-0009.htm_para14"><a name="09102229000462">I urge the Government not to rest on their lack of laurels or think that because they are printing so much money, the economy will suddenly come miraculously right. Printing money without things happening on the ground just causes inflation and far worse mess and distress. If we are to make anything out of the mess, we need now to put in place policies that create orders and create a sensible level of regulation and low taxation, so that people will want and be able to make things here and so that we can get people back into jobs.</p>

Tragically, by halfway through that debate there were only three Labour Members in the Chamber. They included the Minister, the Parliamentary Private Secretary and the Whip on duty-in other words, no Labour Back Bencher was present for the debate. However, in the course a full day's debate, at least four Labour MPs managed to speak.

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09102229000470">Behind this debate is an assumption that a recovery is beginning. However, the Library has placed in the Vote Office the economic indicators for October 2009, a publication that makes worthwhile reading because it contains the Library's figures. They are not partisan figures from a political party or independent commentator, but the Library's figures. The economic indicators for October show that full-time employment has fallen by almost 700,000 over the year. There have never been so few people under 25 in employment in recent times. The UK economy has now been in recession since the third quarter of 2008. Also, the economy contracted in the second quarter of this year, compared to the first quarter,  <br>

which was the fifth successive quarter of negative growth. However, the research paper shows that, although we are still in negative growth, France, Germany and Japan have emerged from recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000471">The paper also shows that manufacturing output decreased by 12.4 per cent. in the second quarter of this year, compared with the same quarter in 2008. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham mentioned, manufacturing industry has been getting into a desperate plight year on year. Total business investment decreased by 10.2 per cent. in the second quarter of 2009, compared with the previous quarter, and was 21.8 per cent. lower than in the second quarter of 2008. Productivity across the whole economy, measured by output per head, is estimated to have fallen in 2008, as compared with growth in 2007. In the three months to July 2009, total employment was 600,000 lower than a year earlier.</p>

 May I suggest a little more humility from a member of a Government who oversaw two-I repeat, two-internally generated recessions? We all recognise the current difficulties in the economy, but does the hon. Gentleman accept that action by this Government at least had the consequence of not allowing a recession to develop into a depression?</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="09102229000473"><a name="91022-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="09102229001240"><b>Tony Baldry:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention because it shows the Labour party's two desperate alibis. When Labour Members get desperate, they say, "Well, you know, it was even worse when there was a Conservative Government," which is a bit like saying to the Liberals, "Things were desperate when Campbell-Bannerman was Prime Minister." That approach just does not wash after 12 years in government. The second alibi is, "If we hadn't intervened, it would've been even worse." The hon. Gentleman has to acknowledge that, as I will demonstrate in a second, the deficit-the black hole that the Government have got us into-is monumental. However, let me first conclude my point about unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000474">The change in the unemployment rate has hit everyone. A comparison of the period from May to July in 2009 with the same period a year earlier gives an indication of just how desperate the increase in unemployment in this country has become. In the south-west of England, the seasonally adjusted increase in unemployment from the same period in the previous year was 72 per cent. In the west midlands the figure was 71 per cent., and even in the south-east it was 36 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000475">All that leads us to the fact that the Government have got our public finances into a complete mess. The Library reports that the Treasury forecasts that borrowing will be £175 billion in 2009-10, which is 12.4 per cent.  of gross domestic product. Debt is forecast to rise to £1.4 trillion by 2013-14, which is 76.2 per cent. of GDP, excluding the impact of measures to support the banks. Those are truly horrifying statistics and they show why we can have no recovery until we have some fiscal responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09102229000476">That is why my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer is right to make it clear that the Government have borrowed too much and that £1 in every £4 that the state spends now goes straight on the national debt. More of our taxes go on paying the interest on that debt than go on educating our children or ensuring that our armed forces are properly equipped.  <br>

It is tragic to see the training of the Territorial Army being cut for the next six months, as many of its young men and women are now serving on the front line. I wonder just how many days' debt interest would be needed to ensure that that commitment could otherwise be met-it would probably be only one or two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000477">There is no recovery for the Government to secure. They really need to address how to get the public finances back into kilter and where to make the savings in public spending to ensure that that happens. This is clearly an issue that Ministers are unwilling to address. The shadow Chancellor addressed it in Manchester, but the Government are unwilling to do so. They are simply hoping that they can get from now to the first Thursday in May next year without addressing it, and hoping upon hope that if they keep on talking about some mythical recovery, the electors will be lulled into thinking that life can go on just as it is now. The reality is that responsible, serious measures will have to be taken by whoever is elected to Government at the next general election, and that only we are showing the responsibility of measuring up to that task.</p>

 I shall keep my comments brief, as I should like to hear the Minister respond to the perfectly straightforward points that have been made in the debate. As it is due to finish at 1.46 pm, I should like to give him five or 10 minutes in which to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000479">We covered a lot of these matters in our debate on Monday, in which the Secretary of State for Work and Pension conceded, in response to my intervention, that she had not listened to the debate in full. There was, however, a tacit agreement that she would respond directly to the points made by Opposition Members. I hope that the Minister will give me an assurance today that the genuine points made on a constituency basis by my Conservative colleagues will be addressed directly, by mail-as soon as we can get letters through the post, that is-or via the Letterboard in the next couple of days. That will help us to deal with the problems that we have today, as well as those that we had on Monday, and those that we will have in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000480">I want to put a couple of points to the Minister. First, will the Government commit to applying the small business rate relief automatically to firms across the country? This relief is a significant help to companies struggling through the recession and can save small businesses more than £1,000 a year. That might not sound like a lot, but small businesses and enterprises have been the backbone of the economic success of this country for many years, and unless we build from the grass roots up, we will not have the success or the recovery that this debate purports to be about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000481">Many businesses are not claiming the relief, either because they are not aware that they might be eligible, or because the procedure for claiming it is too burdensome. That just adds another layer of red tape to a small business or enterprise that is trying to do its bit for the recovery. Does the Minister agree that applying rate relief automatically would overcome this problem? Small businesses and enterprises have been an integral part of our success in the past, and we must recognise that for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09102229000482">Recent figures show a discrepancy between the value of loans offered to businesses by banks and the value of loans actually drawn down by them. Does the Minister agree that the two should not be confused? Surely the recovery of the economy can be secured only if Government schemes-many of which were described in our debate earlier this week-are working effectively. If they are not, there is no point in putting out a press release suggesting that they are going to happen. That merely pays lip service to a problem without actually dealing with it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o290"><a name="09102229000483"><a name="91022-0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="09102229001242"><b>Mr. Brian Jenkins (Tamworth) (Lab):</b>
 Mention has been made of apprenticeships. Does the hon. Gentleman fear, as I do, that the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, and now this recession, might well have pushed a critical mass of employees in manufacturing-and in engineering, in particular-down to a level at which we are no longer able to regenerate and reskill ourselves? Does he agree that it will take direct Government involvement to re-establish our manufacturing base?</p>

<p><a name="st_o291"><a name="09102229000484"><a name="91022-0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="09102229001243"><b>Christopher Fraser:</b>
 At the moment, 1 million 16 to 24-year-olds are out of work. As I said earlier, apprenticeship schemes are an enormously important way of training people to get back into the work force. However, the red tape and bureaucracy that we are now suffering from are stifling companies and preventing them from dealing with their problems. The hon. Gentleman must accept that there are now 2 million fewer jobs in manufacturing in this country. That has happened over the past 12 years, and it is not good news. There has not been the necessary investment by this Government in the backbone of British industry and the manufacturing sector that we rely on now and will rely on in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000485">Thetford, in my constituency, is a great manufacturing and engineering base. The businesses there want to work and to make a contribution, but every time they take a step forward, they have to take two steps back because of the way the Government treat them over employment, bureaucracy and the regulations with which they have to comply in order to get their products into the marketplace. Of course that adds a burden of cost to those businesses and makes them uncompetitive. The Government have not walked up to that problem, and I do not believe that they will do so. We need a change of Government-we need a Government who understand the dynamics of business and how that affects the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="91022-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09102229000486">If we are going to get out of this recession, businesses need to know that the Government are listening. I do not believe that they are. Businesses are being stifled. I believe that there is now adequate time for the Minister to address these problems. At the end of the day, the people of this nation need to know that they are being listened to. Alas, that did not happen in Monday's debate. The Minister is an honourable and decent man, and I hope that he will address these issues today. If he cannot answer all our questions, because there are not enough officials in the Box to give him the necessary responses, will he, having read <i> Hansard</i> at the end of the day, have the courtesy to come back to us on every point that we have made? These are serious issues that need to be dealt with, constituency by constituency, as a matter of urgency now, and not by another topical debate in a few weeks' time.</p>

 The topical debate today was chosen by the Leader of the House, presumably in consultation with others on the Government Front Bench. Can the Minister tell us why not a single Labour Member has spoken in support of the debate? Does the recovery simply not matter to his colleagues, or have they just abandoned him to be a one-man show?</p>

 I just wish that, rather than engaging in juvenile debating points, the Opposition would engage with the real issues. They cannot deny the fact that they called it wrong when it came to bailing out the banks and to the fiscal stimulus, or that, at the moment, they are calling it wrong when it comes to the recovery. People need to understand that the Tories' policies, as they are at the moment, would kill our recovery in this country. They have a dangerous set of policies, and the public need to understand that.</p>

 Let me respond first to the point about small business rate relief, which was the subject of quite a lot of debate some months ago. There is now a greater understanding among small business organisations about what is in place at the moment. Steps have been taken to make it easier for small businesses to claim rate relief. The systems in Wales and Scotland are not necessarily automated in the way that some of us are led to believe. It is very easy indeed for businesses to get this relief-as I understand it, it is automatically rolled over once they qualify for it. The evidence I have seen suggests that the vast majority of businesses do actually claim the small business rate relief. If I can provide any further information on that issue, I would be happy to do so, as I agree with those who say that small businesses are an important part of the UK economy. It is right that we, the Government, are seen to support them.</p>

The first thing I have to say, however, is that those of us who have a memory-those who actually remember the previous Government-find it very difficult to stomach hearing Conservative Members talk about the importance of manufacturing.</p>

I hope that she enjoys her current incarnation as much as she did her previous time as a very valued member of our Committee. I am sure that her personal experience on the PAC convinced her, as has mine, of the desire of all members of the Committee to maintain our independence of thought and to divorce ourselves from the murky old waters of partisanship. One of the nice things about this three or four-hour debate is that we do not get involved in party politics at all. One thing that I am most proud of in the 391-or whatever number it is-Committee meetings I have chaired is that we have never had a single vote, not one.</p>

Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), who cannot be here today as he has had to go back to Swansea for constituency engagements. He is a long-term member of the Committee who has given me invaluable advice for many years.

Whichever corner of whichever political party one sits in, how could one disagree with such objectives, especially in the face of the fiscal tsunami that is breaking around us? We are all aware of our difficult financial plight, as national debt has reached worrying levels and small businesses and ordinary people are struggling to keep their heads above water. So, whichever party finds itself occupying the Government Benches after the next election, then, sensible ways to reduce public spending will be all the vogue. The current  <br>

talk of cuts and savings highlights the importance of the Committee. There is spin and there is counter-spin, but those are not our department: it is to protecting the taxpayer's money that the Committee dedicates itself, week in, week out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000517">I believe that the reports we are debating, and the many other reports that we have produced for this Parliament, shine an unbiased light on how Government can save literally billions-thousands of millions-of pounds by applying good sense and common practice to public services. There are no radical new ideas; it is simply a case of plain common sense in the way in which public services are run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000518">Sometimes our hearings leave me wondering whether too many people ignore the basics of good administration because it all seems too obvious, or because it has all been said before. Perhaps it has been said before, but that does not necessarily mean that it has been applied. Civil servants do not need to reinvent the wheel. Simply by looking at the problem, taking on board sound advice and acting in a planned, considered and thorough way, they can save themselves time, money, and a grilling from the PAC. Whoever wins the next general election, I hope that we shall not immediately see a blaze of new initiatives and new policies. The first thing that we should do is do well what we have already undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000519">According to information that I have received from the National Audit Office, over the eight years since I took over the chairmanship of the Committee in 2001 the action taken by Departments in response to our recommendations, including those in some of the reports that we are considering today, has saved the taxpayer, at a conservative estimate-that is "conservative" with a small "c"-more than £4 billion. I wish that all the members of the Committee could have received a 1 per cent. commission. I do not know whether <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> is listening to this, but that would have given each of us the tidy sum of £40 million. I think that we would have been cheap at the price. We have heard so much bad publicity about Parliament over the past six months; what a pity that newspapers are so uninterested in the solid hard work of Committees such as ours. I do not think that saving £4 billion is a record to be sneezed at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000520">I must thank all Committee members past and present. Later, of course, I shall be delivering my usual thanks to the National Audit Office. Let me say straight away that we on the Committee claim absolutely no credit for this. The reason why ours is the most effective Committee in Parliament is that we have 800 civil servants working for us. They provide us with the bullets and we fire them. However, I must thank all the Committee members who work so hard firing those bullets at the civil servants who appear before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09102229000521">In debates such as this, there is a danger of our becoming too self-satisfied. Let me quickly come down to earth, and say that we have not achieved nearly enough. We can still do much more. If we extrapolate the savings that have already been achieved in some areas, or examine the scope for bringing the costs of functions that are common across government into line with the best, we see that billions more could be saved. There is absolutely no doubt about it. That is not me speaking. According to the National Audit Office, whose  <br>

members are not politicians and are not trying to make a political point, we could save billions more without changing a single policy, simply by doing better what we are already doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000522">I have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I shall place the letter in the Library because it is a public document. It will also be copied to my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), the shadow Chancellor, and the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), the Liberal Democrat shadow Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09102229000523">It will come as no surprise that in writing the letter, I received some help from the National Audit Office. It contains the accumulated thinking of myself and the NAO on how we could save more money by doing things more efficiently. I hope that it will serve as a useful adjunct to public debate over the next six months. It sets out five areas where savings and improvements have been made, and where we think that more could be achieved: better financial management, better information management, reducing complexity and improving processes, exploiting the scale of spend, and improved outcomes. I hope that the House will forgive me if I go through them one by one. I think it terribly important, because I am not sure that anyone else has conducted a study of this kind independently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09102229000524">We believe that £560 million has already been achieved by Government implementation of some of our recommendations. Effective financial management helps Departments to manage their budgets, to allocate resources to achieve priorities, and to deliver services cost-effectively. The introduction of resource accounting in 2001-02 was intended to realise those benefits, but the financial management of Departments remains a long way short of the world-class aspirations of Government. Basic management actions can result in considerable financial savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09102229000525">Here are just a few examples of what can still be achieved. As I said, we believe that we have saved about £4 billion. What can still be achieved? The sum of £29.2 million is still to be saved through improvements in Ministry of Defence stockholding. The MOD has a long history of holding too much stock of the wrong type, and of shortages of key items needed on deployed operations. We have produced numerous reports on that. We concluded that the MOD needed to take radical action to tackle its inventory management and bring it up to the standards of modern supply-chain management. Following our report, the MOD agreed an impact of £29.2 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09102229000526">As for museums and galleries' commercial operations, £15.3 million could be saved. Museums and galleries' poor business skills meant they were making losses on activities that were supposed to generate income. The Committee recommended that they set five-year targets for income growth with milestones supported by plans based on a systematic review of their assets and opportunities, an appreciation of which areas are most profitable, and an assessment of the risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09102229000527">We can give further examples of what could be achieved. For instance, there are potential savings of £1.3 billion in reducing running costs. Benchmarking costs would enable Departments to see how they compare with others. That is a very simple thing which does not happen enough in Whitehall. Considerable scope for savings exists in other running costs. For example- this calculation is based on the 2007-08 figures-   <br>

£464 million could be saved if the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Home Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Transport brought their accommodation costs per staff member down to the same level as those of the former Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, while  £85 million could be saved if the accommodation costs of the Department for Work and Pensions were brought down to the level of those of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, and £813 million could be saved if the DCLG, DEFRA, the DWP and HMRC brought their IT costs per staff member down to the level of those of the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09102229000528">I am sorry to rattle through those figures. They are all in writing and they will all be in the Library, but it is important for me to put them on the record to show that by means of simple benchmarking-if every Whitehall Department performs at the level of the best-we can achieve enormous savings in Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09102229000529">The next big area of potential saving is, of course, staff numbers. I am not talking about changing a single policy. I am not talking about affecting any efficiency in the front line. I am not talking about taking away a single nurse, doctor, teacher or soldier. We believe, however, that there are potential savings of £2.5 billion to be made. Some Departments have cut staff numbers in recent years, and they are to be congratulated. I am thinking particularly of the DWP, HMRC and the MOD. Savings in the staff bill have, however, been offset by salary increases above inflation, redundancy payments and increased staff numbers in the health sector, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice. We believe that an estimated £1.7 billion could be saved across government if all Departments matched the level of staff reductions achieved by the DWP, HMRC and the MOD. If the higher-cost Departments reduced their average costs to the level of those of the Ministry of Justice, the saving across Departments would be about £800 million. We believe that those savings could be achieved without any impact on the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09102229000530">Talking of not affecting the front line, what about back office costs? We believe that there are potential savings of £1.4 billion. In 2007, the Cabinet Office estimated that £1.4 billion of the £7 billion that central Government spend annually on finance and human resources-is that not an incredible figure?-could be saved if Departments shared back-office functions. Despite considerable discussion and planning, so far we regret that achievements have been limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09102229000531">So far £1.2 billion has been saved as a result of the work of the Committee but better quality information and better use of information can improve the quality of services and stem the leakage of public money through fraud and poor compliance. Our work to improve information management has led to impacts totalling £1.2 billion. These are some examples of what has been achieved, but the scope for Departments to do more is considerable in terms of better information management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09102229000532">By following our recommendations, HMRC has increased corporation tax yield by improving the way in which it interacts with businesses. HMRC implemented a more structured approach to risk assessment and engages directly in the management boards of businesses that pose higher risks.</p>

Badly designed and overly complex services waste resources and frustrate the citizens who have to use them. From 2001, a total financial impact of £812 million has been agreed including, for example, £110 million from DWP following our recommendations on how to reduce errors, appeals and delay in the medical assessment of sickness and disability benefits.</p>

Improved processes include reduced volatility and uncertainty in work, funding to allow the supply side to invest in skills and innovation and appointing fully integrated supply chains. These are some of the basic steps needed to release at least £2.6 billion of annual savings in public sector construction. I am sorry to blind the House with all these figures but they are important; we are not talking about cutting the real work of government but about making government so much more efficient so that we can all do more to help ordinary people to get on with their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09102229000536">Benefits reform is a huge area on which I can touch for only a minute or so. There are potential savings of more than £110 million. Options for reform that should generate efficiency savings over time include simplification of the overall system, on which we could have a three-hour debate alone. We have a hugely complex benefits system in which at least £100 million could be saved. Greater efficiency and innovation in helping people into work and improving the administration of housing benefit and tackling bureaucracy have a potential saving of  £10 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09102229000537">The next area is exploiting the scale of spend. We believe that we have achieved about £1.1 billion-worth of savings so far. As the UK's biggest customers, the Government have considerable scope to exploit their purchasing power and to improve how they finance and handle commercial contracts. There is virtually no debate about this, but the scale of potential savings is huge. The Committee has published more than 70 reports on private finance initiative deals, and the cumulative effect of our recommendations has led to improvements in the PFI procurement. We do not simply believe that; we know it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09102229000538">Departments are significant consumers of private sector goods and services but have been slow to exploit their bulk purchasing power.

that primary care trusts take steps to ensure GPs prescribe more cost-effectively and on the introduction of benchmarking between primary care trusts resulted in a switch from branded to generic drugs and a saving for the NHS of £157 million-money that can be applied to the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para28"><a name="09102229000540">We have identified further areas where Government could better exploit their purchasing power. For instance, on food procurement there are potential savings of £220 million. By developing commercial skills and knowledge about the specialist food and catering markets and more joint purchasing, savings of £220 million in food procurement are possible by 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para29"><a name="09102229000541">On goods and services there are potential savings of £520 million. The Office of Government Commerce's Buying Solutions enables Government to buy goods and services for their portfolio of products and reports, which can result in significant savings, but by driving performance across all activities and enhancing staff skills and incentives, there is potential for at least  £520 million of extra savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para30"><a name="09102229000542">We have had reports on the use of consultants and there are potential savings of £408 million. We agree that the Government have made progress in achieving efficiency gains in the use of consultants, but there is a lot further to go. By combining reduced spending with better value for money, there is scope to find £408 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="91022-0011.htm_para31"><a name="09102229000543">Our recommendations to improve social and environmental outcomes have resulted in a total agreed impact with the Treasury of £217 million, but there is scope for public bodies to do a lot more. For instance, a fifth of all car crime happens in car parks, but only a small proportion of public bodies across the country have established secure car parks. We recommended actions for the Home Office to raise police detection rates, improve the effectiveness of automated number plate recognition and make car parks more secure. Implementing those actions resulted in a fall of vehicle crime that produced a total agreed impact of £23 million. That is a tiny example in one small area of achieving an impact of £23 million.</p>

We also concluded that the agency should take action to ensure the most effective use of the funds available for inland flood defences.

plenty of scope for further improvement in the MOD. There are plenty of other areas on which I have not touched.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000547">My quick calculations show more than £9 billion of potential savings waiting to be grasped by the Treasury. That may not have been scrutinised rigorously, line by line, in the Committee, but it indicates clear potential. On this the PAC and the Treasury are on the same side. The Treasury knows that there is great potential to make savings from better administration. Indeed, it has previously set targets to save tens of billions of pounds, not least in the operational efficiency programme, but potential and targets amount to naught without action that realises them, and in many cases the action needed is nothing more radical than effective administration-simply getting the basics right, every time in every Department. I do not claim that that is an original thought, but that does nothing to diminish the value behind the thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000548">The Committee's 17th report found another area where getting the basics right would reap rewards. We found that central Government Departments spent a huge amount-more than £12 billion in 2007-08 alone-buying in services such as IT and facilities management. If we buy a service in business, or in real life, we look out for every single pound because we know the other guy is doing just that, but cosy relationships and a lack of control prevail. After analysing those huge contracts, the National Audit Office advised the Committee that about £300 million could be saved each year. It is high time that Departments subjected suppliers to the public sector to the same pressures that those suppliers face in business. No taxpayer's pound should be an easy pound of profit, but too often it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000549">In order to show how that can be done, let me give an example that was presented to the Committee. In 2003, the Committee investigated how the Prison Service bought goods and services. To be honest, we were not very impressed, but the Prison Service dealt with our report with sound common sense. It paused, acknowledged the situation, took expert guidance and set about putting things right. The Committee returned to the Prison Service in our sixth report, and we found that changes to its procurement approach had saved £120 million over five years. That is a great achievement, and I am very pleased to give the Prison Service the credit it deserves today. I would say this to officials: "Don't be shy. When you save money, change a process or control a system and find efficiencies, shout about it."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09102229000550">We had the Foreign Office in front of us yesterday; the permanent under-secretary Sir Peter Ricketts appeared before us. It had one of the poorest financial management systems, but it has achieved a great deal. The Treasury must ensure that such good practice is spread around Whitehall. Departmental counterparts must be told how they can achieve it too, to help make it common practice, not best practice. There are too many examples of best practice in Whitehall, in the sense that often what we suggest in a report might be acted on by the Department concerned but other Departments do not take up the recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000551">We have the bundle of reports on the Table before us, and I do not want to go through all of them, because I have taken up enough time. <i> [Interruption.] </i>No, no; it would take too long, and other Members wish to speak. Let me offer a couple of examples, however.</p>

The Committee has achieved a great deal in bringing to light deficiencies in how we deal with stroke patients and hospital-acquired infections, for example, and we produced a very good report on end-of-life care. The fact is that most people would prefer not to die in hospital, but because of a lack of NHS and social care support services many people do so when there is no clinical need for them to be there. There is a lack of training in basic end-of-life care among front-line staff. The Department acknowledged in its reply that such care has not always had the priority it should have had and recognised the need to improve the provision of care for adults. I hope that we can make progress on that, therefore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000553">Let me turn to the Commonwealth Development Corporation-I am chopping and changing from one issue to another, as we deal with every part of Whitehall. The level and nature of CDC executive remuneration is relevant to its efficiency. The remuneration of the chief executive-of what is, after all, a public body-increased from £383,000 in 2003 to £970,000 in 2007. We were not very impressed. Admittedly, that huge increase in his public sector salary, now amounting to the best part of £1 million a year, reflected CDC's exceptional financial performance, and advisers concluded that CDC executives were paid below the median for such a group. That is fair enough in that they could probably earn even more in the private sector. However, CDC does not compete for cash to invest, offers high job satisfaction and has since 2004 successfully recruited and retained talented staff, so why are we paying so much to the chief executive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000554">On Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, tax credits and income tax, it is true that policy changes have helped HMRC to reduce recoverable overpayments from about £1.9 billion to £1 billion annually, but it has not given claimants the support that they need in making claims and reporting changes in circumstances, and it is planning to introduce new measures again. HMRC estimates that in 2006-07 claimant error and fraud led to incorrect payments of between £1.31 billion and £1.54 billion. That shows the amount of work that has to be done.

We found that the new class of submarine is likely to remain in service beyond the extended life of the existing Trident D5 missile, which will be renewed in 2042, and must therefore be compatible with any successor missile developed by the US. The MOD has received a series of assurances from the US that any new missile will be compatible with the UK's new submarine class, but assurances are not enough. Nevertheless, the concern remains that the MOD has no direct control over the development of new missiles.</p>

Last but not least, I turn to the national programme for IT in the NHS. We could have a debate on that alone. The Care Records Service is at least four years behind schedule, with the Department's latest forecast putting completion at 2014-15. By the end of 2008, Lorenzo, the care records software for the north, midlands and east had not been deployed throughout any acute trust and in only one PCT. Given that we are now talking of spending £12 billion, that is not good enough.</p>

Within the terms of the debate, other Members may refer to more of them if they wish to do so. We might get one more chance before the end of this Parliament to have a debate, but we do not know. Therefore, may I just thank a few people? I thank my colleagues in the Chamber, and those who currently serve on the Committee or have done so over the past eight years. They have to dedicate a great deal of time. The Committee meets twice as often as any other Committee and has a huge amount of paperwork. I also thank the Committee staff, particularly our former Committee Clerk, Mark Etherton, who has just left the role. I welcome our new Clerk, Sîan Woodward, who I am sure will be a huge asset to the Committee.</p>

It has a new head, Amyas Morse, whom the Prime Minister and I appointed last year. Mr. Morse is the first qualified chartered accountant to become the Comptroller and Auditor General. He continues to provide the PAC with excellent evidence, on which our work depends. He takes over the NAO's reins with relish, succeeding Tim Burr, who I also thank. I know that the organisation will go from strength to strength under Mr. Morse's leadership. I welcome the publication of those parts of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill that will place important changes to the NAO's governance on a permanent footing.

I shall end on this point, because it is perhaps the most important. The NAO is denied regular access to three hugely important and publicly funded bodies: the Bank of England, the BBC and the Financial Services Authority.

The BBC spends billions of pounds of public money and it should be fully accountable to Parliament-there is no threat to its editorial independence. The CAG should have statutory financial and value-for-money access to examine how the BBC spends public money. That should prevent a recurrence of the difficulties that he met in his study on the BBC's radio production efficiency when, disgracefully, the BBC tried to limit his remit-that must never happen again. Given the Government's vital interest-and now investment-in the financial sector, it would also make sense for the CAG to audit the FSA and the Bank of England. The Bank is spending billions of pounds of public money, so it should be properly audited through Parliament and be accountable through Parliament and the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

That will be a good opportunity for the civil list also to be subject to the scrutiny of the PAC, the NAO and Parliament. That is for a future Parliament to decide. We can make progress now on the BBC, the FSA and the Bank. I hear very encouraging noises from the Treasury on that, so I very much hope that the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury will in her summing up be able to give more encouragement than we have had in the past.</p>

We seek to ask the questions our hard-pressed constituents would ask, and our interest is in striving for better results for the taxpayer. If we make a few witnesses squirm, it is because every pound that our constituents give matters. It is a pound less for their businesses or their families in hard times; their contributions should be spent with respect.

He has raised its profile considerably in the public mind, used the media properly, exposed things that should have had light shone upon them and given good advice-I am surprised that it is only £4 billion that he has saved.

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09102229000567">As the hon. Gentleman says, the Committee is not about just saving money, although that is extremely important; its work often has other, almost better, implications. In this regard, I can think of two of the things that he mentioned in passing, the first of which is secure car parks. Anyone who has had their car broken into or damaged in a car park will use their insurance, but they will encounter the hassle, work, inconvenience and so on that persists from that. It is unquantifiable financially but has a huge effect on people's lives. If we can save money and avoid that, it must be good for everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09102229000568">My second example relates to flooding. I do not know the number of Members whose constituencies contain areas prone to flooding, although the figure is probably more than we realise; the number of such areas has been increasing in recent times. My constituency has suffered major flooding near the coast. Insurance is becoming more difficult to obtain, and the sheer heartache, stress and so on that is visited upon people when they have been flooded is enormous. Again, that is financially unquantifiable, but we must begin to understand that not only is saving money a good thing in its own right, but that doing things better can have even more profound outcomes. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman, his Committee and the National Audit Commission on the work that they have done. They have had some notable successes and I am sure that there will be many to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09102229000569">I am a member of the Treasury Committee. I suppose that everybody thinks that their own Committee is the most hard-working, the most valuable, the best organised and so on, but when I knew that I was going to be responding in this debate, I looked at the work of the Public Accounts Committee and was astounded at the amount that it has got through-the reports that it has produced and work that it has done. Although members of the Treasury Committee may feel that we do a lot of work, we have to acknowledge that the work done by the PAC is impressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09102229000570">I, too, wish to refer to just three of four reports that have been important to me, as well as to my constituents and others. The first such report, to which reference has been made, is the one on the Ministry of Defence and the Chinook Mk 3. Although my constituency is that of South-East Cornwall, it is close to Devonport dockyard and the Royal Marines, and many of my constituents have direct relationships with our troops. Within that community, and slightly wider than that, the saga of the Chinook Mk 3-those eight years of incompetence and bad decision-making, let alone the enormous cost and so on-has gone down extremely badly. At a time when we have seen inefficiencies and the lack of some equipment, the thought that millions of pounds have been wasted on machines that will not even get into the air for years and the basic mismanagement that that has brought out has left a sour taste in a number of people's mouths. The Ministry of Defence appears to have frittered away, through bad decisions, millions and millions of pounds, yet it seems to be penny pinching on some of the vital equipment that our troops need when they go into theatre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="91022-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09102229000572">The next report-the 11th report, on the UK's future nuclear deterrent-follows on from that. Devonport dockyard is the home of Trident when it is being refitted. It has been an enormous boost to the local economy and significant numbers of my constituents work there. The beginning of the debate on Trident has been watched with great interest and this report is a good start to what ought to be a full debate on the costs of the defence side as well as on all other aspects relating to this major policy area.</p>

 We are not in favour of renewing it, but the decision does not need to be taken now. We have at least another four years before we have to make the final decisions. In those four years, all sorts of things could happen, such as proliferation in states such as Iran, a greater sorting-out of the technology and a better understanding of the alternatives and their costs. I do not think that the debate has reached a point where anybody can make a final decision. There is an objection to Trident in general and to its amazing costs-indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) has put it down as one of the big-ticket items that has to be considered given the financial state of the country.</p>

By any measure, that is very significant. We all know that defence projects tend to go over budget and to take longer-we have discussed how that happens in defence debates-but at a time when we are looking for significant savings over all aspects of Government expenditure, perhaps we need to redesign how the procurement process is undertaken. The report makes some useful comments and suggestions about how that might be done.</p>

 The hon.

It has, perhaps unintentionally, had the effect of penalising small suppliers and small companies in the defence field. It causes great problems for small companies, which can often do things much more cheaply, effectively and swiftly than some of the giants. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of  that problem?</p>

 I am only too aware of that. Even in my constituency, the very small firms that can be light on their feet, which are often set up by people who come out of the military to set up their business on retirement-experienced technicians with enormous experience and the qualifications to undertake some of this work-find it difficult to engage with the large firms on the contracts. One way in which procurement can be speeded up and quite a lot of money can be saved is if the small and medium-sized enterprises are much more engaged in the process, perhaps through some sort of contractual arrangement. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09102229000579">The strategy may be a bit outdated, having been written more than 10 years ago. We know that there is to be a strategic defence review, but many of the earlier assumptions have been undermined by our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. The fact that our enemies can move around much more swiftly and expose weaknesses in our defences means that we need to review our urgent operational requirements much more often. As the PAC report pointed out, future contracts need to be much more flexible and adaptable so that we can be much lighter on our feet. The key question is how that recommendation can be taken into account, as this has always been an extremely difficult and perennial problem, going back decades if not longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000580">The Committee Chairman mentioned the report into the oversight of the CDC group by the Department for International Development. The matter had been brought to hon. Members' attention somewhat before the report was begun, although I suspect that the fact that everyone had so much on their plates meant that not many got around to looking at it. I was extremely pleased with the report, and mention has been made of matters such as the chief executive's salary and so on, but what stands out for me is the fact that CDC is not doing what it was set up to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000581">We need to revisit how CDC operates. Of course it is important that it makes a profit, but that is a heck of a lot easier to do if it deals only with certain markets and businesses. Enhanced performance may lead to larger bonuses-who knows?-but the assumption was that CDC would work in smaller markets, with more difficult companies and in the more difficult areas of the world, because that was where there would be a crying need for support. It appears that DFID has taken its eye off the ball, so it needs to go back and make sure that CDC does what we believe that it should. That may make the sort of profitability that CDC has achieved a heck of a lot harder, but the organisation was not set up to make easy profits in easy markets. That is not what Parliament or the country want: we want it to go into the more difficult areas of the world and help developing countries to get their indigenous businesses going. In that way, they can become more successful economically and less in need of aid and assistance as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000582">The report contains some excellent stuff.

is often expanded in a rather derogatory way but-I do not know whether this has anything to do with the PAC-there has been a lot of improvement even though there is still a long way to go. However, there are many matters on which it has been difficult to shine a spotlight. In my part of the world, for instance, FGW's intention to raise car parking charges did not exactly encourage people to use trains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000584">Another problem has to do with the massively complex and expensive fare structures. A fortnight or so ago, I bought a ticket at Paddington using my senior rail card. I was given a ticket for £40, and I said, "No, you must've got this wrong." The person in the ticket office replied, "No, this is a special deal for people over 55. We assumed that you must be over that age because you've got a senior rail card." I asked whether it was a return, and was told that it was. It is astonishing that one can get a return all the way to Cornwall for only £40. I was not aware that it was possible-although I suppose the offer had been marketed-because the normal cost is around £200. The fare structure is so extraordinarily complex and expensive that it must be beyond most people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000585">The problem is that the train companies are competing against internal flights. I suppose that some people might see it as unfortunate, but it is cheaper to get a flight from Plymouth to London City airport than it is to travel by train. The flight takes an hour and half, but the train takes three and a half hours, plus half an hour on all the other bits and pieces. We are trying to promote rail use, but it is cheaper to travel by air.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000586">Then we have the overcrowding problem. Some people thought that that was a planned strategy-that if there was lots of overcrowding, the company could stick the price up and thereby both adjust its profitability and decrease the overcrowding. The whole question of rail franchising will come back again-at least I hope it will. Although there has been reasonable improvement recently, there is still a lot to be done. If we want public transport that is inexpensive and easy for people to use, so that we can meet our emissions targets and so on, we will have to look more closely at how rail franchises are operating and whether the companies are doing what they said they would do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000587">As a member of the Treasury Committee, it was inevitable that I would want to discuss the PAC's 31st report, on the nationalisation of Northern Rock. The Treasury Committee reported on that as well, of course, and I think our reports complemented the PAC report well. I have never taken the view that the Northern Rock affair was necessarily a forerunner of the disaster that we have seen unfold since. Northern Rock was not, in the jargon, a casino bank; unfortunately, however, it had access to the casino and it was that access that greatly assisted its downfall. Very early on, the FSA, if not the Bank of England, identified Northern Rock as one of the legendary outriders, operating way beyond the general mass of its competitors and going far out on a limb. However, had that bank undertaken some de-leveraging and sorted out some of its wholesale contracts and so on, I think it would have had a fighting chance of avoiding failure and subsequent nationalisation.</p>

I am not certain whether success is defined now or what Goldman Sachs is likely to receive by way of a success fee. Nationalisation is one thing, but if the public are to get some success out of Northern Rock, some hard work needs to be done. It is not just a matter of paying Goldman Sachs some sort of success fee, based, no doubt, on its view of what constitutes success.</p>

Some good work has been done on that, particularly by the Building Societies Association. I hope that the Treasury, the Public Accounts Committee, or both will consider the possibility that value for money for the public may be gained from more than the financial repayment of the support Northern Rock was given. If Northern Rock was returned to the market as a mutual, it could be a catalyst for the revitalisation and expansion of the marketplace for financial companies-banks and mutuals. Our aim could be not only to get Northern Rock back into the market and to get back some of our money, but to use it as a means of kick-starting a renaissance in the mutual sector.

Whoever serves on the Committee, they will be providing a valuable service to this country and to the enormous number of people who feel very let down in many ways.

 We can assume that this will be the final debate about the reports and activities of the Public Accounts Committee before the election, which will probably be on 6 May next year, I understand.

to work for up to six months until the election and there will be matters to report on during that period. We need to keep up the pressure on government to improve performance which these six-monthly debates give us. This is our one voice that is heard more widely than our mere Committee hearings and reports, and we should use it to the maximum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09102229000594">As befits a deferential member of the Committee, I agree absolutely with our Chairman, the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). He gave a commanding overview of what we have reported, and he pointed out the serious savings that, based on our reports, can and should be made. The Committee has identified a number of failures that if rectified would produce serious money that could be used for other things which, if implemented, as I hope they will be, would provide better government and a more efficient public service. We need to keep up the pressure, rather than say that we will abandon it now to go into the wild fields of electioneering, with all the media exaggeration of what can and cannot be saved. Today I am perfectly happy to echo the hon. Gentleman, and to take time out of my own campaign to retain Great Grimsby as a Labour seat to back him and the Committee's efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09102229000595">Being a member of a Select Committee is generally one of the few delights of a Back Bencher's somewhat dreary and pressured existence, but being a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) said is the oldest-and certainly the best-Committee, is the best part of the job. It has been a sheer pleasure to be on the Committee and see so much of the inner workings and possible failures of government, so I congratulate the Chairman on his chairing of the Committee and his summary today of our performance. With that grovelling servility, I shall move on to my own remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09102229000596">These debates are a chance to establish an overview of the Committee and the failures in government that it points up. At the Public Accounts Commission the day before yesterday, I was delighted to hear that that is also the intention of the new Comptroller and Auditor General. He wants to develop a system for bringing out the common patterns of failures and weaknesses in the public services. I hope that that will ultimately produce a manual of mistakes that have been made, which will be an invaluable practical teaching guide, particularly for the training of civil servants. It will also be valuable to us, as a Committee, in letting us know what to look for in terms of the common patterns of failure and chief weaknesses. That will put our debate on a very practical level as opposed to the emotive comment and populist onslaught from the media, who take minor failures, exaggerate them as if they were general practice and then denounce the entire machine-the civil service and Government Departments-for failing to take account of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09102229000597">That emotive level of debate is not an appropriate one for us: our job is to find the common patterns of failure and to eliminate them. That will become even more necessary as the recession increases the importance of Government intervention. From my point of view politically, the problem is not big government, as the Leader of Opposition has identified it-it is not about the scale of government but about the efficiency of government. Bigger government is inevitable as the only way of coping with a recession and economic difficulties.  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>22 Oct 2009 : Column 1114</b><br>
Our job, as a Committee, is not to argue about the scale of government but to make it more efficient and to see that it functions economically and effectively to serve the purposes of the public. We are not part of the populist argument, but we are an invaluable tool. The real need is not for bigger or smaller government but for efficient government and an efficient public service, which will itself be more economical, as our Chairman said, and save an enormous amount of money for the wider purposes of government, giving more satisfaction to the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09102229000598">I want to concentrate on the pattern of common failures and weaknesses in government that are responsible for a lot of the opprobrium in which Government Departments can be held. I am interested in the notion of the continuous grinding away of efficiency savings year by year whereby we can count on a certain amount for, say, this year. That is often responsible for fairly disastrous failures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09102229000599">At the Rural Payments Agency, for instance, the efficiency savings led to the firing of public servants and a diminution of the role of the RPA just as it hit the crisis of rural payments and the common agricultural policy, and it had to re-employ people to do the job and provide the knowledge that the fired civil servants had provided. That is not efficiency, but gross incompetence. This is not just about relying on a grinding process of efficiency savings-we need an invigilation of the processes to ensure that they are effective instead of imposing a general restraint on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09102229000600">Let me give my view of the common problems. First, there is the propensity to spend huge sums on consultancy payments, largely to the big accountancy houses, which under this Government have grown fat on enormous contracts. Admittedly, I slightly exaggerated in our last debate when I gave the figure in billions rather than millions of pounds; I do not suppose that it is possible retrospectively, at a six-month remove, to correct <i> Hansard</i>. However, whether it is millions or billions, these sums are still huge and unjustifiable. It is an abdication of responsibility by Ministers, who formulate a policy and get it sanctioned by a consultancy report without giving the civil service-the senior civil service, in particular-its normal role in policy formulation, which is to encourage, to advise and to warn. It becomes a coalition of Ministers and consultants who justify the policy on the basis of consultancy reports and then use them to argue in its favour. However, those consultancy reports are often ineffective and they are all an expensive way of anointing and sanctifying particular projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09102229000601">Many of the reports have been inadequate-we heard of an example in our hearings just this Monday as part of our inquiry into Metronet. Tens of millions of pounds were spent with Freshfields, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other big consultancy houses for auditing the contracts, giving advice on them and ensuring that they were okay. At the end of it all, despite all the advice and what it cost, the contract with Metronet effectively bombed. It was not valid or effective. It did not provide the Department for Transport with a means of controlling output or performance, or really with any role in performance at all. It was partly responsible for the failure of the Metronet project and the fact that the Government had to pay £1.7 billion in the four years before that failure. That should have been the sum of the payments over the full life of the contract. It was a big expenditure of  <br>

public money-more than £400 million effectively wasted -because of inadequate corporate governance and oversight, and because the contract itself was not an effective way of maintaining control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09102229000602">That is the situation all too often. We get advice from consultants, who are not then held accountable for the failure that they should have anticipated. There needs to be more effective oversight, and not just by the Committee, because our oversight is posthumous. The money is gone by the time we come to deal with it. We try to close stable doors after horses have bolted at enormous expense. Oversight should perhaps be provided by the Office of Government Commerce, which needs a stronger and more effective role than that of an advice service or the toehold of accountancy houses in Government so that they can push their case for contracts. It should have an audit and control role over those contracts, and it should ensure that performance is adequate. If it is not, it should demand sanctions and penalties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09102229000603">The same is true of IT contracts. All too often, Departments seem incapable of dealing with the wily stratagems and sales patter of consultancy salesmen, particularly from the big houses, who offer expertise, but over-praise the product in question and forecast that it can do more than it actually can. Departments, in turn, try to set too many objectives to be accomplished, which always leads to failure in IT contracts. When we try to do more with an IT system than it can bear, it inevitably breaks down and performs inadequately. There is failure on both sides, on the part of the Department and the salespeople.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09102229000604">We see that problem in various reports before us. Implementation of the defence information infrastructure programme is running 18 months late. We recommend that the Ministry of Defence should ask its contractor ATLAS to monitor and report regularly on the health of legacy systems and develop contingency plans for each system, funded by the management fee that it receives. That is an explicit criticism, but it is too late. The matter should have been overseen by the OGC and the MOD itself when the contract was agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09102229000605">The hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) will no doubt wax eloquent about the NHS national programme for IT, as he has so often in the past. Here is a contract, however, that is so curious that it is inexplicable to me. Our report showed that the care records service is at least four years behind schedule. Of the original four local service providers-the main suppliers responsible for implementing systems at local level-only two remain. The others have dropped out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09102229000606">The Government have found that while they can direct NHS trusts and primary care trusts to take the systems, they have no such power over foundation trusts, even though the system would generate substantial benefits for patients. Therefore, foundation trusts have not participated, which pulls the plug, in my view, on the whole system. That is another example of a contract that was not adequately thought through or adequately audited right at the start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09102229000607">The Government were trying to do too much with the systems, which were over-sold. Departments need better advice to put them on a more secure and effective platform for controlling the suppliers of the IT systems  <br>

they deal with. As the Chairman said, no taxpayer pound should be the source of easy profit. That is an absolute maxim. However, in consultancy and IT services, the taxpayer pound has been a source of far-too-easy profits. We need to control that, exact penalties where necessary and blacklist firms that are over-selling in that fashion to see that they do not make the same profits and mistakes in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="91022-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09102229000608">The third common factor that we point out and which I derived from the reports we are dealing with today is that the Government do not think through their purposes or the difficulties of achieving their objectives clearly enough. Because they are an idealistic Government, and because my party is idealistic, they are a Government of impulsive gestures-"We will do so and so!" The gestures come from the heart, which is okay-most of my gestures come from the heart; it is just that I am less competent than I assume the Government to be-but the consequences of implementation are not thought through. If projects fail, it increases public alienation and cynicism about the Government's purposes and objectives.</p>

too many means, none of which make enough of an impact to achieve the objective. That is the third common pattern of weakness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000617">I also include tax credits, which have been the subject of a long series of considerations by the Committee and the NAO. Tax credits were well intentioned. It was right to put money in the pockets of less well-off working people and to pay it to them directly through the tax system. But because of the excessively strict rules on which the Treasury insisted, the system was inflexible. The earnings of people who are in and out of work fluctuate wildly, and the result is overpayments or underpayments, and poor families end up facing demands for enormous sums that they cannot possibly pay back in the time allowed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="09102229000618"><a name="91022-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="09102229001269"><b>Mr. Breed:</b>
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's analysis is shared by us all, but does he agree that part of the problem is that face-to-face meetings have almost been abolished, due to the use of IT, so people cannot sit down and go through their details with someone? When people are trying to sort out their tax credits, they have to go through up to four different offices, never speaking to the same person more than once. Trying to sort the problem out has been vastly too expensive and protracted, and has only increased the agony and stress of the people the tax credits were designed to help.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The tax credit system has been combined with the dreaded efficiency savings, which have led to the closure of offices in Manchester and Bristol, and the concentration of services in Birmingham. Grimsby has lost the ability to conduct face-to-face meetings. The Child Support Agency is another case in point. It tried to provide face-to-face meetings through regional facilities, which quickly failed. A particular problem with the tax credits is that MPs have a hotline, and direct access, but the public do not. People want the system to be explained to them, so what they can apply for is explained to them and what they cannot apply for is justified. That cannot be combined with efficiency savings that reduce the staffing levels of HMRC offices up and down the country.</p>

People want face-to-face advice, but increasingly they have to obtain advice through the internet or on the telephone. That is not an adequate approach to dealing with a sector of society that does not have the greatest understanding of the system-I do not, and they certainly do not-and how to work it. In all these instances, the failure to think through how to implement the Government's good intentions more effectively is a major weakness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000624">Another of our difficulties is that we are deal with everything posthumously. We are trying to close the stable doors after the horse has bolted; we are dealing not with the people who caused the problem, but with their successors, who naturally come along, profess every good intention and promise that it will not happen again. They go away and, in the main, implement our reports, but if we cannot get the perpetrators, it is a very unsatisfactory way to proceed. We got them once on an issue concerning the Rural Payments Agency, and it was very illuminating, but we did that only after exceptional effort. It should be part of our routine that we are able to speak to the people directly responsible for the problems.</p>

We also need wider access to bodies. As the Chairman of the Committee said, it is ludicrous that we cannot cover a major spender such as the BBC, which would be less criticised for being over-grandiose and imperialistic in its ambitions to run everything if it gave the assurance that it would be effectively audited by the Committee and the NAO. That would guarantee that BBC spending was efficient, effective and welcome.</p>

I do not particularly want to remove the glitter that surrounds the civil list-I have lost my earlier enthusiasm there-but Buckingham palace, in its attempt to explain to us exactly what was involved in the maintenance and repairs at the palace, missed a good opportunity: we were invited along, but not given any food, which did not produce the best and most welcoming mood. I did not go for that very reason. If we were not to be fed, I did not want to know, although perhaps that was selfish on my part. As an ambitious over-eater, going to the palace would have satisfied my social-climbing ambitions, but not my culinary ambitions. We should certainly cover the civil list, but I say that with no great enthusiasm.</p>

The NAO has a big staff; its work is welcome and important, and its staff are very good-I am constantly impressed with them. However, we need a Committee staff to fill in the gaps between the NAO reports and our inquiries. Those are often media gaps: what has the debate centred on since the NAO reported, which quite often happens a few months before we deal with a given matter? What is the measure of public opinion? What have the media been saying about the issue? What has <i> Private Eye</i>-often a valuable source of information-been saying? What has happened in the Departments concerned since the report? Addressing those issues would allow us to make more effective and trenchant inquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09102229000632">However, I would like first to say a quick word about the Comptroller and Auditor General, whom we were pleased to see in his post and giving evidence recently about the NAO strategy. He said something in the new strategy that I thought was particularly interesting. It is quite obvious that his beady eye has been caught by the fact that permanent secretaries have to sign statements of internal control. That sounds pretty anorakish-perhaps because it is-but it is important, because it means that permanent secretaries have to write, in their own blood, that they have no reason to believe that their control systems are not up to the job in hand of controlling the resources of their Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09102229000633">Depending on how the NAO treats it, that is potentially a serious thing for permanent secretaries to be saying, and it is clear that the new Comptroller and Auditor General intends to hold them to their word. Indeed, in its new strategy, which runs from 2010-11 to 2012-13, the NAO has been quite explicit that:</p>
<a name="91022-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="09102229000872"><ul><p class="tabletext">"public bodies need to be confident that the resources for which they are responsible are appropriately managed and controlled."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09102229000634">The strategy continues:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para26"><a name="09102229000641">That brings me neatly to the national programme for information technology in the health service. That was the subject of our second report, which was published on 27 January 2009. Members will know that the programme is now expected to cost £12.7 billion, although the original figure that was floated was £2.3 billion. It went up to £6.2 billion, then it became £12.4 billion, and now it is £12.7 billion. In a nutshell, the central problem is that, in the entire period since its inception, no serious public work has been done to compare what is to be delivered by the programme with the original output-based specification in the contract-not least because the contracts are all secret and we cannot see what they say. If such a comparison were to be done, it would show an enormous gap between the two. It was only the extremely high ambition of the output-based specification that justified the enormous cost of the programme in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para27"><a name="09102229000642">Over the years, the programme has been steadily de-scoped further and further-in many cases, behind the backs of NHS managers-so that, one day, the providers will be able to say, "Look, we've delivered, and it's a success. We've achieved our objective." It will not be the original objective, however. These actions make it extremely difficult to compare the outcomes with the original objective, but some of us remember that objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="91022-0014.htm_para37"><a name="09102229000652">The fact is that there has not been a single deployment of Lorenzo in 2009, and there has not even been a plan to have a single deployment of it. The reason is that the handful of deployments attempted have been an absolute mess, causing chaos in the hospitals where they were tried.

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para0"><a name="09102229000653">I tabled a question yesterday about the number of hospital trusts where Lorenzo has been partially deployed, asking how many users-how many concurrent users-of Lorenzo there are. I look forward to the answer, but the Exchequer Secretary will not need to consult the written answer that has not yet been written to know that the answer is not very many. It is literally just a handful, which means that the cost per user is not what one would expect. If one was deploying a software system in an acute hospital with 3,000 to 4,000 workers, one might expect that the cost per user would be a few hundred pounds per user per year, but the cost is going to be many hundreds of thousands-possibly even more than a million-pounds per user per year. How that is consistent   <br>

with conclusion No. 15-with the Treasury saying that it does not accept that the programme fails to provide value for money-I simply do not understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000654">It is not just that Lorenzo is not working. The other system produced by the other main company involved-the Cerner Millennium system-has also caused absolute havoc where it has been deployed. Barts hospital has been forced more or less to its knees because of the Cerner Millennium system. Back in March this year, it suspended its 18-week reporting-one of its obligations, saying it expected to resume them in September. It did not do so, and by the beginning of this October it had a backlog of 23,000 breaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000655">We could talk about missed targets, but what really matters is that patients are being kept waiting longer than they should-in some cases, for longer than six months-because the hospital is unable to manage its information as a result of struggling with that dreadful system. As a consequence-it gets worse-the hospital is to be fined £400,000 a month by its primary care trust, NHS Tower Hamlets. This hospital already has a deficit of £6.7 million. That is no reflection on the clinical work done at Barts hospital, some of which is absolutely outstanding-world class, with no question about it. Yet having a system that does not work properly foisted on it is hampering its ability to continue to be a world-class hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000656">I am afraid that it gets still worse. Under the terms of the contract that the NHS has signed with the local service provider, BT, to deploy Cerner Millennium in the south of England, if the NHS fails to deliver four new greenfield sites that are ready and willing to take the Cerner Millennium product, it will be liable to pay BT £44 million. If all goes well, the Department of Health will pay £73 million to BT for installing Cerner Millennium in four hospital trusts in the south, but not if those trusts baulked at taking the software-they would, of course, be quite right to do so because it does not work. What is more, the Treasury tells them that they do not have to take it, as note No. 16 of the Treasury minutes states:</p>
<a name="91022-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="09102229000887"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Trusts will not be expected to take the systems until they work effectively".</p>

 I am afraid that the answer is extremely hard to find. The Government will say that value for money has been obtained precisely because the original contract required that suppliers were not to be paid until they had delivered, but the position is not quite as simple as that. In some instances suppliers have been paid by the back door in respect of other programmes, and it is therefore difficult to see where they have made money and where they have lost it. I have little doubt that suppliers have lost a lot of money, but I would much rather see them offer the NHS something that it wants and be paid a reasonable profit in return than see patients kept waiting, hospital waiting lists in a complete mess, and hospitals unable to tell whether they have sent cancer patients messages with the results of their oncology tests. I would much rather see something that actually worked and produced value for money.</p>

If he is able to find a further £4 billion in savings, perhaps over the next six months, we should all be extremely grateful. I had been going to say that it would be even better if he could find £175 billion in savings, but in fact he helpfully told us where further large-scale savings to the tune of £9 billion might be found.

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09102229000676">My hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) spoke with his customary forensic skills and fluency and outlined important changes-I will have to read his comments carefully-as to how the NAO will effect better financial controls in Government Departments, which sound like they are welcome. He also said some important words about the culture of  the civil service and on working to change attitudes in the public sector in the present environment to focus more on efficiency; getting more for less, as the leader of my party put it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09102229000677">My hon. Friend then launched a devastating critique of the NHS IT contract and its moving goalposts in terms of objectives and what has been delivered in a project that will come to symbolise Government waste as whole over the past 12 years. His examination of the details of the failings and the Treasury's failure to get a grip, as well as the astonishing consequences for frontline NHS services, should be compulsory reading for all Treasury and Department of Health Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09102229000678">I mentioned the apparent lack of enthusiasm of Labour and Liberal Democrat members for debating the Government's earlier motion on securing the recovery. I note that, in this debate, there has been no Liberal Democrat speaker from the Back Benches and only one Back-Bench Labour speaker; although the hon. Member for Great Grimsby can hardly be described normally as a pro-Government speaker. It is a great pity that in a full day to debate first the economy and then the public finances, there has been almost no contribution from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09102229000679">Several themes have emerged today, but all against a common backdrop. No one in this Chamber can fail to be aware of the woeful state of the public finances. The deficit this year is projected to reach round about £175 billion; £14.8 billion was borrowed in September alone, the highest figure on record. September's borrowing brings net debt to a staggering £824.8 billion and means that debt as a percentage of GDP increased by 2.5 per cent. in just one month, to 59 percent using the Treasury's own figures. To put it another way, the Government are currently borrowing £500 million a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09102229000680">To see the seriousness of the situation we are all faced with, we only have to open the inside back page of <i> The Economist</i> and note that of the 42 countries in the magazine's tables, Britain has the worst budget deficit of all, currently estimated to be heading to about 14 per cent. of GDP. That is twice what it was coming out of the last two recessions. The work of the Committee becomes ever more relevant in such a context, and its reports will prove a valuable resource for the next Government, of whichever party.</p>

Perhaps this was an unconscious effect of their verbal trick of labelling all spending as investment and regarding it as an automatic good irrespective of frameworks and controls, and sometimes irrespective of ends. Whatever the cause, there has certainly been a pattern of failure to ask the right questions or to draw the right lessons from mistakes, and the reports before us today provide further evidence to support this view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09102229000682">Collecting the stack of documents from the Vote Office, one ended up with a veritable armful of reading after a slightly hassled clerk had fished out each of the 27 reports-I think that is the right number. As many Members have suggested, the large number of reports presents a dilemma as they all contain insights into their objects of inquiry but it is impossible to comment on all of them. I will focus on some of the reports that particularly interested me, but I shall be as comprehensive as possible in the available time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09102229000683">A number of reports focused on defence. After both the roll call of those who died in the service of our country over the summer months and the general debate last week, the House has been particularly aware of defence matters since it returned from the recess. There are four reports on the Ministry of Defence before us. One has a particular bearing on the situation of our troops in Afghanistan, and all have some relevance in the debate over resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09102229000684">The Chinook helicopter provides crucial heavy-lift capacity for the Army. It played a battlefield role in the Falklands war and has done so ever since. The current versions were ordered in 1995, in what the PAC described five years ago as one of the worst examples of equipment procurement it had ever seen. The latest report on the eight Chinook Mk 3 helicopters suggests the delays are abysmal "even"-that is the Committee's telling phrase-by the MOD's standards. The Committee says:</p>
<a name="91022-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="09102229000890"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The absence of these helicopters has meant that British troops in Afghanistan have had to make do with fewer helicopters, make an increased number of dangerous journeys by road and, due to the specialist nature of the Mk3, rely on heavily modified Mk2 helicopters for use on high risk special operations."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09102229000685">Further, the night enhancement package referred to at the end of the assessment is, as the Committee discovered, still regarded as a key safety risk by Joint Helicopter Command.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para28"><a name="09102229000686">It is shameful that our soldiers have died from roadside bombs when additional helicopter support might have prevented the need for some of the road journeys they undertook and that our troops continue to undertake as we speak. While the Government can, and do, point to other measures they have taken since, that cannot alter the fact that our forces would be safer were it not for a series of Whitehall blunders, many of which have been examined by the PAC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para29"><a name="09102229000687">Even the abandonment of the "fix to field" project, a decision taken to accelerate additional lift capacity, led to a 70 per cent. increase in the costs of the successor reversion scheme. The Government dispute the Committee's claim that this was due to inadequate analysis and lack of consultation with Boeing, but an impression of hurried misjudgement remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para30"><a name="09102229000688">The departmental response also seems reluctant to accept the MOD's tendency to over-modify what are intended to be off-the-shelf purchases, or the extent to which the pursuit of perfection on paper leads to defects, delays and cost overruns in practice. While they may sometimes be unavoidable, modifications of contracts run a high risk of undoing the advantages that off-the-shelf procurement can offer, and the attitude displayed is worrying. When our country is at war and lives are being sacrificed, it is damning to know that equipment shortages and deficiencies could have been avoided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para31"><a name="09102229000690">Almost the only encouraging note in the entire Chinook report is the reported 20 per cent. increase in flying hours resulting from joint work with Boeing on maintenance procedures. Better use of our existing assets will be essential in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The capabilities review that my Front-Bench colleagues have outlined is just one aspect of the Conservative response to these problems.</p>

<a name="91022-0015.htm_brev4"><a name="09102229000891"><ul><p class="tabletext">"In the last year, the 20 biggest projects suffered a further £205 million of cost increases, and 96 months additional slippage... Total slippage stands at over 40 years".</p>

Projects are not mysterious entities, and basic causes of project failure are the same whether projects are defence-related or civil, public or private. Yet again and again in the pages of these reports we read about over-optimism and poor controls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="91022-0015.htm_para34"><a name="09102229000693">The report on the defence information infrastructure system is a case in point. The project was 18 months late at the time of publication as a result of fundamental weaknesses in planning. This huge project is replacing separate systems ranging from those within Whitehall to the onboard systems on Royal Navy ships. The cost was last estimated at £7.1 billion, and some 150,000 terminals are involved, yet assumptions were made on the basis of "totally inadequate research", the timetable was too ambitious and no pilot was undertaken before rolling out the implementation. Like so many Government IT projects-I will discuss the NHS IT system shortly-this one has come unstuck, and is 18 months behind schedule. It should not be necessary for PAC reports to have to include among its recommendations such basic advice as the following:</p>
<a name="91022-0015.htm_brev5"><a name="09102229000892"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Where accurate information is not available, assumptions should be prudent and cautious."</p>

seem to be leaving all the difficult choices to a future Government. If their intimations of the future come to pass, our priority would be to introduce a much more rigorous and commercial approach. The Department must learn from complex civil programmes if it is to have any hope of completing projects on time and to budget. We believe that greater commercial discipline is the only way to deal with the management of vital and expensive military programmes, and it is essential that industry is brought into the process at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000696">As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough also outlined, there are more encouraging signs from the Ministry of Justice and the Office of Government Commerce in respect of regular procurement from within the Prison Service-we are very pleased by that-which achieved cash savings of £120 million in the 2007-08 period under review. The Committee claims its share in that success and with some justification, as was acknowledged by the witnesses in its evidence session. The critical 2003 PAC report was used as the starting point for the reforms, which are now being implemented across the MOJ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000697">The use of online catalogues and procurement teams to make better use of the purchasing power of the service as a whole holds lessons beyond that one Department. The potential savings from allowing units within and across Departments access to each other's contracts are significant, and do not appear to have been driven forward by the Office of Government Commerce to the extent that they should. Prices and service levels negotiated by one become available to all, and low-volume purchasers benefit from the advantages of high-volume supply. That is an important way in which costs can be brought down-we will all have to pay more attention to this-in some cases dramatically, while also improving quality. The Department's response indicates that it offered to participate in OGC workshops and training events. On the basis of the Committee's evidence, I hope that that has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000698">The OGC's record on contract management is the subject of another of today's PAC reports. As it records, central Government spend more than £12 billion annually on IT and other service contracts, and there are some basic concerns. Of those contracts, 56 per cent. had no associated contingency plan for supplier failure whereas 28 per cent. had no documented management plan at all. Worse, the report goes on to state:</p>
<a name="91022-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="09102229000893"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Of the contract managers surveyed...25 per cent. of those responsible for contracts that had been running for at least three years had undertaken no value for money testing of ongoing services. And 41 per cent. of contract managers had not tested the value for money of new services."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09102229000699">The OGC's responsibilities are secondary, as it is obviously the Departments that provide the management. However, it accepts a long list of areas for improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000700">The oral evidence provided by the OGC's chief executive to the PAC at least seems to demonstrate understanding of what is required. As the Committee concluded, however, until Departments' behaviour changes, incidents such as the SATs testing fiasco are likely to recur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000701">Let me move on to the national health service information technology fiasco.

surprisingly mild in the circumstances, although the facts speak for themselves. Most of the mistakes were made before 2006-before the period under scrutiny today-but there remains the question of whether the Government are throwing good money after bad. There are real doubts about the ongoing viability of the programme and one of the Committee's recommendations is to allow trusts to put forward applications for central funding to develop alternative systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000702">Incredibly, in rejecting that recommendation, the Department of Health stated that it does</p>

 I was interested to hear what my hon.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Government have, at their peril, underestimated their power in negotiating these contracts and ironing out details of them.

The strong financial performance of CDC notwithstanding, it cannot be right that the chief executive of a company that is wholly owned by the taxpayer received an increase in pay of nearly £600,000 in a space of just four years. It is extremely hard to justify total pay of around £1 million when one has complete job security and, despite the fact that the Department has tried to make comparisons with the private sector, when one does not have to compete for capital to invest. We have drawn attention to excessive pay in quangos, and this appears to be a parallel case.</p>

To the Government's credit, the departmental responses to the indictments in the PAC's reports on schools acknowledge that too few people possess the key skills.

 It is an enormous pleasure to respond to the debate on behalf of the Government. As the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said and the hon.

I am no stranger to public accounts debates, either: by looking back in <i> Hansard</i>, I confirmed that I attended and spoke in the debates on 26 January 2006 and 18 July 2006; and, after leaving the PAC on becoming Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon.

We all know that Ministers make decisions in good faith-that was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)-but, of course, that is not the end of the story. If those decisions are not implemented effectively, it undermines both the policy and the Government's relationship with the people. That is why the Government have increasingly emphasised policy delivery-actually doing what we said we would do. Today's debate has again emphasised not only the wide-ranging nature of the Committee's work, but the fascinating insight it gives its members into the way government works. As a former member of the Committee, I can attest to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09102229000720">The Committee builds on a great, long and proud tradition of ensuring that public moneys are properly accounted for and provide value for money, and that the appropriate lessons can be learned when reports are produced. In these times when money is tight, as many speakers mentioned, it is even more important to ensure that we get the best value for money for every pound spent. That is where the Committee keeps Government up to the mark. I have just seen the letter from the hon.

highlights in his letter, nor do I wish to anticipate what we might say in our response to it, but I shall give a couple of examples. In financial management, where the hon. Gentleman highlights back-office costs, the Government have targeted savings of some £4 billion through standardisation and shared services; and in public sector procurement, we expect to achieve savings of some £7.7 billion through the operational efficiency programme. We all acknowledge that there is more to do, however. We shall examine with interest the specific examples in the hon. Gentleman's letter, and respond to his comments.</p>

 On the point about shared services, will the Exchequer Secretary always bear in the back of her mind, if not the front, the Committee's report on shared services in the Department for Transport? That was the project that cost about double the amount it was supposed to save and the computer spoke to people in German.</p>

 I am sure that that will be borne in mind when we are looking at the use of shared services. When considering how we can improve procurement, a one-size-fits-all process does not work. In discussions with one of the officials taking over procurement, it was made clear to me that, when looking at outside procurement, one sometimes has to take into account local factors that can deliver better value for money, rather than just look at the matter across the piece. That is certainly something that I take very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09102229000724">We know that some 90 per cent. of Committee recommendations are accepted by Departments. That shows that the process of investigation by the National Audit Office, Committee hearings and Committee reports are useful. Departments improve as a direct result of the investigative process: for example, in its 13th report,  the Committee acknowledged that the Department for Work and Pensions' handling of customer complaints' had significantly improved since the 2005 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09102229000725">Many reports are critical, but what is good about the Committee is that, even in a critical report, it gives credit where credit is due. It was therefore helpful that in its 18th report, which a couple of hon. Members have mentioned, the Committee acknowledged that the Commonwealth Development Corporation had performed well, outperforming the market while investing in poor countries, since the Department for International Development restructured it in 2004. The Committee acknowledged also that, since taking over from the Strategic Rail Authority, the Department for Transport had, in letting rail franchises, delivered to planned time scales and protected taxpayer interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09102229000726">The Government's perspective on accountability has inevitably been coloured by recent events in Parliament and elsewhere, and those have placed increased emphasis on the need for public accountability from all public institutions and public servants. There is a greater awareness of the value of transparency in underpinning confidence in the use of powers under which public authorities operate. It has rapidly become essential to justify the trust placed in public organisations that use public resources of all kinds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09102229000727">A real public interest is at stake, too. Some people, in Parliament and elsewhere, perceive genuine value in demonstrating that public powers are used as they are  <br>

intended. The Government, and other public authorities with which they work, can gain stature and public support only if they show themselves willing to account for their stewardship honestly and responsibly. We are all now even more conscious of the need for probity in the use of public funds. Trustworthy public audit is the best way to make people confident, all-round, that the right standards are being achieved and maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09102229000728">The NAO's role is unique in providing that assurance, and that is why it is important that the Comptroller and Auditor General be able to audit central Government bodies. The CAG's sphere of influence has grown over the years, and it has recently been extended to a number of central Government companies. When new central Government bodies are set up, the Government now expect the CAG to become their external auditor. If the CAG does not, there must be a good reason why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09102229000729">I am pleased to say that the Treasury has been at the forefront of such moves, ensuring, for example, that United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd, the company that was set up to manage the Government's shareholding in banks, is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

 The Minister is praising transparency at UKFI, so will she tell the House why Ministers continually refuse to answer parliamentary questions about the Government's substantial bank holdings, saying that the service is managed at arm's length from the Government and, therefore, the details cannot be made available to Parliament? Surely, if the Minister believes in full transparency, there should be full answers to hon. Members' questions.</p>

 It is important that our holdings in those banks be managed commercially and, as such, by UKFI at arm's length. The point that I was trying to make was that UKFI will be audited by the CAG, setting the precedent whereby we believe that the CAG is the right person for the role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para30"><a name="09102229000732">The hon. Member for Gainsborough made a cogent case for auditing a range of public bodies, and the Government agree that it is in the public interest that statutory authorities demonstrate that they provide value for money. The NAO has a valuable role to play in delivering transparency and accountability, so I am pleased to announce today that the Financial Services Authority has decided to appoint the CAG as its financial auditor from the next financial year, 2010-11. That will enable the Public Accounts Committee to receive and investigate reports into aspects of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the FSA's performance. I welcome that decision and believe that it can only enhance the FSA's standing and enable it to show how well it discharges its business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="91022-0016.htm_para31"><a name="09102229000733">I assure the House that the Treasury continues to explore opportunities to play a bigger role in delivering transparency and accountability in other bodies that use statutory powers or public funds in the public interest. That must include a full audit of the BBC, as the hon. Gentleman said, and the Government will explore with the BBC how that should be accomplished.</p>

which are not so easy to quantify. He referred to the report on the Chinooks, as did other Members. That episode has been well documented and lessons have been learned, but I think we can all agree that it is important that the aircraft are available as soon as possible. We envisage that the first aircraft will be available for training before the end of this year; I am sure that we would all welcome that.</p>

In that case, there would be plenty of time to rethink the policy.</p>

 It depends on whether the life of the existing hulls can be extended, which is a possibility. If there is an undertaking to obtain new hulls, then yes, the time line is quite tight, but many of us believe that the existing ones are perfectly satisfactory for at least another four years, which would offer that period for further reflection.</p>

 As the policy of the hon. Gentleman's party is not to have Trident at all, I am sure that he is not particularly bothered whether that would leave us with a bit of a gap in procurement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000738">I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments about his bargain rail fares, available on his senior railcard; I look forward to the time when I may get one and take advantage of similar bargains.</p>

We share his concern that costs should be tightly controlled. In fact, in this case the success fee was at the discretion of Her Majesty's Treasury, and none was paid. I want particularly to pick up his point about the mutual sector and the possibility of returning Northern Rock to it, because I want to make it clear that no doors have been closed. Obviously, as a Co-operative MP I am particularly interested in the mutual sector. In our White Paper, "Reforming financial markets", we examined the need for diversity of provision to balance risk across the financial services sector, and how the mutual sector could help to provide that. I am aware of a research paper from Oxford that offers a suggestion on how that could be done. Officials at the Treasury are looking into that, and I would welcome it if the PAC and the Treasury Committee did so too.</p>

For a short time, I overlapped with him on the PAC, so I am well aware of his forensic investigations when he questions witnesses. Today he returned to one of his favourite themes-consultants. When used correctly, consultants can provide great benefits, but we certainly recognise that we can do more to improve value for money. As he knows, we have introduced the consultancy value programme to implement the NAO and PAC recommendations. Our approach is that a business case needs to be made to ensure that consultancy adds value and that consultants are not used in circumstances where civil servants could meet the need, but there will be occasions when the use of expert consultants is the most efficient option. I took his general point about policy decisions needing to be taken in good faith; I picked up on that at the start of my remarks. They also need to be implemented effectively, and that requires effective planning and risk management right from  the start.</p>

He talked about defence expenditure. Before I entered Parliament, I spent my time on the other side, trying to win MOD contracts, managing MOD contracts, and accounting to the MOD for the cost of those contracts, so I have a little insight into that. Changes in requirements and specifications cause the biggest headaches, certainly for the supplier, and probably for the MOD as well. Moreover, our armed services obviously want the latest and best equipment, and that causes pressure and tension. Again, it comes back to the need for effective planning at the start and effective project management. The newly formed defence acquisition reform project is currently working on the matter and addressing the recommendations of the Gray report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000744">We all acknowledge that the NHS IT project is hugely ambitious and that it is essential that we get it right. It is obvious to everybody that many challenges remain. We still believe that Cerner Millennium and Lorenzo will be able to support the NHS in the long term. Local service providers have been set a deadline of the end of November to demonstrate significant progress in the acute sector. They will have to demonstrate that Lorenzo has been successfully deployed by Computer Sciences Corporation across a non-acute site and is on track to be deployed in an acute site by March 2010, and that there is a high degree of confidence in CSC's ability to deploy across the NME-north, midlands and east-area by January 2016. BT will have to have successfully deployed Cerner in an additional acute site, and there must be a high degree of confidence in its ability to deploy across London by October 2015. As set out in the Treasury minute, the Department of Health will provide a note on progress by the end of this year. I shall examine the <i> Hansard</i> record of the detailed points that the hon. Member for South Norfolk made and write to him with a detailed response.</p>

It is not an option for DFID not to work in such environments-the question is how we manage that work.

Those are important, and I would not suggest in any way that they do not matter, but to my mind the provisions to modernise the governance arrangements of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the NAO also have considerable importance. They implement the recommendations of the Public Accounts Commission in its 15th report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09102229000750">As the House knows, the commission wanted to ensure that the CAG had authority to form completely independent judgments about the audits and value-for-money studies conducted by the NAO, while maintaining systems of governance and internal controls consistent with best practice. I believe that the Bill will achieve those aims and set the NAO on a confident course towards even better performance. The new NAO board, which I wish well, should help to guide its staff to stronger and more incisive insights into the use of public funds, and we can all look to benefit from that. I am grateful for the helpful way in which the NAO has assisted the Treasury in getting the provisions right.</p>

our Committee. Again, I will not go through all his comments, but he mentioned the Rural Payments Agency-we are to have another hearing on that agency on Monday. The key point is that the English system was just far too complex compared with the Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and continental systems. That goes back to what the Minister said in her concluding remarks on our generic report about making Whitehall more efficient, reducing complexity and planning carefully.

<p><a name="st_o335"><a name="09102229000768"><a name="91022-0017.htm_spnew3"><a name="09102229001287"><b>Miss Ann Widdecombe (Maidstone and The Weald) (Con):</b>
 I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this important issue in the House tonight. I think that the Adjournment debate on Thursday is your selection, Mr. Speaker-if not, please do not disabuse me-and I am delighted that you have understood the importance of this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para29"><a name="09102229000769">I shall make some rather critical remarks about the UK Border Agency in the course of this debate, so I should first say that I fully recognise the scale of the task that confronts it. I also recognise that it does its best to discharge that task and I have always found its staff perfectly courteous and as helpful as they can be within the rules that they operate. When one meets the immigration officers at airports, they are much more friendly than those po-faced mortals who seize manicure scissors from little old ladies on the rather improbable basis that they might be about to assist Osama bin-Laden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para30"><a name="09102229000770">I do not want to suggest that I think for one moment that the agency is in any way useless or in some way hostile to proper judgments, but it does take completely the wrong approach. Anybody can see that, if they look at the sort of cases that the agency pursues with supreme strictness. In order to meet the multiplicity of targets that the Government have set, it aims at the softest targets, when it should be aiming at those who have eluded it for years, who have abused the system, who are in the country unlawfully, who do not comply with the conditions placed on their stay, or who do not observe their reporting restrictions. They are the people on whom the agency should concentrate. They are, of course, the hardest cases. They are not generally sitting around with their addresses on display. The agency does not pursue them. Instead it spends a disproportionate amount of its time pursuing people who have done the reverse-who have complied with conditions, kept their addresses notified to the agency and have circumstances that other people would recognise as reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para31"><a name="09102229000771">I have three particular cases in my constituency that have come up not over the course of the last year, or the last six months, or even the last couple of months. They have all come up within the last three or four weeks-two of them in a single day at my constituency surgery. That suggests a pretty concentrated effort to up the performance measurements by going for soft targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para32"><a name="09102229000772">When I served on the Select Committee on Home Affairs, one thing that we expressed considerable concern about was the sudden removal of settled persons-persons who had been at an address for a substantial period, had married or had other commitments in this country, were working, or in some cases had even obtained property, and whose whereabouts were beyond all reasonable doubt. The Committee felt that where people had become citizens of substance, so to speak, they should at least be given proper notice before being seized and deported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para33"><a name="09102229000773">If the Border Agency deports somebody, that is a tick in a box, but there is a difference between deporting somebody who has been steadily eluding detection, and  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>22 Oct 2009 : Column 1140</b><br>
deporting somebody who has an appeal outstanding, who has been observing reporting restrictions or who has explained why he is still in the country. Suddenly removing that person will come as a considerable shock not only to them, but to their family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para34"><a name="09102229000774">One of the cases I shall raise tonight is just such a case. It concerns a deportation order served on somebody who had faithfully observed his reporting restrictions. He arrived to report and was immediately arrested, put in a detention centre and deported soon after. I do not object to such action being taken against somebody who is, so to speak, underground or in deliberate defiance of an order, but I do object when it is done to somebody who is obeying orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para35"><a name="09102229000775">The second case concerns a woman who has been married to a British citizen for five years, has two British children and has been told that it is the opinion of the Secretary of State that not only she, but her husband and two British children, can continue their lives outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para36"><a name="09102229000776">In the third case, we have an employment issue and a civil penalty. I strongly support, and always have done, both in government and opposition, the contention that the immigration authorities must be very vigilant about employers who take on people who are not entitled to work in this country. However, I again submit that they should be vigilant about employers doing that either deliberately or because they have been careless, and unjustifiably so, and not where an employer has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the person he is engaging is entitled to work. If that person gets indefinite leave to remain, the Border Agency sometimes says, "Ah, there was a gap between the two when the person was no longer entitled to work, so we will inflict the maximum penalty, and we will not reduce it, even a little, in recognition of the fact that the employer acted wholly in good faith." Given the economic position, £5,000 of civil penalty is quite an imposition on a small employer, so it should never be imposed unless the employer is genuinely and seriously culpable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para37"><a name="09102229000777">I turn now to the detail of the cases. As I have already informed the Minister's office, the person involved in the employment case does not wish to be named. I must therefore refer to him as Mr. K. He runs a small business in my constituency and employed a Mr. J. Mr. J had permission to work here and Mr. K checked the documents upon engaging him. Since that time, Mr. J has paid tax and national insurance throughout, and he has recently been granted indefinite leave to remain. He says that he has a letter that both he and Mr. K, his employer, interpreted as meaning that he could continue with his current status-that is, he was entitled to work-until 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="91022-0017.htm_para38"><a name="09102229000778">I should give a little background to the case. When Mr. K took on Mr. J, he photocopied the documents. The Minister will know that it is a Home Office requirement that it is not enough just to look at documents and say, "Yeah, yeah, I saw that this man was entitled to work." Rather, the documents have to be photocopied. That is what Mr. K, being a law-abiding citizen, did. His solicitors explained the position to the Border Agency in a letter dated 26 March 2009, in which they enclosed all the documents that Mr. K had seen and copied before agreeing to employ Mr. J.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09102229000779">One of those documents was a letter dated 26 April 2002, which gave Mr. J exceptional leave to enter the United Kingdom until 26 April 2003. The letter stated:</p>
<a name="91022-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="09102229000899"><ul><p class="tabletext">"provided an applicant has permission to be in the UK when an application"</p>

<a name="91022-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="09102229000900"><ul><p class="tabletext">"is made, he or she is legally entitled to remain here on the same conditions previously granted until the application is decided".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000781">Mr. K, who had photocopied a driving licence, a national insurance record and that letter, understood the letter to mean that Mr. J could remain in the UK and continue to work after 26 April 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000782">However, Mr. K did not leave the matter there. An employer with less of a conscience and less concern to protect his position would simply have signed off at that point, but from time to time Mr. K asked Mr. J how the application was going. He was assured that solicitors were dealing with it and that nothing had changed. He understood that to mean that Mr. J could continue to remain and work. However, it was as a result of making such an inquiry that Mr. J subsequently produced a further letter to Mr. K.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09102229000783">Mr. K believed that, having secured copies of the letters, as well as Mr. J's national insurance number card and provisional driving licence, he was acting wholly within the law. Mr. K then found out that although he can now employ Mr. J, because he has indefinite leave to remain, and was perfectly entitled to employ him when he took him on, there was a period in between in which Mr. J should not have been employed. Mr. K did not realise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000784">I am perfectly happy for there to be a penalty in that case, but I am not happy that it should be £5,000, with no remission whatever for Mr. K's efforts to try to comply with the law. If we are to be bound wholly by the rulebook, with no exercise of discretion and no application of judgment by individual officials of the Border Agency, particularly at the senior level, frankly we might as well do away with human beings altogether. We might as well tap everything into the computer and come out with a mathematical computation of the penalty at the end. In fact, civil servants, whether employed directly in government or out in the agencies, are there to exercise judgment and discretion within the rules that they operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000785">I now come to the second case, which inspired me to ask for this debate. The Minister will be aware from our correspondence how very angry I am about this one. It concerns a constituent who is happy to be named; she is Mrs. Carpenter. My constituent, Mr. R. Carpenter, married an Indonesian national five years ago in her own country. Three years ago, they also married here, because he was particularly keen that the marriage should be recognised in both countries. It is worth pointing out that he did that precisely because he wanted there to be no doubt that this was a subsisting, genuine marriage. He did not want to rely on something that had happened on foreign shores; he made quite certain that he was married according to British law as well. Since that time, the Carpenters have had two children. One is now four, the other is 13-weeks-old. Both those children are British. There is also a 12-year-old Indonesian stepchild.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000786">In recent years, Mr. Carpenter has been working in Singapore and China, but, until July 2003, he was domiciled and working in this country, as he is now. He  <br>

resides in my constituency. As far as I know, there is no law on earth that states that a British citizen who has chosen to work abroad for a few years of his life is obliged to continue to do so if his circumstances change. Any such citizen is fully entitled to return to live and work in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000787">The sequence of events was that, in January this year, the Carpenter family had a major family celebration, which, naturally, they wanted Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter to attend. Obviously, Mr. Carpenter could come and go at will, but, because they had been ex-pats and Mrs. Carpenter had not yet settled here, she required a visitor's visa. She got the visa; there was no problem with that. Before they left Singapore to visit Britain, however, Mr. Carpenter lost his job. They would not, therefore, have the life that they had been enjoying to return to. He has now found a job in this country, and I stress again that we are talking here about a British citizen with British children and a lawful marriage of five years' standing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09102229000788">The Carpenters then applied for Mrs. Carpenter to be allowed to stay in this country. Let me say right away that the reaction of the Border Agency should have been to say, "No. If you are applying to stay here on the basis of marriage, you must leave and apply from outside the country." I have no queries about that approach at all. That is what the agency does, and, had it done so in this case, I would have explained to Mr. Carpenter that, although it might seem harsh, that is what happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000789">Indeed, I have on many occasions had to persuade constituents who were applying to stay here as spouses-sometimes with very long marriages behind them-that they would nevertheless have to leave the country in order to make the application. I once spent three years trying to persuade a lady to go back to the Cameroons. She eventually did so, and got permission to come back here to stay within a few weeks. I understand the rule that someone applying to settle permanently in this country as a spouse must leave the country in order to do so. I have operated that rule myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09102229000790">That is not what the Border Agency said to Mrs. Carpenter, however. Its letter stated:</p>
<a name="91022-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="09102229000901"><ul><p class="tabletext">"You have provided no evidence of strong ties in terms of private life and the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is reasonable to expect all four of you to continue your family life and private lives outside of the United Kingdom."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09102229000791">That is not only inhumane but outrageous. The agency says</p>
<a name="91022-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="09102229000902"><ul><p class="tabletext">"you have provided no evidence of strong ties",</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09102229000792">yet she is married to a British citizen. She has been married to him for five years. She is the mother of two British children who can stay in this country, yet, according to the agency, she has no evidence of strong ties in terms of private life. And the Secretary of State believes it reasonable that "all four of you"-British citizens as well-should continue their family and private lives outside the United Kingdom. Why should they? Are we saying, "Once an ex-pat, always an ex-pat"? The man has a job in this country. I say again that if the Border Agency had merely said, "You would have a good case for staying here as a spouse, but you will have to go outside the country to establish it", I would see no problem with that. The Border Agency did not say  that, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09102229000793">I am aware that Mrs. Carpenter applied to stay here on compassionate grounds, as she was about to give birth. Having given birth, the Border Agency naturally enough said that there were no more compassionate grounds. I understand that, but I will absolutely not accept-and I believe it to be highly challengeable under any human rights legislation, which the Minister knows I do not usually invoke-that any British citizen can be told that "all four of you" can</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09102229000794">That is provocative, cruel and not even particularly lawful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09102229000795">I turn to deal with the third case, the one I raised first in my introduction. It concerns Mohammad Ahmed, who arrived in the UK as a minor more than nine years ago. He claimed asylum, which was refused, and the appeal was dismissed. I view that as perfectly reasonable; I do not argue with it at all. Through various appeals, he has nevertheless managed to stay in the country and he has now been married to a British citizen for two years, living with her for five years before that. He also has a very stable relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09102229000796">As I mentioned in respect of the earlier case, it was understood that if he were to stay here now-not on grounds of asylum, but as a spouse-he would have to leave the country in order to do so. Unfortunately, the country he had to go to was Iraq, but they both accepted that that was the right way forward. They spent a great deal of time, which I am sure the Minister will find perfectly credible, trying to get a passport from the Iraqi embassy. One can understand the situation: this man has been in the country for nine years, having first entered as a minor, and the necessary documentation was not readily available, so he had to try to get recognised as an Iraqi national in order to get his passport. Investigations had to be made, which therefore took some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09102229000797">The Border Agency recognised that these people were at last doing the right thing, so they simply imposed reporting restrictions. At first, it said Mr. Ahmed had to report weekly. As he was working, that was severely disruptive. After I made representations to the Border Agency, it was agreed that he could report monthly and as far as I know, he has faithfully reported monthly ever since. We should remember that he is trying to get a passport out of Iraq. Then, just a couple of weeks ago, he went to report and was immediately seized and taken to Colnbrook. His wife was eventually informed where he was and she began to visit him. Phoning up one morning, she was told that he was being deported that afternoon. He has since gone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09102229000798">I have no doubt that, once again, that is a tick in a box. A deportation has happened; a target has been reached: this is wonderful, and doubtless the Minister will report to the House that more deportations are taking place than ever before. Anyone who looks at those circumstances can see that that was an unreasonable deportation. The man was settled; he was married; he was working. The Border Agency knew where he was, where he lived and where he worked. What it should have done is to have served him with a notice, explaining that he would have to leave the country by such and such a date. Arresting him without any prior warning-  <br>

when, as I say, the Border Agency knew where he was, where he worked and what was going on-was, in my view, heavy handed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09102229000799">The fact that I encountered three cases like that in as many weeks suggests to me that the Border Agency is having a drive, and that what it is driving at is not the difficult targets-the ones that the public really resent-but the easy ones: the people who have done their best to obey the law but find, like my Mr. K, that they are on completely the wrong side of it, despite being thoroughly convinced that they have done everything that was expected of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para26"><a name="09102229000812">About 18 months ago I visited UKBA's offices at Lunar house in Croydon, which were, I believe, in their current configuration. I think that the staff were a bit surprised to find that a Member of Parliament wanted to go to see them. I too was surprised, and disturbed, by what I found. First, I found a young and dedicated team of staff who impressed me a great deal. I thought that they were probably quite poorly managed, and they were certainly struggling under the work load. Their work had been computerised, and they could take me to their computers and show me the latest computerised file on one of my constituents. At the same time, however, they were unable to do anything without resorting to the voluminous physical file that was retained in another room. The other room, at the back of Lunar house-it was like a conference room-was packed with physical files, which were enormous and held together with string and rubber bands. The superficial impressiveness of the computer system was unfortunately rather undone by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para27"><a name="09102229000813">My right hon. Friend spoke of pursuing those who had complied. I have come across such cases on a number of occasions during the four and a half years in which I have been a Member of Parliament. Let me cite one which, although it dates from a while ago, illustrates the phenomenon well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para28"><a name="09102229000814">The events that I am about to describe took place in the summer of 2006, six months before Bulgaria and Romania became full members of the European Union. Although I concede that there are restrictions on citizens of those countries in terms of where they can work and the requirement for them to have work permits, their entitlement to be here was not in doubt after 1 January 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para29"><a name="09102229000815">My constituent worked at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a development bank dedicated to improving the lives of those in central and eastern Europe, and indeed in the former Soviet Union. She was the case officer for Bulgaria. It is probably a good idea for such a person to be a Bulgarian national, as there are unlikely to be enough United Kingdom subjects with a sufficient level of competence or expertise. It seems entirely reasonable that she was in this country working for the EBRD. She had clearly complied, almost precisely to the letter, with everything she had been asked to do. However, she was asked to produce within two weeks an astonishing 30 or 32 documents including fairly obvious things such as her birth certificate and payslips, but also her school reports from Bulgaria. It was entirely unrealistic to expect the production of such documentation from someone who, it seems to me, was perfectly justified in being in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para30"><a name="09102229000816">I contrast that with other cases where clearly the person should not be in this country. I have raised a particular case at Prime Minister's questions. I was astonished to receive a pro forma letter on an immigration case, addressed to me as an MP. The letter stated that, unfortunately, the agency had been unable to determine the case because the person concerned was a member of or was aligned with the beliefs of the al- Qaeda organisation. That was in an immigration letter sent to me as the constituency Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="91022-0018.htm_para31"><a name="09102229000817">The letter went on to apologise not only to me but to the person concerned and his family for any distress and inconvenience caused by taking so long to consider his case.

 I apologise for missing the start of the debate, which started a bit sooner than I expected. Has the hon.

This is where my right hon. Friend's point about resolving the cases of the weakest in society kicks in: these are the cases that are easy to get out of the way quickly in a furious effort to try to reduce the backlog, presumably to meet some central Government-imposed target.</p>

 If only that were so. Some of the easiest cases to resolve are those where a person has become a mum or dad, where there are British children or where there is a relationship with a spouse or parent who is demonstrably British. Those cases are no-brainers. These people cannot and will not be returned to any other country and yet they are told that these cases will not be resolved until 2011. It is heartbreaking and ludicrous. Obviously these people cannot earn money and their documents are tied up. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I congratulate him on his speech, which I support, but if these are the easy things to be done, presumably we are talking about 2014 and 2015 for the other cases.</p>

It cannot do any good to have this number of unresolved cases. As I have said, I have between 700 and 800 unresolved immigration cases at any one time, and I suspect that I am by no means in the premier league of MPs in that regard. This does nobody any favours: it does this country no favours, it does hon. Members no favours, and it certainly does those applying to be in this country no favours either.</p>

constituency matters with her usual diligence? I am grateful that she appreciates the need both to have clear rules and to enforce them, and also for her understanding of the problems that sometimes occur when they are applied to an individual. For Members of Parliament, that becomes more obvious when constituency cases are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09102229000825">The right hon. Lady raised three cases. As she may know, we do not comment on individual cases, but let me give her two commitments. First, my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration, who unfortunately cannot be present, will write to her separately about the specifics of the cases she has raised. Secondly, I will do my best to respond to her general concerns, which have been echoed by Members on both sides of the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09102229000826">The UK Border Agency has recently undergone the biggest shake-up in its history and has coped with not only many legislative changes, but massive organisational ones. Its staff are trained to carry out their duties professionally and impartially, whether when considering applications for visas, asylum or further leave to remain, or when enforcing the immigration laws of this country and removing those who have no right to be here. The public would expect no less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09102229000827">Let me also assure the right hon. Lady and other Members that there is no policy of pursuing soft targets, and that decisions must be made in accordance with the immigration rules. Those decisions are subject to appeal, either in the UK or from abroad, and are therefore scrutinised by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. Asylum decisions are also audited by UK Border Agency quality teams and, in the case of some asylum decisions, independently by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Further to this, the appointment of John Vine as chief inspector of the UK Border Agency provides for an independent, external assessment of the agency in both its UK and overseas dealings.</p>

 The Minister said that the agency does not go for soft targets, but I have to tell him that that is not my experience. Single young men are like the Scarlet Pimpernel in that they move around and are difficult to find, but the agency picks up seven, eight or nine loving families in bed at six o'clock on a Sunday morning. That is what is happening, but not in my name, because it stinks. People experience the trauma of having their doors being banged on at six o'clock in the morning, when everyone knows where they are.

 The Minister spoke about the agency staff having to operate within the rules. At what level do discretion, judgment, compassion and reason enter?</p>

<p><a name="st_o352"><a name="09102229000832"><a name="91022-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="09102229001304"><b>Mr. Campbell:</b>
 Staff are properly trained to work within the rules. Of course there will be some leeway and discrepancy in individual cases, but it is important to ensure that those rules are applied impartially. I am trying to explain that that is necessary not only in the first instance of contact with individuals, but throughout the handling of a case. It is, however, also important to have in place appeal mechanisms, and beyond, to ensure that cases are dealt with reasonably and within the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09102229000833">As for the issue of those who are allowed to work in the UK, it is very important that we have an immigration system that is fit for the 21st century and protects the interests of not only Britain and British people, but foreign nationals who have legally settled here. That is why we introduced and are rolling out the flexible points system, which has the purpose of controlling the number of people coming to the UK from outside Europe and ensuring that they have the skills that this country requires. We cannot allow individuals to circumvent this system once they are already here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09102229000834">The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald is concerned about the implementation of the new civil penalties regime. We know that the way to tackle illegal immigration is to tackle illegal working. The availability of illegal work is often associated with breaches of legislation governing tax, health and safety, and so on, and it can act as an incentive for people to enter and remain in the country unlawfully. The experience of UKBA staff shows that illegal migrant workers tend to be found in jobs and occupations that are often considered unattractive by UK workers because of the hours, wages and working conditions that prevail. As a result, those migrant workers are exploited should they take those jobs on coming into this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09102229000835">That is why we introduced new measures on 29 February 2008 under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 that distinguish between employers with less than adequate recruitment practices and the more serious cases where employers knowingly and deliberately employ illegal migrant workers. The measures include: a system of civil penalties for less diligent employers-I take the right hon. Lady's point about her view of the diligence in the case that she raised; a tough new offence of knowingly employing an illegal migrant worker, which applies to the more serious cases and can carry a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine; and a continuing responsibility on the employers of migrant workers to check their ongoing entitlement to work in the UK. Again, I note the points that right hon. Lady made about that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09102229000836">UKBA takes an intelligence-led approach to operations and will target those whom it believes may not be complying with their obligations. Again, let me be clear that there are no soft targets. UKBA will issue civil penalty notices to any employers should it come across evidence of illegal working. Where evidence exists to show that an individual has been knowingly employing illegal migrant workers, consideration will be given to prosecution, as appropriate. The evidence in respect of  <br>

the notices that have been issued and the potential value in fines shows that we were right to bring in this tough legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09102229000837">Let us consider the second case that the right hon. Lady raised and the general points arising from it. On her concerns about UKBA's application of the immigration rules to individual cases, I should say that the rules lay down the requirements that need to be satisfied by a person who seeks leave to remain as the spouse of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom. The first requirement is that the applicant has limited leave to enter or remain that was given in accordance with any of the provisions of the immigration rules. The only exception to that would be where, as a result of that leave, he or she would not have been in the UK beyond six months from the date on which he or she was admitted to the UK-on this occasion in accordance with the rules. The requirement prevents people admitted to the UK for six months as a visitor from switching into the category of spouse. I understand the particulars of the case that the right hon. Lady has described, but I am trying to set out the background to the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09102229000838">We strongly believe that anyone who is coming to this country with the intention of settling on the basis of marriage should apply for spouse entry clearance in the proper fashion, from abroad-the right hon. Lady accepted that point. Before the no-switching requirement was introduced in April 2003, more than half of those who switched into the marriage category did so within six months of entry to the UK. I hope that I can set out why the rule is as it is. Many of those who switched intended to avoid rigorous examination of marriage applications by diplomatic posts abroad or the higher costs of obtaining spouse entry clearance compared with visitor entry clearance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09102229000839">Some applications to UKBA for leave to enter or remain touch on article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Article 8, which is a qualified right, states that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life. Restriction or interference with that right is permissible in order to maintain effective immigration control. When an application for leave to enter or remain contains an express or implied family life claim, caseworkers should complete a five-stage process, considering the following questions: does the claimant have family life in the UK; is it reasonable to expect the family to leave with the claimant; if there is interference with family life, is it in accordance with the law and the immigration rules, published policy and procedures; is the interference in pursuit of one of the permissible aims set out under article 8(2); and is the interference proportionate to the permissible aim?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09102229000840">In considering proportionality-item 5-caseworkers consider all relevant factors and no one factor is decisive. The prospective length and degree of family interruption involved is highly relevant, as is the person's immigration history. Any delay in considering the claim is relevant. Another factor is whether family members can or cannot reasonably be expected to join the person abroad when he or she makes his or her entry clearance application.</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="09102229000841"><a name="91022-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="09102229001305"><b>Miss Widdecombe:</b>

 Yes, I understand the right hon. Lady's point. I am sure that that will be considered, as the case is still live, as I understand it. I do not want to comment specifically on it, but I am sure that that point will be made strongly when the case is considered by those whose job it is to consider such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09102229000843">It is also open to a person to apply for leave to remain outside the immigration rules. The only two circumstances in which it will be necessary to consider granting leave to remain outside the rules will be in cases where someone qualifies under one of the published immigration policy concessions or for reasons that are particularly compelling in the circumstance. Such leave to remain outside the rules will inevitably be rare, and should be given only for genuinely compassionate reasons-I am sure that that will form part of the deliberations on the case-or where it is deemed absolutely necessary to allow someone to enter or remain in the UK when there is no other option available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09102229000844">I cannot accept the accusation that we are targeting soft cases. I do not accept that, but I understand the concerns and frustrations of right hon. and hon. Members, particularly when it comes to constituency cases. It is important that we have strong rules and that they are applied fairly and consistently. It is also important that they can be challenged and that there are avenues of appeal. I understand that such appeals are still under way in some of the cases that we have discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09102229000845">Let me say something briefly about removals and proper notice. Of course, one wishes and hopes that systems are humane and fair and, where possible, take into account all the characteristics of a case. If there is the threat that someone will be removed, it is not the case that they become aware of that threat only at the moment at which they are removed. Throughout the process, the implication and assertion is that there is a risk that they will be removed if they do not have a right to be here. The suddenness of that removal can of course cause concern, but to some extent it reflects the actions of the lowest common denominator in such cases. I am not commenting on the case mentioned by the right hon. Lady, but if a person is warned of the time of their removal, where it will take place and who will do it, in many cases they will choose to abscond. The long trail to find them will then be embarked on again and they will have to be tracked down at considerable expense. I understand the concern that has been expressed, but the difficulty of making judgments in these cases, and of carrying them out, needs to be appreciated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09102229000846">I understand the frustration felt by the right hon. Lady and others across the House, especially in constituency cases. I want to reassure her, as far as I can, that cases are looked at properly and within the rules, and that there is no targeting of soft cases. All cases will be dealt with properly, and that includes the appeals process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="91022-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09102229000847">As I said at the outset, my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration will write to the right hon. Lady on the specifics of the case. If she is not fully satisfied with this afternoon's debate, I hope that he will be able to address her concerns further.</p>
