 (LD): What assessment she has made of the effectiveness of sports action zones; and if she will make a statement. [222736]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="50321-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 An initial evaluation relating to the establishment of the 12&nbsp;zones was conducted by Sport England in 2001. Further evaluations were conducted in 2002&#150;03&nbsp;and 2003&#150;04. A summary of the findings of the most recent evaluation will be published by Sport England this summer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The work in all the zones shows, in varying ways, that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sport has made a major contribution to dealing with some of our problems in promoting health, the integration of ethnic minority groups, crime reduction and social exclusion. We expect the good practice to go into the mainstream work of developing the sports infrastructure.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50321-01_spnew0"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 Our hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) chairs with me our sports action&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zone in Lambeth and Southwark, which is brilliantly led by Brian Dickens, and we have experienced huge success in that zone in our two boroughs. Will there be an opportunity in the near future, whoever is in government, to roll out the zone across the rest of our boroughs so that the benefits spread? The Minister gave a list of lessons learned, including access, participation, health and social inclusion. Will there also be an opportunity to share with the rest of the country the lessons that boroughs such as ours have learned?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50321-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Very much so. I thank and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and the hon. Gentleman on their work in the action zone. We are rolling out a further 18&nbsp;zones and I hope that, as the hon. Gentleman says, the genuine good practice and innovation that stem from them will now fit into the actions of regional sports boards in developing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 580</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their strategies. They involve health, social inclusion, education and the development of sustainable communities, and the zones can play an important role in that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50321-01_spnew2"><b> Kate Hoey  (Vauxhall)</b> 
 (Lab): The Minister should be aware that one of the lessons from the sports action zones is that a bottom-up, not a top-down approach works. When the approach in our area was top down for the first two years, with Sport England trying to run it, it did not work. When it was bottom up, with genuine neighbourhood support from community groups, the South Bank employers group and all the people who lived there and knew what they needed, it worked. Does the Minister agree that it is important that the funding continues and is not diluted in a London sports board, thus getting broken up and not necessarily used for inner-city areas such as mine?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50321-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Well, I do not know about the last part of the question&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Bear with me. Sports boards are charged with targets of greater participation. I remind my hon. Friend that, when I came into the job, Sport England was passing down 98&nbsp;different sports initiatives to the regions. There was no bottom-up process; it was a case of ticking boxes and getting the dosh without anybody measuring what was happening. That approach has changed significantly in the sports boards, which bring in health, social inclusion and business to ensure that they drive up participation and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also target the least well off in our society. I hope that, in the next few years, we will tackle the issues that my hon. Friend raised and use sports action zones in doing that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50321-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Nick Hawkins  (Surrey Heath)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister knows that I will always be happy to welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more money for sport anywhere in the country. I recognise, as the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) did, that there are good areas where the approach in the sports action zones has been bottom up. However, does the Minister recognise that, in some parts of the country, there are still complaints that the money is not getting to the sharp end and that too much is being spent on bureaucracy? Does he acknowledge that, in any further development of the sports action zone programme, the Government need to be especially careful to ensure that taxpayers&#039; money going to sport reaches children in disadvantaged areas and is thus spent on sport, not administrators?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50321-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Very much so. The hon. Gentleman knows that Sport England&#039;s employees have reduced from 600&nbsp;to a little more than 200. There is much going into the regions and the county sports partnerships. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest that he has a quick word with his Front Benchers, because the plans for sport that they will present at the next election appear centralist by any stretch of the imagination. Indeed, they would scrap everything except the Minister for Sport.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50321-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson  (Coventry, North-West)</b> 
 (Lab): Is my right hon. Friend aware that the city of Coventry was honoured by his visit last month to see the new Coventry arena? He is to be congratulated on seeing the project through from inception to realisation this

<br>&nbsp;<br>year. Does he realise that it stands as a model for the country and shows how sporting facilities, zones and new arenas can contribute to the regeneration of a city and, indeed, a region?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50321-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 That is absolutely true. Anyone would think that there was an election in the air, but I could not possibly comment on that. The project to which my hon. Friend refers is extremely good for regeneration. It has taken a long time getting there, but I have had the privilege of going to see the development to date, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am sure that it will have a major and much-needed impact on Coventry&#039;s economy, in terms of how it can diversify using sport and other activities.

<p><a name="qn_o1">2. <a name="50321-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Adrian Sanders  (Torbay)</b> 
 (LD): If she will make&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement on the UK tourism deficit. [222737]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50321-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 The UK&#039;s tourism deficit was &#163;17.3&nbsp;billion in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2004. National tourism deficits in the developed world reflect various factors, including rising prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of illustration, Germany&#039;s deficit stood at &#163;27.1&nbsp;billion in 2003. Of more importance is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;industry&#039;s impressive domestic and inbound performance, with a record &#163;12.8&nbsp;billion spent by 27.5&nbsp;million overseas visitors last year. That illustrates a rising trend.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50321-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Sanders: </b> 
 Does the Minister agree that a way of dramatically reducing the tourism deficit would be to introduce an aviation tax, because Brits spend far more overseas than is spent by overseas visitors to the United Kingdom?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50321-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will know that tax is a matter for the Treasury. However, the industry has been working with my Department recently to address the structural weaknesses in tourism. We have now moved tourism into the regional development agencies, where it is seen as a major economic driver, especially in the south-west, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, as he comes from Torbay, where RDA money has already been invested. I hope that that trend will continue. This is about identifying skills and quality, developing EnglandNet, and having sound data on which to base decisions for the future. It is also about addressing structural weaknesses, and the industry and the Government are now working together in a strong partnership to do that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50321-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend recognised the importance of the regions in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promoting tourism. Will he congratulate One NorthEast and the North East Tourism Advisory Board, of which I am a member, on the production of their recent strategy for the north-east? It is not just about promoting the wonderful attractions and beauty of the north-east of England, but about ensuring that tourism plays a key part in the revival of the economy there.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 582</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50321-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Very much so. I congratulate my hon. Friend on what has been done in that regard. There is no doubt that creating a new structure for tourism in the north-east has had a difficult start, but I am sure that a solution has now been found that is acceptable to all parties and that will drive tourism forward as part of the region&#039;s economy development strategy. I look forward to seeing further developments in the area.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50321-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Robert Key  (Salisbury)</b> 
 (Con): We could do with more visitors to south Wiltshire. Twenty-one years ago, I attended the birth of English Heritage, whose first priority was to be Stonehenge. Eight years ago, a Select Committee described the facilities at Stonehenge as a national disgrace, and eight years ago in July, the Prime Minister said that the Government would do their best to put that right. All that time has passed, but we have nothing to show for it. We know that the inspector&#039;s report on the tunnel is now with Ministers, but will the Minister give us an assurance that Stonehenge remains a priority for his Department as well as for the Government as a whole? What can I do to help the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister in this regard?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50321-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 It is not often that I get an offer like that. We are waiting for the report that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and it will go to the Department for Transport. I accept that this has gone on for far too long. All that I can say on behalf of my Department and of English Heritage is that this matter is a priority and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that we want to see things happen. So the sooner we get the report, and the sooner that decisions are made by the Department for Transport, the better.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50321-01_spnew14"><b> Andrew Mackinlay  (Thurrock)</b> 
 (Lab): Will the Minister hold discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, bearing in mind the very wrong perceptions that people overseas&#151;particularly in north America&#151;have of banks being robbed there and of crime in urban environments? In fact, Northern Ireland is one of the most attractive and peaceful parts not only of the United Kingdom but of western Europe, with the hills of Antrim, the lochs of County Down, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sperrins. Could not the British Government do more to promote interest in and awareness of Northern Ireland, rather than seeing so many people being attracted to Ireland via Dublin?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50321-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 That question is timely, because later this week I shall be meeting Ministers and other representatives from the four devolved authorities, and I shall make sure that my hon. Friend&#039;s point is conveyed to them. There is no doubt that Northern Ireland is a beautiful place, and it is unfortunate that the worst events are sometimes disproportionately reported in the press, while the best things are left out. I shall convey my hon. Friend&#039;s sentiments to the people responsible for these matters in Northern Ireland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="50321-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Malcolm Moss  (North-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): As the Minister confirmed in an answer a few moments ago, the Government can accurately measure the tourism deficit and take steps to narrow the gap only if they have reliable statistics or sound data. Given that the Secretary of State, after the Hartwell meetings, made better statistics a priority&#151;a fact later confirmed by the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 583</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government&#039;s policy document &quot;Tomorrow&#039;s Tourism Today&quot;&#151;and that the Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s science review of DCMS last year said that only if DCMS implemented the tourism statistics improvement initiative&#039;s findings would the statistical base be accurate and reliable, why are the Government continuing their miserly approach and turning their back on the needs of the tourism industry by denying funding for TSII?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50321-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 That would be absolutely wrong. As the hon. Gentleman knows, because we held a conference a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few weeks ago in Birmingham, the industry has acknowledged very clearly to us that we are sitting down with it in the implementation group, which I chair. We are addressing, probably for the first time in a long time, the real structural weaknesses. Data are one of those, but not the only one. We are looking very seriously at those structural weaknesses and driving that agenda for change&#151;not just in the industry, but through the development agencies, with which there is now a very strong partnership. Data are part of that and we are acting on the issue. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I said in an answer that we will produce those data in the not-too-distant future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">This is one of a number of issues that we are considering in terms of ensuring that the industry is fit for purpose and can achieve the objective, which is to increase its worth from &#163;74&nbsp;billion to &#163;100&nbsp;billion by 2010. That is achievable, it will mean a lot more jobs and those data are important to achieving it.

 I have particular pleasure in answering a question from the hon. Gentleman at what might be his last appearance at DCMS questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o2">As part of the regular meetings with the chair of English Heritage, we have discussed progress on the current heritage protection review. Some of those discussions have referred to the changes to the listed building regime, which is due to be implemented next month.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="50321-02_spnew0"><b> Sir Sydney Chapman: </b> 
 I am delighted to hear the right hon. Lady&#039;s response to my question, because she knows that, in certain parts of the fourth estate recently, there was speculation that her Department would not hand over the powers of the listed building system to English Heritage next month. Now that she has confirmed that she will be doing so, may I congratulate her and say that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have such confidence in English Heritage that even if she handed over the designation orders as well, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be pleased?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50321-02_spnew1"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 As the hon.

We hope to publish those proposals in a White

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Paper later this year or early next, and they would have to be followed by legislation, but we consider the administrative changes that will take place next month a first step.

 (Lab): This year is the 200th anniversary of Trafalgar. As we have such a rich maritime history, can I persuade my right hon. Friend to ask English Heritage to list not just buildings, but our great ships, as it used to, so that they do not sink?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50321-02_spnew3"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 That is an interesting proposal from my hon. Friend&#151;one that I will certainly ask English Heritage to consider and provide advice on.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50321-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings)</b> 
 (Con): Has the Secretary of State calculated how many listed buildings will be affected and how many lost due to the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s plans to bulldoze the north and concrete over the south? She is aware that those plans will do a great deal of damage to a number of historic settlements, including a number of listed buildings. Will she make such an assessment and bring it to the House, and will she give the House a chance to debate and overturn these disastrous plans?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="50321-02_spnew5"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 We have just heard from the Opposition&#151;it is not surprising&#151;another myth that has no basis in fact. We have a strong and robust heritage protection system, which I intend should become more flexible and more susceptible to public involvement. There is no question of the need for new homes, which are desperately needed in the south of England, being compromised in the way the hon. Gentleman suggests. He is simply making a rather cheap, party political point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="50321-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston)</b> 
 (Lab): I am extremely grateful for the work that English Heritage is doing in the north-west, particularly in supporting work in my constituency to look after the grade II* listed buildings on the Hooton aerodrome? One of the problems that has emerged is the shortage of money to repair buildings, and the resultant tendency for preference to be given to grand mansions rather than our industrial heritage. Can my right hon. Friend use her Department&#039;s offices to work with English Heritage to try to gear in private sector money to help buildings for which alternative uses could be found to succeed in the future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="50321-02_spnew7"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Yes, that is a very good proposition, and one which English Heritage has been applying in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different parts of the country. Notable buildings, which fall under the auspices of English Heritage or the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Trust, can often make an important contribution to modern regeneration, which is one of the important objectives. There are many examples of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that. I therefore welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion.

Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottomley), may I say what a pleasure it is to be asking the Secretary of State a question on what might be the last occasion that she answers from the Dispatch Box? However, will she confirm that more than 1,000&nbsp;grade I and grade II* listed buildings are currently on the at-risk register, and one in six of those are owned by the Government or by local authorities? How will those be helped by the &#163;14&nbsp;million cut in the budget of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English Heritage announced recently by her Department, coming on top of the &#163;19&nbsp;million cut in the previous spending review? Is it any wonder that English Heritage has said that her Department has no regard for the heritage&#039;s contribution to people&#039;s quality of life or to the economy? Will she now match our pledge to guarantee the future of the heritage lottery fund, and to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boost it by an extra &#163;100&nbsp;million a year?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="50321-02_spnew11"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Let me take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s intervention point by point. First, it does not square with the many discussions that I have had with English Heritage. The figures that he quotes do not take account of the fact that this spending round saw English Heritage gain an additional &#163;13&nbsp;million. Will he welcome the increases that, in this tough spending round, we were able to establish for the museums sector, and the above-inflation increase for most of our regularly funded arts organisations? In relation to English Heritage and the heritage sector more generally, I pay tribute to the fact that it has saved money by tackling bureaucracy and inefficiency, which has now been translated into what would be described as front-line activity. I hope that that process will continue.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="50321-02_spmin1"><b>The Minister for the Arts  (Estelle Morris): </b> 
 The Government support the UK art market in a number of ways. Our policy of free admissions to national art galleries and museums has substantially increased public access to contemporary and non-contemporary art, and raised awareness and interest in the visual arts. The own art scheme, administered by the Arts Council, is directly supporting the art market by enabling the general public to buy art through interest-free loans.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="50321-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 Is the right hon. Lady aware of the damage that will be caused by the implementation in January next year of the directive on the artist&#039;s resale levy, which will drive art sales out of this country to centres such as New York which do not impose the levy? 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Given that the European Commission never carried out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a regulatory impact assessment, given that the Government&#039;s own assessment concluded that 1,000&nbsp;jobs would be lost as a result of the directive and given that&#151;to be fair&#151;the Government voted against the original directive, will she demand an urgent re-examination of this further example of job-destroying European regulations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="50321-02_spnew13"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that the Government have argued vociferously in Europe about the droit de suite. We should bear in mind, however, that the art market is tremendously strong in the United Kingdom at present. It is worth &#163;4.2&nbsp;billion to the economy, so I do not think that it is vulnerable or weak.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_o3">Let us be clear about what this measure will mean. It will mean that artists or&#151;for 70&nbsp;years after their deaths&#151;their successors will have a share of the resale value of any work of art that goes to the British art market. Given that art inflation is significantly above general inflation, I suppose there is an argument that those who produce works of art should have a fair share of the profit; but we have always felt that it would have been better for us not to be party to this measure, and have argued to that effect as vociferously as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_o4">I think the right hon. Gentleman would have to admit that the art market has recognised the work that the Government have done. We will continue to defend, in a number of ways, a market which, as I have said, is incredibly strong at present&#151;probably far stronger than it was when the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s party was in government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="50321-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Tony Banks  (West Ham)</b> 
 (Lab): Droit de suite may be a good idea in principle, but would it not be better for the levy thus raised to be spent on promoting the arts generally, rather than going to the families of artists&#151;some of whom will take ages to trace, and may be incredibly wealthy themselves?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o37"><a name="50321-02_spnew15"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 That may be so. I do not know how easy it would be, but as my hon. Friend knows, that is not part of the proposal. We are currently consulting on the details, a process led by my noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation. I am sure that he will read my hon. Friend&#039;s comments and reflect on them, but I do not want to give the impression that Europe will be swayed. The motive behind the proposal is to ensure that the person who produces a work of art has a share of the income when it is sold, sometimes at an immeasurably higher price in a relatively short period.

There is no doubt that English Heritage has re-organised its education service in the past few years. Change is always unsettling and leads to some lack of certainty, but I am pleased to say that the money that English Heritage is putting into education has increased. Indeed, a lot of money has gone into front-line services, so that more people with different skills are working with children. In addition, and as my hon. Friend knows, our Department and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department for Education and Skills have been working closely with English Heritage to ensure that the quality and shape of its education service is as effective as it can be.

: I am informed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electoral Commission that, in last November&#039;s referendum in the north-east region, its statutory responsibilities included commenting on the questions in relation to the establishment of unitary authorities and advising on the clarity of the ballot papers. However, the Electoral Commission has not provided general advice on ballots for the establishment of unitary authorities.

<p><a name="st_o77"><a name="50321-05_spnew4"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 Some of us did not particularly want regional government, but we would be quite happy to hold ballots on unitary authorities. Is that not exactly the kind of thing that the Electoral Commission should turn its eye to?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o78"><a name="50321-05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 The Electoral Commission has a limited role as a precursor to the Government&#039;s proposals for referendums on elected regional assemblies in the three northern regions. The boundary committee for England was directed by the Deputy Prime Minister to carry out a local government review and to set out options for unitary government structures in the north-east, the north-west, and Yorkshire and the Humber. However, that was the result of a direction from the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Electoral Commission does not give advice on unitary authorities. That is a matter for the Deputy Prime Minister.

 I am grateful for that response.

 Yes, the commission recognises that young people are a key audience for its voter awareness activities and has set up dedicated programmes of activities and campaigns to address that.

 I am most grateful for that reply and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="50321-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 Indeed. It may not be widely recognised that postal voting is now very widespread. I am advised, for instance, that in some areas, such as Newcastle, Cardiff and Stevenage, some 50&nbsp;per cent. of voters have registered for postal votes. The commission expects that demand&#151;in Great Britain only, not in Northern Ireland&#151;in the forthcoming general election, whenever it may be, will be in the region of 15&nbsp;per cent. It is obviously extremely important that proper scrutiny and supervision should be exercised.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="50321-06_spnew5"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 The Electoral Commission has made recommendations for changes to the law on postal voting. However, its current position is that, under the code of conduct, it is committed to self-regulation to begin with, but it will keep the operation of the code under review.

The creation of a system of postal voting on demand, in which the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genuineness of those applying for and receiving the ballot papers cannot be verified, has been a disaster. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secrecy of the ballot box has been destroyed by the wholesale expansion of a scheme that used to be properly reserved for people who had special reasons for voting by post because they were not able to go to the polling station.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">It is of great importance to my constituents and me that I am able to introduce the Youth Disorder and Engagement Bill. In July 2003, I organised a meeting for 150&nbsp;local constituents to meet the previous Home Secretary and to discuss ways of tackling youth disorder, which is a hugely important issue to me. Local residents were in touch with me every day, as they were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worried about vandalism, arson, graffiti and intimidation by groups of youths. The meeting attracted a wide range of residents both young and old from all ethnic groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_3">Consensus was reached about the two approaches required. First, as Members would expect, people wanted more police on the streets. Since then, I have circulated questionnaires, held local meetings, secured an Adjournment debate, and listened to constituents on the doorstep and in my surgeries. All the consultation convinced me that the initial consensus was correct&#151;everyone wants to be able to walk down the street without fear, and no one wants graffiti, arson and gang fights. The way to achieve that is through a combination of more police and better youth services. We have all heard requests for police, but I hear fewer requests for better youth services. We now have more police. Since 1997, there has been an increase in Tower Hamlets alone of 43&nbsp;per cent. or 200&nbsp;new police officers. We have safer neighbourhoods teams, and every area of my borough will have its own team of police officers by July this year. Tower Hamlets will be the first authority in the country to roll that programme out to ensure that residents feel safer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_4">The safer neighbourhoods programme is delivering exactly the sort of community policing that my constituents were asking for, and we have already experienced a drop in crime. In the past year, crime in Tower Hamlets fell by 5&nbsp;per cent., and in one of the first neighbourhoods to have a safer neighbourhoods police team it fell by 15&nbsp;per cent. That programme is clearly working, but what about youth services? Consultation with residents led directly to this Youth Disorder and Engagement Bill, which is intended to make sure that every borough takes responsibility for providing youth services. It is a scandal that such an important area of service provision is not a statutory duty, and it is now time to crack down on antisocial local authorities that do not take young people&#039;s needs seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_5">Youth services must be good quality, and must work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a partnership, which means setting strategy locally with all the stakeholders, including the police, the education authority, Connexions, the voluntary sector, parents and young people themselves. Most importantly, youth services must reach the hard-to-reach&#151;kids who have dropped out of education, kids who have been in prison, kids who have recently settled in the UK and, of course, girls. In the past, most youth 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>services have predominantly attracted young men, not young women. Youth services must be both creative and preventive. Kids should have the chance to develop skills and enjoy leisure activities, but intensive work must be undertaken with vulnerable children and those most at risk of offending.

<a name="stpa_6">Not many things in Tower Hamlets are getting worse, but I would be kidding if I said that everything was fine. Two years on from the last time I took 150&nbsp;residents to meet the Home Secretary, we still have graffiti&#151;my house was done last weekend&#151;vandalism and gangs of youths hanging out on the streets. But let us consider some of the issues that those young people face, and some ideas about how the Bill could help local authorities develop good youth services.

<a name="stpa_7">Tower Hamlets has almost 20,000&nbsp;young people between the ages of 13&nbsp;and 19. Fifty per cent. of the community in Tower Hamlets is white, but 60&nbsp;per cent. of pupils are of Bangladeshi origin and many live in poor quality, overcrowded housing. Our overcrowding rate is four times the national average. Many families are on low incomes. I imagine that in most constituencies there are areas where the majority of pupils are not entitled to free school meals&#151;in Tower Hamlets 60&nbsp;per cent. of children are entitled to free school meals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_8">Tower Hamlets youth services are rising to the challenge, but even Tower Hamlets council has said that although the youth service has performed well, it has not been well regarded. I shall mention aspects of the service that have worked well. One is the rapid response team, which was set up to deal with gang violence, to defuse incidents and to bring a youth work response to antisocial behaviour. The team provides street-based youth work, three mobile youth work vans and early intervention work in schools.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_9">Let me give an example of one young person, Tony, who had already been involved in gang violence when he met the rapid response team. He was sent to a young offenders institution at 16, after being found guilty of grievous bodily harm, and his probation officer referred him to the RRT. He was given one-to-one support to help avoid a return to his problems and to get appropriate training. He is now on a modern apprenticeship course and works with the rapid response team to help other young people get out of the conflict situations they have been in.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50321-08_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 Last week, the Chancellor set out the Budget choice facing our country: to continue to build on a platform of sustained economic growth and investment in the future of our country through education, skills, early years provision and child care, or to cut &#163;35&nbsp;billion from public services. That is not a question of potted plants at the Department of Trade and Industry, as the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collins) suggested last time we debated the subject in this place&#151;no, it is a sum equivalent to every teacher, doctor and nurse in this country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50321-08_spnew0"><b> Mr. Tim Collins  (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (Con):</b> 
 Is the Secretary of State seriously telling the House that she wants people to believe&#151;I dare say that she does, so rather does she believe herself&#151;that any incoming Government would sack every nurse, teacher and doctor? Why does she not treat these debates with a degree of seriousness?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50321-08_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Is the shadow Secretary of State disagreeing with his own shadow Chancellor that a &#163;35&nbsp;billion cut from public services is &quot;vast&quot;, as the shadow Chancellor said on &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; last week? Does he agree that &#163;35&nbsp;billion of cuts is vast, or not? Can he confirm that he would match the &#163;9.4&nbsp;billion spending programme that the Chancellor announced to rebuild or refurbish every primary school in Britain? Can he confirm that he would make the extra spending on Sure Start, skills or junior apprenticeships, or make the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion investment in further education colleges?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50321-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Collins: </b> 
 Yes. Now can we have a real debate?

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50321-08_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I am delighted about that, because the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) said that those are non-priority areas. Indeed, when he was shadow Secretary of State for Education he described Sure Start as the beginnings of the &quot;nanny state&quot;.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50321-08_spnew4"><b> Derek Conway  (Old Bexley and Sidcup) (Con):</b> 
 Perhaps we could address issues that mean something to the people who may be watching this debate instead of engaging in the usual political knockabout. Will the Secretary of State tell the House exactly what is happening to adult education funding under her Government? The Sidcup campus of Bexley college has certainly been hampered for funds and does not see the fabled growth that we hear about from Labour Ministers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50321-08_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 It has increased; indeed, it has increased significantly, and I shall come to the House tomorrow to talk further about that. We are making unprecedented investment not only in skills, but in further education colleges to update and transform them to deliver the skills that this country needs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50321-08_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham  (Coventry, South) (Lab):</b> 
 Coming back to the question posed by the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) about whether the Conservatives would slash everything if they were in government, they would take us back to the old days when we had fewer teachers and doctors and were knocking down schools and hospitals. That is the sort of policy that they want to pursue, and he is not being honest about that. This is not knockabout&#151;it is serious stuff.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50321-08_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am delighted that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale has now committed his party to doubling spending on Sure Start over the next three years and having 3,500&nbsp;children&#039;s centres in this country. That is not what his right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor has set out in his medium-term fiscal strategy, which says that spending on schools and child care social services will be protected, but that there will be a freeze in the non-schools budget.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50321-08_spnew8"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State has been advised robustly by my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibb) about the desirability of using synthetic phonics in the effective teaching of reading. If she agrees with that proposition, will she confirm to the House that we will not have to put up any more with the ramblings of Kimberley, Meek and Miller, who are three so-called experts in the teaching of reading? They are on record as saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Within the psychosemiotic framework the shared reading lesson is viewed as an ideological construct where events are played out and children must therefore learn to position themselves in three interlocking contexts.&quot;</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_15">The right hon. Lady had the good fortune to have a privately financed education, but millions do not and never will. Is not that sort of nonsense responsible for the destruction of the life chances of a generation of school pupils in state schools in this country?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 607</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50321-08_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I am pleased to say that the hon. Gentleman, whom I admire greatly, is right on the subject of synthetic phonics. We have a synthetic phonics strategy in our schools&#151;it is called the national literacy hour. We introduced it in 1998&nbsp;and its approach is now almost entirely based on synthetic phonics. Indeed, if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Members look at the results of the Clackmannanshire study, to which I believe the hon. Gentleman is referring, they will find that they are remarkable compared with those of control groups in Scotland that do not use synthetic phonics. However, if its results are compared with those under the national literacy strategy taught in England, the gap is not the same. He will agree with me that it is right to teach our children phonics. I want that teaching to be ever improved in our primary school system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_16">It is our ambition to be the best-educated, best-trained and best-skilled country in the world. All the evidence shows that if we really want to offer children the best start in life, we must invest in the early years. That is why children and families are at the centre of our strategy. It is right that we do more to support parents and families with young children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_17">The children who face the greatest challenges in learning to read and write need to be helped at an early stage. By 2008, we will be investing almost &#163;1.8&nbsp;billion in Sure Start, thus doubling the funding available now. Over the next five years, early years will become a fundamental part of the welfare state which will be able to respond to the varied needs of children and families. By 2010, we will extend from 500&nbsp;to 3,500&nbsp;the number of Sure Start children&#039;s centres, so there will be one in every community offering information, health care, family support, child care and other services. We will extend the free early education entitlement for all three and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four-year-olds to 15&nbsp;hours a week, thus working towards our goal of 20&nbsp;hours a week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_18">We must continue to invest in our schools and to reform them so that we drive standards ever higher, promote good behaviour and widen opportunity. All parents have the right to have their children educated in modern facilities and orderly classrooms with strong discipline and good standards of teaching. We now have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more teachers than before, with more than 28,000&nbsp;recruited since 1997. There are now 105,000&nbsp;more support staff in our schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_19">The standards of teaching are better than ever before. Our children are gaining the best results ever at age 11,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCSE and A-level. Those results compare with the best in the world, but we must go further. Some 78&nbsp;per cent. of 11-year-olds achieve level 4&nbsp;in English and 74&nbsp;per cent. gain level 4&nbsp;in maths, but we know that the chance of children achieving five good GCSEs is almost seven times higher if they reach those expected standards. We must support teachers in driving standards ever higher. To do that, we need to focus on the needs of every child and have first-rate places in which children can learn. Last week, the Chancellor announced the 15-year programme to rebuild or refurbish all our secondary schools to world-class standards. He said that that strategy would be extended to all our primary schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_20">For those children who have not reached the expected standard in literacy and numeracy by the end of their primary school education, we will continue to place a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 608</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>relentless focus on the basics at secondary school, thus ensuring that every child who leaves school is equipped with functional English and maths for work and for life.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050321/debtext/50321-09.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50321-09_spnew0"><b> Mr. Phil Willis  (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD):</b> 
 Will the Secretary of State clarify her statement about rebuilding all secondary schools? We support that policy, so it is not a trick question. The Labour party&#039;s website says that all secondary schools will be rebuilt by 2016, whereas the Department&#039;s website states that three in every local education authority will be rebuilt by 2015. Which is correct?
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50321-09_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 We have a 15-year strategy to rebuild or refurbish all our secondary schools. The first will be rebuilt in 2007&nbsp;and the strategy will go on from there. We have a programme for primary schools on the same timetable. However, not all local authorities will have to wait for their place in the 15-year programme. In the interim period, we can offer the chance to all local authorities to have their most run-down schools rebuilt or refurbished. I am not aware of the details on the Labour party website, but I suggest that they relate to local authorities not having to wait in the queue for all their secondary schools to be rebuilt or refurbished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_21">The key to ensuring that every child who leaves school is equipped with functional English and maths for work and for life is to free the curriculum for 11&nbsp;to 14-year-olds to provide space for tailored support&#151;help with the basics, and challenge and stimulation for children who would benefit from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_22">Behaviour is good or outstanding in most schools. We are clear that there must be strong measures when dangerous and violent conduct occurs. However, all parents and teachers know that we face the challenge of low-level, disruptive behaviour in our classrooms. The answer is not to create new sink schools, full of excluded children, but to redraw the line on what is an acceptable standard of behaviour in the classroom, nipping bad behaviour in the bud. We must have a zero tolerance approach to bad behaviour, providing schools with the resources that they need for on-site or off-site facilities to withdraw children from the classroom when and if they need to do that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50321-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kelvin Hopkins  (Luton, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend interested in the recent research that shows that food and drink additives have an enormous effect on children&#039;s behaviour? In a school in America, where children have been removed, they take away all the drinks that contain additives and the children calm down and become normal. I hope that my right hon. Friend accepts that serious point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50321-09_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend always makes serious points and he is right to raise that one. We know that healthy meals promote good standards of behaviour and that children achieve more when they are fed healthy food. That is why we have recently been talking about the new school foods trust that we are setting up and how we can make change happen in our schools so that all children have the chance to eat a healthy meal. I shall present more details of our proposal in the next few weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_23">I want every secondary school to be part of a network of schools by September 2007. We must focus our efforts on those schools that are found by Ofsted to have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 609</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unsatisfactory behaviour. That is why I recently announced that local authorities would draw up urgent action plans to support the schools identified by Ofsted as being in that category, backed up by return visits from Ofsted within a year to check on progress and ensure that improvement is under way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_24">Through increased and sustained investment in information and communications technology, we also ensure that learning is tailored closely to each young person&#039;s needs and circumstances, including the facility to learn from home when necessary. Strong, autonomous schools, closely linked to home and each other, with a strong sense of mission and purpose, will transform opportunities for our children. If all young people are to make the most of their skills and talents, it is crucial to give them the opportunity and encouragement to stay in learning until they are at least 18. Far too many young people drop out of school at 16&nbsp;or 17. Our participation rate at the age of 17&nbsp;is one of the worst in the industrialised world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_25">The White Paper on 14&nbsp;to 19-year-olds, which was published last month, outlines our proposals to build on the current system of GCSEs and A-levels to enable all our young people to combine practical, work-based learning with traditional, academic learning in the classroom. In future, children will learn the subjects that they enjoy at their own pace in places that motivate them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50321-09_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I was sorry that my right hon. Friend passed over the subject of Sure Start so quickly. I visited a Sure Start centre in Norwich this weekend, and I was amazed at the design of the furniture there&#151;I was interested to find out that it had been made by the Amish&#151;at the state of the kitchens and at the food that was being given to people. The encouragement that was being given was very good. My right hon. Friend is talking about 14&nbsp;to 19-year-olds, but we now have a generation that is being encouraged to think and act differently. Does she agree that that is a credit to all the policies that we are operating across the whole educational field?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50321-09_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. What is more, all the evidence shows that if we get the early years right, and if children start school ready to learn at the age of five, it has an impact on their performance right through primary school. The Sure Start system works best when parents feel that they have control and ownership of the courses in the Sure Start programme which they can attend while their children are learning and playing. In some Sure Start programmes, we have seen really innovative learning programmes, involving dads and books, for example, and mums learning to cook&#151;to come back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins). The scheme presents a huge opportunity to make a lasting difference not only to children but to their parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_26">We recognise that, when a child reaches the age of 14,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are sometimes financial barriers to their participating in education, particularly for those from lower-income households. That is why we are rolling out education maintenance allowances nationally. They will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 610</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>play a significant role in widening access to further and higher education by encouraging more young people from lower-income backgrounds to enter academic or vocational post-compulsory education. More than 290,000&nbsp;young people have enrolled for education maintenance allowances under the national scheme so far.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50321-09_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hopkins: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend may know that some of the early pilots for the EMAs were carried out at the Luton sixth-form college. They provided a double bonus, because the families were helped and the students turned up for their classes and learned better as a result of having the reward of the EMA.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50321-09_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I am delighted that my hon. Friend has mentioned the pilot schemes in his constituency. The EMA pilots were also carried out in my constituency, so I have first-hand experience of their fairly dramatic impact on raising participation and attainment, partly because of the incentive to complete courses involved in the EMA programme. We have a real opportunity to encourage participation and to tackle the financial barriers that exist.
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="50321-09_spnew8"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State says that EMAs offer a tremendous advantage to people staying on at school. If that is the case, why does she not believe that tuition fees have a deterrent effect on people considering going to university?
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50321-09_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will know that we are reintroducing grants for the poorest students, abolishing up-front fees and ensuring that students will not have to pay a penny while they are learning. I hope that he took note of the study recently produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said that students will be &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion better off under the Government&#039;s programme than they would be under the one proposed by the Opposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_27">As a result of the Budget, we will be able to offer an extra 20,000&nbsp;opportunities in pilot areas from 2006&#150;07&nbsp;for disaffected 14&nbsp;to 16-year-olds, either at work, in college or with the voluntary sector. In 1997, as we emerged from the Conservative years, there were just 75,000&nbsp;apprenticeships. By 2008, 300,000&nbsp;young people will be in apprenticeship training. We also want to ensure that the 150,000 16&nbsp;and 17-year-olds in the United Kingdom who are in employment with no training improve their skills, so we will pilot new approaches to encourage those people to take up apprenticeships or other structured training. We will also pilot learning or activity agreements for those young people not currently in education, work or training. This is clear evidence of our determination that every young person should fulfil their potential through education and training. As a result, I want our participation rate at the age of 17&nbsp;to rise from 75&nbsp;to 90&nbsp;per cent.&#151;one of the best in the industrialised world. Every teenager must have the opportunity of a guaranteed place in sixth form, on an apprenticeship or in training.

The Statistics Commission has again warned the Government that they should not overclaim the progress on literacy and numeracy. I am delighted that this week, unlike last, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary of State seemed to heed that warning. The National Audit Office, no less, has pointed out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government have spent &#163;885&nbsp;million on anti-truancy initiatives without making any progress.

This party has a strategy to reverse those problems, starting with a root and branch clear-out at the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.

The first thing that should be said is that no party that has been responsible for any part of education spending at national or local level in the past 20&nbsp;years should be anything other than ashamed by what Jamie Oliver has discovered and publicised. It is clear that both resources and strategy have been badly wrong for many years, and they are still badly wrong today.

There has been something of a failure to recognise or understand that parental needs and preferences are not uniform or identical. There has been little to no research into or focus on the quality, rather than the quantity, of child care provided. In particular, there has been little analysis of why children aged 11&nbsp;and above in Scandinavian countries seem to perform appreciably better than ours, even though they do not start formal education until the age of seven or later. In short, when the Chancellor announced in his Budget statement that he simply wants more years of education, rather than a focus on quality, many will have sighed with irritation rather than pleasure.

 I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s suggestion that the Conservatives would devolve more spending to the front line. Gershon&#039;s report suggests that in fact, pooling resources and scaling up&#151;particularly to local authorities or even to Government for matters such as ordering&#151;would be a more efficient way of spending money. One could save money by greater centralisation, rather than by more devolution.

That is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why we are determined&#151;on the basis of independent advice received from the extremely respected James committee&#151;to proceed in entirely the opposite direction, and according to the view that value for money will proceed from devolving power and decision making, rather than from taking it upwards.

 I have heard the argument for getting rid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Learning and Skills Council, which is in the James review&#039;s report.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50321-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Collins: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his question. We propose to merge the Higher Education Funding Council and the Further Education Funding Council, reducing the number of quangos by one. We do indeed intend to apply to further education the principle of money following the student, as we already propose to do in secondary education, and as is the logical consequence of the changes taking place in higher education. We furthermore intend to offer both FE and HE a much simplified funding structure that involves no top-slicing and getting rid of all the silos. The hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the frustration that many FE colleges and HE institutions feel when the various bureaucracies that interfere with their work tell them how to do their job.

That is in clear contrast with the Secretary of State. She said that she is in favour of drawing lines in the sand, of zero tolerance and of cracking down hard on misbehaviour, but it transpires that that means that head teachers still would not have the final say on exclusions, and that she believes that she knows better than they do whether a child should be excluded. Moreover, we will invest in keeping special schools open, rather than allowing more and more of them to close in pursuit of a politically correct and often entirely inappropriate strategy of one-size-fits-all inclusion.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that she criticises us for advancing in respect of education is exactly the same policy that her Government are currently implementing in respect of health. In other words, a patient is usually paid for by the taxpayer, and a child is usually paid for by the taxpayer when access to a state hospital or school is required. People who want to access a school that is not owned or run by the state are, in the Secretary of State&#039;s view, taking money out of public services in education, but if they want to use a hospital that is not owned or run by the state, they are acting in accordance with the spirit of proper reform in health care. In our view, that is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sensible policy to pursue across the whole of the public services. How, then, does the Secretary of State distinguish what we are proposing for education from what her Government are now doing in health?

I got it from Lord Blackwell, head of the No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;policy unit between 1995&nbsp;and 1997. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Yes, I will address the training of our young people in universities in the latter part of my speech, but we must consider more than just the universities: university students and graduates come from schools, so the science, engineering and technology taught in schools, as well as the technicians themselves, are extremely important. We are missing a trick or two in that respect, and I shall make some suggestions about that.

<a name="stpa_62">We are putting much more money into clinical research, and not just in relation to stem cells. We are putting money into engineering under the Budget. We are bringing researchers over from other countries. Indeed, Roger Pedersen&#151;a friend of mine who is a professor in stem cell research on the Addenbrooke&#039;s site at Cambridge&#151;has come from California and will not go back because we are ahead of the game. In the next week, there will be another sensational recruit and transfer from across the great pond into this country. So we are well up front.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asked various eminent people about the term &quot;science cities&quot;, and the only answer that I got was, &quot;Well, that&#039;ll be another sign outside a place. Does it mean anything?&quot; If we read the script properly&#151;we have more to do on it&#151;the relationship between the science and business communities will be extended and will grow because of the feeling of being a science city. They exist across the world. For example, Sir Richard Sykes of Imperial college tells me that Novosibirsk&#151;I have been there&#151;in Siberia is an amazing science city, where it is minus 20&#176;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centigrade outside, so the scientists and teachers do not get out very much, as hon.

The other night, the Home Secretary and I entertained many glamorous people in Norwich in a business tent to collect huge sums of money for the Labour party&#151;who in their right mind would vote for anyone else these days?&#151;and we asked them what they would do about making Norwich a science city. There was a long silence, and we said that, as soon as we get back and get on with business, Norwich would become a science city and we would knock some heads together. The concept is intended to drive people together in order to promote the whole science arena, in the areas that the Government have identified, to the level of world excellence.

<a name="50321-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_65">There are one or two storm clouds. I do not pretend that everything is wonderful. There are many more things to do, and the Budget has opened the way for that. There are certainly questions about research and development, as the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) will remember in relation to health care. We lag behind in terms of initiatives and developments in comparison with India and China, but we should not hold up our hands and wallow in defeat; we should say that we can do as well, if not better, and that is the spirit that the Budget has delivered to many scientists in this country. For the first time, we have doubled that budget and people are smiling and beginning to work, but there is more to do in that arena.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_66">The problem is not just competition, but trying to persuade small businesses to develop that sort of work and to increase research and development in science-intensive small businesses. A private Member&#039;s Bill that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campbell) intends to present has been picked up in the Budget, which requires Departments to provide money for research.

<a name="stpa_67">There are problems accessing venture capital. Venture capitalists are strange people&#151;I met some in Cambridge on Friday night&#151;and talk in billions not millions of pounds. They work in the short term and want results within one or two years, but results take longer than that in many enterprising and innovative research arenas. We must marry those two different views and, at last, we are starting to talk to venture capitalists. The aim is to encourage small businesses&#151;not just bright people from universities but inventors and the James Watts&#039;s of this country because they have bright ideas and need support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_68">Another problem is VAT, as hon. Members know, for organisations involved in biomedical research and so on. I have taken two cases to the Inland Revenue to ask its officials to remove VAT because of the nature of the research. A charity in my constituency is trying to develop a cancer information centre, but has been told that because it is connected with a private finance initiative hospital it must pay the full rate of VAT. The money comes from charity and there is a lot of reaction 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>against that decision. The Minister will recognise that problem, which arises time and again. I never want to meet another official in my life, although when one puts the arguments one sometimes wins &#163;1&nbsp;million for a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;university or &#163;2&nbsp;million for a charity. I hope that something will be done about the VAT problem. The process is clumsy and we must do something about it.

<a name="50321-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_69">There is something fundamentally at odds with the problem of developing small industries. The antipathy of many young people to taking their research and discoveries to the marketplace must be seen to be believed. The culture in this country is that people dirty their hands if they go into business after doing magic work on this, that or the other, whether chemistry, physics or mathematics, and so on. The sort of people that I have talked about&#151;Paul Grayson, Chris Evans and Richard Branson&#151;have had such experience but they are true entrepreneurs in a sense that is sometimes hard to define. Many people think of themselves as entrepreneurs, but are not because someone else takes on the marketing and development problems, proof of concept stages and so on. Making a discovery does not suddenly result in a glorious product that the world awaits. It must be marketed and it is difficult to tell someone to leave it to another professional or expert in the area to develop the product. Partnership and teamwork are necessary and we are beginning to accept that.

The answer&#151;I kid you not&#151;was, &quot;You need headed notepaper.&quot; That was depressing. To get a kick-start and an introduction to someone who has been through the process is a big step. One gets depressed, but then one gets on with winning the research assessment exercise and glorious kudos as a scientist, but one forgets the other aspects of the work. We need to do much more to encourage that side of matters.

<a name="stpa_71">If there is one factor that distinguishes the US from this country it is that people in the US take risks. In the US, people can fail once, twice and even three times, but they are still not failures. It is recognised that it may take four attempts to achieve something, but every time something does not quite make it, lessons can be learned. That is how Americans are encouraged to think, but that does not happen in this country. People are deflated and put down if something does not work. The knives go in and people are put off. We have to change that culture, and we should start in schools by encouraging people to experiment and think. If they do not succeed the first time, they should be patted on the back and told to try, try and try again. We have a long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way to go in introducing that attitude into our teaching culture.

<a name="stpa_72">The Government have also talked about other aids for small businesses, including tax credits, involving the Inland Revenue, ways to give people the confidence to get on and do it, and setting up Lambert-type interactions. However, we still have a serious problem with physics and chemistry departments in universities closing. That is not a new phenomenon, but when universities lose key departments, it is demoralising for those who work in them and it creates a threatening environment for everybody else. I am pleased that the Government have started to consider how we can prevent such closures.

<a name="50321-12_para16">
<a name="stpa_73">We know that we need bright young people, not only for policy-making but for research, development and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innovation. However, the number of people taking the subjects I have mentioned has been declining for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several years, and that contributes to the closure of departments. If they are closed, we will not be able to take on the extra students coming through the system who want to be chemists or physicists, or to develop new subject matter. We have intervened to try to increase the number of university places, but we have to be smarter. We have to look at the root cause of the decline in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;student numbers that has led to the closure of departments. We need to inspire students and young people in schools to study science. We want teachers who can be creative and enthusiastic. We need to change the curriculum, because it is dull and boring. When I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visited a school in Norwich, I found that stem cell research was not taught to scientists but to those studying religion. That is fine, but scientists should be talking about the big idea in science in this country at the moment. I invite colleagues to ask whether stem cell research is being discussed in the schools they visit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-12_para17">
<a name="stpa_74">Another reason for the falling numbers of science students is the funding arrangements for research and teaching in this country. Departments often nick money out of their research budgets to pay for teaching. Strange ratios have developed for different subjects, but nobody seems to know why one subject gets more for teaching than another. I am sure that there is an explanation, but it is not convincing in terms of the overall visionary economic plan that we have to increase the number of students in some areas. Nor can anybody tell me how many physicians, mathematicians or biotechnologists we will need. There is no overall plan, but we need one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-12_para18">
<a name="stpa_75">We must also be honest and admit that not all universities can do everything. That is a brave thing to say, but every region can provide the surety that, whatever subject someone wants to study, they can find a course that they can follow within easy travelling distance of home&#151;I shall not go into all the reasons why someone might want to stay at home or why they should not do so. We need to take hold of the regional development agencies and take something from them&#151;not just money but some of their people, who could interact with others on a regional affairs committee or some such body to solve our infrastructure problems in order to ensure that the subjects are taught. We will never have enough money to teach every subject that we want to teach in universities. That is a hard thing to say and believe. Yes, we will get more students; we want more graduates and we want more of them to go out into the business world and into pure blue skies research. We must allow for that on a regional basis, although I do not see it happening in some RDAs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-12_para19">
<a name="stpa_76">Policies must not dictate that research is the only thing that is important. A vice-chancellor once told me, &quot;Forget teaching. Give the students 20&nbsp;minutes and then walk out and get on with your research. That is much&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more important.&quot; We must not have that. We must create structures in which very good teachers just teach and do not do research, and vice versa. We must work out such interaction on an original basis.

We can do it, and this Budget is the first line in the sand.

<a name="stpa_80">The hon. Member for Norwich, North made a powerful and thoughtful contribution, as he does to any education debate. However, I wondered when he would get to several elements of Government policy that move us in the opposite direction. The recent publishing by the Office for Fair Access of the universities that are to charge so-called differential fees reveals that the full &#163;3,000&nbsp;top-up fee will be charged for 91&nbsp;per cent. of courses. I do not believe that that is a differential. That means that there is a new flat-rate fee of &#163;3,000&nbsp;in our universities. I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would say what impact that will have and how it will detract from the ambition to attract the young people whom we want to go to university. Are we to retrench a middle-class higher education system, which he and I would decry?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-13_para2">

We did not address the purpose, function and shape of higher education and its relationship, not only with further education but with the 14&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;sector. If we are to meet the 21st-century challenges that the hon. Gentleman identified, we must undertake a radical review of post-14&nbsp;education through to higher education and level 4 provision.

<a name="stpa_85">I shall give one example. The Chancellor has assumed a &#163;2.825&nbsp;billion tax receipt over the next three years by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clamping down on fraud and tax avoidance.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="50321-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Willis: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but if it is so straightforward to recover all the money being lost through tax avoidance, why has it taken nine years to do so? If it had been done sooner, we might not have had to impose fees on university students. And if there is another &#163;35&nbsp;billion out there, we would not need the James review, would we?

An additional &#163;9.4&nbsp;billion of expenditure to rebuild or refurbish half our primary schools over 15&nbsp;years is ambitious, but the programme will not start until 2009, and without careful strategic planning at local level we may see what we have seen at secondary level&#151;the development of a two-tier primary system, with thousands of schools still out of the programme by 2020.How do the Government intend to prioritise the primary school rebuild programme? Will it be done through local education authorities or will it, as happened with the secondary programme, be directed from the Secretary of State&#039;s office? Can the Minister confirm or knock on the head the impression that the new resources for rebuild will be given only to projects where extended school provision is offered? Will voluntary-aided primary schools be included in the programme? Where they serve communities with open admissions, as is usually the case in rural areas, will they receive 100&nbsp;per cent. capital support or will they have to provide the capital element? That applies particularly to the Church of England, which is the main provider of primary education in rural areas. In other words, will the voluntary-aided capital programme and the capital programme for controlled schools come together?

<br>&nbsp;<br>difference as allowing children to be taught in small classes by qualified teachers supported by trained teaching assistants. The Prime Minister often boasts about what the private sector has to offer in education, but the key selling point in any independent prep school prospectus is not about buildings but about children being taught in small groups. That is because any parent or teacher believes, as all the research confirms, that giving children greater individual attention when they are developing their learning skills pays massive dividends in later learning.

 We would all agree that smaller class sizes are highly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desirable. However, as I am sure the hon.

<a name="stpa_92">The Government have done a good job as regards early years. We support the Sure Start programme, and it is good to hear Conservative Members say that they will support its continued roll-out. We support the extra 3,500&nbsp;early years centres by 2010, and that will certainly be in our manifesto. But I ask the Minister this: why compromise that huge achievement by moving children from groups of eight, or at the most 12, in nursery classes to groups of 30&nbsp;or more when they reach infant classes in primary schools? I think the hon. Gentleman would agree that that does not make sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_93">The School Standards and Framework Act 1998&nbsp;said that there could not be more than 30&nbsp;children in a class, but the response of the Department for Education and Skills to a recent parliamentary question shows that a significant numbers of classes in our infant schools have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than 30&nbsp;children in them. There are good explanations for that, so I do not think that schools are bypassing the policy. I think that there are about six categories under which children who arrive in an area may join a class and thus take its size above 30.

<p>
<a name="50321-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_94">If we are talking about investing billions of extra pounds into early years education, why compromise that if there is another way of achieving the objectives? Liberal Democrats have chosen to invest resources to reduce key stage 1&nbsp;infant class sizes to 20. That would require employing 15,000&nbsp;more infant teachers, so the project is large. We would pay for that by scrapping the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child trust fund. We have always made it clear that it is far better to invest in children when they are five and six than to give them something that they can cash in at the age of 18, so we have made a policy choice. We could use that &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion to give our youngest children the best chance that they have ever had at the beginning of their school careers.

 With due respect to the hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner), either we will have a sensible debate in the House on an important issue, or we will not. The hon.

The Government are putting more than &#163;9&nbsp;billion into a primary school build programme, so we would prioritise that and ensure that additional classrooms were available to accommodate additional teachers.

<a name="stpa_95">I also tell the hon. Lady that the demographic trend shows that the number of children coming into our primary schools is significantly down. Something in the region of 6,000&nbsp;classrooms and teachers will become available simply because of falling rolls. It is logical to the Liberal Democrats that rather than allowing those teachers simply to go out of the door through redundancy or retiring early, let us use them as part of our recruitment of 15,000&nbsp;teachers and ensure that they are working with our youngest children to give them the start in life that only the wealthy could afford in the past. The Conservative party and the Government might not accept that that would be a proper use of the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion that the Chancellor has set aside for the child trust fund,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Liberal Democrats will go into the election saying that giving children a flying start to their education is our priority.

I spoke at the conference about a policy of colleges for the future. The Liberal Democrats have always asked what is the point of renewing all the schools when what is often needed in communities is new colleges. To be fair, the Chancellor has come on to that ground and given an extra &#163;350&nbsp;million for the final two years of the spending review, which will make a total amount of &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion. That welcome new money should be seen as a down-payment. I hope that, when the Secretary of State makes her statement on skills at the Dispatch Box tomorrow, she will say more about that capital investment in our stock.

Those young people, who disproportionately come from poorer, less traditional and less affluent backgrounds, are short changed by the sum of approximately &#163;500&nbsp;a year&#151;a loss of some &#163;500,000&nbsp;to the average FE college.

Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) on 21&nbsp;February. When I challenged the Minister, he admitted in a parliamentary answer on 17&nbsp;March that he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had conveniently dealt with only part of the funding gap in his reply to the hon.

I hate to give succour to the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale, but these spiralling costs represent a real issue that needs to be addressed. There is no one else in the Chamber at the moment who sat on the Learning and Skills Bill Committee, but we were told at the time that huge savings would be made by moving from the Further Education Funding Council and the training and enterprise councils to the new Learning and Skills Council. However, in 2000&#151;the last year in which they operated&#151;the FEFC spent &#163;29&nbsp;million, and the TECs &#163;118&nbsp;million, on administrative costs. Yet, four years later, the administrative costs of the Learning and Skills Council have spiralled to &#163;330&nbsp;million. That is a huge additional cost, yet we were told in 2000&nbsp;that there would be a &#163;50&nbsp;million reduction as a result of the introduction of the LSC.

<a name="stpa_119">Let me make a few suggestions to the Treasury. Let me suggest a few fiscal measures designed to combat climate change. I am happy for us to maintain the climate change levy and the renewables obligation to promote energy conservation and the deployment of renewable energy, but I think we must enhance those measures considerably. We must beef up the renewables obligation, or lay on top of it something that is much more powerful in encouraging new, renewable, non-carbon-emitting electrical generation technologies into market deployment.

<a name="50321-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">The Royal Society recently suggested a carbon tax, and the Science and Technology Committee has suggested a comprehensive system involving a carbon tax and a carbon tax credit. Electrical generators emitting carbon dioxide would pay a carbon tax&#151;at present they constitute about 96&nbsp;per cent. of our generating capacity&#151;while generators that do not emit carbon dioxide and operate on the basis of renewable resources would receive a carbon tax credit.

<p>
<a name="50321-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">A carbon tax would generate the resources needed to supplement and speed up investment in renewable energy. This is not a stealth tax but a &quot;behaviour tax&quot;, which is intended to punish environmentally bad behaviour and to reward the good. We could profitably extend that principle throughout the whole range of environmental taxation; indeed, it is already embodied in some existing taxation measures.

<a name="50321-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">We must also address transport. We cannot go on not increasing what is, in effect, a carbon tax on fuel&#151;the fuel escalator&#151;year on year. To be fair, it was introduced by the Conservatives and I totally support it. We all know that it reached the limit of public acceptability a few years ago, since when the Treasury has been a little leery of increasing it. We are going to have to bite the bullet sooner or later and start progressively increasing it, but again, we can use corresponding carrots. For example, we can go further with lower taxation for environmentally friendly fuels, and we can probably do more to stimulate the production and sale of biofuels.

 I am very interested in what my hon. Friend is saying, which I broadly support.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, with which I broadly agree. There is a great deal more that we can do in terms of energy conservation, and in fact this Budget contains further measures to that end.

We should strongly encourage its use, and we need more fiscal measures to do so.

That is another awful technical difficulty to be overcome before we can achieve non-carbon-emitting aviation. I would like the Government to fund research into that subject in order to find a way forward.

 I am not saying that. If the hon.

Such a policy has been carefully set out by my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, building on the foundation of the thorough and detailed James review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">The fiscal deficit in the United Kingdom last year was greater than that of France, Germany, Italy and Canada. The deterioration in the UK&#039;s fiscal position since 1999&nbsp;is bigger than in any G7&nbsp;country. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund has advised that a cut in expenditure of &#163;12.5&nbsp;billion is required, equivalent to 3.5p on the basic rate of income tax; in other words, a fiscal adjustment of 1&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product&#151;an enormous sum. Almost all informed commentators have estimated growth forecasts below the Chancellor&#039;s, which currently stands at between 3&nbsp;and 3.5&nbsp;per cent. That is well above consensus expectations, which are much closer to between 2.5&nbsp;and 2.75&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">When I looked at the detail of the Chancellor&#039;s forecast I was shocked to see that growth in investment spending and exports looked wildly optimistic, at a figure of between 6.75&nbsp;and 7.25&nbsp;per cent. Even if we accept that world trade picked up last year, we see that UK exports grew by only 2.6&nbsp;per cent. The deteriorating budgetary position has been facilitated by two factors: faster than projected growth in spending and a shortfall in tax receipts. That shortfall was hardly surprising given that between 2001&nbsp;and 2003&nbsp;growth failed to reach 2.5&nbsp;per cent. per annum, on which the public finances arithmetic is based. Nothing was done when that growth figure was not hit. That is why public borrowing is deteriorating and the Chancellor has to keep revising his borrowing forecast.

<a name="stpa_135">It was clear from the Budget statement that the Chancellor had to start tightening his fiscal position immediately, which he supposedly did by penalising businesses such as the oil industry.

We cannot sustain a situation where there is an increasing tax burden, an unsustainable increase in public expenditure and increases in regulation and bureaucracy that make us less competitive in the global economy.

<a name="stpa_142">There has been virtually no progress on the former since the Government came to power and, without question, the labour market is less flexible, more bureaucratic and therefore less competitive than in 1997. I shall draw on some examples from my constituency. In rural and coastal Lincolnshire, we suffer from low aspiration at school, and when coupled with poor penetration from the higher and further education sectors, the work force struggle to upskill, thus exacerbating and perpetuating a low-skill, low-wage economy. Some 50&nbsp;per cent. of the work force have no qualifications, as opposed to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;national average of 29&nbsp;per cent.

<a name="stpa_143">I am pleased that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced that &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion would go into the FE sector. I hope that, unlike most of the Government&#039;s announcements, some of that money will find its way to my part of Lincolnshire, where people with a desire to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upskill will be able to do so. That factor, when coupled with poor access and the seasonality of employment, causes real socio-economic problems. In Ingoldmells, a resort just north of Skegness, there is a 600&nbsp;per cent. increase in unemployment out of season and a 30&nbsp;per cent. change each year in primary school rolls owing to seasonal fluctuations. That makes it even more disgraceful that the Government manipulate funding formulas and move resources away from Lincolnshire to shore up the Labour party&#039;s votes in its urban heartlands.

Secondly, there was no mention in the Chancellor&#039;s remarks that pensioners would get &#163;200&nbsp;off council tax for one year only. Thirdly, there was no mention that free bus travel would apply to off-peak tickets only. Fourthly, there was no mention that most of the money for the primary schools rebuilding programme has been announced already or that the relatively small additional sum would not be spent for another four years.

A lower than average number stay in education to the ages of 16&nbsp;to 19, and a much lower than average number go on to higher education. It is typical of urban and historically deprived constituencies, but that is only one part of the picture, because it is being transformed in part by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general improvement in our economic situation. Low interest rates have led to a boom in house prices and construction, and the increase in public sector investment in the past few years is beginning to show in schools, hospitals and the number of policemen, and general practitioners.

In my area it went down, despite claims that the economy expanded under the Tory Government. The fact that a number of then Cabinet Ministers are now leading the Tory party can give no confidence that in the unlikely event of the Tories being returned to power the situation would be any different.

I believe that there is a strong and legitimate case for the child trust fund in education. First, it involves that proportion of the electorate who do not have bank accounts and in areas such as my constituency that is 20&nbsp;per cent. of the electorate. The fund will provide a stake in the commercial world and with it an incentive for financial education, so that people understand and use that stake effectively. Without the child trust fund, that will not happen. Secondly, in the long term it will provide a fund that can be used for higher education. I have no doubt that if we are to reach our targets in higher education there must be a funding commitment, whatever party is in power.

The quality of pupils&#039; work, and its presentation, is also much improved, and that gives them a sense of self-esteem and self-worth.

<a name="stpa_158">I have a few comments about 14&#150;19&nbsp;education and the proposals outlined by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills recently. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am happy to say that my constituency still has a significant level of manufacturing employment of about 30&nbsp;per cent. However, manufacturers tell me that in spite of the general employment situation, they still face a skills shortage. They have real problems in getting young people to consider industry and manufacturing as a potential career. I hope that engaging industry in the formation of our vocational curriculum for the 14&#150;19&nbsp;age group will mean that that problem is adequately addressed.

We have to have a counter-revolution, because if we want this country to be successful and give industry the added value of our investment in education, we must ensure that some of those who benefit want to use it in the industrial and manufacturing context.

 I agree with my hon. Friend, but how do we overcome the problem that the really high salaries and the big money are earned in the City and in the financial sector, not in industry, which is much more vital for our economy?

 I must admit that the moving of people from my constituency to the City has not been a huge problem in the past. I would be happy if my constituents had the skills base to work in local industry where there is a skills deficit. However, I accept the broader point that my hon. Friend makes, although we should not assume that everybody is motivated purely by earning big money, in the City or elsewhere. Many people want to live in the west midlands and they want to contribute to industry, but salary levels have to be adequate and appropriate for the level of educational qualifications that employees possess. Of course, some 30&nbsp;years ago, people went straight from school at a young age into industry because salary levels were relatively good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_160">I emphasise the need to engage industry fully in the formation of the vocational curriculum, and we should consider pioneering ways in which industry and education can link up. If we are to enthuse people about going into science and industry, we need to start at primary, not secondary school level.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recently joined the Royal Society pairing scheme to try to get some insight into what was needed by the world of science. As somebody who forsook the study of science at the age of 14, it was a revelation to me to partner Dr. Laura O&#039;Neill, a stem cell research scientist at Birmingham university. I was amazed by the work being done. The people I met were very appreciative of the investment put into higher education, which has provided modern, state-of-the-art facilities at that university. Significantly, the number of foreign scientists attracted to work there&#151;by the facilities and the legal and ethical framework in this country&#151;included some American scientists.

Local authorities used to receive a HIP&#151;housing investment programme&#151;allocation for housing, but the Tories started to withdraw that. Various grants helped to keep rates down, but they were withdrawn on a large scale. In fact, capital programmes were capped. Those are the days that the Tories are harking back to, so they really cannot crow about their record in government. As has been said, they have an appalling record on the economy and on local government.

<a name="stpa_179">To strike a positive note, I shall turn to the Budget. Inflation has been about 3&nbsp;per cent. for eight years, which allows businesses and families to plan ahead. Families can acquire mortgages or take a holiday&#151;whatever they want to do with their money, they know that the economy has been steady for the past eight years with inflation at 3&nbsp;per cent. Businesses can look two, three or four years ahead and know how much they will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spend on investment. From that perspective, the Government cannot be faulted. Over the past eight years, mortgage rates have averaged 6.1&nbsp;per cent. Under the previous Government they reached 12&nbsp;per cent. On one occasion, in fact, they reached 18&nbsp;per cent. There is therefore a contrast between the way in which we run the economy and they way in which the Opposition did so.

I was in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liverpool, Wrexham and Andover over the weekend, and in all three places I found a rather muted response to the Budget. I am not sure that it has had huge political impact. It certainly has not kick-started the Government&#039;s flagging re-election campaign back into life, as many Labour Members may have hoped.

By and large, under the Tories it went down and under the Labour party it went up. Nowadays there is no single thermometer by which we can judge the Budget. Instead, there are hundreds of little sensors all over the body politic, all giving out slightly different signals. That makes the Budget much more difficult to interpret.

<a name="stpa_193">I do not say that as a criticism of the budgetary measures, but I do think that the move away from changing the rate, doing something significant about the allowances and focusing instead on micro-measures makes it more difficult for the public to read a new Labour Budget and come to a judgment about it.

That question has not been satisfactorily answered. Perhaps the Minister who winds up the debate will answer it.

<a name="stpa_197">May I offer, with respect, a word of caution to the Government regarding their boasts about public services, particularly the NHS? Many hospital trusts and primary care trusts in the south-east, especially in Hampshire, are running large deficits and are having to introduce financial recovery plans in order to balance the books. The Mid Hampshire NHS Primary Care Trust is looking at spending reductions of some &#163;14&nbsp;million. It has to save &#163;9.5&nbsp;million to deal with a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recurrent deficit and &#163;4.5&nbsp;million to deal with non-recurrent savings. It is looking at fewer staff, has not ruled out redundancies and is planning to reduce beds. That local debate, which I suspect is being reproduced elsewhere in the south-east, provides a rather discordant background to the harmonious noises that we have been hearing from Ministers about record investment in the health service. Once one nets off the impact of higher drug prices, reduced working hours for doctors and the high cost of recruiting temporary staff, the extra cash gets eaten into. Some of it is ring-fenced. Services that are not ring-fenced are the ones that are exposed to reductions in investment. NHS dentists, in Hampshire as in other parts of the country, are increasingly difficult to find.

This is not a new benefit, and there has been time for the take-up campaigns to kick in, but there is still a very low take-up, coupled with the horrendous complexity of filling in the forms and then operating the system.

But what about the single parent who has filled in the form correctly, gets incorrectly assessed and is overpaid, and is then told that she should have spotted the overpayment and that the money must be repaid? Then the payments stop, she cannot pay the childminder and has to give up the job, and is back where she started.

The Chancellor introduced that with a great fanfare in 2003, and such inner-city initiatives take time to bed down and get taken up. The wards that the scheme applied to were chosen by the Chancellor, and there may be developers who were induced to invest and develop and now find themselves some 4&nbsp;per cent. out of pocket.

I have no difficulty with that policy, but there is real concern that insufficient resources have been given to schools to enable them to pay other people to take over the classes that the teachers will no longer operate. I read in the press a few days ago that although head teachers had initially supported the policy, they were having second thoughts because it was under-resourced.

<a name="stpa_207">The Chancellor was right to outline the global competition that Britain faces. Members on both sides of the House have mentioned China and India as having the potential to become major economic superpowers in the next few decades. Economic growth rates, year on year, of some 10&nbsp;per cent. in India and China and their almost insatiable demand for raw materials will naturally have profound consequences for the UK economy. I am worried that that sustained burst of demand will increase the unit cost of raw materials throughout the globe and that that, in turn, will damage the robustness of the UK economy&#039;s ability to fend off inflation in the short to medium term.

<a name="stpa_208">I am equally worried that the low wages offered in those countries will mean that British firms will not be able to compete. I have been told that workers in many parts of the Chinese economy are paid the equivalent of 75p a day. We cannot compete with that rate, and nor should we want to. The British economy should be concentrating on high-skilled, high-value, high-technology companies, not sweat-shop labour. I shall return to that point later.

<a name="stpa_209">I am confident that the structural changes to the UK economy made in recent years will enable us to maintain this sustained period of economic stability. Several factors have produced that stability. First and foremost was the decision taken in the first few days of the Labour Administration in 1997&nbsp;to make the Bank of England independent. I do not wish to make petty party political points, much as I am tempted to. For example, I was impressed that the right hon. and learned Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who is not in the Chamber, introduced inflation targets when he was Chancellor, although the Conservative party now appears to despise targets as a means of improving performance.

I think that boring Budgets mean economic stability, so I would rather have them than exciting Budgets that reflect boom and bust and the stop-go economy of the 1980s and 1990s. That was my experience as I was growing up in my constituency. The Conservative Government of the 1980s decimated economic activity in Hartlepool and did that again in the early 1990s, so I would rather not have lessons in economic management and competence from the Conservative party. The fact remains that only a Labour Administration were bold enough to give the Bank of England independence, which was an important building block in helping to produce a stable and prudent economy.

<a name="50321-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_211">A second key factor that is often grossly overlooked is the decision taken in 1997&nbsp;to repay a substantial amount of the national debt. The figures provided by the Chancellor in his &quot;Financial Statement and Budget Report&quot; last week were impressive. National debt has reduced from 44&nbsp;per cent. of national income in 1997&nbsp;to 34&nbsp;per cent. today. Apparently we have repaid more debt in one year than the combined total of that repaid during the previous 50&nbsp;years. Debt interest repayments now represent the lowest share of our national income than at any time since 1915.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_212">The fact that our debt repayments have been substantially lowered has meant that the Government have had the flexibility and added receipts to invest in schools and hospitals. Rather than wasting revenue on loan repayments and unemployment benefits, which is what happened in the 1980s, the Government have had the foresight and ability to spend money on our children&#039;s education, our health and law and order. Surely everyone can welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_213">These factors, among others, have meant that the Government have presided over historically astonishing economic stability and growth. The International Monetary Fund report on the UK economy this month has been cited in some quarters as evidence that all the good work done in recent years will slide into an abyss. After reading the report, however, I do not share that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpretation. I see a British economy that is remarkably robust enough to withstand the shocks and uncertainties that the wider global economy will almost certainly throw at it. As the report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;The fiscal and monetary policy frameworks remain at the forefront of international best practice &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The economy remains enviably&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_215">That does not appear to paint a picture of a Chancellor who has squandered prudence. Instead it shows that he has put in place and consolidated long-term prosperity and stability as the centrepiece of his economic policy.

<a name="50321-22_para18">
<a name="stpa_216">I have never delivered a speech in the Budget debate before, so I did a bit of research by looking at previous debates, especially those held in 1997&nbsp;and 2001. When I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read the speeches made by Conservative Members, I was struck by their almost universal mantra that we were about to embark on a road of economic doom and gloom and imminent recession. Since 1997, the Chancellor has consistently been able to make a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="50321-22_para19">
<a name="stpa_217">I sincerely believe that the future of the British economy is with state-of-the-art technological companies and a highly skilled work force producing high-value products and services, such as disease-eliminating drugs arising from biotechnological advances and environmentally friendly energy sources that can be exported to the rest of the world. That is why the emphasis on research and development and science in the Budget is crucial to the long-term health of the British economy. Equally, the removal of regulation for our companies is a welcome step, and the principle that our well-run firms will be subject to less audit and inspection will go a considerable way towards ensuring that success and compliance with regulations are rewarded with freedom and flexibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-22_para20">
<a name="stpa_218">The fact that added emphasis is being given to enterprise and entrepreneurialism is also welcome. We need to have at the forefront of Government thinking the ways and means of educating and nurturing a highly skilled work force with the capacity to produce world-beating ideas.

<a name="stpa_219">By chance, on the day on which the Chancellor delivered his Budget statement, I met David Waddington, the incoming principal of Hartlepool college of further education. The college has been absolutely central in my constituency during recent years in raising aspirations and increasing the number of people in Hartlepool with qualifications. However, David expressed concern over a long-term trend of skilled and educated people leaving the town after receiving a qualification to take advantage of the vibrant economy in London and the south-east. The Hartlepool economy has come a long way in the past 10&nbsp;years, but I fear that a brain drain will result in fewer opportunities for prosperity in the town, which in turn will create the risk of higher dependency on benefits. Hartlepool people do not want handouts; they want the prospect of additional prosperity and stability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-22_para22">
<a name="stpa_220">There is evidence that that is happening, but I want it to go further and happen faster. The number of business start-ups in the town has recently increased massively after being decimated by the recession in the early 1990s, but we need many more businesses in my town to provide opportunities for wealth and employment creation. I urge the Chancellor to intervene, at least in the short term, to ensure that skills and qualifications obtained by Hartlepool people are rewarded with well-paid employment prospects and job opportunities in Hartlepool. We should continue to help businesses by putting in place the infrastructure necessary to compete with the rest of the country and the world, such as a direct, fast rail link to London and incentives for businesses to relocate to, or be established in, the town.

<a name="stpa_221">Other measures in the Budget will greatly help my constituents. The doubling of the value at which stamp duty is paid should have a positive effect on the Hartlepool housing market, in which most properties fall within the &#163;60,000&nbsp;to &#163;120,000&nbsp;price range. That will enable more people in the town to own their own homes and move further up the property ladder. I am slightly concerned that the move will accelerate still further

<a name="stpa_222">It almost goes without saying that the extension of tax credits and help for pensioners will greatly assist hard-working families and older people in Hartlepool. The fact that the tax credits mean that a family with two children starts to pay income tax only on income above &#163;21,200&nbsp;will have a hugely positive effect on the majority&#151;the absolute majority&#151;of my constituents, because average earnings in Hartlepool remain below the national average.

<a name="stpa_223">I found a hugely important statistical table in this week&#039;s edition of <i>The Economist</i> showing the effects of the Labour Government&#039;s Budgets between 1997&nbsp;and 2004, especially on the income of the richest and poorest in our society. It showed that the net income of the poorest 20&nbsp;per cent. had increased by some 8&nbsp;per cent. over that period, while the richest 10&nbsp;per cent. had experienced a relative fall in their net income of about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;per cent. I believe passionately that such a redistributionist economic policy, which flattens economic and financial inequalities in our society while encouraging and rewarding enterprise, is exactly what a Labour Administration should be pursuing.

Productivity growth in the public services has been reducing, as shown by the reports of the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Commission.

It was the fad and fashion of the time. We are the generation that did not have technology in schools but have survived quite well. Often, the argument for the necessity for such technology is, &quot;Oh they&#039;ll need it to get a job; they&#039;ll need it in the workplace.&quot; And of course it is now commonplace for people in the work place to have to develop computer skills.

<a name="stpa_243">I also want to say that the Tory comments about there being a black hole in Treasury accounts really are nonsense. Compared with the past&#151;this point has been made by my noble Friends in the other place&#151;our deficits and surpluses are negligible and of small account. Britain has a much stronger economy, with lower gross borrowing and gross debt than any other country in the developed world, and has been a tremendous economic success, perhaps in contrast with what went on in the 1980s.

<a name="50321-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_244">The important thing is to keep the economy buoyant, not to worry too much about 0.5&nbsp;per cent. more inflation. Is that dangerous talk? I do not know, but 0.5&nbsp;per cent. more inflation is far less important than maintaining high employment, high growth and high prosperity.

<a name="stpa_245">It is another Tory myth that this country is highly taxed. That is just not true. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development table shows that our tax burden, as it is called, is much lower than that in most of the most developed countries. The idea that low taxation is somehow essential for a successful economy is, again, complete nonsense. The two strongest economies, arguably, are Sweden and Norway, which have some of the highest taxation in the world. Indeed, Sweden is the highest taxed in the world, but it is competitive and prosperous with a strong welfare state. If I had to wish Britain to drive in any particular direction, it would be that of Sweden.

<a name="stpa_246">Interestingly, at the last general election, Sweden&#039;s Conservative party chose to campaign on tax cuts and spending cuts. It was rejected by the electorate and that campaign helped the Social Democrats to get back into power. Indeed, the Swedish Conservative party has

<a name="stpa_247">So, Sweden is ahead of us. The difference between Swedish and British taxation is of the order of 15&nbsp;per cent. of GDP, which is a staggering amount&#151;more than &#163;150&nbsp;billion a year. I am not suggesting that we suddenly start to have Swedish levels of tax, but there is scope for a little more taxation&#151;particularly for the rich, provided it is progressive&#151;and for a little more spending on the things we think are important. Norway, compared with Britain, has an extra &#163;90&nbsp;billion of tax. The figures for Norway are quite a long way from those for Sweden, but it still has a strong economy.

The only point on which I agree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) is that we at least can choose our own economic policy in Britain&#151;our Chancellor and the Bank of England are doing very well in that respect&#151;and we do not have to submit to the mistaken policies of the European Central Bank and, indeed, the European Commission.

<a name="stpa_257">I come to some good news, which is what the Government have done for primary education. That is where we have had our problems. For years, our party argued endlessly about secondary education and ignored primary, relatively speaking, yet it is in primary where basic reading and mathematical skills are learned. It is those schools that were failing: children were getting to secondary school and finding that they could not do mathematics and had poor literacy. They would fail from there onwards.

We have a problem with that cohort of children and young people still going through education, who are possibly in their late teens, who suffered the worst of the starved education system 10&nbsp;to 12&nbsp;years ago. They missed out on what young children are getting now, and it is a shame that they cannot go back and take advantage of what is happening now. When that cohort has gone through&#151;we will do our best to make sure that they get the adult education or whatever training that they need later&#151;and the new cohort goes through the 14&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;system, we will see dramatic improvements, some of which are already taking place.

We used to do experiments by putting those people together in liberal studies classes, and the tensions and frictions were extraordinary. That was 30&nbsp;years ago, and I hope that things have got better since, but we have a deeply divided society, which is reflected more in attitudes and education than in any other way.

We have not got transfer to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondary schools right, and a lot of children go backwards in their first two or three terms at secondary school.

William Vickrey had the rather good idea that in an auction the person who wins should pay the price put forward by the under-bidder. In terms of politics, that is indicated in the current Government saying that they would adopt the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative plans for public spending for the first two years, which is one of the foundations of the relative economic prosperity.

The documents produced by the Treasury at the time of the Budget made no distinction, in terms of time, between the &#163;200&nbsp;for retired households on council tax and the free bus travel, but we now know that the council tax concession is for a year. Will Ministers tell us why none of the three or four references to that concession includes that information? Did they decide to make the concession apply for only one year after the papers had been published, or did they deliberately arrange it so that people would mislead themselves when they heard what the Chancellor had to say and read the newspapers?

 Was it not the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party that put the uniform business rate in the hands of central&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government? Would not handing it back to local authorities be one way of achieving what he wants?

 There may or may not be arguments in favour of that, but it would certainly not provide a buoyant system of revenue for local government. Buoyant revenues are income tax, fuel duty, penalty taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and so on. VAT, for that matter, is a buoyant source of revenue; but the business rate on its own is not.

 Yes. Let me also say that Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives could not have saved the country in 1979&nbsp;if there had been many more than 11&nbsp;Liberal Members of Parliament. The politics are very simple, as are the arguments about council tax. There were too many Labour Members of Parliament. If we ask when people last voted Liberal as an answer to any serious national problem, the generous answer is 1906.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Conservatives, we are at our best the national interest party&#151;that is, part international, part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;national, part local. I shall be happy to debate the details of council tax for the next three weeks, if the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;election is going to happen when it is expected.

Under this Government, the household saving ratio is less than 6&nbsp;per cent., yet when the Conservatives were in government it was 9&nbsp;or 10&nbsp;per cent. Saving is even more important than people&#039;s assets rising simply because of house price inflation. I look forward to the day when a Chancellor will say, &quot;I have been successful in encouraging people to save voluntarily and in increasing the savings ratio to 10&nbsp;per cent. or more.&quot;

 I begin by saying how much I enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to pay him a compliment, although he may not look on it in that way. If I had listened to his speech on the radio, I would have found it very difficult to decide which side of the political divide he is on; long may that continue. I should also like to endorse what he said about the Woodcraft Folk. As he rightly says, the Government should revisit that decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_281">Of course, being on the Labour side of the political divide, I greatly welcome the Budget, and for several reasons, the first of which is the promise that it holds out for a number of key groups in our society, including pensioners, savers, single parents&#151;they have not been mentioned much today; indeed, they rarely get a mention&#151;and first-time buyers, who have been referred to consistently throughout. Secondly, as Members of all parties have pointed out, and as it is important to stress, the Budget provides a modest fiscal tightening, which is characteristic of this Chancellor. It is a prudent Budget and stability is at its very centre. That is key to what we are trying to achieve, but we also want economic growth and to improve living standards for the people of this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_282">I want to address some of the criticisms that I have heard from the Opposition not just today but in the past few days&#039; discussion of the Budget. Although it has been rather grudgingly admitted that the Budgets between 1997&nbsp;and 2001&nbsp;were good, it has been argued that, miraculously, those between 2001&nbsp;and now were comprehensively bad. I want to examine the impact of all those Budgets on the real economy, because that is what affects our constituents. Employment has been much commented on today, and we should note that we have the highest employment rate on record. The current employment rate is nearly 75&nbsp;per cent., which is one of the highest figures internationally. That is a major success story for this Chancellor and for the past eight Budgets. Of course, we also have the lowest unemployment rate for some 30&nbsp;years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_283">According to the new measure, inflation is running at 1.6&nbsp;per cent., and it will drift up slowly to the target figure of 2&nbsp;per cent. by 2006. Of course, the fact that that is the lowest figure for 30&nbsp;years endorses the decision taken very early on by this Government to make the Bank of England independent. That decision has also resulted in the lowest interest rates for 35&nbsp;years, from which this country&#039;s 18&nbsp;million home owners have directly benefited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_284">Growth&#151;the usual measure of economic success&#151;was 3.1&nbsp;per cent. in 2004, despite the fact that almost every single independent forecaster predicted that it would be much lower. This year, the figure will be 3&nbsp;to 3.5&nbsp;per cent., and next year it will be 2.5&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;per cent. Each of those figures is above the economy&#039;s trend growth rate and better than other comparable European countries&#039; growth rates. Indeed, our economy even grew during the international recession of 2001&#150;02. Ours is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 675</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>therefore a record to compare with anyone&#039;s. The icing on the cake is the fact that living standards in this country since 1997&nbsp;have improved by 50&nbsp;per cent. on average. By anybody&#039;s judgment, that must be a record to be proud of.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_285">The Tories claim that all this is the result of the prudent measures implemented by former Conservative Chancellors; indeed, one Member even claimed his small share of the credit for the benign economy this afternoon. I am surprised that even the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)&#151;he is not with us this afternoon&#151;has not laid claim to some of the credit for the benefits that the economy has delivered. It is natural that the Tories would want to claim part of the glory, but they cannot then continually take great delight in telling us, &quot;You&#039;ve been in government for eight years. You have to accept responsibility for the decisions taken during that time.&quot; We do: we accept responsibility for the good economy, as is right and proper. It is also right and proper to point out that the mid-1990s&#151;during which time two Conservative Chancellors introduced new policies&#151;signalled the end of a very deep recession, so growth was almost certain to happen at that stage. The unique trick of this Chancellor and this Government in the past eight years has been to sustain growth, stability and improvement in the real economy. That has to be recognised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_286">I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) that there has been a lot of alarmist talk about the economy, not just from the official Opposition but from both Opposition parties. They have taken great delight in highlighting the most pessimistic forecasts of the so-called independent forecasters, even though they have been consistently inferior to the Treasury&#039;s. There is also the myth of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so-called black hole, which, according to the Opposition, has existed for many years. However, it looks almost certain that when the current economic cycle comes to an end, the Chancellor will easily meet his fiscal rules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_287">The negative impact of increased interest rates has been focused on, yet it is clear that there is significant international confidence in the UK economy. Money continues to flow into our economy, perhaps partly because of the malaise in the eurozone and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficulties currently experienced by Japan. The American economy is obviously doing well in attracting significant funding, but the UK economy continues to enjoy the confidence of the international community. There is no reason to think that that will change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_288">What really stuck in the Opposition&#039;s craw was having to give credit to the Chancellor and the Treasury for the fact that their forecasts have continuously and significantly outperformed those of the so-called independent research bodies. Everyone, including the Chancellor, would have to accept that forecasting anything further than a year or two into the future is a very shaky business. Of course, we have annual Budgets and a pre-Budget statement in order to be able to take into account any difficulties that might emerge in the national or international economy, and that is what we would do, should those circumstances arise.

According to the Budget statement, &#163;2&nbsp;billion has been saved through value-for-money studies and another &#163;2&nbsp;billion through improvements in procurement. Several posts have disappeared and are now being reallocated to front-line services. However, the Gershon review is predicated on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the view that delivery at the front line should not be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put at risk. That differs from the so-called James review, which Conservative Members mentioned. When Gershon was asked about the figures in the James review, he raised the question of whether it would be able to deliver on front-line services. I ask the same question again this evening: will it deliver?

</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_290">The other key question is where the &#163;35&nbsp;billion-worth of cuts will come from. We already know that the Tories are going to pinch the Gershon review&#039;s &#163;21&nbsp;billion or so savings and redirect them into front-line services, but that still leaves &#163;14&nbsp;billion unaccounted for. We know that the Conservatives&#151;supposedly members of a party that proclaims itself a great supporter of small business&#151;are prepared to cut the Small Business Service. They are also prepared to cut the new deal. We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all know that they do not care about youth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unemployment; frankly, they do not care about unemployment at all. As a former Tory Chancellor said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unemployment is a price well worth paying.

<a name="50321-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_291">Added to that &#163;14&nbsp;billion under the James review, the shadow Chancellor announced a further &#163;35&nbsp;billion-worth of cuts for the future. We have absolutely no idea where those cuts will come from. It was argued earlier that &#163;11&nbsp;billion or &#163;12&nbsp;billion was an enormous amount, so we should remember that &#163;35&nbsp;billion-worth of cuts, even if spread over a number of years, would have an enormous impact on our economy. If we do not find out where those cuts will fall, we shall have to assume that front-line services such as education and health will be affected.

We have heard a lot in the past few days about the mythical so-called black hole, but the Chancellor&#039;s forecast in the Budget is that at the end of this economic cycle, under the golden rule, we shall be at least &#163;6&nbsp;billion in surplus.

The reduction in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of regulatory bodies&#151;we shall have to see how it pans out in the future&#151;is also very welcome to the business community. Speaking as a member of the Regulatory Reform Committee, I accept that we have to change the culture in Whitehall and get it to think about reducing regulation as well as increasing it. Only when we have institutionalised that here at Westminster will we get the changes that we want.

We have invested substantially in recent years, and it is pleasing to see that public investment will rise from 2&nbsp;per cent. to 2.25&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product in the next couple of years. Over the next few years, a brand new hospital will be built in the most deprived part of north London, which lies in my constituency, and a second hospital in my local authority area will receive significant investment in new facilities.

The Budget particularly highlighted the &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; initiative, which is an exciting prospect that should help to deliver a completely refurbished secondary sector and additional improvements to the primary sector. It amounts to &#163;9.4&nbsp;billion-worth of investment over the next five years, which will make a significant difference.

We need more comprehensive reform, however, and I hope that once the general election is out of the way the Treasury will consider the matter more seriously.

For some considerable years, increases in the unified business rate have been held to the rate of inflation. Such increases are no longer sustainable, and I hope that the Government will seriously consider, in discussion with the business community, its contribution in the future.The second issue is the regressive nature of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;council tax.

 I may have inadvertently said something that I did not intend, but I have not called for the abolition of the unified business rate and we need to continue to look at the return to local level. What I was calling for is a greater contribution from the business community towards the overall funding of local government, but the point that my hon.

<a name="stpa_307">Finally, I am sure that when the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) speaks on behalf of the Conservative party, he will have not only the Budget but the forthcoming election in mind, as have Labour Members. This modest Budget continues the path of stability and growth set by previous Budgets. It provides investment in our public services into the future, which is critical, and gives us a platform to show what the Government have done for the economy and public services, in contrast to the proposals of the two major Opposition parties. The public will see that we have a good Budget and a Government who can be trusted with the future.

 I shall confine my comments almost exclusively to early years education, which is important. In his Budget statement 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 681</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Chancellor promised 1&nbsp;million child care places over the next five years, but it was not clear how many of those places would be for early years education. We must put the figure in context because since 1997&nbsp;there has been an estimated 22&nbsp;per cent. fall in places in playgroups and pre-schools and a 24&nbsp;per cent. fall in child minder places. The greatest increase in places has been for out-of-school and holiday child care where there has been an increase of 134&nbsp;per cent., but pre-school child care provision is falling in many areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_308">Early years provision comes in many guises: child minders, cr&#232;ches, play groups, Sure Start and a range of nurseries, including workplace, private, charity and those attached to primary schools. That diversity is important because it caters for a wide range of need. Working parents need a safe place for their children, run by kind, responsible people. Some parents simply want an opportunity for their children to socialise, to meet and play with other children and to get used to other adults. Others want their children to get a head start in learning before they go to school. Single parents may need more support with parenting skills and social problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_309">When early years education is discussed the emphasis is often on eligibility, cost and the level of supply. It sometimes sounds as though the provision is for the convenience of parents so that they can go to work. In whatever setting a young child is placed, the priority should be on the quality of provision, the benefit to the child and what the child gets out of it. Early years placements are not warm storage with lunch until the child is collected at the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_310">I have discussed early years provision with a range of providers: private nurseries, primary school nurseries, child minders, the National Day Nurseries Association and the National Campaign for Real Nursery Education. There are many examples of good practice and a good deal of consensus on what very young children need to give them the best start in primary school when formal learning begins. We will give primary schools direct control over their finances to spend as they know best.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_311">Many children are lucky and have parents who talk to them, teach them good manners, play with them, eat with them at a table when the day&#039;s experiences are discussed, and read to them. Any parent who has read a bedtime story to a child knows what a rewarding experience that is. Other children are not so lucky and come from homes where there are no books, meal times are informal and the television is permanently on. The communication of such children is often delayed due to lack of the right experiences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_312">I was in an infants school recently where one third of the children have special educational needs. They had been asked to write about their morning. The school learned that a significant number of those children get themselves up in the morning, wash themselves, dress themselves, make their own breakfast&#151;or not&#151;and when it is time for school they wake their mother and ask to be taken to school. It is very useful for infant teachers to have that sort of information, so that they understand the level of responsibility that is sometimes put on extremely young children.

<a name="50321-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_313">Early years settings are useful for the early identification of special educational needs and speech and language difficulties. Whatever the type of early years setting, it is where children can learn their social and interpersonal skills, learning through play, singing, acting and games, creative activities and exploring the outdoor environment. Learning to give and take, share, be part of a group and to accept authority without feeling the need to kick against it are all essential life skills. People who do not have them often have a difficult journey through life and, more particularly, children who do not have them often have problems in school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_314">The Government have announced that there will be five Sure Start children&#039;s centres in every constituency by 2010. I have a very good centre in Harold Hill, the most deprived ward in my constituency. It is doing extremely good work and provides wonderful support for those parents who need it, some of whom are very young single mothers who are barely out of childhood themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_315">However, I have two concerns about children&#039;s centres. The first has been raised with me by the National Day Nurseries Association, which feels that ideally every children&#039;s centre should have a nursery school incorporated in it. Some do not at the moment and provide only social support. The other is that children&#039;s centres may squeeze out other providers, but it is important that a range of provision is available. Not all parents have social problems and need all the additional services provided by Sure Start, but they do want a nursery place. We need to ensure that the closure of other child care places is no longer a consequence of opening new Sure Start facilities, as was reported by the National Audit Office statistics in 2003. For every child care place the Government have created, another has closed down elsewhere. Valuable though Sure Start is, it should not be the only type of child care on offer. The different types of child care&#151;provided by the state, the private sector, voluntary organisations, charities and faith groups&#151;must all coexist without Sure Start being predatory on the others. Already, many new providers do not last beyond their start-up funds. That causes instability in the system and is very unsettling for young children who have to move away from the place where they are happy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_316">The cost of child care is a major problem for the very parents who need a second income to make ends meet. Child care in Britain is still the most expensive in Europe. A nursery place costs the average household one quarter of its total income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_317">The Chancellor announced that the child element of the child tax credit will increase in line with average earnings up to 2007&#150;08. But one increase in just one element of the tax credits will do nothing to stop the chaotic tax credits system from putting thousands of families into financial insecurity and hardship each year. One in every five tax credit claims received by the Inland Revenue is processed incorrectly and up to &#163;700&nbsp;million a year is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overpaid in error. Overpayments are later clawed back by the Inland Revenue, leaving thousands of families in &quot;significant financial hardship&quot;&#151;according to the 2004&nbsp;parliamentary ombudsman&#039;s annual report.

The system is far too complex and needs reform to make it easier to administer, so people can make some sort of judgment about whether the tax credit they receive is right or not.

 My hon. Friend will not be surprised to learn of a case in my constituency of a mother who is faced with the recovery of tax credit. The process began in August last year.

 I am following what the hon. Lady is saying and I have great sympathy with her point.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. I agree absolutely; the repayments are often unmanageable. It is galling for people to be told by the Inland Revenue, &quot;Yes, it is our fault, but it is your fault for not knowing that it is our fault.&quot; I ask the Minister to bring pressure to bear not only to simplify the system but to overcome that basic problem.
</p>

<a name="50321-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_320">A Conservative Government will allocate more funding to early-years partnerships with parents, Sure Start programmes and the national parenting fund, to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support parenting programmes provided by the voluntary and community sectors.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_321">I believe passionately that if we get early years right, the long-term benefits will be felt throughout the education system. If every child who enters primary school is self-confident, socially well adjusted and ready to learn, the job of their teachers will be so much easier. Teachers will be able to concentrate on teaching. Of course children will have differing ability levels, but they will all have the opportunity to develop to their individual full potential. The knock-on benefit of successful primary education would then be felt in the secondary sector with, I predict, fewer disruptive or disaffected teenagers and the consequential early retirement of demoralised teachers.
</p>

<p>

One teacher of senior boys said, &quot;Some of these boys are bigger than me and they have attitude, and I am not even allowed to adopt what is described as an aggressive stance towards them&#151;and they know it.&quot; That simply has to stop. The awful thing was that he added that a lot of his colleagues were also planning to retire. That large school will see an exodus of experienced staff and therefore an influx of less experienced staff, who will not have more experienced teachers as mentors and role models. That could have a serious effect on the overall management and on attainment levels in the school.

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_323">Getting early years right is not a panacea&#151;life is more complicated than that. The education system cannot make up for all the problems that a child might have, but it can make a major impact. Early years must not drop down the list of priorities to make room for after-school clubs and holiday care. I hope that the Minister will take up that point specifically in his summing up.

 One of the issues that will be at the core of the debate over the next few weeks is how we improve our public services. One reason why people question the growing burden of taxation is that, although they have seen their taxes rise over the past eight years, it is difficult to discern the improvement in our public services.

<a name="stpa_326">Council tax bills have risen by 70 per cent. since the Government came to office. The Chancellor&#039;s one-year-only council tax rebate is a bribe or a con&#151;people know that their bills have gone up because of the transfer of resources from the south to the north. In south-east Hampshire there is greater pressure on our infrastructure as a consequence of housing developments. Major routes such as the M27, the A27 and the A32 are clogged up at rush hour as more and more people seek to use the same stretch of road. There have been no major road schemes in Hampshire, however, for the past five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_327">People want to know where the money has gone and how their increased taxes have been spent. Part of the answer concerns the way in which the Government have sought to manage and control public services. We have witnessed the development of a tight, rigid, centrally driven and controlled framework that has absorbed money in the processes of monitoring, recording, inspection. I shall give some examples, to demonstrate where the money goes on many occasions. Late last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year, the Government produced an outcomes framework for their Green Paper, &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. It is a complex document that sets out various 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 685</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>outcomes, inspection criteria and public service agreement targets. There are 26&nbsp;PSA targets for the agenda of &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; involving nine Government Departments and agencies, ranging from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Crown Prosecution Service. In addition, there are 18&nbsp;key indicators and 52&nbsp;separate inspection criteria. The targets range from targets to reduce child obesity and mortality to targets on the take-up of cultural and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sporting opportunity by over-16s and on the number of young people taking part in mock elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_328">There is clearly a mechanism in the 24,000&nbsp;schools throughout the country to count the number of people who vote in mock elections. The bureaucracy involved in analysing and reporting on those inspection targets sucks money out of front-line services, and prevents improvements from being made to our schools, hospitals, and in terms of safety on the streets. Last year, the Government decided to draw some of those measures together, and I shall demonstrate the extent of the burden. A document that accompanied last year&#039;s Budget was entitled &quot;Devolving decision making: 1. Delivering better public services: refining targets and performance management.&quot; Chart 2.6&nbsp;in chapter 2&nbsp;sets out the number of targets and external controls facing the health service. The number of external controls on front-line health staff is 17&nbsp;times greater than the number of headline public service agreements. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;PSAs, 23&nbsp;PSA components and a further 58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA-related targets, measures and compliance requirements. In total, there are 81&nbsp;PSA-related targets measures and a further 125&nbsp;targets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_329">In education, there are six PSA targets, 27&nbsp;PSA components and a further 13&nbsp;PSA-related targets, measures and compliance requirements. There is a total of 40&nbsp;PSA-related targets and, in addition, there are 167&nbsp;non-PSA-related targets, measures and compliance requirements. Paragraph 2.26&nbsp;says that the number of external controls facing police forces &quot;follow a similar pattern&quot;. It is not surprising that the chief constable of Nottinghamshire police was moved in last weekend&#039;s press to complain about the amount of paperwork with which his force has to deal. This week, the chief constable of Surrey police said that about 90&nbsp;per cent. of police officers&#039; time is taken up in some shape or form with targets, monitoring and reporting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_330">If the Government were serious about the agenda set out in the Red Book, we would see a reduction in the number of targets, but I do not believe the Government are serious. They set out in the Red Book their plans to merge a number of inspectorates and replace them with a thematic inspector to look after a number of areas. They refer to creating a single justice and community safety inspectorate, bringing together five existing inspectorates. But merging all those inspectorates is not the way to cut down the burden of inspection. What people want is a more streamlined inspection process, not the old process re-badged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_331">The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) spoke hopefully about the reduction of bureaucracy. He ought to bear in mind that the Chancellor has spoken of a reduction in bureaucracy in a number of Budgets, yet has conspicuously failed to deliver a reduction in red tape. If people in our public services believe that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 686</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>merging of inspectorates will result in less bureaucracy, they should listen to people in business to find out how hollow those claims are likely to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_332">The problem is not just the targets and the bureaucracy, but how decisions are made in our public services. Too many decisions are taken not out on the front line, but centrally. We gain a remarkable insight into the way the Government&#039;s mind works in the Red Book, in the chapter entitled &quot;Delivering High Quality Public Services.&quot; The Government have a curious view of the role of professionals in public services. They say, perhaps with a note of surprise:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;Engaging the knowledge and experience of public service professionals in the design of public services has the potential to make services more efficient and tailored to users&#039; needs. In developing future public service reforms, the Government will examine the way in which employees&#039; and professionals&#039; input is used in the design of policy and the provision of services, ensuring a constant flow of information and ideas between policy-makers and the front line.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_333">Most professionals in our public services assume that to date the flow of information has been in one direction&#151;from the centre to the front line&#151;and has not been an exchange of views.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_334">It is breathtaking that a few weeks before the general election, in their eagerness to address the concerns of professionals, the Government suddenly realise that professionals can make services more efficient and can ensure that those services are tailored to the needs of users. If we free our doctors, nurses, teachers and police to deliver the services that local people want, we will see a transformation in our public services. Too often the problem is that the Government decide that there is a one-size-fits-all solution to the needs of every part of the country, not recognising that the needs of Fareham, for example, are quite different from the needs of a community in the north-east. If we do not free up professionals to make those decisions on the ground, we are unlikely to get the public services that individual communities need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_335">The issue is not just the role of professionals in helping to deliver better public services. In paragraph 6.35&nbsp;the Red Book refers to involving users in the delivery of public services. It states that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;the Government aims to involve users more closely in the design, delivery and governance of public services, recognising their critical role as co-producers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_336">But involving people in the design of public services is about more than getting them involved in the governance of local services. What is needed is an extension of choice in many areas of public services, to enable users to tailor the services to meet their needs&#151;to give parents the power to choose the school that best fits the needs of their child, or to give patients the opportunity to choose a hospital that has a lower rate of hospital infection, a shorter waiting list for a particular condition or a consultant with an excellent record in a particular condition, rather than being forced, as they are now, to go to the hospital that their primary care trust has a contract with, even though that hospital might not be the right one to meet their needs.

 My hon. Friend has hit the button precisely. There is a world of difference between a member of public being able to sit on a governing body, whether of a school or a foundation hospital, and

<br>&nbsp;<br>his having the ability to choose the hospital that best delivers his needs. Is it not astonishing that we expect people to go through the bureaucratic procedures of involvement in governance when they could go through the so much simpler procedures of having the opportunity to decide where to obtain the service that they want?
</p>








<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50321-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In reality, there is no substitute for choice in terms of delivering the service that people want. If they are able to choose their child&#039;s school or the hospital in which to have their operation, services will be tailored to match their needs. Too often, involvement in boards and other forms of governance is seen as a substitute for real choice in our public services. Placing too much emphasis on that puts us in danger of taking away the most simple mechanisms for people to ensure that their wishes can be heard, their views expressed and their voices listened to directly by organisations, instead of having them ignored or ridden over roughshod by public bodies and by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_337">This Government have been a tremendous example of the way in which services can be run on the basis of a single sense of direction that is determined from Whitehall, not at a local level. As a result, priorities are not set in our local communities. Parents do not have the choice of schools that they believe that they should, but are forced to choose from a very narrow range with their choices restricted by a Government who have a clear sense that what they believe is right. That arrogance of centralised direction and control has absorbed much of the money that they have raised from taxpayers. The &quot;Government knows best&quot; approach stifles much of what is done well in our public services. In recent weeks, I have talked to teachers who feel as though they have become de-professionalised&#151;that there is so much that they are told to do by central Government that they are moving away from being professionals towards being technicians. Many in the public sector worry that they are losing their autonomy and sense of decision making as individuals because of the way in which the Government, through public service agreements, targets, monitoring and control, have sought to remove some of their discretion and independence in improving public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_338">If we strip out much of the bureaucracy in Government, we can afford to spend more on our front-line services. We can ensure that our doctors, nurses and teachers&#151;all those in the front line&#151;have the opportunity to mould services in the interests of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people who use their hospitals and schools and want safer streets. If we strip away that bureaucracy and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centralised direction, we will have an opportunity to develop a pattern of provision that meets local needs and responds to what is happening on the ground, instead of whatever is the current priority in Whitehall. That will allow resources to be spent where it matters and drive the improvement in our public services that so many people are waiting for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_339">Our approach to public services distinguishes us from Labour. We will give power to professionals and choice to patients and parents.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centralising agenda that has demoralised our professionals and angered our constituents, who cannot see where their taxes have gone.

Our future deliberations will be the poorer for his not being present to participate in them. Perhaps his good friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will be kind enough to pass that message on.

He then pointed out quickly that what the Government had said last week had already been qualified in the Red Book that was published only a few hours thereafter.

<a name="stpa_369">One of the most worrying aspects of the Budget is that it fails to address the serious black hole in the public finances. Despite all the brave words about never taking chances with them, the Red Book represents a fiscal tightening of just over &#163;250&nbsp;million, which does virtually nothing to plug the black hole that persists at the heart of the Chancellor&#039;s finances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_370">Almost all the major independent economic forecasters&#151;the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the ITEM Club, which uses the independent Treasury economic model&#151;agree, and all concur that the black hole exists to the point that, if Labour was somehow to be re-elected, the inevitable consequence would be major tax rises to try to fill that hole.

<a name="50321-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_371">As David Smith noted in <i>The Sunday Times</i> yesterday:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;For Brown, part of the aim of last week&#039;s budget was political, though mostly it was to focus attention on the long-term challenges facing Britain. But he also hoped to bury doubts about the public finances and switch the spotlight to Tory plans. In that respect the Budget was a failure&quot;.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_372">The Chancellor and his allies like to claim that he has an impressive record for forecasting. That is half wrong and half right. His growth forecasts have indeed tended to be accurate, but his deficit forecasts have been just the opposite, and have increased by some &#163;6&nbsp;billion since the last Budget alone. The Chancellor is now projected to run a Budget deficit of some &#163;34&nbsp;billion this year, and over the next six years combined that amounts to an eye-watering &#163;168&nbsp;billion of expenditure over revenue, even without including all the off balance sheet debt. Therefore, whatever his record on forecasting growth might be, the emperor has no clothes when it comes to forecasting accurately the state of the public finances.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_373">Another thing that we have learned about the Chancellor&#039;s Budgets is that we always need to read the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small print. When we do so, it provides some fascinating information. For instance, his council tax discount applies only for one year. Page 187&nbsp;of the Red Book shows clearly that it applies in 2005&#150;06, but the corresponding figures for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&nbsp;are zero. It is therefore a one-off bribe designed purely to get Labour through the election, whereas our discount of 50&nbsp;per cent. off a household bill up to a maximum of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;500&nbsp;per household is for multiple years, not just one. No wonder <i>The Sun</i> responded to the Chancellor&#039;s Budget the following morning with the headline, &quot;Beware the bribes of March&quot;.

<a name="stpa_377">At the heart of this Budget statement has been the Chancellor&#039;s confirmation that the UK is enjoying the longest period of economic growth and stability since records began. While every other major developed country experienced at least one quarter of negative growth in the recent world downturn, Britain did not. Instead, Britain is the only G7&nbsp;economy to have grown in every quarter since 1997. In 2004, we saw the economy grow by more than 3&nbsp;per cent. for the second year running. That was exactly in line with the forecast that we first made two years ago. We entered 2005&nbsp;with the same growth forecast of between 3&nbsp;and 3.5&nbsp;per cent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, the hon.

<a name="50321-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_379">Stability is not just a concern for economists&#151;it helps families, it helps business, it helps Governments to plan for the future. It also reduces costs, because it leads to lower inflation and lower interest rates. Britain has simply not been used to the stability that we have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the economy since 1997. Between 1979&nbsp;and 1997&nbsp;Britain was the least stable and most volatile&#151;rather than the most stable and least volatile&#151;economy in the G7. During those 18&nbsp;years under the Tories, the inflation rate was double the rate since 1997. Interest rates had doubled, millions were consigned to negative equity, and unemployment hit 3&nbsp;million not once but twice. Since 1997&nbsp;inflation has been the lowest for 30&nbsp;years, interest rates are the lowest for 35&nbsp;years, employment is the highest ever, and living standards have risen by an average of 3&nbsp;per cent. every year in the last eight years under a Labour Government.

<p>
<a name="50321-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_380">A strong economy is the basis for sound public finances. Since 1997, no G7&nbsp;country has had lower debts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deficits than the United Kingdom. We have established and are meeting strict fiscal rules, and the Budget sees no relaxation in that fiscal discipline. Since the pre-Budget report in December public finances have strengthened, as we expected. Tax receipts are on forecast and unemployment costs continue to be low, as do Government debt and the interest rate on it. For the remainder of this economic cycle and the next, while continuing to invest in public services and infrastructure we will also continue to observe our fiscal rules.

<a name="50321-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_389">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love) developed that theme and in doing so reflected his regular service on Finance Bills and his close following of Treasury matters. He rightly said that what clearly sticks in the Conservatives&#039; craw is giving credit to a Labour Chancellor for the successful management of the economy. My hon. Friend also reminded us that the Conservatives somehow regard the past eight years as being down to the economic legacy of the last Conservative Government. It is easy to get an economy moving again after a deep recession such as that experienced in the early 1990s, when there was the fiasco of sterling crashing out of the exchange rate mechanism; the hard part is putting in place the policies to sustain that growth, along with low inflation, low interest rates and high employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_390">It is also worth remembering that in 1997&nbsp;interest rates were higher, unemployment was higher, debt was higher, the last Conservative Government were spending more on servicing government debt than on education, and inflation was back in the system. That was the legacy that this Government inherited from the last one.The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) constructed a rather lengthy argument about public service targets, information capture and inspection. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to tell him that, frankly, it is wishful thinking to believe that his party can somehow find &#163;35&nbsp;billion-worth of savings from spending on such measures. If the hon.

There has been a net increase, confirmed in the 10-year child care strategy published alongside the pre-Budget report in December, of 525,000&nbsp;places in a wide range of child care settings, including nurseries and the provisions of child minders before and after school clubs&#151;precisely the sort of provision that the hon.

May I remind him that the Chancellor&#039;s Budget last week raised the child tax credit? Also, as a result of the announced rises, the new system of tax credits, offsetting income tax liabilities, means that the effective rate of income tax for a family with two children, collectively earning &#163;25,000&nbsp;a year, is 6&nbsp;per cent.&#151;not 22&nbsp;per cent., which is the basic rate of income tax, but 6&nbsp;per cent.

<p><a name="st_230"><a name="50321-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Nigel Beard  (Bexleyheath and Crayford) (Lab):</b> 
 I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome Sir David Clementi&#039;s final report on legal services in England and Wales and I was pleased to hear of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s speech today at the legal services reform conference where he announced the future establishment of a legal services board and an office for legal complaints. Such a large reform and liberalisation of legal services cannot happen overnight and I therefore want to draw attention to structural deficiencies in complaints handling by the Law Society that need to be addressed immediately. The case of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. John Andrews makes it clear how urgent and necessary that improvement in complaints handling has become. I realise that the Minister will be unable to comment on the specific details of the case, but it shows the background of my general points about the Law Society&#039;s performance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_411">At the beginning of 1995, the late Mrs. Patricia Andrews of Welling in my constituency, realising that she was critically ill with cancer, instructed Ms Gill Scott, a solicitor with a local firm, Woolsey, Morris and Kennedy, to arrange her will. The executors were to be a family friend, Mr. Heaton-Smith and the solicitor, Ms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott. The estate was to be passed into trust, primarily for her son, Mr. John Andrews.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_412">Mrs. Patricia Andrews died on 7&nbsp;June 1995. What followed was three years of delay, poor service, unsatisfactory decision-making and possible misconduct by Ms Scott, all of which resulted in huge financial loss to the estate and years of distress for Mr. Andrews. Ms Scott was finally removed as co-executor by the High Court in March 1998. Sadly, that was not the end of the affair because, some seven years later, the new executors are still trying to recover the financial losses and the estate cannot be released.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_413">This was not a complex probate case. There were some savings, some shares and two properties, one with a disputed mortgage, all to be transferred into a discretionary trust. It is difficult to understand why there were six-month periods of inactivity and why so little had been achieved at the time of Ms Scott&#039;s removal as executor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_414">Ms Scott failed to keep accurate accounts and did not know the estate&#039;s value when she was removed. She was guilty of misconduct in transferring &#163;500&nbsp;from the client account to the office account without first rendering a bill. She broke practice rule 15&nbsp;in failing to provide a letter containing her charging policy, which might have avoided the dispute over costs at a later stage. In fact, she continually failed to provide cost information and at the time of her removal as executor the administrative costs of handling probate amounted to &#163;10,800, compared with an original oral quote of &#163;900.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_415">Perhaps Ms Scott&#039;s most serious error related to one of the properties in the will. The late Mrs. Andrews had transferred a mortgage in the 1980s from an endowment policy to a repayment mortgage, only to find out some 13&nbsp;years later that the building society had never made the transfer.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 704</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_416">The building society admitted liability and made a generous offer of a &#163;15,000&nbsp;interest-free mortgage. Both the lay executor, Mr. Heaton-Smith, on the advice of independent solicitors, and Mr. Andrews were happy to settle. However, Ms Scott decided that the estate should litigate. Sadly, the case was lost, resulting in the estate being required to pay both sides&#039; litigation costs and a full mortgage of &#163;22,500. Plainly, there was a conflict of interest, with Ms Scott as executor instructing her own firm to litigate and the resultant income that it gained from the case. As a direct result of Ms Scott&#039;s behaviour, the estate was required to pay a total of &#163;40,000&nbsp;plus interest, rather than the &#163;15,000&nbsp;interest-free mortgage that had been offered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_417">Ms Scott did not fulfil her oversight obligations to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property in question, 56&nbsp;Colmer road. The tenant repeatedly complained about the state of the property, but Ms Scott procrastinated about funding the repair work. In the end, the estate was forced to sell to pay for the now extensive repairs and associated litigation by the tenant. If only Ms Scott had inspected the property when Mrs. Andrews died and paid for the then minor repairs, that could all have been avoided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_418">In summary, Ms Scott was intransigent, made a catalogue of mistakes and did not administer the estate properly. As a direct and indirect result of the decisions she took, the cost of handling probate amounted to &#163;35,000&nbsp;more than it should have done. However, as my summary implies, the total costs were much greater than that. In being forced to sell the house, Mr. Andrews lost the value of the property, he lost future rental earnings and, thus, the investment potential from other buy-to-let properties. A conservative estimate of his loss would be some &#163;500,000. Furthermore, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews could not draw on the residual estate value to aid them when their business and livelihood experienced serious financial difficulties. This affair has had a cataclysmic effect on the Andrews&#039; lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_419">I turn now to the handling of the consequent complaint by the Law Society. Mr. Andrews first complained in 1999. Ms Scott immediately submitted a formal bill for taxation proceedings, effectively a stalling tactic as the Law Society refuses to continue an investigation while court proceedings are under way. The second stage began almost two years later in December 2001, when Mr. Andrews came to see me at one of my surgeries. He and I wrote to ask for the file to be reopened, and that is when the endemic pattern of delay at the Law Society became apparent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_420">First, there was uncertainty over whether the Law Society would investigate. Then the local conciliation officer took three months to submit his formal report. That meant that it was four and a half months before the investigation stage even started. The investigation started in July 2002. It did not conclude until December 2003. It is a disgrace that such a complaint should take 23&nbsp;months to be concluded, even if one accepts the Law Society&#039;s original rejection of the complaint. When the report was published, it was four years and one month after the moment the complaint was first raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_421">In 2000, Professor Richard Moorhead of Cardiff university produced a very comprehensive report on complaints handling, commissioned by the Law Society, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 705</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>entitled &quot;Willing Blindness?&quot;. It did not pull any punches. Professor Moorhead found that persistent and pervasive delay


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;is in many ways the defining characteristic of the organisation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_422">Although that quote is from 2000, my constituents&#039; experience through to late last year suggests that very little has changed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_423">Another significant issue for my constituents was the Law Society&#039;s artificial distinction between inadequate service and professional misconduct, which Sir David Clementi highlights. The Andrews could ask for misconduct to be investigated, but not inadequate service, as neither Mr. Andrews, the beneficiary, nor Mrs. Andrews, the new executor, were clients of Ms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott. That raised the absurd situation whereby, in the eyes of the court, the Andrews are the clients and should pay, but in the eyes of the Law Society, they are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the clients and therefore can receive no compensation and very little protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_424">Mr. Andrews was also frustrated by the lack of transparency. At the moment, no one can ring to find out whether a complaint has been lodged against a specific solicitor. That means that we have no idea whether Mr. Andrews&#039;s complaint is an isolated example or whether there is a pattern of mistreating clients in the firm.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_425">To finish with the most serious element, it seems that the major fault of the Law Society in this case is an apparent bias towards the solicitor and a lack of robustness in exacting punishment. Both may be due in part to the training of caseworkers. Mr. Andrews had four different caseworkers and there was a worrying lack of consistency. For example, the first caseworker never told Mr. Andrews that she would not investigate inadequate service on his behalf, whereas the second picked up on that straight away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_426">&quot;Willing Blindness?&quot; highlighted many such concerns about casework and adjudication panels. It found that

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_427">&#151;the combination of inadequate service and professional misconduct&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;&#039;spare&#039; solicitor members tended to participate in discussion, regardless of whether they were formally allowed to vote&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para19">
<a name="stpa_428">It also found


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;that caseworkers were simply accepting the solicitors&#039; story in preference to the client&#039;s without calling for evidence which clearly existed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_429">Even when the Law Society does find a solicitor guilty, little appears to happen. Ms Scott was found guilty of three complaints, yet she does not appear to have been punished or reprimanded in any way. From April to September 2004, after the rebranding of the consumer complaints service, only 5&nbsp;per cent. of complaints were upheld with action taken. That tiny level of convictions makes it clear that the scales of justice are firmly tipped against the man in the street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para21">
<a name="stpa_430"><i>Which?</i>, formerly the Consumers Association, has repeatedly backed up the conclusions that I have drawn and supports an end to self-regulation. In its 2004&nbsp;survey 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 706</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of solicitors, 71&nbsp;per cent. of those who responded complained about excessive delays and 59&nbsp;per cent. about negligence. More than 40&nbsp;per cent. of those who said that they had received poor service failed to complain, which implies that the problem is even greater than the one in five solicitors who are complained against at present. Those who did complain did not feel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they had fared much better. The legal ombudsman&#039;s annual report backs that up: she was satisfied with the quality of complaint handling by the Law Society in only 53&nbsp;per cent. of last year&#039;s cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_431">As I said at the opening of my speech, the large-scale reform suggested by the Clementi report might take years to come about. I appreciate that that is why the Government took the responsible step of activating the legal services complaints commissioner. I am also very heartened by the Law Society&#039;s recent decision to set up a separate body for consumer complaints, with a lay majority. That is a positive step and I hope that this debate will inform its work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para23">
<a name="stpa_432">Nevertheless, I ask the Minister as a matter of urgency and in combination with the legal services complaints commissioner to bring pressure to bear on the Law Society to make some immediate changes. Those include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eliminating the artificial distinction between inadequate service and professional misconduct; punishing infringements of practice rule 15&nbsp;much more rigorously; making the process much more transparent by making both conditions on practising certificates and the complaints history against a firm a matter of public record; giving wider publicity to disciplinary findings; referring sanctioned solicitors to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal if they repeat an offence; and either making the adjudication panel minutes public or always allowing oral hearings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para24">
<a name="stpa_433">None of those changes can undo the financial loss and years of depression experienced by Mr. Andrews and his family, the second element of which has certainly been increased by the Law Society&#039;s unimpressive performance. The changes could aid some of the 17,000&nbsp;members of the public who, on past experience, will complain about solicitors in the next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-35_para25">
<a name="stpa_434">Most people come into contact with the law on only a few occasions, and their depth of knowledge of procedure is shallow compared with that of lawyers. Their relationship must perforce depend on trust in a solicitor&#039;s competence. For whatever reason in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, that trust was unjustified. Such cases will inevitably arise, although every step should be taken to ensure that they are rare. The Law Society has a central role in ensuring that trust is justified by giving an objective reprimand to people whose standards of practice and behaviour fall below reasonable expectations of good faith and competence. The overwhelming weight of evidence, as exemplified by Mr. and Mrs. Andrews&#039; case, suggests that the Law Society itself, through bias, obscurity and delay, has fallen below reasonable expectations of good faith and competence. I therefore urge the Minister to ensure that the findings of the Clementi report are implemented speedily and to take steps in the meantime to eliminate the most blatant inadequacies of the Law Society&#039;s present arrangements.

<p><a name="st_231"><a name="50321-36_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. David Lammy): </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) for raising this issue, and I express my sympathy for his constituents, who have clearly had a distressing experience.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_435">Since I joined the Department for Constitutional Affairs when it was formed in June 2003, my overriding aim has been to promote better public services, including legal services, that are designed to meet the needs of the people who use them. Individuals use and depend on the justice system and legal services as they go&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about their everyday life. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, used them to deal with the important legal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matters of a will and an estate. People who use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legal services are no different from other consumers, and are entitled to expect an excellent service from their provider. At worst, that service should be satisfactory. Most people go to a solicitor in times of tremendous stress&#151;for example, when they are buying a house, when they are going through a divorce or dealing with the necessary paperwork following the death of a family member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_436">As someone who was previously a lawyer, I know that this is bread-and-butter work for solicitors. For the individuals concerned, however, it is a vital matter that can have a devastating and lasting effect on the rest of their lives. Someone going through the stress of a divorce has enough to contend with. How much worse would the whole experience be if, at the end, they felt let down by their solicitor, whom they trusted to uphold their rights and protect their interests? I do not wish to suggest that the majority of solicitors in England and Wales are failing to provide an excellent service. Legal services in the United Kingdom are among the best in the world, and many countries look to us in these isles for the high standard that our legal community upholds. However, we all recognise that sometimes things do not go smoothly, and there has been a problem with the processing of complaints made against solicitors. That could undermine the esteem in which our solicitors are held.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_437">If things go wrong, consumers are entitled to expect that their complaints will be dealt with fairly and effectively. That is true whether the complaint is about a solicitor delaying sending out papers or is a matter of professional misconduct. To the consumer whose life has been affected, it does not matter whether the profession views the complaint as a minor issue or not. What matters to the consumer is that they are listened to and their concerns taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_438">My hon. Friend referred to Sir David Clementi&#039;s final report on legal services in England and Wales. One of the key recommendations is the proposal for a single new complaints body. We will create an office for legal complaints that will be led by a board with a lay chair and a lay majority. This body will be simpler for the public to use and understand, and better able to provide quick and fair redress. It will ensure consistent, fair and professional handling of cases for all complainants. A single new complaints body should remove the need to distinguish between inadequate service and professional misconduct. That goes to the heart of my hon. Friend&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 708</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>remarks. It will provide for much greater transparency within the complaints system, so addressing the points that my hon. Friend raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_439">I am looking into the amount of compensation for complainants. I agree with the findings of Sir Stephen Lander, the Law Society&#039;s independent commissioner, in his 2003&nbsp;annual report, that the current levels are too low. The Law Society has accepted Sir Stephen&#039;s recommendation that the compensation limit when people suffer at the hands of solicitors should be raised to &#163;15,000. I can assure hon. Members that I am keen to implement that as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_440">Of course, removing complaints handling from the professional bodies will in no way reduce their responsibility to ensure that their members operate to the highest professional and ethical standards at all times. I acknowledge the serious and constant efforts that the professional bodies make in this regard. The office for legal complaints will help. I believe that getting complaints handling right is of critical importance. The solicitor&#039;s role as the conduit between the public and the legal system is vital, but it will continue to work effectively only if the Law Society can ensure that its services are carried out to a high standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_441">Many people will already be aware of the history of complaints handling by the Law Society. Historically, hon. Members across the House have made representations to the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department because of their concern about the handling of complaints. It was clear that the consumer was being let down. Decisive and immediate action was needed. That is why we took the step of using the powers in the Access to Justice Act 1999&nbsp;to appoint a Legal Services Complaints Commissioner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_442">The role of Legal Services Complaints Commissioner has been taken on by Ms Zahida Manzoor, the legal services ombudsman. Ms Manzoor&#039;s experience as ombudsman meant that she had the necessary skills to undertake the challenging role of Legal Services Complaints Commissioner. Ms Manzoor&#039;s unique knowledge of complaints handling in this field meant that she was able to hit the ground running and speedily engage with the Law Society on how they intend to improve their services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_443">To ensure that Ms Manzoor is equipped to do the task, we granted her a range of powers. She can require the Law Society to provide information about the handling of complaints; conduct investigations into those complaints; make recommendations on how to improve performance; set stretching targets; require the society to submit a plan showing how it is going to handle complaints, for her approval; and impose a fine if the society fails to meet the agreed plans for improvements in complaints handling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_444">I have regular meetings with Ms Manzoor and I know that she is already making good use of those powers. She has made recommendations to improve performance and has set performance targets that she believes are reasonable and achievable for the Law Society to meet. The targets represent a package that aims to achieve a balance between timeliness of response, appropriate quality of decision making and customer satisfaction. They are a step towards achieving effective and efficient complaints handling. The Legal Services Complaints Commissioner will keep the targets under close review. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 709</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Naturally, she will act in the best interests of the consumer, but balance that with the Law Society&#039;s capacity to improve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_445">I am pleased to report that the Law Society&#039;s performance is beginning to improve in several areas, but there is still some considerable way to go before it delivers an effective and efficient complaints-handling service. I am sorry that we did not achieve that for Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Mrs. Andrews. The Law Society has demonstrated its commitment by constructively engaging with the commissioner, responding to feedback and assigning resources to ensure delivery of the required improvements. The commissioner will publish her findings on the Law Society&#039;s handling of complaints in her first annual report, which is due to be laid before Parliament in July this year. I look forward to learning of the benefits that the collaborative actions of the commissioner and the Law Society will deliver for consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_446">I spoke earlier about Sir David Clementi&#039;s report. The Government have broadly accepted his main recommendations concerning the regulation of legal services, complaints and discipline, and new business 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 710</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>structures. That will form the basis of a wide-ranging programme of reform that the Government will introduce. Much of that programme will require legislation. Earlier today, my noble Friend the Secretary of State gave a public commitment that we will publish a White Paper on the proposed package of reforms this year. That will set out the proposals in detail as well as plans for their implementation. Furthermore, we will bring forward legislation to put these reforms in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50321-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_447">I congratulate my hon. Friend on initiating this debate, which raises yet again in this House the sad state of affairs that some of our constituents experience at the hands of lawyers who should provide a much better quality service. In the past 18&nbsp;months, we have accepted the recommendations of Sir David Clementi and have moved forward in implementing them. We look forward to the day when we no longer have to discuss the, frankly, shoddy service that some of our constituents get from solicitors when they experience a divorce, have a problem with a will or probate or have difficulties when buying a house. In the meantime, I hope that my hon. Friend welcomes the changes that I have outlined.
