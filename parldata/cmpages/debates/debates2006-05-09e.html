That hotel struck me as a classic example of the type of hostelry that will benefit from the change that the Scottish Executive have announced.</p>

Friend aware of the recent statement by the Disability Rights Commission that it costs three times as much to bring up a disabled child as it does to bring up a non-disabled child, and that 84 per cent. of the mothers of disabled children are unemployed? Will he continue to promote, with the DRC and others, the Government&#146;s view that employment is pivotal to dealing with the problem of child poverty&#151;including poverty among disabled children&#151;as one of the most positive aspects of the Government&#146;s achievements?</p>

It is, of course, owing in no small measure to his campaigning work over many years that we have a Disability Discrimination Act&#151;the 1995 Act&#151;and the Disability Rights Commission, which has done tremendous things in promoting the basic human and civil rights of disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="60509-0001.htm_para4"><a name="06050969000051">My right hon. Friend is right to point out that work is the best route out of poverty for everyone. We should concentrate less on people&#146;s disability or incapacity, and more on the capacity that they have. When we are trying to reform incapacity benefit, it is important for us not to write off disabled people, but to work with them to find out what meaningful work they can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="60509-0001.htm_para5"><a name="06050969000052">My right hon. Friend is also right to refer to the higher costs incurred by families bringing up disabled children. The Scottish Executive have an excellent scheme involving relatively modest but very helpful grants for families. The overall budget for the scheme is about &#163;2 million, which I think constitutes recognition of the facts mentioned by my right hon. Friend.</p>

I have no specific information about the number of sign language interpreters, although I do not quibble with what the hon. Gentleman said. Of course, such matters are primarily a matter for the Scottish Executive, but in creating the new commission for equality and human rights the Government intend to put them at the top of the political agenda, and to give disabled people and others a strong voice that will be heard much more clearly throughout society when they work in concert.

Of course, as I said a moment ago, the whole point of creating the new commission for equality and human rights was to raise the profile of the agenda for all the various bodies that will be part of the commission. In order to recognise the central importance of the rights of disabled people, the commission will have a specified disability committee, 50 per cent. of whom will be disabled people, and one of the commissioners will be a disabled person. So the work that the Disability Rights Commission has set out will be taken up by the new commission, and although I accept that the dilution to which my hon.

First, the Executive were kept in the dark about the &#147;most wanted&#148; list; then, we were told that Mr. Malkovs was one of the 79 most dangerous people in the country. Now, the sheriff at Peterhead has refused deportation on the ground that Mr. Malkovs has no serious criminal convictions. What on earth is going on, and will any Minister in the Home Office, the Scotland Office or the Scottish Executive&#151;full-time or part-time&#151;take charge of this shambles in order to restore public confidence?</p>

It should have taken place before any statement being made in this House, and I am not in any sense attempting to downplay that point. To restore confidence in the system, it is important that now and in future we ensure that foreign nationals who are convicted and sent to prison in this country expect to be deported at the end of their sentence. That does not happen at the moment, even if the system is being administered perfectly. I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party will lend its support to any measures that have to be taken, to ensure that what the public expect to happen does happen: that foreign nationals who commit crimes and end up in prison are sent back to their home countries.</p>

Now is not the time to rehearse the arguments that I deployed against that piece of legislation in the time permitted to us by the Government since last June. Have you, Mr. Speaker, received a request not from the old Home Secretary, but from the new Home Secretary to make a statement to the House explaining the Government&#146;s incompetence in repealing by means of the Identity Cards Act 2006 section 5 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, under which it was an offence punishable by up to 10 years&#146; imprisonment to possess with intent to deceive forged passports and other travel documents, money orders, postal orders, postage stamps, Inland Revenue stamps, share certificates, cheques, travellers cheques, bankers drafts, debit and credit cards and certified copies of entries in certain registers such as those for births, deaths and marriages?

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06050969000187">This is yet another sad tale of a failing Home Office. This time, it is failing to protect people from the misuse of crystal meth, which is seriously bad news for individuals who use it and for society at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06050969000188">The widely respected New York police chief, Anthony Izzo, told the Select Committee on Science and Technology:</p>
<a name="60509-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="06050969000524"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Crystal meth makes crack cocaine look like a Hershey Bar.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06050969000189">He bases his view on hard evidence and experience. UK Sky TV news coverage showed the drug&#146;s impact on individuals and called for Government action before use of this nasty drug becomes endemic. But the Home Office says that it is not yet very prevalent in the UK and that, in effect, they will reclassify when a greater number of people have been damaged and communities are suffering more serious consequences. That is hardly the precautionary approach that the public deserve. It is hardly the action of a Government who care about their young people or want to minimise the impact of drug abuse on society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06050969000190">Methylamphetamine is one of a group of psychostimulant drugs called amphetamines that act on the brain and nervous system. It is produced in tablet, powder or crystalline form. It is taken orally, snorted or injected, but unlike amphetamine, it can be smoked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06050969000191">The term &#147;crystal meth&#148; is often used for the purer crystalline form. The drug&#146;s street names include &#147;yaba&#148; for tablet form, &#147;ice&#148;, &#147;glass&#148;, &#147;Tina&#148;, &#147;Christine&#148; and &#147;Nazi crank&#148;. It was first developed in 1919 and used by troops to keep awake. It was rumoured that Hitler injected it twice a day, hence the name &#147;Nazi crank&#148;. The chances of getting hooked are incredible compared with other illicit drugs. Psychological and physical dependence happens quickly. It affects the brain reward pathways. Users must take more to achieve the same effects, as tolerance quickly builds up. Using the drug by intravenous injection or smoking is especially likely to cause addiction. Smoking the purer, crystalline form produces an intense rush, similar to that of crack cocaine, but much longer lasting&#151;not only minutes but four to 12 hours. That is highly reinforcing and becomes highly addictive. The higher potency, especially when smoked, makes the drug a greater threat. It is, all too often, a one-drag-and-you&#146;re-hooked drug.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06050969000192">The drug&#146;s effects are appalling. They include agitation, paranoia, confusion and violence, usually against innocent bystanders. It damages more than those who take it. It can bring on feelings of exhilaration and produces increased arousal and activity levels. It causes a rapid rise in heart rate and blood pressure, and the higher the dose, the greater the effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06050969000193">The risks are enormous. Methylamphetamine-induced psychosis has been widely reported in countries where use has become endemic. High dosages lead to strokes  <br>

and pulmonary, renal and gastrointestinal disorders. Coma and death can and do follow. It is a much more serious drug than the class A ecstasy that killed Leah Betts in Essex a decade ago. Yet the Government appear to have learned nothing from that tragic wake-up call.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06050969000194">Methylamphetamine is often injected, with sharing of paraphernalia and all the consequences of infection. The drug also increases libido and risky sexual behaviour, thereby increasing blood-borne virus transmission. Home Office research shows that the drug is especially used by the homosexual community. It is disastrous for that group to reduce sexual inhibitions or undertake ever more risky behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06050969000195">Methylamphetamine is currently a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. That historical classification results from the drug&#146;s chemical association with amphetamines, which were all classified B. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which reports to and advises the Government on the classification of drugs, is as dysfunctional as the Home Office. It meets just twice a year with a quorum of only seven, but comprises 38 people, some of whom are caring, knowledgeable, professional and sensible. However, too many represent a neo-liberal, politically correct rag-bag, who appear to make decisions without excessive reference to the evidence and the consequences.</p>

He argued that downgrading mushrooms might stimulate demand and that upgrading crystal meth would have the same effect. That is perverse and muddled thinking. I sometimes wonder whether the ACMD is personally testing the products when making decisions.</p>

So I call on the new Home Secretary to bring forward that review urgently, and to change the drug classification system to a more consistent and rational one. The Government should take a precautionary approach and immediately reclassify methylamphetamine as a class A drug, so that we can save individuals and society from its terrible consequences.</p>

Like many other drugs, including medicinal drugs, it certainly can have those dangerous effects in some cases, but in other cases it does not. It is used as a recreational drug, and, as the hon.

were 1,000 people addicted to heroin and cocaine in Britain. Heroin and cocaine have been class A drugs ever since then, yet the number of addicts now stands at 280,000. If we were going to place all harmful drugs in an appropriate classification, we should put alcohol and tobacco into class A because of the harm that they cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para22"><a name="06050969000209">The hon. Gentleman seems to believe the great myth that was prevalent in 1971, when the United Nations decided that it was going to get rid of drugs all over the world. There was to be a great united effort from every country. However, the result was entirely perverse. In the subsequent years, we have seen a great increase in the use of drugs throughout the countries that signed up to the United Nations convention. We are now supporting a convention established by the UN in 1998, which states that we will aim for the &#147;elimination&#148; of all drug use, and of the growing of poppies and the plants for cannabis and cocaine production, within 10 years. That period ends in 2008, yet the world has made absolutely no progress towards achieving that aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para23"><a name="06050969000210">People believe that prohibition works, but we need only to consider our own experience in Afghanistan, where the British taxpayer has spent &#163;115 million to eliminate poppy growth. The evidence suggests that next year will see a record growth of heroin poppies there. In Colombia, the Americans have spent $4.7 billion on Plan Colombia, but next year will see a 20 per cent. growth in the coca crops there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="60509-0004.htm_para24"><a name="06050969000211">The lesson for this Bill is that prohibition of drugs does not work; it creates a market, which enriches itself through greater sales. We should not change the classification, which will have no effect. The hon. Gentleman speaks with disrespect of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, but it said that cannabis should change category, which resulted not in an increase in cannabis use in Britain but a decrease. He must accept the logic of that. He is saying that we should carry on with a failed policy from the past, but what we should do is learn from the experience of those such as the Benelux countries, Germany and Australia, but principally Portugal, which in 2001 de-penalised all drugs. As a result, the number of drug deaths in Portugal is now half what it was in 2001. The Bill is misguided.</p>

If they are asked, albeit rather arbitrarily, to increase efficiency savings from 1.7 per cent. for the previous year to 2.5 per cent. this year, that constitutes an effort to try to deliver greater efficiency, although it has not been accompanied by any measures to help it to happen. What many staff of NHS trusts object to is that the tariff is being manipulated at the same time, so that last year they had a 7.1 per cent. uplift for pay, prices and costs, and a 5.3 per cent. increase in tariff. This year they will have a 6.5 per cent. uplift for pay, prices and costs but only a 1.5 per cent. increase in tariff. That is why hospitals in many parts of the country find that they have no alternative. Their PCTs will not send them any more patients, and say that there is a limited financial envelope for their activity. The tariff being paid does not reflect the costs that the Government have imposed.</p>

The truth is that there are Labour Members who know that, all across the country, such consultations have too often been a sham. It is a disgrace that the public have been deluded into believing that NHS organisations are genuinely listening to them, whereas in fact those organisations are being dictated to by the Department of Health.</p>

The latest figure, in April 2006, is about 10 per cent. On electronic prescribing, the Government&#146;s target was for 50 per cent. of prescriptions to be electronically filled by December 2005. In February 2006, the figure was 1.8 per cent. Confidence in the NHS IT programme continues to fall. The latest disclosure is that an NHS care records service, which was intended to be up and running in 2005, has been put back&#151;no date is now offered&#151;and will have to be piloted. People who know about such programmes have said that user involvement and piloting the systems would have been the right way to proceed in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="60509-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06050969000296">I am afraid that we arrived at the point in April when the latest statistics added insult to injury for NHS staff. The work force census showed that the number of managers had doubled since 1997. In the last year for which the figures were gathered, the number of administrators went up by 11,000&#151;while the number of nurses went up by 6,000. That is in the teeth of all the Government&#146;s claims to want to cut the bureaucracy of the NHS. That is not happening at all. On the basis of all that, on 23 April, the Secretary of State called it &#147;the best year ever&#148;. I never want to be around when she thinks that things are going wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="60509-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06050969000297">The Prime Minister has retained the services of the Secretary of State at the Department of Health, apparently to push forward NHS reforms. If the Prime Minister believes that, he is living in the parallel universe that the Secretary of State inhabits. Conservative Members believe that reform is essential, but that even more so is leadership and competence. The Government&#146;s combination of arrogance and incompetence is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="60509-0006.htm_para18"><a name="06050969000298">Every aspect of desirable reform is being undermined by the actions of Health Ministers. Patients should have choice, but PCTs, through referral management centres, are controlling and subverting choice. Patients need a voice, but after scrapping community health councils, the Government are going to abandon patients forums and have no idea what to put in their place. GPs need real GP budgets, but the Government&#146;s plans do not offer them the incentives to reinvest their savings or give them the power to negotiate contracts with providers. The Government talk about local decision making, but that is being abandoned because the SHAs are top-slicing PCT budgets and controlling the growth money for the NHS for this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="60509-0006.htm_para19"><a name="06050969000299">Progress towards foundation hospitals is being delayed and their freedoms are still severely limited. National standards need to be set through the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, but the guidelines are not being implemented and the postcode lottery goes on. The independent and voluntary sectors have no clarity on their future involvement in the NHS. The second wave contracts are being scaled back, and the wave 1 contracts cost 11.2 per cent. more than the NHS price. As independent sector treatment centres are guaranteed payments whether or not they do the work, they are bringing the system of independent contracting into disrepute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="60509-0006.htm_para20"><a name="06050969000300">One cannot talk, as the Prime Minister does, about a patient-focused service that is locally delivered when at the same time the NHS is controlled by an overbearing bureaucracy and politically dictated targets. The team at the Department of Health knows neither what NHS reforms are actually needed, nor how to deliver them. No one in the NHS can say what the destination of reform is. Who will be commissioning services in the future? Will PCTs be both commissioning and providing services? Who will set the tariff? How will financial control be enforced? Will the independent sector have a long-term commitment and the opportunity to supply services to the NHS? What happens to failing hospitals? The team does not know, and the Government will not give, or simply do not know, the answer to any of those questions.</p>

That cannot continue, particularly in the 7 per cent.&#151;just 7 per cent., or about 40 organisations&#151;that account for more than 50 per cent. of the deficit.</p>

While it did so, the number of people waiting more than six months for treatment fell from more than 470 to zero. Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals trust has already cut its costs by &#163;10 million, the equivalent of 200 jobs, but with only one compulsory redundancy.

It is in substantial deficit, even though it was viewed as the third best hospital in the country and the best in the south-east last year. Indeed, it has been in the top 40 hospitals in every one of the last six years. It is the only hospital in the country to achieve such a record, but guess what is happening?

That is not worse care for patients, but better care for patients and better value for money.</p>

<p><a name="st_o200"><a name="06050969000347"><a name="60509-0007.htm_spnew30"><a name="06050969000778"><b>Kali Mountford:</b> I am somewhat surprised to see the Opposition in today&#146;s debate blocking the reform that is so badly needed. Opposition Members used to talk in the past about the reforms that needed to be made to secure value for money. My right hon. Friend has pointed out some very good examples of where change has taken place with minimum disruption. It is important to assure people working in the NHS about their futures and their ability to deliver the best possible service to our population. Will my right hon.

That is exactly what we are doing through the Modernisation Agency and the NHS institute for improvement. As staff change jobs, and particularly as more services move from hospitals and into the community, we need to support those staff, particularly where they need to change their skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="60509-0007.htm_para7"><a name="06050969000349">Let me give the House an example of exactly how the NHS is making those changes in Dudley, where I recently met several of its patients. One is Ron Lane, a gentleman in his 70s who has severe heart disease. He told me that his community nurse now gives him tests and treatment in a couple of hours in his own home that just two years ago used to require an emergency admission and several days in hospital. He told me that his quality of life has been transformed thanks to those community nurses. In just 12 months, thanks to the NHS community nurses in Dudley, 120 patients like Mr. Lane have had more than 500 fewer admissions to hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="60509-0007.htm_para8"><a name="06050969000350">The new acute hospital in Dudley has fewer beds than the old hospital. It needs fewer staff in many of those jobs, and the local NHS is underspending on its hospital budget, so it has more money to put into other improvements for other patients, which provides better care for patients and better value for money. The reforms that we are making, which the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire has said that he supports but has also attacked, and the changes that we are making, with stronger commissioning from GP practices and primary care trusts, will give every part of the NHS the incentive to do what Dudley and many other places are already doing.</p>

Will my right hon. Friend confirm that when Labour entered office, one of the problems that we had to address was that areas in which health needs were greatest were, relatively speaking, underfunded compared with more affluent areas? We have been addressing that problem, and it would be wrong to continue a system where health surpluses in areas of high health treatment need were subsidising more affluent areas, which was the case in the past.</p>

In the old NHS, over-spending in one place was simply compensated for by underspending elsewhere. As my hon. Friend said, that was not only unfair, but utterly ineffective, because overspending areas had no incentive to put their houses in order. Our changes and reforms have not created those problems, they have revealed them, and now they are helping to correct them.</p>

On the theme of turnarounds, it has been interesting to watch the Secretary of State turning around from being a Blairite to a Brownite in the course of her speech.

What a discerning group the British public are! We understand why the Conservatives, who tabled this motion, are still not the most trusted party on the NHS. I recall being elected to Parliament in 1997, and having constituents coming to see me with letters saying that they would have to wait 104 weeks to see a consultant and to get on to the waiting list.</p>

We must not allow the British public to be deceived into thinking that the Conservatives are committed to the health service and that, if only they were in power, the health service would be sorted. So much progress has been made. Indeed, if it were only a matter of the Conservatives&#146; record on what was happening nine or 10 years ago, we might be tempted to think that the leopard had changed its spots.

There has been a growth in the number of front-line doctors and nurses, but on the Government&#146;s figures, without counting all sorts of obscure people as administrators, the growth in the number of managers over the past 10 years has been twice as fast. That is a statement of fact, and that is where things have gone wrong. It is not that those managers are doing nothing all day; they are running around chasing Government targets, monitoring and form-filling, which they should not have to do, and that is the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="60509-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06050969000409">When challenged about bureaucracy, the Government say, &#147;We&#146;re going to sweep away managers and merge primary care trusts, which will result in less bureaucracy.&#148; I have been contacted from West Sussex, where one new primary trust will replace five. A non-executive director of one of those PCTs has written a letter saying that the new plans have</p>

Instead of having a health authority, a primary care trust and the doctors, it will now have a health authority, a primary care trust and eight local practice-based commissioning areas. Each of those eight&#151;there were only five before&#151;will have a business director and support staff for finance and commissioning, public health partnerships, primary care development, patient and public involvement and so on. Incredibly, an extra tier is being introduced, which is typical of this Government. A whole raft of new bureaucracy is being introduced in the name of efficiency. It is classic new Labour reform. </p>

However, the reforms have not been co-ordinated, planned, phased and staged; they have come helter-skelter, all at once, and have not been effectively implemented. One example of that is the failed implementation of the new tariff for children&#146;s specialist services, about which, it is reported, the former Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), resigned, although I do not know whether that is the case, and I am happy to be corrected. We have raised the issue of specialist children&#146;s hospitals, such as Alder Hey, Great Ormond Street and others, which are saying that the amount of money that they get for doing the clever things that they do for sick children is not sufficient to meet their costs.</p>

appointments to NHS posts. On the subject of Alder Hey and specialist children&#146;s hospitals, however, let me make something absolutely clear. More work is needed on the specialist tariffs, and we are doing that work in conjunction with the children&#146;s hospitals; but the top-up to the tariff that we give those hospitals has been increased. Last year it was 53 per cent. over and above the normal tariff, and this year the figure will be 69 per cent. We shall go on working with Alder Hey and the other outstanding children&#146;s hospitals to ensure that their essential work continues.</p>

The situation is extraordinary; the new tariff is being introduced very rapidly, people are not having time to adjust to it, and there is a threat to valuable front-line services. What is worrying, and what angers people about the Secretary of State, is that she appears to be out of touch with what is going on.</p>

So much runs on that basis, and the Government are systematically undermining it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06050969000446">We should also talk about what needs to be done. I listened in vain for nearly 45 minutes to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire for any suggestions, and there is nothing in his motion about what needs to be done. A constructive and effective Opposition say what needs to be done, so I shall point out several measures that need to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para12"><a name="06050969000447">The first is that if one accepts the Government&#146;s logic, the NHS should be given greater time to adjust. If one believes in a market directed by incentives&#151;including incentives to be more efficient&#151;it needs time to adjust. Incentives do not work over night. If the NHS is to be restructured, new units built and old ones closed, the effect will take time to be felt. The logic of the Government&#146;s position is that we should not have wholesale reform all at once to be implemented quickly. Instead, change should be phased, staged and managed, but that is not what is happening. One cannot sort out the problems of decades in weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para13"><a name="06050969000448">The second key aspect is the need, at the very least, for the infamous level playing field between the NHS and the private sector. All too often, the independent treatment centres, which are supposed to be the dynamic, free-market, capitalist competition that will ensure efficiency, are being subsidised and given guaranteed business. That is the exact opposite of what should happen. For example, a doctor wrote to me recently saying:</p>
<a name="60509-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="06050969000551"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One contributing factor&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06050969000449">to the problems of the NHS&#151;</p>
<a name="60509-0009.htm_brev7"><a name="06050969000552"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is the...Treatment Centre...in Shepton, which is treating straightforward patients for routine ops at an inflated tariff and leaving the more complex cases, as well as sorting out their errors, to the local NHS.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06050969000450">He makes an interesting point when he states that the number of staff working there is very similar to the number of redundancies at the Royal United hospital, Bath. He says that that is no surprise, as those staff members are doing the work that the RUH has lost, although at a higher price. That cannot be a rational way to manage efficiency in the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para16"><a name="06050969000451">The shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, asked about what should happen when a district general hospital &#147;loses business&#148;, as the jargon has it. He did not answer his own question, but the logic of the Government&#146;s policy is clear, and it is that district general hospitals may close when their work can be taken up by regional specialisms, treatment centres and GP surgeries. However, have the Government talked to the British public about that? Has there been a debate about whether we think that district general hospitals have a future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06050969000452">The answer to both questions is no. We have had no such debate. What is missing most of all from the NHS is real local democratic accountability. The NHS employs 1.3 million people, or one voter in 35. The only person democratically accountable to all those people is the Secretary of State, who has just left the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para18"><a name="06050969000453">I shall give the House an example from my own part of the world. In the former area of Avon, none of the local MPs and councillors, regardless of party, wanted the PCT configuration, but the health authority just said, &#147;Tough.&#148; Where is the democracy and accountability in that?</p>

We want the NHS to be genuinely accountable and answerable to us not just because we pay for it, but because that would be more efficient. Local people and those whom they elect would be able to scrutinise what went on and ask pertinent questions. At present, they are completely shut out; only one person is accountable for the NHS, and she takes no responsibility for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para20"><a name="06050969000455">Over the past nine years, the amount of money going into the NHS has risen from historically low levels to something more credible, but the problem has been the endless interference and issuing of diktats from the centre.

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para21"><a name="06050969000456">That has to stop. We want real local democratic accountability, and that will mean that the NHS is different in different parts of the country. That is what local people want; they should be allowed to have it, and not be told from the centre how things are going to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para22"><a name="06050969000457">We should not go back to the pre-1997 regime that failed the NHS.

I fundamentally disagree. My right hon. Friend knows fine well what the realities are. The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) referred to some of them when he talked of the need for staged change in the NHS. He said that the changes needed to be better timed, because things had been done in a bit of a rush. I have been hearing that in this place for 23 years. Before that I was active in local politics and I heard it there, too. Every time we ask for change in the NHS, we are told, &#147;Yes, but don&#146;t do it now.&#148; I do not say that things could not be done better, but I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is listening to the voices of vested interests&#151;people who work in the NHS and do not want to change. In certain circumstances, it is a great pity that they do not want to. We have all heard those vested interests in media reports over the past few weeks, and I have heavily criticised some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60509-0009.htm_para25"><a name="06050969000463">I want to set out what has been happening in the NHS since the Government took office in 1997. We have dealt with waiting times of more than six months, although earlier we heard an example that showed they were increasing again. In March 2000, three years after we took office, more than a quarter of a million people had to wait more than six months for an operation; by December 2005 the number was almost nil. The bar on the Department of Health graph is so small that I cannot see what the number is.</p>

I did not hear anger when we sat together, taking evidence for an inquiry that we are undertaking at the moment. I do not see that anger, but we get it from the top sometimes.

That is the truth of what has happened in our NHS under this Government.</p>

than 99 per cent. of suspected cancer cases are now seen within two weeks. That is up from 63 per cent. in 1997. Again, there has been a substantial increase. Those are the figures that the hon. Gentleman should have given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06050969000481">My final point relates to my earlier intervention on the Gentleman. In my view, we should measure what is happening inside our national health service in terms of its impact on patients, not jobs. The national health service is there primarily for patients, and not as an employer. There were many times when large parts of the public sector were there to provide social employment; that is not the case any more. God knows, in my own constituency, I saw thousands of jobs go from public sector industries that were there for social employment reasons. That is how we should look at the situation now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06050969000482">A MORI poll on public attitudes to our national health service draws attention to users&#146; good personal experience of the NHS. It says that 81 per cent. of hospital users were satisfied with their last visit. In a Populus poll, 70 per cent. said that, based on their own experience, a good service was provided in the NHS. That is not anecdotal evidence. We are not talking about vested interests being shouted out in television studios or conference halls. The polls reflect the views of the people whom the NHS is there for. There is no doubt at all in my mind that in 1997 a turnaround team was put into the Department of Health, and it is working wonders for an area of the public sector that was badly neglected for many years.</p>

On the basis of his speech, I could couple him with the Secretary of State and ask him to reflect on why the reaction that the Secretary of State received to her statement that the NHS had just enjoyed its best year ever was as strong as it was. On the basis of his speech, he is clearly bemused by the reaction that the Secretary of State received and he prefers to believe that it was all got up by a group of Tory politicians and journalists. The right hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State would serve their cause better if they reflected a little longer on the fact that the Secretary of State&#146;s comment received an intense reaction not just in the political world, but right through the national health service. They might serve themselves better if they set out to understand why people reacted as strongly as they did.</p>

If the statement had been that patients had had a better year, nobody could have grumbled about that, because that is the case. The right hon. Gentleman was a Health Minister so he should know all about the issues inside the health service. We then come to the question of how there could be a so-called spontaneous demonstration at a conference&#151;with hundreds of people sitting there all wearing the same protest T-shirts. The simple answer is that that was not patients being mad at the national health service; it was people who might have to move and change their jobs in the next few years. If that improves patient care, they should get on with it.</p>

Gentleman was kind enough to refer to the fact that I was once Secretary of State for Health. I have read briefs very similar to the speech that he just made to the House&#151;on occasion, I have even read them to the House. They are no substitute for an honest reflection on why people react to circumstances in the way that they do. He is quite right to say&#151;and the Secretary of State may reasonably reflect&#151;that the national health service has been the beneficiary of record levels of expenditure. He is quite right to say that record numbers of people, in the history of the national health service, were treated last year, record numbers of clinicians were employed and records levels of resources were deployed. Given those facts, why did people dispute the proposition that it was the best year ever? I want to focus on that question, because some important policy conclusions can be drawn from the reasons people reacted in the way that they did.</p>

<p><a name="st_o285"><a name="06050969000486"><a name="60509-0010.htm_spnew11"><a name="06050969000859"><b>Dr. Stoate:</b> Perhaps I can help the right hon. Gentleman to explain why there was such a strong reaction. As someone who worked in the health service and spent a lot of time speaking to people who use the health service and people who work there, I know that the facts are that people have much higher expectations than they had before&#151;and so they should. People expect to have better treatment. They expect to be treated more fairly and more humanely. That is the way things should be, and long may that continue. Things are available now that were not even conceived 10 years ago. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) said, most people receive a far better service than they did before&#151;albeit that the health service staff might not entirely always agree with that point.</p>

<p><a name="st_o286"><a name="06050969000487"><a name="60509-0010.htm_spnew12"><a name="06050969000860"><b>Mr. Dorrell:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that things are being done in the health service now that were not done in 1997. It is equally true that things were being done in the health service in 1997 that were not done in 1987. That is the first point to make when thinking about why the Secretary of State was so misguided as to present her case in the way she did. In fact, in every year of its history, the national health service has used more resources, treated more patients and employed more clinicians. The proposition that everything is better this year than it was last year&#151;or better this year than in 1997&#151;is one that every single Secretary of State for Health from Aneurin Bevan onwards has been able to make, and justify.</p>

My hon. Friend was entirely right to say that, in the health service today, there is a broad sense that people are making progress, as the health service has always made progress, but doing so despite the intervention of politicians, rather than because of it.

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06050969000491">Let me move on to the second point. The argument that has not yet surfaced in the debate is that one of the reasons for low morale and demotivation in the health service, as well as one of the reasons for the major waste of resources in the health service in recent years, is the programme of constant reorganisation&#151;the bureaucratic moving round of the deckchairs. Let me briefly recite the Government&#146;s record on the reorganisation of the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06050969000492">When the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) was appointed, he said that he would abolish the internal market, but then the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) was appointed and said that that was wrong and that the Government would reintroduce foundation hospitals. The present Secretary of State says that the Government were wrong to abolish not only the independent management of hospitals but fundholding, so back comes practice-based commissioning with a deadline of involving every general practitioner in GP fundholding, or practice-based commissioning&#151;they are exactly the same&#151;by December this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06050969000493">I intervened to ask the Secretary of State about the role of PCTs in the delivery of service, because it is one of the issues on which the Government have caused deep confusion throughout the service in the past 12 months. She said, as though it was somehow clear and everyone knew it, that PCTs would go on being involved in the delivery of community-based health service care. However, that is absolutely not what Ministers have been saying over the past 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06050969000494">It is worth repeating Ministers&#146; words. In July 2005, the Government&#146;s position was:</p>
<a name="60509-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="06050969000553"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;PCTs will become patient-led and commissioning-led organisations with their role in provision reduced to a minimum.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06050969000495">There was confusion about that and Ministers announced an extension to the deadline, which was originally the end of 2008. When the then Health Minister, who is now Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, gave evidence to the Health Committee on 1 November 2005, he was asked by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice):</p>
<a name="60509-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="06050969000554"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Are you telling us that the Government is as committed as it ever was to see frontline medical staff move away from employment in Primary Care Trusts? Is that what you are telling us?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06050969000496">The then Health Minister replied:</p>
<a name="60509-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="06050969000555"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I think we have set ourselves a long-term objective, yes, but I think what was clarified was the removal of the 2008 timetable for that.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60509-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06050969000497">There was thus a statement in July 2005 to say that PCTs would divest themselves of the services. By November, they were still going to do that, but do so without a deadline. However, today, the Secretary of State says that PCTs will not divest themselves of the services. It is small wonder that there is confusion in the service about where the bureaucratic deckchairs will come to rest when Ministers can give three fundamentally different answers in 12 months to a very simple question.</p>

I do not want to dwell any longer on the matter. However, I wanted to emphasise it because it is an aspect of the process of constant management change that is one of the reasons why the Secretary of State received such a reaction when she tried to suggest that the NHS had had one of its best years ever.</p>

one that we pursued when I was both a junior Health Minister and Secretary of State for Health. However, it makes me cross that nine years after the Government came to power&#151;it has been nine years of confusion, wasted resources and demotivation&#151;they have made a 360° U-turn. That is a major factor behind the demotivation of the staff of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06050969000507">Let me move on to another reason the Secretary of State received the reaction that she did. There is emerging knowledge in the NHS that the good times are over and that there has been, to an almost criminal extent, a wasted opportunity. That is not to say to the right hon. Member for Rother Valley that no good has been done&#151;of course good has been done&#151;but people in the NHS understand and increasingly reflect on the scale of financial mismanagement during the growth years as they find that the years of plenty are inevitably, under Governments of any political complexion, coming to an end. The Government get credit, as they should, for the fact that they have doubled the resources going into the NHS, but they must accept responsibility for management decisions on the use of money and the consequences of those decisions as they work themselves out in the coming years, as people in the service are increasingly seeing that they will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06050969000508">I will offer two examples that people working in the NHS increasingly cite when they talk to me. They talk about the employment prospects for doctors and nurses coming out of the medical and nurse training schools. The Government are keen to claim credit for committing substantial extra resources to increasing the number of people going into medical schools and nurse training so that a greater number of skilled clinicians is available to the NHS. However, they do not tell us that there is no model for the future funding of the NHS that offers job opportunities for all the people coming out of the expanded nurse and doctor training schools. Those who are coming out of the schools have a pretty significant vested interest in understanding the economics and dynamics. They have done the maths and know that there are not enough jobs to go round. We are heading into a period in which there will be unemployed nurses and doctors because the Government have got their staff planning wrong and are producing more trained doctors and nurses than the NHS will be able to employ in any likely scenario over the next decade. That is mismanagement of resources and is known to be such by those who work in the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06050969000509">There is a second area of mismanagement of resources of which people are becoming increasingly aware, and it is not dissimilar to the one to which I have just referred. The Government are proud that in constituencies throughout the country they have launched the biggest capital investment programme in the history of the NHS, and that throughout the country there are new, expanded and renovated hospitals that reflect that huge investment programme. The Government do not tell us&#151;the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) touched on this&#151;that resources have been pre-empted elsewhere, and that the intelligent commissioners in the health service increasingly see that resources should have been made available in greater proportion to the development of the community-based and the less politically sexy aspects of the delivery of health care.</p>

It is ironic that the Government should have issued a White Paper within the past 12 months stressing once again, as Health Secretaries have since Enoch Powell and before, the importance of moving health care out of the big general hospitals into the communities so that it is close to where patients live, is accessible to patients and uses the latest technology to deliver day case and ambulatory care, for example.</p>

That was unforgivable. I do not blame nurses for that, but I point the finger at some of the leaders who purportedly speak on their behalf. Let me cite some important statistics. Minimum starting pay for nurses is &#163;19,000&#151;a 55 per cent. increase since 1997. Nurse consultants start on &#163;49,000 a year, senior professional nurses can earn up to &#163;88,000, and modern matrons start on &#163;35,000 a year. The typical starting pay for a junior doctor is &#163;30,000&#151;an increase of 40 per cent.&#151;and a grade F nurse who earned &#163;21,000 in 1998, received &#163;28,200 in 2004, which represents a 23 per cent. increase.

GPs can pay nurses according to their skills and expertise.

I am concerned, however, that those reforms may not be sufficient to reshape the health care landscape in favour of primary care. How can we reconcile the goal of moving more care closer to home and encouraging more integrated pathways of care with the Government&#146;s determination to allow more acute trusts to attain foundation status and to operate independently?</p>

greatest possible value for money. However, it is dangerous to rely on the market alone to achieve the reduction in acute activity needed to achieve the goals that the Government set out in the White Paper. Not only will that lead to imbalances in the way in which acute care is delivered but it will encourage acute trusts to concentrate on more lucrative health care activities at the expense of less lucrative ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06050987000016">Moreover, the experience of countries that have sought to shift more care into the community is that change is slower in health care systems composed of powerful, autonomous hospitals that compete with one another for patients. Having invested so much political capital in the foundation trust model, the Government would find it inconvenient to curb the very freedoms that it has worked so hard to give hospitals. Without a concerted and meaningful attempt to blur the boundaries between primary and secondary care to achieve vertical integration between the two sectors, we cannot achieve the vision of a prevention-oriented, primary care-led NHS that the Government wish to deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06050987000017">Simply encouraging more consultants to see more patients in primary settings is not the answer. Primary and secondary-care consultants and professionals must be answerable to the same paymaster&#151;a single care trust that it is openly committed to an integrated, primary care model&#151;if we are to achieve meaningful change and resolve the problems facing the NHS. We could learn a great deal from the Kaiser Permanente model of health care in California, which has reduced secondary admissions and kept hospital stays to a minimum in a wide range of specialties. It owes much of its success to its decision to invest in a network of community-based specialty clinics, in which primary care professionals work alongside specialists. Those clinics have the facilities to cater for virtually every step of the patient pathway, from initial assessment to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up appointments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para16"><a name="06050987000018">One aspect of the Kaiser model is crucial to its success in reducing acute sector activity. Unlike the NHS, there are no structural distinctions between primary and secondary care. Not only is the model vertically integrated but the entire care package is based on prevention, integrated working and a belief that the most effective treatment is delivered as close to home as possible. The specialist doctors and nurses who work for Kaiser tend to support that model. It has been extremely successful, and we could learn a great deal from it.</p>

The system would be much smoother, and patients could understand it. It would achieve what they want and deliver efficiencies. I would go further, as we need to ask what is the role of the acute hospital in the 21st century. That dangerous question needs to be handled subtly&#151;Members on both sides may fear that there is threat to their own unit&#151;but we must have that debate. An acute unit capable of delivering emergency care, followed if necessary by transfer to a more appropriate unit after stabilisation, is required in each district, but what should be provided beyond that? Does the district general hospital need all its acute beds? Is that requirement appropriate in every instance? Is it appropriate for every speciality to be provided in every district general hospital? Do we need a full range of services in each unit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06050987000022">The vast majority of acute admissions are entirely avoidable, particularly for people with chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes. Those admission should be regarded first and foremost as a sign that the system has failed. If I have to make a phone call as a GP to admit a patient to hospital, I always ask what went wrong with their care package. Sometimes there is a simple answer&#151;they have had a heart attack or stroke and need to be admitted to hospital to be stabilised and treated&#151;but often there is a failure of social care. I have to send a patient to hospital, because there is not a safety package in the community that I can put into action fast enough to enable them to stay in their own home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06050987000023">When we send a patient to hospital, it is usually a nightmare. Elderly people, in particular, become institutionalised after only a few days, and it is much more difficult to rehabilitate them so that they can return to their own community. They become disoriented and, all too often, end up spending a long time in hospital or being transferred from hospital to a social care bed, all of which could have been avoided with more planning and blurring of boundaries. Putting people in hospital is expensive, and in many cases it is harmful to their health, particularly to their psychological well-being, as most people would far rather be treated by their family and friends in a familiar environment. Hospital-acquired infections are, by definition, acquired in hospital, not in the community. Far too many people succumb to those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="60509-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06050987000024">Reviewing acute sector capacity is not just financially desirable, but essential from a clinical and a patient perspective. In the early 1960s, when the present model of the district hospital was developed, there was a need for large-scale repositories in each area, given the rather limited range of treatments that we could provide and the rather rocky patient pathway that many people followed. It was inevitable that people were kept in hospital for long terms. When I was a junior doctor, I remember working in a district hospital that had access to 1,000 beds, and we were always full. I used to admit acute surgical patients to the ear, nose and throat ward because I had nowhere else to put them. That was 20 years ago. We now have far fewer beds and do not face anything like the same pressures on the beds. Times have changed.</p>

His first thought was that perhaps the hospital had become unpopular and that we were sending patients elsewhere. In fact, we are not sending them anywhere. What GPs are doing is keeping far more people than ever before in their practices. They are all running diabetic clinics, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinics, asthma clinics and minor surgery clinics.

My gut instinct is that patients being treated in their own home by their own practice nurse, their own doctor and their own team of associate support staff is the way to go. Big acute general hospitals are probably not the way to go. The interesting debate will be about how we get from here to there, and I look forward to many more of these debates in the future.</p>

Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), and how right I think he is in his remarks about the nurses. I deeply regret the way the nurses treated the Secretary of State. It was a mistake on their part. It was clearly organised, and it was a foolish demonstration. I agree with the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) that nurses are far better paid than they were, and so they should be. That manifestation was not about pay at all. It was about the constant rate of change in the health service, which is proving so destabilising and bringing such great uncertainty not only to those who work in the health service, but in the long term to patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para8"><a name="06050987000037">In the south-east of England a health care crisis is developing throughout the region, and dealing with it will be extremely difficult. The Chancellor made a colossal error by announcing massive increases in public expenditure on health without demanding substantial productivity gains and further reforms. A very great deal of taxpayers&#146; money has been wasted and is about to be so again, and there is a substantial managerial failure which lies at the door of the Department of Health. It is not a failure, by and large, at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06050987000038">Let us start where credit is due. The NHS needed more money spent on it. There has been a broad improvement in a substantial range of services and the right hon. Lady is to some extent right to feel that the press, as always, concentrates too much on the reporting of people&#146;s negative experiences. All of us Members of Parliament know that serious complaints are made, but on the whole my postbag is filled not with complaints, but with letters from people saying how well they were treated and how grateful they are to the doctors and nurses for their skill and care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06050987000039">However, much too much money is being wasted in the health service. For example, after seven years of wasted planning time, St. Mary&#146;s hospital, Paddington decided not to replace its Victorian buildings with a new hospital, by which time the trust had spent &#163;14 million on consultants&#146; fees. That is not acceptable, and there are many such examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06050987000040">There is a mixed picture, and in respect of my own constituency I shall say something about the Princess Royal hospital and the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. I have raised these matters on the Floor of the House on a number of occasions and at a series of meetings with Ministers, and I do not want to go over old ground. As I have said before, the trust is &#163;21.3 million in debt, with no possibility, in my judgement, of paying it off in the time scale required. A similar point was made earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06050987000041">I warned the Government at the time the trust was created what would inevitably happen when the two hospitals were merged. The position now is that a turnaround team has reviewed the situation with the trust managers and it is my firm conviction that, unless the debt is dealt with in a sensible manner&#151;we must leave headroom and time to support a full recovery process&#151;the trust inevitably will have to make substantial cuts in services, close wards and reduce vital services for local people. That cannot be what the Government want and it is certainly not what my constituents want. It would be a disaster locally and would, I am afraid, further damage my constituents&#146; confidence; already bruised following the &#147;best care, best place&#148; consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para13"><a name="06050987000042">I appeal to the Minister to accept that the trust is struggling with long-term financial burdens; they are not its fault and are, frankly, beyond resolution. The Government should not reward poor financial stewardship, but where such a situation exists&#151;as it does with this trust and many others in the country&#151; alongside a genuine commitment from the management and capacity to reform and increase transparency, the Secretary of State should act in a sympathetic and understanding manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06050987000043">I want to speak briefly about the future of the NHS. The national health service employs 1.3 million people. In Surrey and Sussex alone&#151;my part of the world&#151;the budget is &#163;2.8 billion and the NHS employs more than 50,000 people. On any one day, 4,500 people will be occupying a hospital bed and 1,100 will be admitted to hospital, of whom 720 will return home that day. About 2,350 people will attend an accident and emergency department on any one day in Surrey and Sussex, of whom about 560 will be admitted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06050987000044">The local Surrey and Sussex health economy is now in great difficulty, from which it will be difficult to extricate itself. It is not possible any longer to run an organisation of this size as it is, and I believe that change is required, particularly around the issue of accountability at all levels. I applaud the work that the Government are carrying out to try to get that done, but I firmly believe that we need significant devolution of responsibility, autonomy and accountability at the local level and that it will be possible and equitable only if managers and clinicians are able together to set local strategies, targets and service delivery. They should be agreed by the strategic health authority, monitored according to that agreement and set within the SHA&#146;s financial framework, aligned to the strategy of the Government of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06050987000045">The NHS will never work efficiently and truly effectively until empowerment and ownership of services and service delivery are an absolutely integral part of the success of achievement. At present, many of the clinicians to whom I speak are, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood argued so effectively, feeling disillusioned and disconnected from the process and restrained. Managers who, given their heads, could do a much better job, feel disempowered and are unable to take initiatives that they know to be right. Only in genuine partnership will clinicians and managers be able to deliver the sort of dynamic service that is really responsive to the needs of patients. We need that to happen now and the Secretary of State needs to do more to encourage it and to make it happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06050987000046">It has always been my experience in public life that pay is not the only driver for those who work in the NHS or elsewhere in the public services. Job satisfaction, improving patient outcomes, applying new and valuable initiatives and good systems changes, alongside feeling valued and respected, are just as important. Ethos matters very much to most public servants. There are some outstanding managers in the NHS, but there are also too many inadequate ones who are recycled from job to job. The good ones need to be nurtured and developed. Initiative, and particularly risk taking, needs to be encouraged and managed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para18"><a name="06050987000047">I have a suggestion for the Minister, which he is at liberty to use. I believe that the Government should set up a staff college, based on the services model, to which all managers marked out for further and higher command above a certain level in the NHS have to attend. Such a course could be run at business schools throughout the country to ensure that only the very best managers go on to the most important jobs. As in any other business, the leadership or senior management is absolutely crucial to the success of the enterprise. The NHS should be no different, so my right hon. and hon. Friends are right to be critical of the Secretary of State in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para19"><a name="06050987000048">In the last five years, the NHS budget has increased by 40 per cent. in real terms, while output has increased by less than half that. In its doctors and nurses, the NHS has one of the most committed work forces in the country, yet management has significantly failed to motivate and engage those dedicated professionals towards a common goal of increased productivity.</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="06050987000049"><a name="60509-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="06050987000256"><b>David Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The hon. Gentleman is perpetuating&#151;unintentionally, I am sure&#151;a bit of a myth here. Of the significant extra tranches of money invested in the NHS, it has been clearly demonstrated that 48 per cent. has gone into new posts, operations and new drugs; 30 per cent. into pay, which needed to be tackled; and a further 18 per cent. on capital investment, environment, equipment and so forth. Those are not unreasonable figures, so the suggestion that it is all somehow dribbling down the drain is not worthy of the rest of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, which has otherwise been excellent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="06050987000050"><a name="60509-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="06050987000257"><b>Mr. Soames:</b> I am attempting to suggest no such thing. The hon. Gentleman is right about capital expenditure and all the rest of it, but I am suggesting only that for an investment of this size, one would expect to see a greater degree of productivity right across the board. It is a fact, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, that the inefficiencies in the health service are legion. The way the NHS does its business is still many years behind what goes on in the private sector. I am not suggesting that the private sector is necessarily a perfect role model, but the NHS has many lessons to learn from how the private sector runs its affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06050987000053">While the &#147;payment by results&#148; initiative has brought the impetus to improve productivity in the NHS, the real challenge lies in empowering and engaging its front-line staff and getting them to take personal responsibility for the performance challenge. That is a technique that has been implemented time and again in the private sector to very great effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06050987000054">I want to conclude by saying that the national health service is, in my judgment, a truly remarkable organisation, which is greatly valued by the people of this country, but it could be and should be so much better than it is. There is nowhere better to be, frankly, if people are really ill, and I know that most of the people who work in the NHS find the teamwork and comradeship extremely rewarding. Most feel that it is a great privilege to work in the NHS, but they all have one thing in common, as eloquently argued by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood: they absolutely yearn for a period of stability. They yearn for the ability to take the best decisions for their local communities, to provide the best care that they can, and to deal with the abuses and inefficiencies that are all too rife. Many of the NHS&#146;s difficulties are systemic and the deficits can be wiped out only by fundamental change: the NHS and its people, wherever they work, need the time, the space and the resources to achieve it.</p>

The Conservative party has opposed every penny of extra money that this Government have put into the NHS. As an alternative to our strategy, its current leader has, so far as we can tell, designed the patient passport, fought a general election on that issue and then ditched the policy. It is the party of GP fundholding, unfair competition and constraints on NHS spending, which lead to growing waiting times and waiting lists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06050987000057">We have got every reason to be proud of what the NHS has achieved. If we think back to when my hon. Friends and I were elected in 1997, we realise how things have changed. We have already doubled spending since then, and it will have trebled by 2008. We were spending at well below the European average on health after years of Tory cuts, and waiting was the keynote that typified NHS services in those days, whether it was waiting on those ever-increasing lists for operations, waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency units or waiting for winter to end&#151;the extra deaths caused by winter used to generate fear every year. In my first few years as a Member of Parliament, I used to receive far too many letters from constituents who did not know whether they would get their hip or knee operation done or whether they would die first. We used to get letters like that, but I am delighted to say that I have not received one for some years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06050987000058">At that time, the health service in my constituency was typified by the Devonshire royal hospital, which rattled around inside a magnificent grade II* listed building. The building was in a poor state, and, although people were fond of it, few High Peak residents used it as an in-patient hospital, because it was a centre of regional excellence for head injuries and rheumatism treatment in the north-west&#151;it happened not to be in the north-west region, which was one reason why its closure was proposed. Many people were against the closure, but when the hospital closed, no services were lost. Out-patient services were transferred to the two community hospitals or, as is increasingly the case, to GP surgeries. Now, nobody would attack the decision to close that hospital on the basis of the health care that is provided in the area.</p>

outskirts of my constituency, and a brand new hospital, which is awaiting the outcome of its foundation application, is about to be built to replace the present Tameside hospital. No one waits for four hours in A and E in either of those hospitals, and in-patients, who typically faced a 12-month wait in 2002, now wait for less than six months. Out-patient waits in the area were typically 21 weeks in 2002, but they are now less than 12 weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para26"><a name="06050987000062">There are two PCTs in my constituency&#151;Tameside and Glossop and High Peak and Dales&#151;and they are both hitting all of their key targets, which benefits their patients, providing more and more services within communities and working closely with an excellent team of GPs. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-GP health staff are working inside GP surgeries delivering basic community health services. As far as Tameside and Glossop PCT is concerned, Shire Hill hospital in Glossop has now achieved step-up, step-down status, which means that people who do not need to take an acute bed can use a GP bed in that hospital. Similarly, people who have been in an acute hospital can use that hospital as a staging post on the way home. A walk-in centre will be built in Glossop through the local improvement finance trust programme, and I am delighted to say that the town has a high level of registration by dentists. Tameside and Glossop is an historically low-funded area, so I am pleased to say that it is getting a 9.4 per cent. increase this year and a 9.3 per cent. increase next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para27"><a name="06050987000063">High Peak and Dales PCT also has a record of excellence, although the locality is different. The Corbar maternity centre is a centre of excellence, and it was recently reopened and reinvigorated in Buxton. The Stonebench ward is one of the most deprived wards in my area, and for the first time it has both GP and dental services provided through PCT investment in the Sure Start programme. It also has the first four dentists employed by the NHS who do not have the option of going private. That historically high-funded area will still get an 8.1 per cent. increase this year and an 8.2 per cent. increase next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="60509-0012.htm_para28"><a name="06050987000064">There is an issue about the High Peak and Dales PCT budget, because&#151;sin of sins&#151;the PCT has overspent by 1 per cent. on its 2005-06 budget, which has resulted in the closure of the minor injuries unit in Buxton for eight hours a day between midnight and 8 am and the failure to bring an elderly person&#146;s ward at the Cavendish hospital back into use after refurbishment. I agree with the protestors who say that the minor injuries unit should be available 24 hours a day, and I hope that the PCT will make sure that it comes back into service in one form or another. Between midnight and 8 am, the unit used to serve an average of two people a night&#151;on average, one of them would go to A and E, while NHS Direct would probably be able to deal with the other. Nevertheless, public pressure is such that the situation requires a response. Equally, I agree with the PCT that the elderly ward should be brought back into use first when the money becomes available. In dealing with that minor overspend, no redundancies have been necessary, and I hope that the situation will be corrected before too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para0"><a name="06050987000065">Like PCTs in other areas, PCTs in my area face reorganisation. Tameside and Glossop PCT is perhaps the only PCT which straddles a regional border&#151;Tameside is the north-west region and Glossop is in the Trent region. Greater Manchester SHA has proposed that Tameside and Glossop should stay together, which recognises the local affinities, the local needs of Glossop, transport connections and travel-to-work areas. Indeed, 1,601 people replied to the public consultation in Glossop, of whom 1,597 supported maintaining the current link. Greater Manchester SHA only consulted on that option, while Trent consulted on four options, two of which would take Glossop back into Derbyshire in order to make a Derbyshire-wide PCT, which would be coterminous with social services. I understand that argument and see why social services and health services should be run according to the same boundaries, where no overriding feature exists. However, because of the geography of Derbyshire, and, in particular, the geography of Glossop, it is essential to maintain the link between Tameside and Glossop, and I hope that the Minister will announce the adoption of the status quo when he makes the announcement in a couple of weeks&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06050987000066">I have already mentioned Corbar maternity unit. For some reason, the whole of High Peak is included in the north-west region, where a number of options are currently being considered for maternity and children&#146;s services. The consultation is open until the end of this week, and the large number of such units will be reduced to eight or nine in the Greater Manchester and north-west area, with the aim of improving staffing, quality, investment and opportunities for excellence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06050987000067">That idea has come from within the NHS itself&#151;it is not being imposed from elsewhere. I am happy to tell the Minister that I have supported option A, which is already the preferred option, because it not only retains Corbar maternity unit in Buxton&#151;in fact, all the options do that&#151;but is the only one that maintains the maternity services at Tameside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06050987000068">Having said that, if Ministers find that there is an opportunity to show some flexibility, they might acknowledge that the reduction in choice from 13 or 14 units to around eight is a bit drastic. Perhaps they could consider the possibility of including Macclesfield in option A, because choice is an issue here. As someone who is used to representing a constituency on the fringe of a region, I am aware that one usually does not have as much choice as one does elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06050987000069">The NHS has been a huge success under Labour. More staff are employed and they are better paid than ever. There are more community services and more flexible services. There is an imaginative use of private capital to support and expand, not replace, public services, and there will be more to come. In the NHS, change is always difficult and challenge is always complex. Champions of health care, especially in our most deprived communities, are worth their weight in gold. The principles on which the NHS was founded, which, we are told this afternoon, are espoused across the Chamber, are safe with this Government. Equally, the funding that has been championed only on this side of the House is safe with this Government. We have a job to do with the NHS&#151;let us get on and do it so that we have a better NHS for all.</p>

I recall listening to &#147;Yesterday in Parliament&#148; during the late 1970s and mid-1980s, when Mrs. Thatcher was challenged week after week on the state of the NHS. She always answered robustly from the Dispatch Box with reams of statistics saying how many more operations had been carried out and so on. Even in those years, despite the myths that may be spun, the NHS was improving. Nevertheless, it did not work, because it did not match up to the ordinary people&#146;s perceptions based on their experiences. That is the problem that my constituents are having at the moment.

Yet only one GP practice south of the A337 is still taking on new patients. That outgrew its existing premises some time ago and is short of space, whatever measure one chooses to use, and sometimes the cramped conditions in the waiting room are unacceptable. A few years ago the practice secured the primary care trust&#146;s permission in principle to expand its premises, but before it could do so, a directive from the Department of Health instructed that that was not to happen because the funds were to be allocated not to the primary care trust but to Hampshire as a whole. Hampshire&#146;s priorities are different; they apparently lie in Portsmouth. There is now not the remotest chance of that practice, or any practice in my constituency, being able to expand its premises.</p>

It does not suit most people to have to spend hours ringing the surgery in the morning, only to find it engaged, when they would like to organise their lives so as to see the doctor at a time convenient to them, as they used to in the past. They feel that the situation is not as good as it was before. That is entirely a consequence of the targets to which general practitioners have been subjected.</p>

do something about it&#151;what has happened?&#148; The answer is, &#147;You can rest assured that patient satisfaction will be one of the measures on which general practitioners will be remunerated in future.&#148; That does not deal with the perceived deterioration that my constituents experience in booking an appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06050987000075">Let us examine the possibility of booking an appointment with one&#146;s dentist. A couple of years ago the situation deteriorated. It got so bad that constituents of mine who were lucky enough to have an NHS dentist were receiving letters telling them that there were not going to be any more NHS dentists, but they were welcome to stay on as private patients if they wished. When I raised that at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time, the Deputy Prime Minister, who was answering on that occasion, said :</p>
<a name="60509-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="06050987000215"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am well aware of the problem that the hon. Gentleman mentions because I have experienced it. My dentist declared that he was going private and I declared that I could not stay with him. Many of our constituents have faced this problem. As the hon. Gentleman said, each one of us has been confronted with it.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 9 June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 270.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06050987000076">That does not actually address the problem. He went on to tell me that it was all the Tories&#146; fault for having closed down the dental schools. A decision by the university grants funding body more than 10 years ago is not germane to our problem now. The problem is that NHS dentists are leaving the NHS. It is not a question of a shortage of dentists but of how they are employed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06050987000077">The problem got worse. Several constituents wrote to me complaining that they had received a letter from their dentist saying that he was no longer going to be an NHS dentist but would nevertheless continue to treat their children under the NHS as long as they, the parents, remained as private patients with the practice. They did not like being held hostage in that way, but felt fortunate at least to have their children still being treated as NHS patients. The Secretary of State acted to right that perceived wrong. Instructions were issued to primary care trusts whereby they were empowered to prevent dentists from maintaining children-only NHS lists. So in the past few months, parents in my constituency, particularly vulnerable families, have been receiving letters from those self-same dentists saying, in effect, &#147;You will recall my letter of such and such when I undertook to keep your children on as long as you remained as a registered private patient at the practice&#151;well, sorry, that deal is off and your children will either have to find another dentist or stay with me and pay.&#148; That is a very worrying letter for the many families with children who have orthodontic requirements and all sorts of work to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06050987000078">As a consequence of the Government&#146;s policy, it is much more difficult to secure NHS dental treatment. However, my constituents have been told that the seventh cavalry is on the way, and that some 12,500 new dental registrations will be available to the good people of New Milton. To take advantage of those as yet virtual dental registrations, a new model is to be used to avoid the inconvenience&#151;and, of course, the attendant unpleasant publicity&#151;of long queues forming and being photographed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06050987000079">The people of New Milton have been invited to telephone a number to secure their dental registration. I have a letter from a constituent who tried that. The  <br>

To ring back please press five&#146;. Furthermore, if you press five a similar voice tells you &#145;Sorry, there is a fault please try again&#146;.&#148;</p>

He tried again on 4 April between 1.45 pm and 2.10 pm, and 4.10 pm and 4.35 pm. Each occasion met with the same result. Let that be a measure of the frustration of ordinary constituents in trying to secure the NHS treatment to which they rightly believe that they are entitled. Those perceptions mean that there is an understandable belief that things have got worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06050987000081">We have been told that the position on waiting times has changed; the claim was repeated today. We are told that a magnificent improvement has occurred, but that is not the experience of many of my constituents. At previous Health questions, I asked about audiological waits in my constituency. It has a disproportionate number of elderly people, and thus a disproportionate number suffering from poor hearing, which is one of the most socially isolating experiences. As I said in Health questions, there is a significant danger that many patients will die before they secure the hearing aids that they require.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para16"><a name="06050987000082">Strangely, I received a letter about the problem today&#151;although it is not an amazing coincidence, because I am afraid that I receive such letters almost every day. My constituent&#146;s 17-month wait for a hearing test was over in February. His appointment was on 6 February and the consultant told him that it would take three months for the hearing aids to be made up. My constituent wrote:</p>
<a name="60509-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="06050987000217"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A reliable person tells me it ought to take... say, a fortnight.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para17"><a name="06050987000083">He waited and waited. After a further three months, he rang the hospital to find out what had happened to his hearing aids, only to be told that it would take another six months before they were delivered. That is a measure of ordinary people&#146;s experience of the health service. Can we blame them if they believe that it is getting worse?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para18"><a name="06050987000084">We have five community hospitals in New Forest. We launched a massive campaign in the past year to save them because the primary care trust intended to close them. It backed off and said that it no longer planned to close them, but that it would have to work with the community to find a role for them&#151;exactly the model that the White Paper, which the Secretary of State launched, set out. There was, therefore, progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para19"><a name="06050987000085">However, community hospital supporters now experience huge frustration and staff morale is low because nothing has emerged from the process. Whatever is suggested about the role of a specific hospital&#151;whether in Fordingbridge, which could be a centre for best practice or nursing excellence, or the hospital in Milford on Sea&#151;the PCT response is that there is a difficulty because it is building a new hospital in Lymington. That is one of the first new hospitals in which the PCT will employ a private supplier to provide the health care.

therefore make any commitment about the services that need to be provided in any of the community hospitals. The new hospital in Lymington is due to open in January next year. Is that the way to run a national health service? We are only a few months away from the opening of the new hospital, yet we are told that decisions cannot be made about existing community hospitals because the PCT does not know about the services that it is commissioning at the new one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para20"><a name="06050987000086">I understand my constituents&#146; frustration and anger. They say, &#147;Yes, expenditure on the NHS has increased enormously, as have our taxes&#151;but have we had value for money?&#148;</p>

In contrast to the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), I have experienced&#151;as a Member of Parliament, a lifelong resident of my area and, most personally important, the daughter of two very elderly parents&#151;the most fantastic improvements in the local health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="60509-0013.htm_para21"><a name="06050987000088">The improvements are due to the work of dedicated staff, as we have heard, and the investment in facilities, to which the increase in the money spent on the health service has directly led. Those improvements are tangible. The south-west London elective orthopaedic centre in Epsom has ensured that the waiting time for hip and knee replacements is less than six months. I have been a direct beneficiary of that centre because my mother, a nurse who was forced into early retirement by being made redundant in the 1980s, has had two hip replacements in the past three years. Her care has been fantastic and I thank the Government and the doctors and nurses for that treatment.</p>

At accident and emergency in St. George&#146;s hospital, he was seen in less than four hours. Within 48 hours, he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, of which, thanks to the care of Mr. Bailey and his oncology team, he has now been cured. That is Government and staff working together&#151;real people, not bluster or amazing, screaming headlines.</p>

I am glad that some Conservative Members have five, but, in 1992, our last community hospital&#151;the Wilson&#151;was closed.</p>

That is a measure of the Labour Government&#146;s commitment to the health service. Instead of having to go to dingy, dirty, run-down hospitals or watch much-loved hospitals such as the Wilson close, my constituents are now experiencing something completely different.</p>

And only two weeks ago, in the teeth of opposition from Conservative councillors on Merton council, we obtained permission to build a new surgery at Ravensbury Park for Dr. Arulrajah.

My constituency is probably the most disadvantaged in the whole of Surrey or outer south London. The Tories&#146; approach to that inequality was to take away our health services, force us to cope with grotty GP surgeries and shut our hospitals. Labour&#146;s attitude involves doubling investment, building brand new GP surgeries and health centres, and reopening and rebuilding our hospitals.</p>

However, there are still a few people in place who take a bureaucratic approach to health care, rather than a human approach.</p>

Many of them were elderly or infirm, and they have suffered for years as a result of inequalities in the health service.

In the past few months, we have uncovered secret plans by the local health authority dating back to the mid-1990s. It proposed to shut St. Helier, but thankfully was unable to do so before Labour came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06050987000105">St. Helier hospital is not in my constituency&#151;it is in a Liberal Democrat constituency&#151;but it serves half of my constituents. The health establishment has for many years scorned Mitcham and Morden. Even now, despite many complaints from me, no one who lives in my constituency is on any NHS board, either of a primary care trust or a hospital trust. So I should not have been surprised when St. Helier came under threat again more recently, when the administrators decided that they wanted to remove critical services from the hospital. It was saved only following the intervention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06050987000106">Those administrators argued that the site of the main hospital&#151;the critical care hospital&#151;was not important, as the community hospitals would take most of the people who normally go to hospitals. A public consultation was conducted, and it soon became clear that the main issue would be where to put the new critical care hospital, which would house the area&#146;s accident and emergency unit, and acute services such as maternity and obstetrics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06050987000107">My view is that the people who need critical care services the most are those who are most disadvantaged and have the worst health. There is a strong link between social disadvantage and the need for emergency services and health needs such as low birth weight and teenage pregnancy. The bulk of the population live near St. Helier, and the vast majority of those with the greatest health needs live there. They are those with the lowest life expectancy, those who experience the most emergency admissions, the highest levels of child accidents, the lowest levels of good health and the most long-term illnesses. They also include those with the most babies with low birth weight, the least access to primary care, the lowest incomes and the least access to cars. The area also has the largest black and ethnic minority population. For all those reasons, I felt that having the critical care hospital at St. Helier was the best way to reduce health inequalities.

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06050987000112">The public consultation seemed to agree with my views. Although fewer people from disadvantaged areas take part in public consultations, and although my own surveys were repeatedly ignored, St. Helier emerged as the top choice among the public for the location of the critical care hospital. However, last January, local NHS managers voted to overturn the views of the residents, and to build a new critical care hospital in Belmont, a very well-to-do suburb in Surrey, instead. They did so despite the fact that the health establishment initially gave St. Helier a 7 per cent. higher score than Belmont in its original assessments. That decision would have meant that St. Helier would lose its accident and emergency, maternity and other critical care services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06050987000113">Belmont is one of the wealthiest areas in the country, and the people living close to it have a high life expectancy, good access to health care and high levels of private health care. The area around St. Helier has the greatest health needs in the whole catchment area, and the people living there have up to 10 years less life expectancy. They are also the least likely to have a car and the most likely to need to go to hospital. The whole catchment area can reach St. Helier well within the critical &#147;golden hour&#148; that our health experts agree is crucial to survival. Indeed, more people can get to St. Helier within 20 minutes than to Belmont, and St. Helier has far better public transport services than Belmont. St. Helier was the preferred choice of all the MPs in Sutton, Merton and Wandsworth, and of Sutton and Merton councils.</p>

Even the health establishment admitted that if the Belmont site was chosen, people living in seven of the 10 most deprived postcodes in the region would have to travel further than they do at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06050987000115">I was delighted, therefore, when the Government demonstrated once and for all to the whole NHS that health inequalities really do matter, and when the Secretary of State backed St. Helier too. She was brave to do that, because she must have been under a lot of pressure from the health establishment, and the decision must have been very close. She came down firmly on the side of reducing health inequalities.

I resent very much the suggestion that the demonstration at the Royal College of Nursing conference was orchestrated. Many people whom I have known well for years feel strongly that they cannot keep up the current quality of care. There have been instances of only one trained member of nursing staff being present on a large ward, of patients being unable to find a member of nursing staff to help them, of relatives feeding patients because there are not enough nurses to do it and of relatives looking for a doctor who does not have time to talk to them.

In 2002-03, the Health Committee&#146;s report inquiring into foundation trusts started with a table quoted from the <i> Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</i>, which listed the reforms that had taken place between 1982 and 2003 under Governments of different colours. There were 12 reorganisations between 1982 and 1997, another six between 1997 and 2003, and since then, as panic has set in, there have been at least 10 more&#151;practice-based commissioning, payment by results, &#147;Agenda for Change&#148;, new contracts, reorganisation of trusts, independent sector treatment centres, out-of-hours care, the computer program, the primary care White Paper and the abolition of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. The NHS is supposed to be patient-led, but none of those has come up from the bottom; they are all top-down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para21"><a name="06050987000131">With regard to the private finance initiative, would people now allow a PFI contract to be written with a clause stating that if bed occupancy goes above 90 per cent, there would be extra payment? Before the changes removing the need for some hospital beds, not all of which have taken place, as the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) mentioned, initial PFIs were made with fewer beds. Allowing a contract to have a penalty clause for occupancy levels that would inevitably be reached was inexcusable. During one meeting of the Health Committee, we tried to find out from top civil servants how widespread the practice was. The civil servants promised to send a note because they could not answer at the time, but I think we are still waiting for that note.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para22"><a name="06050987000132">There is another sad aspect of the private finance initiative. Forecasts were made of its unaffordability, and my own trust has now admitted that approximately &#163;7 million of its deficit of nearly &#163;30 million is owing to the PFI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06050987000133">We should also ask what managers in any concern other than the health service would allow independent-sector treatment centres a fixed contract for a guaranteed number of cases, to be paid for within a fixed time regardless of whether they have been dealt with, while at the same time NHS treatment centres struggle to make ends meet? That strikes me as a little odd, and it strikes me as poor management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para24"><a name="06050987000134">Another thing that worries me, and worries many people in the NHS is who would go fast and furious down the road to privatisation when there is so much opposition from health workers of all kinds? The fact of resistance is proved by the appearance of the group called &#147;Keep Our NHS Public&#148;, which has been joined by a good many junior doctors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para25"><a name="06050987000135">Some expenses resulting from Government rulings on top-down management seem to me fairly ridiculous. They may be controversial and I may be wrong, but I want to mention them. Clinical risk managers, for instance, are senior nurses who have been taken away from their jobs looking after patients in order to manage risk. Has there been any study of their value for money? The same question could be asked about quality managers. As for the plethora of &#147;modern matrons&#148;, that is really just another name for the departmental nursing officers whom we have had for years and years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="60509-0014.htm_para26"><a name="06050987000136">The typical image of a matron is that of the archetypal figure in a smart uniform who sails around a hospital and puts the fear of death into all the nurses and doctors. That one person can do more in terms of risk, quality and the standard of care than any number of highly paid modern matrons. If I were looking for savings, rather than getting rid of practising, working nurses on the wards I would get rid of risk managers and quality managers. I would return the modern matrons to their jobs as nursing officers and bring back &#147;the matron&#148; who is not bothered by management or the reforms that she must introduce, but is purely and simply concerned with quality.</p>

That money comes from a health service fund. There are other ways of training people, and I think that the number of people we lose when they go on those terribly expensive courses is distinctly excessive.</p>

My plea is this: give the NHS a period of stability, stop the reforms for the moment and do not produce any new reforms just yet, and allow the NHS time to get into balance. It is impossible to be in balance within 12 months when some 15 per cent. of the budget must be saved.</p>

At some points, it has featured the breaking out of an understanding across the House that all parties should be committed to the NHS. However, as I listened to the speeches of some Opposition Members, it occurred to me that they could will the ends but not the means for that understanding to grow. Conservative Members have been critical. They cannot pretend that their opposition to providing proper funding was not clear, given that they refused to vote with us to ensure that the NHS was properly funded. They said then that it should be made clear that there will be reform and value for money, and it was obvious that they were not in favour of increasing the salaries of NHS staff. During today&#146;s debate, they are saying very loudly that they support NHS staff, including doctors and nurses, but they are still critical of the increase in pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06050987000150">Pay is a significant issue.

That must include a proper salary and a proper job design and structure, which has certainly been missing for many people. A nurse can now advance her career&#151;or his career, given that nursing is increasingly a male occupation&#151;from a starting salary of &#163;19,000, through grades that used not to exist, and take on management and important clinical responsibilities that used not to exist.

There is a proper argument to be had about what should be included in the contract, and in my view, we should be able to demand certain outcomes from consultants. On the other hand, there are those who criticise the Government for insisting on certain outcomes. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Romsey shakes her head. Perhaps she is not among those critics, but Conservative Members certainly have made such criticisms. They say that the medical profession should decide for itself how it operates its businesses. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon.

It is disappointing that they have other issues with us, and the House will be surprised to hear that I do not entirely blame them. Their concerns are entirely understandable.

Some of my constituents would cry out for more and faster change if they felt that it would benefit patients. The question should be: what will bring about the best results for patients, not for doctors or managers? These are very difficult problems to grapple with. A continually changing NHS is having to cope with new treatments coming on stream, for example. We need to balance the NHS&#146;s differing demands in a sensible way.

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06050987000157">That brings me to a very difficult problem. A lot of change is taking place in my own area. The hon.

Incidentally, that candidate beat a Liberal Democrat in the local elections&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman failed to mention. I can understand why some people say, &#147;We don&#146;t want change in the NHS.&#148; They have grown to value the NHS and they feel that it is best left as it  <br>

is&#151;until they hear of a new treatment, which they want &#147;today&#148;. Herceptin is a valuable example. At first, the primary care trust in my constituency refused to supply it, but after some debate about the savings to which its introduction could lead, the PCT changed its mind, and patients now have that choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para8"><a name="06050987000158">That brings me to the question of where the balance should be struck. We have said that decisions should be made as locally as possible, yet when they are so taken&#151;free from political interference, hopefully&#151;do PCTs, which are charged with responsibility of consulting the public on such changes, listen sufficiently carefully? How should they then balance public demand against what clinicians tell them is best for patients? Conservative Members have put forward both sides of the argument. They have said, &#147;Save my hospital, because I don&#146;t want anything to change&#148;, and in the very next breath said, &#147;We ought to allow such issues to be decided locally, and we should be brave enough to shut down certain hospitals.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06050987000159">The truth is that both positions can be right. Some hospitals have simply outlived their usefulness. St. Luke&#146;s hospital, in my constituency, mainly cares for patients with mental health problems. Mental health treatment has changed enormously in recent years, and it is right to reconsider how we provide such care. St. Luke&#146;s has acquired a new building that is closer to the general hospital, and it could be used in a different way. The administrative facilities could be moved into that building, thereby allowing new treatments to be delivered properly in a major hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para10"><a name="06050987000160">For some people, a major hospital is not a pleasant experience or a good place to be. It is better for those with mental health care needs, in particular, to be treated in their own homes by a community nurse or a community psychiatric nurse. Such decisions are the appropriate ones to take, but there are more difficult and demanding ones. Sometimes, the clinical need is not clear, and the community take a different view on what should be delivered from that taken by the PCT, the hospital trust or even the Member of Parliament. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I see that the hon. Member for Shipley has returned to his place, and I am very glad that he is here. When he stood against me in 2001, I enjoyed his company greatly. I also enjoyed it when he stood for election to the local council, and I am sorry to have to tell him that his friend, who stood and won, has now lost her seat. I am grateful to him for bringing to the House&#146;s attention the fate of his own party and of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para11"><a name="06050987000161">The independent candidate to whom I referred earlier won her seat fighting on a ticket of opposition to NHS cuts. It is easy to utter slogans about health, but it is not a responsible thing to do. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Conservative Members laugh, which may sound fine in a debate, but it is not a very sensible attitude to take. If we are to make proper decisions about local health care, we have to accept that those decisions will sometimes be difficult and that sometimes the public need to be listened to. Part of the argument about hospital reconfiguration in my constituency&#151;which needed more care in the decision making&#151;concerned maternity services. The hon. Member for Romsey and I have discussed the issue in the Chamber before. The way in which maternity services can be delivered is changing and that should be part of a plan, but it should not be the only plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06050987000162">The difference between maternity services and, for example, mental health care, orthopaedic care, heart surgery or cancer treatment is that all those expecting a baby hope and expect that their experience will be normal and a family event. They do not necessarily consider it as a health intervention. In fact, it would be a bad thing if they did. Birth should be as ordinary and as happy an experience as possible.</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="06050987000163"><a name="60509-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="06050987000286"><b>Mr. Gray:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady. It is important that maternity services are midwife-led and available in community hospitals. Given that that is the case, why have the Government closed the midwife-led maternity units in Malmesbury, Devizes and Trowbridge? Such units have been closed in seven hospitals across Wiltshire, so that the only places to have a baby are Bath and Swindon.</p>

The community wants an ordinary maternity unit in the local hospital and does not want a midwife-led unit, so we are on opposite sides of the argument. My personal view is that midwife-led units can, in the right circumstances and with the right support, be of great benefit. Midwives are the right people to make decisions and help a mother through all prenatal care, the delivery of the baby and some of the postnatal care. The relationship that can be built up over a period of time is valuable to a safe birth and important in helping mothers to take decisions that lead them away from unnecessary interventions, such as elective caesareans. As soon as a pregnant woman visits the local maternity unit, she sees shiny pieces of equipment and thinks, &#147;Oh my God, I need some of that. It is bound to all go wrong and I want to ensure that I am as near to that equipment as possible.&#148; That has been the undercurrent of the debate on health.</p>

In fact, the argument started five years ago when the health authority took a decision against the advice of the hospital, which wanted to move maternity services into one huge unit&#151;a sort of super maternity unit. We rejected those plans, although the hospital claimed at the time that it was a matter of clinical need. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) has mentioned clinical need, but the problem is that clinical decisions are not always straightforward. Clinicians argue about them all the time. Indeed, clinicians from all over the country came to my constituency to argue about the best way forward for delivering babies. There is not only one point of view or one way of delivering excellence. That is fine, if the community backs the eventual decision. If everybody in my community demanded a midwife-led unit, I would not blame them for doing so, because it could be an excellent move. However, if it were introduced against the wishes of the community, we would have a problem, because it would be set up to fail<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon.

My constituency has one of the lowest rates of home births. It is not the norm for mothers there to elect to have that form of delivery, nor is it the norm for them to consider midwife-led units.

Despite that, it came to its bizarre conclusion because the clinicians thought that the best way forward was to separate out maternity services, send potentially difficult cases to another hospital in a different town and have only a midwife-led unit in Huddersfield. The community said, properly, that it was used to what it already had and did not buy into the PCT&#146;s suggestion. The hon.

How do we charge PCTs with the task of making sure that those services are what is wanted by the people who, through their taxes, pay their wages? That should be a simple question for Opposition Members to understand, but ensuring that we have a democratic NHS might be too difficult for them.</p>

It should be clear to the House that I place great value on giving people in the community a say in how the NHS is run. I understand why a bigger PCT could deliver better value for money, and why bigger management teams could be slimmed down. However, I fear that that approach could cause us to lose something that I value very much&#151;community involvement in the NHS. The House may not value that as much as I do, but I believe that that is how we can make sure that what is delivered is in the best interests of my community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para21"><a name="06050987000181">My proposal is that we look at how we can build a smaller, locality-based form of PCT into the overarching management committee that covers a number of PCTs. I have discussed the idea at length with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers. The advantage would be that funding for each area could be ring fenced and so deal in part with the problem raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley. That is, people in richer areas would not be able to raid the funds of the poorer areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para22"><a name="06050987000182">There is a huge difference in how the two PCTs in my area are funded.

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="60509-0015.htm_para23"><a name="06050987000183">Such problems matter. If we do not think about patients&#146; experience of the NHS, value what they say about what they want and stop the richest raiding the funds of the poorest, how can those who need the most get what they need? I hope that Ministers and the Secretary of State will look carefully at the proposals for the Kirklees PCT, and the proposals that I have made about making the best use of resources. I accept that an over-arching executive board would be cheaper than having three separate boards, but we must retain the important and valuable role played by non-executive board members. Their work as advocates for their local communities will mean that, when future consultations are held about the provision of health services in my area, people can be assured that they will get value for money and the health service that they crave.</p>

I am sorry to say that that ideology seems to be shared by ranks of dubious advisers and think tanks, as well as the official Opposition and, sadly, the Prime Minister.

It is an ideology dreamed up by people who do not understand what the NHS is. As I understand it, the NHS is the vehicle by which we&#151;the healthy, the taxpayers&#151;entitle the sick and infirm to a standard of care that they simply could not afford by themselves. The NHS is a provider of entitlements and a moral enterprise. It is not a business, but nor is it a fairy godmother to satisfy every whim and ill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06050987000187">However, just as the sick are entitled to care, so the taxpayer is entitled to value for money, and to see that the money invested is well spent. We all welcome the new investment, and we all want value for money, which leads us to the mantra about investment and reform that the Government recite again and again&#151;although the word &#147;reform&#148; should be a synonym for beneficial change, and not just for change itself. Moreover, not every change is a reform, and there is certainly something wrong with permanent reform that is too fast and too frequent, and which is ill-managed and incapable of being withstood by the organisation to which it is applied. That is what is called chaos.</p>

We have almost got to that stage in the NHS, caused by well-motivated but mistaken attempts to secure value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06050987000189">In the early phase of this Government we had a target and inspection regime that in itself was not bad: setting targets and having inspections is one way to encourage a degree of efficiency in a public service. Gradually, however, it was recognised that the service could be distorted by performance indicators that caused silly things to be done, such as taking the wheels off trolleys so that they could be called beds. Moreover, targets could be politically driven. They were micromanaged and run to satisfy inspectors, and they were neither sufficiently focused nor alert enough to patients&#146; needs or clinical priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06050987000190">That approach has not been abandoned altogether: it is still around, being implicit in the contracts for dentists and GPs whereby activity is to be rewarded. In some ways the process has become more sophisticated and works a little more harmlessly than in the past. Now we simply have a new, more dominant model of reform; in the absence of another description I shall call it the market model. It seems to be widely accepted on both sides of the House, although not by me, and consists of turning our NHS institutions into autonomous trading units, increasing competition and importing concepts of consumer choice from private enterprise. Its rationale is relatively easy to understand: such models are supposed to encourage efficiency in the private sector, so, it is argued, they will necessarily encourage it in the public sector.

model will eventually shake out waste and inefficiency in the NHS, which of course we are all against.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06050987000191">There are fears about the model, however. The fear that it will accentuate health inequality has been voiced in the debate. There is also the fear that the model will bring unpredictability, and the fear, which should dog Labour Members, that it will bring the collapse of much-needed services and district general hospitals. The reason for those fear is that markets do not deliver entitlements, and the NHS is not a market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06050987000192">To deliver the complex entitlements that the NHS offers, it needs to operate seamlessly. There must be strong clinical networks spanning many agencies, co-operating and not trading with one another. The NHS needs strong partnership arrangements and good integration. I offer a practical example from my own neck of the woods, where there have been long-standing problems with children&#146;s services, which were to be ameliorated, in part, by co-operation between Alder Hey, the PCT and the acute trust to establish good and better clinical networks. That clinical network&#151;the solution&#151;has been blown apart, because the organisations concerned have acute individual financial needs and problems that they need to address separately rather than co-operatively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06050987000193">I have another example. My local GPs have told me that they want to work co-operatively, to co-provide and fund new secondary care facilities, but they dare not because there are so many uncertainties about the effects of the choose and book system. The GPs might set up something for which there turned out to be no predictable demand, so their investment would go to waste.</p>

After all, what market has its costs and tariffs invented, varied, tweaked and tweaked again by civil servants on an irregular and unpredictable basis? What market rewards providers in one area more than in another, not by market circumstances but by Government decree? I am referring to the market forces factor, which may be subject to considerable debate at a later stage. What business&#151;whether Tesco or any other&#151;forces its newer branches, as the NHS forces hospitals, to bear the capital costs of newer buildings, so that it costs more to treat people in newer hospitals, which trade at a loss and are then charged 10 per cent. on their overdraft? The word &#147;trade&#148; is horrible in this context, but we are forced to use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06050987000195">That is the situation in my local hospital. It has new buildings and good clinical outcomes.

There is no clinical or patient need to close it, because the patients will be transferred to the only remaining Victorian asylum operating in England.

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para22"><a name="06050990000008">My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West talked about perceptions. If nothing else this evening, I hope that we can bring Members on both sides of the House together, at least to recognise that what is happening in our own constituencies is not necessarily the same as what is happening in those represented by other hon. Members. Certainly, the bigger picture for Guildford and Waverley PCT is looking rather grim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para23"><a name="06050990000009">The PCT had a substantial and partly inherited deficit. Last week, to alleviate that deficit, it decided, against public opinion, to close community beds. It took that decision after many months of consultation and many hours of work by the local community. The PCT decided to close Milford hospital, which, although not in my constituency, is used by many of my constituents and is a specialist rehabilitation centre. It also decided to close beds at Cranleigh village hospital. That was one of five options that the PCT had to consider. Democracy and local opinion have been mentioned, and it is of note that 94 per cent. of local people did not want that option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para24"><a name="06050990000010">The decision was taken despite the fact that the local community in Cranleigh has raised considerable funds to rebuild Cranleigh village hospital. It was taken despite the fact that the Cranleigh village hospital trust has now been given a piece of land on which to build the hospital and despite the fact that it has planning permission to build the hospital and a partner within the project. In fact, the trust was going to build precisely what the Government would like to see: a community hospital that has flexible space, the opportunity for step-up or step-down beds and the space to perform diagnostics within the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="60509-0016.htm_para25"><a name="06050990000011">By pulling the plug on the beds at Cranleigh village hospital, the PCT has put the project in jeopardy. The partners are unsure whether there is any real commitment from the NHS to buy services from the hospital. It is extremely disappointing to local residents in Cranleigh that the Government cannot see that. I share the frustration of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who said that he has written to the Secretary of State and to Ministers but nobody is listening. There are exceptional circumstances&#151;Cranleigh village hospital is one&#151;where the community have embraced some of the changes that the Government would like to see and have raised all the funds to build a new hospital, but still it seems impossible to get the attention of Ministers or the Secretary of State.</p>

Having been in balance, the trust is now forecasting a &#163;15 million overspend and today it announced plans to try to counter that. I have had some reassurance that the situation is unlikely to lead to redundancies at this stage, although I think that there will be some job losses.</p>

and I note his comments. I remember a time when I worked in the NHS, when the first aim and objective of many public sector workers was their pay and conditions of service. Their second objective was service delivery. That was in the &#146;70s and I remember it well. I do not believe that that is the case now or that the Royal College of Nursing did what it did the other week&#151;or is coming here to do on Thursday&#151;because those people are self-serving and are simply thinking of their own jobs.

There is a reason I joined the Conservative party and not the Labour party and if Labour Members really want me to go back and describe the situation in the NHS when I was a nurse, I will gladly tell them about it.

The problem is that, on the one hand, the Government talk about delivering services more locally and closer to people&#146;s homes and, on the other hand, they talk about reviewing acute services and moving such things further from people.</p>

My constituents have been refused PET scans and DAT scans, and even a hernia operation, because the PCT is not buying them any more, on the grounds of cost. The hospital says that the PCT will not pay for them and the PCT says that it has funded them, but the patients are left terribly confused and do not know who is making the decision. The NHS about which some Labour Members talk is not the NHS that I recognise at the moment in Guildford. The situation is not all bad, but there are serious problems and we are finding that our services are being cut.</p>

The national standard for a first routine out-patient appointment is 13 weeks. At Chesterfield, a patient waits a maximum of 10 weeks, although most people do not have to wait even that long. That success is largely due to a close working relationship between our primary care trust and the hospital to ensure that waiting times are some of the lowest in the country. By the end of March last year, every single patient who was referred with suspected angina was seen within two weeks. Every single patient with suspected cancer saw a cancer specialist within two weeks, and every single patient diagnosed with cancer was treated within one month. The hon.

be spent on health or that we need to find various ways to attract it. He may wish to take that lesson on board. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="60509-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06050990000045">Northamptonshire is desperately underfunded. We have heard that there are many problems and that people wish to transfer money from the wealthy areas to the poor ones. I am not sure that we are a poor area, but we are certainly heavily underfunded in local government, policing and health. The Minister for Local Government acknowledged those problems but did not act to deal with them when I visited him in December last year. They are caused by various factors&#151;I shall not go into all of them, because time forbids&#151;but a serious shortfall has resulted from the formulaic underfunding of Northamptonshire in general and Northampton in particular. We face an additional problem as the result of the sustainable communities programme that the Government have forced on us, but which most of us reject. There is sizable growth, but the need to fund extra medical provision has simply not been recognised by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="60509-0017.htm_para18"><a name="06050990000046">The most serious problems are in health. Leicestershire, Rutland and Northamptonshire strategic health authority is the worst-funded SHA relative to the notional capitation formula. Together with our PCTs, it was underfunded by &#163;88 million&#151;5.3 per cent. of the budget&#151;and thus significantly below the capitation funding level at the end of the last financial year. Northampton general hospital faces severe demands for a reduction in spending in two areas in particular. It has been forced to reduce spending on the 2006-07 budget by &#163;7.8 million or 4.5 per cent. of the budget, which means reductions in the length of stay and staffing&#151;particularly health service staff, as well as increased day care treatment. Doctors may wish to recommend that a patient remain in hospital, but the hospital fears that it cannot allow them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="60509-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06050990000047">In addition, the hospital faces a further reduction of another &#163;8 million because of the transfer of certain functions to the primary care sector. I accept that that is Government policy, but it creates a massive challenge for both the hospital and the primary care sector, as there will be a 10 per cent. cut in the hospital budget and a 5 per cent. minimum increase in work load for the primary care sector. Any business man knows that there is a huge risk attached to such change within a year. I am not sure that the Government have understood what that risk element means. I can tell them. It means possible cuts in services, a lack of resource to service the requirements, and less good treatment for the patient. On top of that, we have a further problem in Northamptonshire because &#163;25 million of underfunding has been carried forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="60509-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06050990000048">The Office for National Statistics said that we were to have no growth in Northampton between 2001 and 2008. I invite the Minister to come to Northampton. By God, he will see growth on a massive scale, yet the ONS said that we were to have no growth, which meant that we were not funded. That was accepted by the Government. What have they done? They have given us slightly increased growth for 2006-07, but have taken no account of the &#163;25 million underfunding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60509-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06050990000049">That is placing a massive burden on the primary care trust. I plead with the Minister to reconsider.

Examining and investing in public health in Hull is key to the future prosperity and regeneration of Hull and that part of East Yorkshire. The life expectancy of a man in Hull is at least two and half years off the national average. For a woman, the corresponding figure is just over a year.

We will always need hospitals, but we also need to ensure that we invest in our community sector. I was pleased that there was some debate earlier about the LIFT programme and the money that the Government have identified to go into enhanced service delivery for GPs, linked to the wider regeneration of areas such as Hull.</p>

on site&#151;to build a &#163;45 million cardiac and elective surgical facility at the Castle Hill hospital site, and &#163;60 million is available for a new oncology centre at Castle Hill. Several other smaller capital developments are either planned or already in progress. My constituents are really seeing the benefits of massive investment in the NHS in Hull and east Yorkshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06050990000057">My area in Hull is rated ninth out of the 354 local authorities and districts in the country in respect of disadvantage and deprivation: health care is thus a key issue for us. I was very pleased that the Hull York medical school came to the Hull university site a few years ago, which meant that we were training doctors who would, we hoped, decide to make their careers in the Hull and East Riding area. We put in a bid for a new dental school, but it was unfortunately not successful. I remain hopeful of another round and another strong bid from the Hull York site, which should be viewed favourably by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06050990000058">I want to finish with a few comments on some recent visits that I have made. The first was to the East Yorkshire eye hospital. I encountered a fabulous NHS staff team there, including a consultant who told me that, from the day he sees someone who needs a cataract operation, he can be operating nine days later. I believe that that is phenomenal when we think that a few years ago, people in Hull and elsewhere had to face months of misery before having a cataract operation. Nine days is brilliant and something to be very proud of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06050990000059">We should also pay tribute to the flexible way in which NHS staff now work. It was interesting to hear from the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) about what I thought was a rather old-fashioned way of demarcating doctors, nurses, matrons and so forth. What I felt was so refreshing when I visited the eye hospital was the fact that the consultant, the nurses and the administrators worked incredibly well together to ensure that the patient experience was the best possible. It was a real team, which recognised the importance of working as a team. There was no pulling rank in the sense that the consultant had considerable experience while others did not: they operated as a team, which demonstrates the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06050990000060">I would like to say a few words about the Hull and East Yorkshire women and children&#146;s hospital, which provides midwifery-led care.

That is simply not taken into consideration when we look at the issue from a purely accounting perspective. Does she agree that that should be taken into account as well?</p>

because it was midwife led and no consultants or doctors were there to deal with any emergencies. Women then had to be put into an ambulance and taken back to the centre of Hull. There are many important issues there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para5"><a name="06050990000063">When the Jubilee centre was being designed, I suspect that management was not thinking sufficiently clearly. There are two sites in Hull&#151;one in central Hull, the other in East Riding. It is now believed that elective surgery and planned occurrences such as having a baby should be carried out on the site outside Hull and that the acute hospital should deal with accident and emergency and provide urgent treatment that cannot be arranged in advance. The issue involves management and thinking about what will be most effective for people in a particular area. Ten years ago, such issues would not have been thought through as well as they are today, and I know that today&#146;s plans involve splitting off elective care from A and E and the acute sector.</p>

I am very pleased about the reconfiguration of the PCTs. At the moment, we have East Hull PCT and West Hull PCT, but we will have one PCT for Hull, which is sensible because it will be coterminous with the local authority. Furthermore, the local authority and the PCTs are already working together on the public health agenda: a public health director has been jointly appointed; work is going on in our schools to encourage healthy eating among young children; free swimming has been provided for young children; and smoking cessation groups are working particularly well.</p>

taxpayers&#146; money into a structurally dysfunctional organisation. What is structurally dysfunctional about the Department of Health or, using language that the Government understand, where does the systemic failure lie? In too many cases, there is no link between the central strategies followed by the Department of Health and what is delivered on the ground. The Government are trying to micro-manage from Whitehall, but they do not take responsibility when things start to unravel on the ground in our constituencies, and we have heard many examples of that today. I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) in hoping that Ministers are listening to the problems, which are real.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06050990000070">I shall give the House two brief examples. A key plank of Department of Health strategy is to move patients from being treated in an acute setting in hospital to being treated in the community. We have been told that that strategy reflects the patients&#146; desire to be treated closer to home. In my experience, most patients want to be treated in the most appropriate place, which should be down to doctors, but we have been told to follow that strategy in order to reduce referrals to secondary care and to control the financial situation. GPs in my constituency have acted responsibly and organised themselves to take the challenge seriously and to examine delivering services in GP surgeries which have historically been delivered in hospital. However, we have no community hospitals in my constituency.</p>

Despite the Government&#146;s strategy of trying to take people out of acute services and into our community, there is simply no money available from the primary care trust for any new doctors&#146; surgeries to fulfil either the strategy of trying to increase the services that are available through surgeries or the demands of the many thousands of new people who are moving to Basingstoke every single year.</p>

As a simple person who has been in business for about 17 years, I find that the way in which the Department tries to put together accounting practices is for the benefit of nobody but itself. When doctors look at creative ways of trying to improve services for their patients, financial limitations, in the shape of accounting procedures, are put in their way. That is deplorable.</p>

When the Department&#151;indeed, the then Secretary of State, who is now Home Secretary&#151;announced that by 1 April 2005 all hospitals would be able to provide at least one cycle of IVF treatment, that built up the hopes of a great many of our constituents. It received good media coverage for that&#151;just before a general election, I seem to recall&#151;but the reality is that health care providers in our constituencies cannot provide that service on the ground. There was no more money to deliver, and the result was a great deal of distress and pain for people who deserve better. It does not seem to matter much to the Department whether the headline matches the reality.</p>

It recently benefited from significant investment in the capital of its building, but now faces a &#163;6.8 million overspend that is described by the departing chief executive as a significant financial problem. Indeed, it is a problem that will also be worrying staff, as it is expected that several rounds of reductions in posts, and some redundancies, will have an adverse effect on the performance of this excellent trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para17"><a name="06050990000077">I listened closely to what the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) said about supporting the elderly, because the Mayday trust has found it necessary to close down a ward that was dedicated to such support. In times of financial difficulty, inappropriate decisions are often made whereby services are in effect forced to transfer to other parts of the public sector, often to areas where the eventual cost of care will be greater than it would have been for the authority that has been trying to transfer it to others.</p>

First, I welcome the two new Ministers&#151;the hon. Members for Leigh (Andy Burnham) and for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)&#151;to their posts and wish them success. I have sat through the long debate, in which we had, with one notable exception, thought-provoking, valid contributions of quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para22"><a name="06050990000083">My first point is a macro point. No hon. Member wants the NHS to be out of financial balance. However, the Government&#146;s macro reality is that they are spending &#163;96 billion on the NHS, whereas my micro reality is that my local acute hospital and my PCT are in deficit. The Government&#146;s macro reality is that, as the Secretary of State said, the financial problems are always created by the trusts. That is not so. The bulk of my constituents in Wimbledon look to St. George&#146;s as their acute hospital, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan). I have spoken to the financial director, Mr. Colin Gentile, and the turnaround team has done a good job. However, one of the problems that exacerbated the deficit was the inability of the Department of Health to get its tariffs correct in the first place. Although the Government say that the problems are always caused by the trusts, that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para23"><a name="06050990000084">Secondly, let me consider the local point. The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh), who is no longer in her place, made an ill-tempered contribution, in which she allowed no interventions. Her constituency is next to mine and we share a borough council and a health reality. The health reality that she portrayed was not that that some of us experience. Yes, several improvements have taken place at Sutton and Merton PCT but she should also have said that it has deficits. Some are due to overspending, which it needs to put right, but others, as in the case of St. George&#146;s healthcare trust, are due to a problem about which it could do nothing. An arbitration settlement from three years ago hit it. Community practice nurses, the district nursing service and the home health visiting service are consequently being cut. The White Paper states that community health provision should not be cut as a result of short-term budgetary issues. I ask Ministers to think about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para24"><a name="06050990000085">The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden also spoke a lot about the &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; project, and about her supposedly great victory in retaining St. Helier hospital. St. Helier was never going to be closed: it was either going to be a local care centre or an acute care trust. She misrepresented the situation several times, and I look forward to reading <i> Hansard </i>carefully tomorrow and, I hope, making some points of order and asking for some corrections.</p>

As a result of that decision, the whole &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; project has now gone into abeyance, and the business case has been distorted. My constituents in Wimbledon, who want to see excellent local primary care delivered through the local care hospital, can no longer be certain that that will happen, either in the given time scale or at all. I am seeking reassurance from the Ministers that it will happen.</p>

My local acute trust has overspent by &#163;24 million, which means that it will have to make considerable savings. There is no doubt about that. Some of the reasons for the overspend are quite interesting. The trust talks about an overspend from the last financial year, as well as about money that needs to be spent over the next year in order to meet Government targets and to comply with other financial pressures. Therein lies the message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para26"><a name="06050990000088">Health trusts have tried hard to meet the various targets that the Government have set. They have had to reduce waiting times and perform a certain number of operations and procedures, for example, in order to meet those targets. The problem is that, in doing so, they have overspent. It is a bit rich of Ministers to point the finger at health trust bosses who have done their bidding and performed the tasks that they were asked to perform, and who are now being threatened with the sack because they have overspent. The Government cannot have it both ways, and it is absurd that they appear to want to take that position.</p>

That is partly due to relocation to a new hospital site funded by a public-private partnership. I welcome the creation of the new health facilities, provided that they are used effectively and properly. My concern, however, is that that is not going to happen, because efficiencies&#151;such as those relating to the use of theatre time&#151;that need to be put in place now have not been followed through properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="60509-0018.htm_para28"><a name="06050990000090">In the Secretary of State&#146;s opening speech, she commented on the fact that my local hospital trust was going to make savings from the temporary agency staff budget. That might be quite clear, but she appeared to pass over the issue on the ground that that meant that there would be no loss of clinical staff on the front line. I simply do not accept that. While those savings are part of the recovery plan that the health trust is putting in place, it seems clear to me that the jobs of permanent front-line staff will be threatened.</p>

savings cannot be made and that more pressures are being brought to bear. As the chief executive of my health trust is suggesting, more job savings on the front line might be needed. Locally, there is considerable uncertainty. The local health economy faces a number of challenges, which the professionals, nurses and doctors are working extremely hard to meet, but the threats are there.</p>

Priorities set from the centre must be adhered to, spending levels must be followed and increases in spending cannot be applied elsewhere. The suggestion that it is all about local decision making and local management misses the point. It is about central direction, the priorities set by Government and failures from the centre. The localities must deal with that, but the problems are caused by the centre.</p>

He made only one point that I thought was worth putting on record&#151;about the difficulty of being on the border between two English regions and the disparities that that creates. I ask him to consider the problems of being on the border with Wales. The health provision for my constituents in Farndon is completely different from that for those in Holt in Wales, 200 yd across the River Dee.

No wonder the hon. Lady did not like the professional health establishment. Not surprisingly, none of its members agreed with her, or, indeed, with the Secretary of State.</p>

The Government have not committed themselves to any amount beyond 2008. The suggestion being made in the Whips&#146; handouts to the parliamentary Labour party is therefore a complete Aunt Sally. I have some of the notes here. The main argument that features in the material that the Whips keep handing out to Labour Members&#151;they have done it before every health debate in which I have been involved for the past few months&#151;is that there is a distinction between us when it comes to funding. There is not. We made a total commitment to the same level of funding as the Government&#146;s until 2008.

Friends the Members for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) and for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) identified on their constituents&#146; behalf the need for efficient investment in the health service, and to balance finances in order to respond to local need. That point was reflected by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), who discussed costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0605102000017">We have to make it clear that the issue in today&#146;s debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex said, is the competence of the Secretary of State, not of the hard-working doctors and nurses whom we support, and who are doing their best to deliver health care for our constituents. The shadow Secretary of State made with forensic skill&#151;as skilfully as if he had used a surgeon&#146;s knife&#151;the case for the prosecution concerning the financial competence of the Secretary of State, her Ministers and the Department of Health. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0605102000018">Most people will agree that, sadly, the Secretary of State&#146;s reply was flat-footed and a touch too shrill. If there had been a bucket of sand in the Chamber, Mr. Speaker, you would have believed that, ostrich-like, she had her head buried in it. The problem is not only what she says, but the way in which she says it. Hard-working doctors and nurses&#151;let alone the public at large&#151;are fed up to the back teeth with being talked down to, and with everything being larded with a smile from here to Australia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0605102000019">Let me recap the howlers that have been committed. The Secretary of State has not listened to NHS staff or to patients. She has consistently meddled and interfered, using centralised, top-down management under the cloak of the word &#147;local&#148;, and ducking the blame as her meddling goes wrong. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Now her Parliamentary Private Secretary, who is from Scotland and has absolutely no relevance to this debate whatever, is trying to intervene from a sedentary position. The Secretary of State has presided over 13,000 job losses so far, with more expected to be announced any day. She has consistently underestimated the deficits, leading directly to real cuts in front-line patient services. She botched a needless reorganisation, and is now returning the organisation of the NHS to a map that applied until 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0605102000020">The Secretary of State has allowed health inequalities to widen. More community hospitals are closing or being cut as we speak. She has had an adverse impact on training and employment throughout the service. Her handling of Herceptin was a fiasco, as my hon. Friend&#151;and neighbour&#151;the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) forcefully highlighted. She miscalculated the demand for flu drugs by forgetting about Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. She underestimated the new doctors&#146; and consultants&#146; contracts, introduced a shambolic dental contract and wasted time and money delaying  <br>

the Barts private finance initiative. This year she is underfunding hospitals, and according to the <i> Health Service Journal</i>, the tariff was a &#147;total cock-up&#148;. She has had to cut back, backtrack and apologise, and she has allowed the home oxygen service to collapse. She has made little progress on the targets for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and her NHS information technology programme is behind schedule, under fire from the experts and of uncertain cost&#151;and what a cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0605102000021">The Secretary of State failed to get the Chancellor to address the NHS at all in the Budget. She axed the Mental Health Bill and allowed her Ministers to make spending commitments without the money to support them. Public health campaigns&#151;notably the bowel cancer screening programme&#151;have been severely delayed on her watch. Failure is rewarded with the spending of taxpayers&#146; money in the Department of Health. The Under-Secretary with direct responsibility for public health was promoted. Before the reshuffle there were two Ministers of State and two Under-Secretaries; now there are three Ministers of State and one Under-Secretary. That amounts to a 3 per cent. pay rise within the faction of Ministers&#151;at the very time when doctors and nurses are losing their jobs as a result of their financial mismanagement. Finally, the Secretary of State then tried to blame it all on the Conservatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0605102000022">To try to mitigate the financial mismanagement of the NHS, the Secretary of State has sent turnaround teams into the most troubled trusts. The full cost, like so much else, has been kept hidden. There is clearly a pattern, and we must look carefully at it. Of course the NHS deficit is the biggest scandal. It is the legacy that the Secretary of State will leave behind when the Prime Minister next needs to clear the headlines with a reshuffle. Indeed, it is the legacy that the Prime Minister will leave: he will be remembered as the leader of a Labour Government who could not be trusted with the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para21"><a name="0605102000023">The Secretary of State has consistently underestimated the deficits and refused to come clean about the scale of them. If she covers up some failings with the empty cacophony of the restructuring programme, others are hidden by a deafening silence. Our national health service is too important for that. We want it to succeed, and we want it to succeed now. To remedy the financial mismanagement today, we need a turnaround team to go into the Department of Health today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0605102000024">The Secretary of State survived last week&#146;s Cabinet purges, but turnaround in the Department is needed and her past form shows that she is not the person to deliver it. Bring on the turnaround team to reverse the decline of the NHS over which she has presided. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

assure him that I did a real job once in my life, for the NHS Confederation, and I have served on the Health Committee, so I am not entirely new to health policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para23"><a name="0605108000011">I pay tribute to my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy). She can point to real improvements during her time in office that will be of direct benefit to patients, including the speeding up of the NICE appraisal process and, more recently, the conclusion of deals for the rebuilding of Barts and new hospitals in Birmingham and&#151;closer to home for both of us&#151;St. Helens. I hope to build on her work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para24"><a name="0605108000012">We have had a debate of two halves. We have heard serious contributions, raising legitimate points, from Labour Members, and some thoughtful contributions from Opposition Members, including the hon. Members for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor). I listened carefully to every contribution and as a Minister new to the Department I was encouraged by the picture of progress on the ground that my colleagues mentioned. It was nice, too, that some balance was injected into the debate after the frenzy and overstatement from others. I am under no illusions about the difficult reality in some localities, but balance is important. The NHS is improving, and we have heard about that today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para25"><a name="0605108000013">On the other side of the debate today we have seen the unedifying spectacle of some Opposition Members being determined to talk down the NHS. Today&#146;s debate was all about destabilising the NHS and seeking to create crisis&#151;a word used by several Opposition Members today. Their plan to do so will fail, because it is not backed up by the facts. We had overstatement and bluster from the hon. Member for Eddisbury and the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). However, I got the impression that the latter&#146;s heart was not in it. I have a great deal of respect for him and he has a detailed grip of health policy, but his troops were not with him. Nor were they with the hon. Member for Eddisbury just now. That is because the facts do not bear out what they were saying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para26"><a name="0605108000014">At one point, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire feigned outrage. He said that patients were waiting nearly six months for an operation. That is a long time and we are determined to reduce it. Despite the problems in some areas, we will bring it down to a maximum of 18 weeks. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that in March 1997 283,866 people had waited more than six months for an operation. Only 74 people were in that position in January this year, yet Opposition Members still claim that we have made no progress and still they talk of crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para27"><a name="0605108000015">I was pleased to hear the balanced contribution from the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb). He mentioned the real improvements we have seen and he rightly reminded the House of the appalling record of the Conservatives in government. He was right, too, to draw attention to the collective amnesia that they have about policies such as the patient&#146;s passport. Only seconds ago, the hon. Member for Eddisbury said that there was no difference between us at the general election and that the Conservatives were committed to the same level of spending. He forgot to say that they were committed to a policy that would have taken millions of pounds out of the national health service. That has been airbrushed from history by the Conservatives and their leader.  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para28"><a name="0605108000016">The hon. Member for Northavon gave us a familiar Liberal Democrat refrain and railed against central targets but, if they were the problem, the same pressures would be replicated across the country. We have heard today that the vast majority of NHS organisations are doing well and improving their services, so it too simplistic for the Liberal Democrats to blame everything on central targets. They have brought about real improvements for patients across the country, and it is right that we should continue with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para29"><a name="0605108000017">I was very pleased to hear the authoritative and knowledgeable contribution from my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), the Chairman of the Health Committee. He injected a note of reason and perspective into this fevered debate, and those who care about the NHS should listen to what he had to say. He painted a picture of improvement across the board in the NHS, and he was right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para30"><a name="0605108000018">As a Minister new to his post, I welcome the inquiry into NHS deficits to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley referred. It will be a useful exercise, and I look forward to working with the Select Committee on it. My right hon. Friend is a Yorkshireman and so made some characteristically robust comments about the RCN and its recent conference. I am only two days into my job, so I hope that I will be forgiven for not commenting directly on those remarks, but I am sure that people outside the House will have heard exactly what he said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para31"><a name="0605108000019">I was pleased that the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) contributed to the debate, and am glad that he is back in his place. He reminded us, helpfully, of what the NHS was like in 1996, when he was in control. I was a mere Labour health researcher then, and I remember the right hon. Gentleman well. I felt that he was battling like mad to get more money into the NHS, and that he believed in it when all those around him did not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="60509-0019.htm_para32"><a name="0605108000020">However, the right hon. Member for Charnwood was not able to get more money into the NHS. I remember children in the north-west being turned away from paediatric intensive care beds, and the long trolley waits in accident and emergency departments. I also remember the winter hell that recurred&#151;to use the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s own phrase&#151;year on year on year.</p>

As I said, he was not able to get the then Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), to pay for the expansion that he envisaged. I listened carefully to the lecture that the right hon. Gentleman gave Ministers today, but it was undermined somewhat by what the shadow Secretary of State told the House in his contribution. He said that the percentage deficit was higher when the Tories left office than it is now, and gave the bizarre explanation that that was because the then Conservative Government were preparing to be succeeded by a Labour Government. I do not accept that: the large deficits that existed when the right hon. Member for Charnwood left his post as Secretary of State for Health were partly due to the fact that the previous Conservative Government would not put the money in.</p>

Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) spoke from the front line with great passion and knowledge. He was absolutely right to say that we must move to self-sufficiency in work force planning, and that we should blur the boundary between secondary and primary care. He also rightly drew attention to the Kaiser Permanente model, where specialists work alongside primary care workers. I believe that the LIFT centres that this Government have created in areas such as mine will enable us to make changes to that model of care so that secondary care services can be delivered in communities, and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) was absolutely right to draw attention to that.</p>

Conservative Front Benchers want to unpick and break the coalition of support that sustains the NHS, but whenever they add their voice in support of those whom they have never supported we have to ask why. Their aim is not save jobs or secure better conditions; they seek to undermine public confidence in the NHS and to splinter its support base. They propose vouchers and privatisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0605108001162"><i> Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.<i> &#151;[Mr. Roy.]</i></p>
<a name="ordayhd_28"><a name="60509-0021.htm_ordayhd2"><a name="0605108001234"><h5 align="left">10.34 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o411"><a name="0605108001163"><a name="60509-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="0605108002340"><b>Dr. Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> Anybody looking at the title of this Adjournment debate could be forgiven for anticipating that I am yet another Conservative Member standing up to complain about the Government&#146;s closure of an RAF base. That would be very far from the truth. I am delighted to say that the Minister has been giving the utmost support and consideration to my efforts to prevent the closure of the base. He has been able to do that not only because he has safely survived the reshuffle, which I am delighted to see<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am delighted that he is delighted. He has also been able to do it because RAF Hythe is not a British base at all. Since 1967, when General de Gaulle threw NATO bag and baggage out of France in the atmosphere of fraternal French military support to which we have become so accustomed, the base has been a US army facility in my constituency. It masquerades under the title of a Royal Air Force base and deals primarily with water craft, as one would expect given such consistency so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0605108001164">What RAF Hythe has done over these years is quite phenomenal. It has developed from what was originally a storage base into an advanced network of shipbuilding maintenance repair and upgrading skills that is second to none in the US armed forces. That has been acknowledged. In order to give the House an idea of what the equipment that is so well looked after by the personnel at RAF Hythe is for, I ask hon. Members to imagine the Mulberry harbours, which, perhaps by coincidence, were also developed, constructed and deployed from the Solent and Southampton Water region. Mulberry harbours were the artificial harbours that enabled a port to be opened on the coastline of occupied France when opposed landings were being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0605108001165">That is the work to which RAF Hythe has been essentially committed. It is involved in the preparation of causeways and the maintenance and upgrading of port-opening vessels, floating cranes, and medium-sized and small landing craft. Another particular line of expertise has been the maintenance of fleets of small vessels that were originally deployed on the back of a very large ship based in Diego Garcia, a place that I may mention again later. That large vessel, which was a semi-submersible, would be able to transport the small vessels to anywhere they were needed, flood down, and float them off, and thereby enable a floating point of deployment for the application of military force to a hostile shore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0605108001166">Over the years, the staff of RAF Hythe, who are, with the exception of two or three American personnel, entirely British, have been called upon to perform many functions, and they have never failed. They wrote the textbooks on the way to dehumidify and preserve water craft and other military assets so that they can be pre-positioned in various theatres around the world. What is more, they developed the techniques and wrote the manual for bringing those dehumidified and otherwise stored assets safely back into service and ready for deployment within a 10-day period. In 2002,  <br>

it was decided that 30 of those vessels should be pre-positioned to serve the far east theatre at Yokohama north dock in Japan. In 2003-04, a similar pre-positioning of another 30 such vessels was arranged to be carried out in Kuwait naval base. That was in no way to diminish the role of Hythe, which was integral to setting up those two bases and has been essential in carrying out the missions that the bases perform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0605108001167">At Yokohama north dock, an attempt was made to contract out one of the less skilled functions that the direct US army-employed work force of Hythe had previously performed. It was such a failure both in the quality of the work and the cost that the services of ITT, the contractor company, were dispensed with and Hythe was recommissioned to carry on with the work. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0605108001168">The key document to which I shall refer is an audit, which was carried out early this year and presented on 13 March to Major-General Johnson, who is at army field support command at Rock Island, Illinois. That is the next step up in the chain of command from which the facility at Hythe derives its work and instructions. The audit examined four options for continuing the work, which the work force at Hythe, who are directly employed by the US army, has hitherto carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0605108001169">Option 1 was to carry on with Hythe, option 2 was to continue with full and open competition, and options 3 and 4 were to use other agencies that had done similar bits of work, which related to part of the functions that Hythe had hitherto performed either for the Army or the US navy and ascertain whether they could apply. Five criteria applied: technical capability of sustaining the water craft; overall cost of the operation; contract duration; lead time to the award, and resident skills and expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0605108001170">Let me give the assessment of option 1&#151;Hythe. The audit, by the US army&#146;s audit agency, found in favour of Hythe that maintenance costs were projected to be significantly lower through continuing with Hythe than the contracted operation alternatives of options 2, 3 and 4. It found that there was a completely trained work force, total resident knowledge and technical capability, and that Hythe provided maximum flexibility, resident expertise to support exercises and no security problems because all employees are security cleared through their affiliation to the US army.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0605108001171">What was against Hythe? Only two things. The base closure was stated to be already in process, although nothing had been announced and no explanation has ever been given, and Hythe was not funded for the financial year 2007 and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0605108001172">Options 3 and 4 did not come close. It is interesting that one of the arguments against option 2 was:</p>
<a name="60509-0021.htm_brev13"><a name="0605108001221"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Readiness may be impacted if any delays to contract award by 30 September FY06&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0605108001173">and that it would be a lower risk if the award date were postponed until 31 December 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0605108001174">At the end of the process, a matrix was produced showing the four options and judging them against the five criteria. Hythe was the only one to score a 1&#151;the top grading&#151;for technical capability, a 1 for overall cost, and a 1 for resident expertise. The other two criteria, which covered contracts and how long it would take to get the operation up and running, did not apply because Hythe is already up and running. So Hythe  <br>

had a top score of 3&#151;the lower the score, the better. Option 2 scored 10.5, option 3 scored 16, and option 4 scored 12.5.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0605108001175">This resulted in the realisation that, whereas it would cost $18.42 million for Hythe to carry on doing what it does, both locally and in running the bases in Japan and Kuwait, that sum would be at least doubled by option 2, to $37.73 million. The cost of closing Hythe&#151;we assume that the Americans would act in good faith and pay off the pension fund in full&#151;would have to be added to that $37.73. That would involve another $72.85 million, making a grand total of more than $110 million in the first year, compared with $18.42 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0605108001176">Three additional vessels in Hythe have been separately budgeted for, which would keep the base going until the end of 2007. That would lessen the risk even if option 2 were chosen. When that is taken into account, we need to add another $27 million to the costs that would result from the closure, because the uncompleted boats would have to be towed back across the Atlantic for completion in US dockyards. If they stayed at Hythe, however, and if the work force were allowed to continue to work on them for that extra year, it would cost only an extra $10 million. In other words, this is the economics of the madhouse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para26"><a name="0605108001177">The audit recommended to the commanding general in Rock Island, Illinois, that the closure notice that was under way&#151;for reasons that have never been explained&#151;should be rescinded, and that Hythe offered by far the best value for money. We do not know what went on when that audit report was received at the Rock Island base in Illinois. We do know, however, that no explanation has been given, and that no notice of any significance has been given. There seems to be a desperate rush to close the base at Hythe before the end of the American financial year on 30 September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0605108001178">By contrast, other bases that carry out only part of the work&#151;in Germany and Italy, for example&#151;are not being closed, even though the base at Germersheim in Germany consistently fails to meet its targets. It carries out work not on the water craft but on flat-bed trailers and mobile military generators, in which Hythe also specialises. A similar function is carried out at a base at Livorno in Italy, which has frequently been beset by labour troubles and strikes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para28"><a name="0605108001179">We wonder whether Hythe is being picked on in this way because the American army authorities feel that it would be easier to divest themselves of their loyal work force in England than to divest themselves of people who are not direct employees of the US Army, and who are protected by all sorts of labour laws in countries on the continent that have shown themselves to be somewhat less reliable to the United States of America when the chips are down than have the people from this base in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="60509-0021.htm_para29"><a name="0605108001180">In short, we have a facility that is versatile to the extent that when it was invited to send volunteers to Afghanistan, 14 went, and let us remember that they are civilians and do not get medals or other recognition. Incidentally, volunteers were requested from the Rock Island headquarters, and I believe that three were obtained. Out in Afghanistan, the volunteers from Hythe were  <br>

This is an expert force: as I said, it wrote the manual for the preservation and reactivation techniques of pre-positioned stocks. It is an economical force&#151;it is half the cost to the US taxpayer compared with the next best option, and that is only the yearly cost, apart from the colossal closure costs to which I have referred.

Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) for what was undoubtedly a thorough and well-rehearsed contribution, and for the support that he is showing for his constituents in seeking to understand the reasons for the United States&#146; decision to withdraw from RAF Hythe. Of course, had his speech been more concise I should have had more than 10 minutes in which to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0605108001194">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the decision to withdraw US Army operations from RAF Hythe by 30 September this year was confirmed in a letter to the Ministry of Defence only this afternoon. I agree with him that it will be very disappointing news for the local work force, especially given the valuable contribution made by RAF Hythe&#146;s highly trained and dedicated workers over the years. The hon. Gentleman paid generous tribute to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0605108001195">I remind the House that this was very much a US decision. I know the hon. Gentleman understands that. Notwithstanding the case that he presented, I know that he is also aware that the decision was made as part of a wider US review of the global posture of US forces across the world. That has resulted in the reconfiguring of the US &#147;global footprint&#148; and reductions in US forces, particularly those stationed in western Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para5"><a name="0605108001196">While I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern for the local community, the US decision should be viewed in a wider context. RAF Hythe is one of several RAF bases in the United Kingdom made available to United States visiting forces under the terms of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement of 1951. It is one of the smallest bases of that kind, and the only US visiting force facility in Britain that is used exclusively by the US Army. It is also unique in that it is the only US facility in the United Kingdom that handles marine assets by the waterfront, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0605108001197">Although RAF Hythe is the only US Army base in the UK, there are other US visiting force bases in the UK that employ considerable numbers of US military personnel, including some members of the US Army. Overall, the US visiting force presence totals more than 20,000 service personnel and their families, who represent a considerable investment in the US-UK special relationship. I recognise that notwithstanding that wider presence, this will be a difficult time for the 200 or so civilians employed by the US Government at RAF Hythe who are now considering their future as a result of the US decision to withdraw from the base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0605108001198">The hon. Gentleman dealt with the function of RAF Hythe, so I need not go into it now. There are currently only two US personnel stationed there, including the facility commander and a small complement of 12 Ministry of Defence police. However, there are around 210 civilians employed by the US Government in connection with the base. Those personnel are employed in a wide variety of trades. Approximately  <br>

170 are &#147;blue-collar&#148; workers, while around 40 fulfil &#147;white-collar&#148; functions in supply, administration and facilities management. The blue-collar posts are mainly in support of the marine repair function, and include marine mechanics, electricians, platers, pipefitters and painters. Many of the personnel have been carrying out those specialist roles since the start of the operation in 1975, and their loyalty and commitment are commendable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0605108001199">RAF Hythe also has a first-class apprenticeship training regime, which has produced a highly trained and skilled work force. Such is the value of their skills that a significant number of them are in demand overseas: the hon. Gentleman mentioned many of the areas in which they are involved. They are employed by the US Government around the world&#151;for instance, in locations in Kuwait and Japan. At any one time, between 30 and 50 of the personnel directly hired locally are deployed to overseas sites for periods of three months at a time. A full team in Kuwait comprises 23 staff, and a full team in Japan comprises 27. Given that the bulk of those posts require skilled blue-collar workers, the deployed task falls largely to the 170 marine engineering tradesmen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0605108001200">The hon. Gentleman knows how disappointed I was to learn today that the US Army no longer requires RAF Hythe, when the US Government confirmed their decision to cease their operations at the base by 30 September 2006. The hon. Gentleman first raised this issue early in the new year&#151;he was on to it early on&#151;but it was not until early April that the Ministry of Defence received notification of the US Government&#146;s intention to withdraw from the base by this September. As I said, only today did final confirmation of the decision come through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0605108001201">I know that our US ally will acknowledge the considerable contribution that RAF Hythe and its work force have made to both countries&#146; defence over the decades. That will doubtless be reflected in their treatment of their committed local work force, who have given such loyal and sterling service over the years. Indeed, the US ambassador and I spoke about that very point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0605108001202">During my discussions with the US ambassador, I fully recognised that the final decision can be made only by the US Government. I was keen to register then the MOD&#146;s interest for two principal reasons. First, if the decision to withdraw from the base were formalised, as has since proved the case, I wished to make it clear how important it was that all those affected understood the timing of, and reasons for, the decision. Secondly, I wanted to register the concern, expressed this evening by the hon. Gentleman, that careful consideration be given to mitigating measures to ease the effects of the withdrawal locally, and to the thoughtful and sensitive handling of the situation. I know that the ambassador duly registered that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0605108001203">I was made aware that the MOD police complement at RAF Hythe was informed by its management of the US proposals in early April. Separately, I have been made aware that the approximately 210 civilians employed by the US Government were notified of the decision earlier today. I mention this because I have been copied a letter that the chairman of the local national employee council wrote to the US President and to the Prime Minister, among others. Again, I  <br>

registered that point with the US ambassador during my conversation with him. That letter made some very significant points, which the hon. Gentleman cogently expressed in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0605108001204">Let me deal with the UK MOD personnel, which is where my responsibility lies. The MOD police senior management were quick to inform and brief their officers about the consequences of the US proposal to withdraw from the base. I understand that senior management within the MOD police are considering redeployment of their officers, as necessary, and it is appropriate that we handle our personnel accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0605108001205">It is too early to determine the long-term future of RAF Hythe. If the base is to be vacated, a detailed process will be gone through to look for alternative uses. The hon. Gentleman will be fully aware that that first involves looking for alternative defence uses. If that is not possible, the site will be offered to other Government Departments, and appropriate rules for disposal will be applied. We are very conscious of the quality of the property that we have. Even when we  <br>

ourselves vacate such property, we try at all times to ensure that we are not divesting ourselves of valuable assets that would be difficult to replace or replicate. A sensitive process is gone through in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="60509-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0605108001206">In concluding, I hope that I can go some way toward satisfying the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns. The news confirmed today is particularly disappointing for those civilian employees who have worked so hard in support of the US military mission at RAF Hythe for so many years. I will draw the US Government&#146;s attention to this debate, and I know that the hon. Gentleman will pursue his case with vigour at all appropriate levels within the US Administration. Like him, I am keen to continue our excellent relations with our closest ally, the United States, and I know that none of his comments attacked that very close relationship. He is a great admirer of that relationship, as are this Government, and it will continue in the decades to come.</p>
