 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para2"><a name="07011960000015">The Bill will make the Government more responsive to an issue that arouses genuine passion and concern&#151;the problem of community decline in Britain. It will push the Government to go further in giving real power to local authorities and the people whom they serve. That is the only path to delivering sustainable communities that will stand the test of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para3"><a name="07011960000016">The Bill is tenacious&#151;in various forms, it has fought for life for more than five years. It is therefore right to start by paying tribute to the work of hon. Members who sponsored and supported its previous incarnations. I am thinking in particular of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) of the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) of the Labour party and my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker), who is sitting alongside me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000017">I also wish to place on record my respect for the campaign group, Local Works, which has built and held together an extraordinary coalition to support the Bill. The breadth of that coalition is amazing. Any Bill that unites the Campaign for Real Ale and the National Federation of Women&#146;s Institutes must be worth considering. The Bill&#146;s principles unite 72 other national organisations, 300 local organisations, 1,000 parish councils, nearly 100 local authorities, the Conservative party, the Liberal Democrats and last, but by no means least, 170 Labour Members of Parliament who signed early-day motion 641 in the previous Session. I am told that, since then, the proportion of Labour Members of Parliament who have expressed support for the principles of the Bill has risen to more than 50 per cent. Out of respect for the strong cross-party support for the measure, I weighted the list of sponsors to reflect the balance of hon. Members in the House.</p>

opposition from Department officials suffering from not-invented-here syndrome. He should be in no doubt about the chord that the measure and the principles behind it has struck with the public we serve. Twenty thousand people have signed up to the Local Works campaign. Hon. Members who have taken part in the more than 70 public meetings throughout the country will testify that they have been packed and vociferous in their support for the measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para6"><a name="07011960000019">What drives the rainbow coalition? It is common concern about what appears to be remorseless community decline in Britain and what that means for quality of life. The decline is well documented, not least through the incisive work of the New Economics Foundation and the all-party group on small shops. It is driven by the loss of key local services&#151;often the hubs of the community. The statistics are stark. In the past decade, we have lost a fifth of our post office network, a quarter of our local grocery stores, a quarter of our bank branch network and more than 30,000 independent community retailers&#151;the people who can often brighten our day with their enthusiasm and passion for the management of their business and their willingness to help others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para7"><a name="07011960000020">The decline affects not only the high street but the quality of our public spaces. According to English Heritage, 40 per cent. of urban parks are in decline, with only 18 per cent. considered to be in good condition. Spending on community halls has also suffered a dramatic decline in real terms in the past 25 years. However, hon. Members do not need statistics or third-party reports to grasp that problem. Most of us have all the evidence that we need in our constituencies. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para8"><a name="07011960000021">In Ruislip and Northwood, we are fighting a constant battle to try to preserve the identity and character of places such as Harefield and Eastcote in the face of enormous pressure. Those open spaces are under threat from the planning regime. Local shopping parades struggle with the challenge of big, uniform warehouses, squatting on a ring road that is choked with traffic. Local service providers are under constant budget pressure, without the flexibility to respond if they do not comply with national targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para9"><a name="07011960000022">Yet I suspect that we are the lucky ones. Across Britain, people living in many town centres and small rural towns and villages feel that the guts of their community have been ripped out. It is not enough for us in this place to say, &#147;Oh well, that&#146;s the market working&#148; because, in some cases, such as post offices, public policy has been a driver. We are confronted with growing evidence of the genuine social cost that the market trend imposes on us. It is a cost to the communities in which we live and that we hope to pass on to others as vibrant places to live, work and raise children. It is also a cost on our ability to deal with some themes that should concern us nationally. I should like to concentrate briefly on four of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para10"><a name="07011960000023">First, there is the cost to our quality of life, which is felt particularly by elderly people, who tend to be less mobile and rely more heavily on local services, such as the shop on the corner or the community pharmacy. It is no surprise that both Age Concern and Help the Aged are vociferous supporters of the Bill. The latter put it well:</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>19 Jan 2007 : Column 1039</b><br>
undesirable and unacceptable but in terms of increased pressure on public safety net provision, it will be costly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para11"><a name="07011960000024">The growing risk of street crime is also of concern. In my constituency, the once vibrant shopping parade in Northwood Hills is struggling to avoid a spiral of decline. As leases come up for renewal, independent shops give way to fast food outlets, which bring litter and attract yobs who intimidate and vandalise. As a result, resources are diverted, not least from the police, residents get disillusioned and the circle and cycle of decline continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para12"><a name="07011960000025">Secondly, there is a cost to our economy, as the loss of community retailers means that less money is circulating around local producers. Small businesses rely heavily on post offices and local bank branches for the management of their cash flow. That ought to be a real concern for central Government, because the vibrancy of the small business sector matters hugely at the national level. Small businesses employ half the work force in the country. Under normal conditions, they should be the engine of growth and innovation in the economy. Declining high streets and the concentration of retail power appear to be working against their interests. Community decline therefore carries a big cost to our quality of life and to our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para13"><a name="07011960000026">Thirdly, there is the cost to the environment, local and global. The local cost of community decline can be found in dirty streets, badly maintained parks and children&#146;s playgrounds covered in graffiti&#151;in my constituency, often on the morning after having been set up. The global cost stems from our increased dependence on the car and our difficulty in meeting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Minister should need no reminding that carbon dioxide emissions have risen in this country since 1997, and that transport is widely recognised to be the problem sector. It represents 20 per cent. of emissions and is the only sector whose emissions are growing. About two thirds of transport emissions come from motor vehicles. Those emissions have grown by 8 per cent. between 1990 and 2000 and the Government forecast that they will grow by another 8 per cent. between 2000 and 2010. We have an urgent imperative to control those emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para14"><a name="07011960000027">The path to reducing emissions does not lie simply in encouraging us to drive cleaner cars. We need to consider how land and space can be used more intelligently to reduce our need to travel. What we are allowing to happen flies in the face of that. With the loss of local amenities, we are having to travel more. The average person now travels a staggering 893 miles a year to shop for food, which is itself now travelling ridiculous distances to reach the supermarket.</p>

<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="07011960000028"><a name="70119-0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="07011960000802"><b>Mr. David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important point well. The issue of public transport and rural services has been extensively debated in the House without, as far as I can see, any satisfactory response from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para15"><a name="07011960000030">With regard to the pressure to travel more, let me give one example that brings home the impact on emissions. Transport 2000 and the Campaign for Community Banking Services have calculated that the decision to close just one bank branch in Shepshed near Loughborough resulted in an additional 1.4 million road miles per year being travelled by the residents of Shepshed, and more than 500 extra tonnes of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. If we are serious about tackling greenhouse gas emissions, we cannot afford to be complacent in the face of such trends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70119-0001.htm_para16"><a name="07011960000031">Fourthly, there is the cost to our democratic health. With the sense of community decline and loss of identity comes a sense of disillusion about our ability to shape what is important to our quality of life.</p>

 My hon. Friend is being very generous in giving way. In dealing with the important subject of democratic health, he has said much about the needs of old people. Will he bear it in mind that young people also feel very detached from decisions made in their communities? There seems to be a common misconception that all that young people need is a skateboard park and a pat on the head, and they will be fine. Actually, they have some very smart ideas about how their communities can be made more receptive to them so that they will want to grow up in those communities and bring up their own families in them later.</p>

What we need is family housing, not one-bedroom or two-bedroom units that often involve a huge intensification of land use in suburbs. We do need housing, and we may well see back gardens being used, but we do not want a huge change in the style of housing when communities do not need it.

 I am not tempted to pursue the line of inquiry recommended to me. The short answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is this. The additional cost of the national allocation plans for which clause 2 provides will fall entirely to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day. As for the community spending plans, they are all about the opportunity to redirect pots of money. I will deal with the bureaucracy issue later, as I suspect that the Minister may wish to raise it.</p>

 I was very fond of Eric Forth, but I was not fond of the way in which he often talked out very good Bills&#151;it seems that I want to have my cake and eat it&#151;and I do not like that attitude on either side of the House. I have come here today to support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill, but I urge him to be even-handed politically. This is not about one Government or one term of government; the ravaging of our communities has taken place over 30 or 40 years, and in my constituency much of it happened during the Thatcher years. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will keep the political balance right, because although there is something very wrong with the way in which our communities are being undermined, it is not a purely political matter. I hope that he will keep an all-party coalition behind him.</p>

It requires them to draw up that plan in a different, bottom-up way, with the real participation of communities and residents acting through their local authorities. Secondly, it will give local authorities the right to demand and receive a breakdown of central Government spending on local services in their areas. I emphasise the distinction between the money that is already passed to local government and the money spent by central Government directly through Departments and through their network of agencies and quangos in the communities that we represent.</p>

That must be part of the process, and there is a requirement on the Secretary of State to come to the House and explain why decisions have been taken&#151;and why inputs have been rejected, if they have.

It asks a very tough question of this or any Government: &#147;How serious are you about giving power away?&#148; Its premise is straightforward. If we accept that community decline is a fact and that it carries a significant and growing social risk, the only way effectively to manage that risk is to give local authorities and the people whom they serve real power. When it boils down to the fundamental question of who knows best, the unequivocal answer from this Bill is that local people know best.</p>

surpassed only by that which we all feel when a particular, well-loved facility in our constituency is about to close. When that happens, we MPs get it in the neck. The usual response is, &#147;Why haven&#146;t you done more about this? Why haven&#146;t you prevented this from happening? If this facility is to close, what are you going to do about it?&#148; There was a lot of disillusionment at those difficult and angry meetings, and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is absolutely right to talk about the democratic deficit&#151;a wonderful term that means all things to everyone. However, on dealing with such meetings, one knows what the democratic deficit is. The people at them do not trust us. They do not feel that we have done enough, and they certainly do not feel that we are going to do enough. I hope that, in a small way, this Bill will try to change some of that.</p>

I want to pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd). One of the most important things that happened recently was the publication of the all-party group on small shops&#146; report on the decline of small shops. It is easy to say that that was driven by the Association of Convenience Stores, which is a very good organisation, but the report explains more than anything else what is wrong. It does not necessarily provide a map for the future, but it is important to understand the causes of the problem. That is why so many organisations have signed up to the Bill. It is because we now understand the nature of the problem and the debate now is how to move forward from here.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s comments. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) was kind enough to mention the all-party small shops group, and the work that we did on the issue was supported&#151;like the Bill&#151;by Members on both sides of the House. I would mention in particular the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), who is in his place, and the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell), who is not in his. We await Government action and the results of the Competition Commission&#146;s review of the retail sector. The group&#146;s work reflected the widespread concern in all kinds of communities about the way in which trends in retail development are undermining social cohesion across the piece.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70119-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000108">There has been a view&#151;and I know that the Government agree&#151;that the Bill is overly bureaucratic and top-down, with the Secretary of State having to sign off all sorts of plans and action points for individual communities. That would appear to go against the idea of devolving responsibility. I do not see the Bill in that way at all. It is very much a bottom-up Bill. Yes, the Government are asked to take note and consider carefully how they disburse their resources, but in reality they cannot save services for individual communities. The Government set the framework and the market decides&#151;sometimes very roughly&#151;which service will survive and which will go, but it is up to individual communities to engineer not just the saving of services but their retention and their growth.</p>

 I did a little bit to help preserve small shops in my private Member&#146;s Bill on Christmas day trading in 2004. I agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s sentiments about town and parish councils and I am a huge supporter of those communities, but does he agree that the public are sometimes a little schizophrenic in their approach? They are willing to sign petitions against the closure of post offices, but when one actually asks whether they use the services they tend not to do so.</p>

 I agree. It is a case of use it or lose it. It is no good if the parish or town council decides to put money into a service&#151;they do have means&#151;or talk to service providers about how to support businesses through genuine partnerships, if local people do not use the service. Baroness Corston has just moved into North Nibley in my constituency, although I am just about to lose her ward to another constituency&#151;these things happen to us all&#151;where the village has taken over the shop and post office. On the first day that she was in her new house, she received a share certificate and a request for her to buy her share in the village shop. It was explained to her that it was important that people in the community bought their share, because they kept the shop going. If they did not use the shop, it would close. It is that sort of community action that I hope the Bill will support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70119-0003.htm_para6"><a name="07011960000112">The issue is how we can make best use of community assets. We all have community assets in our different communities, but the challenge is maximising them. That is why I think that the Bill is a bottom-up Bill. The Government can have various ideas and initiatives, such as local area agreements, sustainable communities plans and local development frameworks, and they can encourage local strategic partnerships&#151;all good initiatives&#151;but communities need to do more. The Government can help, but the communities themselves must drive it forward. The Bill will force communities to face up to their responsibilities. The representatives of communities&#151;not necessarily the elected representatives, but those who take it on themselves to save a particular community resource&#151;are very important in that and they must work in partnership with democratically elected representatives.</p>

I hope that the Bill will receive its Second Reading unanimously, because anyone who chooses to oppose it will have an interesting time of it from the various organisations who have written to us all about it.

 I, too, wish to congratulate the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) on making the most of his opportunity. He laid out very well how the Bill will work and the benefits that it will bring. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) as we have worked together closely on the issue over the past few months. He mentioned how tough the public meetings on the issue have been. I had meetings in my constituency and I was surprised by how many people turned up, because it is not immediately clear what the Sustainable Communities Bill might do, and it sounds a little technocratic. I did not think that it would set my constituency on fire, but the public meeting was attended by 150 people. I know that other hon. Members had even more people turn up, to the point where they had to change venue. It is interesting that the subject brings up a range of issues, and we have seen as much from the various interventions this morning.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The key problem is not necessarily opposing closures or proposing renewed services, but that people feel powerless about the decisions that are being taken. There is a law of unintended consequences&#151;the Government may not have malicious intent, but they do not appreciate that decisions have entirely different ramifications for different communities. People find themselves coming up against a system where there is no accountability and no recourse; they cannot voice their concerns and feel confident that they will be taken on board. My hon.

issues: first, the Bill helps to identify and tackle community decline, and promotes greater social, economic and environmental sustainability in communities; secondly, it does so by encouraging participation by communities in decisions that affect them; and, finally, it provides accountability in areas where there is no democratic accountability. I shall give some personal examples of that point.</p>

<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="07011960000120"><a name="70119-0003.htm_spnew12"><a name="07011960000857"><b>Mr. Kevan Jones:</b>
 Does the hon. Lady agree that if we are to consult local communities it is important that we have the widest possible spectrum of opinion? For example, in many constituencies there is controversy about traffic calming in communities and there are hugely fierce debates between people who are for or against it. Does she agree that it is important to ensure that the loudest minority does not get its way over the majority in the community?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. The Bill particularly encourages the participation of groups who do not have the strongest voice, not necessarily those in deprived areas, but groups such as young people whose views may not have been heard in the past. At the public meetings in which I participated, it was striking that not just the usual suspects attended. There are people with loud voices in every community who want to raise such issues, and we probably meet them regularly, but at those meetings I also met people I had never seen before. They raised some issues of which I was unaware and others on common themes, so I am confident that communities will feel that the Bill offers them a vehicle that enables their voice to be heard. As has already been said, it will create a climate in which they feel that their views will be taken on board&#151;something which may have been more difficult for them in the past.</p>

My constituency is diverse, with people from many ethnic minorities, and although there is provision in the Bill for particular consultation with people under 25, there is no reference whatever to reaching out to groups in minority communities with whom it is often hard to communicate and get feedback. As she is a sponsor of the Bill, will she explain why it contains no reference to the great importance of engaging with minority communities that are, by and large, considerably excluded from the political process? In the provisions for consultation arrangements, why is there no requirement to consult in minority languages?</p>

but that the &#163;6 in every &#163;10 taken out at the post office which would have been spent in the local community is spent elsewhere. People have to travel further for those services and might have no access to a car. In a rural area, there will probably be no adequate public transport either.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a strong case. Is not the merit of the measure its holistic approach to community involvement?

 My hon. Friend makes a good point, which demonstrates that people who campaign against the closure of a service may not always be its direct beneficiaries. For example, people could support a local primary school even if they do not have children who attend it. The point is that closures have knock-on effects. If young families cannot live and work in a community, there is an impact on the school, on the economy and on public transport. There is concern about the law of unintended consequences; many Government decisions may be well intentioned but the Government do not appreciate that the ramifications will be different in every community.</p>

For example, there is an active member of a local residents association in one of the most isolated and deprived parts of my constituency who would refuse to consider becoming a councillor, but who is a loud voice for the community that she lives in and the people whose views she feels that she is able to represent.</p>

In my constituency, there is an urban regeneration company called CPR Regeneration. It has done lots of excellent consultation with local communities on plans, but the problem is that it is seen as separate from the other processes that are going on in the community and there is no feedback. Probably it errs on the consultative side, rather than the participatory side. So, although there is brilliant evidence of best practice that can be taken forward,  <br>

there are still real ways in which that can be extended. A key issue is that the Bill would mean that the budget&#151;much of which is not funded by local government&#151;and how it relates to the rest of local spending would be much more transparent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70119-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07011960000140">That brings me to what I see as the most important point of accountability: the fact that the Bill seeks to provide greater transparency in Government spending in any local area. The regeneration company that I referred to earlier is spending millions of pounds in the area. That is excellent and it is helping to regenerate the area, but there is no clear sense of how that relates not only to other local government spending in the area, but to wider national Government spending. There is no sense of relative priorities. People have no opportunity to ask, &#147;If I were given the choice to order my priorities, would I put these particular issues of regeneration above other things?&#148; That adds to the sense of powerlessness.</p>

The initiatives are targeted like a laser on specific issues, so it is difficult to see what they are trying to achieve in the ranking of local community priorities, although obviously a lot of the intentions are good. I will give an example.</p>

Over the past six months, there has been a huge amount of work. I am not sure whether that is through the market and coastal towns initiative or a local heritage scheme. There has been massive refurbishment of the car park and the replacement of all the paving stones with granite, at the cost of tens of thousands of pounds, in order to beautify the area. In itself, that is not a bad thing. Redruth is a former mining town and it is not a pretty coastal town, so perhaps that will help. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70119-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000143">There is a problem, however. The town does not have any multiples. Virtually all the retail outlets in the town centre are independent traders. In the past six months, five shops have closed. So, we have a town centre that has a refurbished car park and granite paving slabs, but, unfortunately, fewer and fewer shops. I am sure that that issue is replicated across the country. If they had had the opportunity, the people in that community might have said, &#147;We&#146;d like to see some support going into our local shops so that when people come to the town they will visit the shops.&#148; We know that people do not come to visit nice pavements. The pavements might make their visit more pleasant when they get there, but, if there are no shops, people are not going to visit the town in the first place. All that money is being spent and the chamber of commerce, a key community group, has no opportunity to raise those concerns. Priorities are being misdirected, even if that is well intentioned.

Town and community councils in Wales are the closest level of elected government to their communities and they reflect the strong feelings of local people, who want their communities to thrive. The councils are concerned about the decline in local services and, in particular, the loss of local shops. They feel that post offices, community pharmacies and village and town centres are continually under threat from powers that seem to be beyond their control. They welcome the opportunity that the Bill provides to have their views and community issues heard at a higher level, rather than having things from outside imposed on communities. For that reason, I am keen to support the Bill. I hope that, whatever doubts the Minister might have about particular details, which I am sure we can discuss further in Committee, he will support the Bill and enable it to go into Committee.

Without doubt there is a feeling of disconnection, even in places that are relatively close to London, such as those in my constituency. West Sussex is hardly a great distance from our capital, but people feel that decisions are being taken over their lives about which they have little say at all. The south-east makes a huge net contribution of &#163;11 billion to central Government. People feel not only that they quite often do not receive a fair share in return, which is another issue, but that the decisions are removed from them.</p>

My constituency could be seriously affected by proposals to downgrade the only three acute hospitals in West Sussex. All three are threatened with the removal of their accident and emergency departments or maternity services. That has caused outrage in West Sussex. Some 250,000 people have signed petitions against the proposal and 25,000 have marched against it. However, who will ultimately take such decisions, and what real say will the community have about the proposals? The Government tell us that such decisions are not a matter for them and that they will be taken locally, but it is clear that decisions will be taken by a newly constituted, wholly unelected primary care trust.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that, regardless of whether decisions on local NHS services could be included within the Bill&#146;s remit, one of the reasons why it has such fantastic cross-party support is that the public&#146;s appetite for local decision making has never been greater? The threats of closures and the downgrading of acute services, such as at the Royal Surrey County hospital in Guildford, have heightened the public&#146;s concern about local services and their understanding that they need local NHS services if they are to have the sustainable communities that they so badly want.</p>

I am trying to persuade the assembly and board that they should introduce a bypass in Arundel, which has been promised by successive Governments but not delivered.

I became quite certain that the Bill represented a move in the right direction when I heard the Minister for Local Government this morning citing the police as an example of how additional devolution of budgets has been granted. I have been looking at police funding closely over the past year. It is clear that local communities have very little say over what happens to their local police force and the operation of community safety. Police authorities are almost entirely invisible from the local community and include unelected members. Community safety partnerships and crime and disorder reduction partnerships are completely invisible to local people. The constant refrain that I hear from local people&#151;I am sure my hon. Friends and Labour Members hear this in equal measure&#151;is that they do not feel able to influence the way in which policing operates in their communities. If the Minister was saying that there has been sufficient devolution of budgets to local communities and that communities really have a say on policing, he needs to think again.</p>

 May I offer the hon. Gentleman a little advice? He should have read the Bill before the debate because a lot of his speech has nothing to do with it, and he is perhaps harming the cause. Has he shared my experience that where police authorities have set up community forums&#151;there are some good ones in my constituency in Durham&#151;attendance is very poor? The attendance is large only when there is a problem in the community. Does that not put a huge question mark over the idea that everyone is eager to attend meetings to discuss all these issues?</p>

 I am sorry to have to disagree rather strongly with the hon. Gentleman, but that attitude is tantamount to saying that we should not bother to take account of people&#146;s views. There is great dissatisfaction with policing in many communities. If people do not attend meetings, it is because they sense that the meetings are purposeless and because they are not properly consultative and give the public no real say on the improvement of policing or other services in their communities.</p>

 May I give the hon. Gentleman a further example of good practice when consulting local people? Recently, Greater Manchester police have established in every ward in Tameside a PACT&#151;police and communities together&#151;meeting, which is open to the general public, in which ward councillors, the neighbourhood policing team, Tameside patrollers and home watch co-ordinators discuss the problems in the ward and put together an action plan.

officers in return. Communities in my constituency are angry about the fact that they had been promised police community support officers, but they are no longer to have them. There will always be difficult questions about resources, but the important principle is that, where possible, communities should be involved in decision making, so that they can share responsibility for the decisions taken, and so that there are transparent lines of funding. That does not exist at the moment, which exacerbates people&#146;s feeling that the Government are removed from them and that, although decisions are not taken in their interests, they nevertheless continue to be taxed, which is an unfair bargain.</p>

It is not sensible for us Members to lament, as we often do, the lack of political engagement without being serious about finding ways to improve it. The cause of localism is particularly important to me, not just because I think it right in principle that decisions should be taken locally, or because it will mean that better decisions are taken, but because I see it as a way of reinvigorating politics. The emasculation of local government and the removal of the control of services from the people has been one of the reasons people feel so let down by politics in its current form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70119-0005.htm_para1"><a name="07011960000174">Many of the arguments that have been put forward are powerful, but to gain a true appreciation of the legislation before us, it is necessary to go beyond the pamphlets and the good intentions of the letters, and to study the Bill in detail. Before I do so, I point out that when I leave the Chamber today, I will go back to my constituency, like all Members. I will return to Caerphilly to chair a public meeting on the regeneration of Caerphilly town. Caerphilly is one of the communities that has benefited from the general improvement in the prosperity of the country; for example, it has a relatively good record on job creation. However, the town&#151;an old, former mining community&#151;is in need of regeneration. As is the case for so many communities in Britain, in Caerphilly, there have been out-of-town developments, and estates have grown up outside it, but not in the heart of the town. I am pleased to say that the local authority has mobilised private and public money, and a plan is being put forward by the local authority, with the support of the local community, to regenerate the town, but although work is going on, regeneration is still a concern for many of us.</p>

similar to his, as it contains former mining villages. Some of the problems in those former mining communities need large solutions, and require difficult and tough decisions that sometimes divide the local community. Does he share my concern about the Bill, which is that although it is well intentioned, it comes down to the idea&#151;we have heard this from many Members&#151;that everyone will somehow come to a consensus and agree? However, on occasions, the fabric and grit of local politics is disagreement, and tough decisions have to be taken.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. Politics is not always about people coming together and agreeing, and a common strategy being worked out. It is often about discourse, dispute and creating a dialogue between people, out of which ideas emerge and change comes about. It is often about creating change, and not simply basing the way forward on a common denominator. I shall return to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70119-0005.htm_para2"><a name="07011960000177">My constituency offers a microcosm of the problems faced elsewhere. In Caerphilly town centre, many shops have closed over the years, and charity shops have opened in their place. Senior citizens, in particular, are alienated from the community in which they grew up, and antisocial behaviour has increased. Members on both sides of the House are acutely concerned about those serious issues, but are those shared concerns addressed effectively and successfully by the Bill? At the beginning of my speech, I referred to the Bill&#146;s cross-party support, and I believe that the Conservative party has published a version of the measure in its pamphlet, &#147;The Permissive State: How to Achieve Local Social Responsibility&#148;. It is an important step forward in the development of Conservative philosophy, but we shall have to see whether it is genuine, well thought-out and supported by members from all parts of the party. Nevertheless, such publications are now seeing the light of the day, which was not the case only a short time ago.</p>

As a Welshman, inevitably I must refer to Aneurin Bevan. If anyone wants a clear, coherent statement of democratic socialism based on the empowerment of ordinary people, I suggest that they read his book, &#147;In Place of Fear&#148;, which is an eloquent statement of socialism. May I suggest, too, as we are discussing Wales and Caerphilly, that Members dip into <i> Hansard </i>and read the contributions of Ness Edwards, who was Member of Parliament for Caerphilly from 1939 to 1968. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Yes, I have written a book about him, which Members may wish to read.

It is about industrial democracy; it is about when people are engaged with their communities, as well as public accountability and involvement. In discussing the need to create a new kind of society in this country, much of the language has changed but, nevertheless, we all accept that what we want is not a top-down society or an intrusive state but a facilitating state framework that allows individuals to maximise their potential so that they are proactively involved in their communities. If that philosophy is our starting point, the question is how we turn it into reality.</p>

It is a strong principle, which motivates many of the Bill&#146;s sponsors and, increasingly, the Government, but I am concerned about whether the measures in the Bill would put it into practice effectively. Many organisations have made representations to us, and we have received formal submissions expressing strong support for the measure, which they regard as a step forward. However, some organisations that studied the Bill concluded, like me, that although its intentions are good, it has significant weaknesses.</p>

 I shall respond first to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the Federation of Small Businesses. I assume that all hon. Members received e-mails yesterday from ePolitix.com. It is clear what the British Retail Consortium said. The detailed submission from the Federation of Small Businesses shows that it has studied the issue carefully. For me, and I am sure for the hon. Gentleman as well, if he is fair, the most striking point about the submission is that the federation has not endorsed the Bill. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to indicate to MPs at a crucial time&#151;the eve of the Second Reading of the Bill&#151;that the Federation of Small Businesses explicitly supported it.

It is important to recognise that the process set out in the Bill is extremely cumbersome. The Secretary of State will be required to draw up an action plan for sustainable communities. Local authorities can make representations and will have to include all valid responses and comments on proposals not taken forward. The Secretary will then be required to provide an annual report on the progress in implementing the action plan, which in due course will be debated on the Floor of the House.</p>

Each local authority can ask for a local community account each fiscal year, which will set out the money to be spent on local services in the specific area from all Government Departments for the following four years. Local authorities will prepare a spending plan to show how money will be allocated locally. The Secretary of State has the power of approval over each and every local authority plan in a fixed three months. Individual attention would be given to each plan by central Government.</p>

That is not only excessively bureaucratic, but a recipe for creating conflict within Government. Yes, we are all in favour of dovetailing and ensuring that Government Departments work coherently together, but it is another matter entirely for one Department to have such control over the strategic priorities of other Departments without a fundamental review of how government is organised in this country.

Otherwise, it is&#151;dare I say it&#151;the worst kind of imperialism. It is us as a Parliament saying to the Welsh Assembly: &#147;We think this will be good for you.

 That is a good question. It would be extremely unhelpful if we knew. We have seen examples in the recent past whereby legislation was agreed in this House and there was a strong feeling among the people of Wales that it was not required. Going back to the 1970s and 1980s, that is precisely why we had the groundswell in Wales for devolution in the first place. In 1997, there was a referendum and the people of Wales voted in favour of devolution so that they themselves could decide what legislation they wished to have on the statute book within certain confines. A clear delineation has been made in which of what powers are devolved and which powers are not devolved.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. Devising structures and processes that will inevitably create conflict is not a good recipe for creating consensus in society and implementing progressive policies. With regard to Wales, many of the policy areas that would be covered by the Bill, such as health, community regeneration and local government, are devolved matters. The Bill is saying to the Welsh Assembly: &#147;You must fulfil certain processes, even though you might not like them and even though you have not been consulted, in areas where we have decided that you should have responsibility.&#148; That is profoundly ill thought out.</p>

 We all agree that we must work to achieve safe, healthy and sustainable communities. The Road Traffic Act 1991 devolved parking enforcement to local authorities. In Brent, the new Lib Dem-Tory administration decided to send a battalion of traffic wardens out on new year&#146;s day to issue hundreds of parking tickets. Local councillors Bobby Thomas, James Powney and Bertha Joseph, and a local resident, Rocky Fernandez, started a petition to try to get the local authority to take account of what was going on. That is another example of how the Government have devolved some powers to local authorities and where sometimes it can go a bit wrong.</p>

 As I said, the principle of devolving powers is now widely accepted. It is significant that the Conservatives, who opposed Welsh devolution, now support it. The principle of devolution has been accepted, but for it to work, first, it must have the support of the people, and secondly, it must be well thought out. We are not talking about separatism but a new set of relationships. It is extremely important to ensure that when we talk about devolving powers we work out clearly and precisely what the relationships are between the Government, regional bodies in England&#151;if that ever happens&#151;the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament, and do not simply go with the flow because the rhetoric is positive and we are all getting a warm feeling.</p>

 Yes. I do not know what the solution is, because I did not draft the Bill. It would be interesting if the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood could deal with that point.

 With all due respect, devolution does not mean that, so let me provide an example of what it does mean. The Welsh Assembly Government have the ability to decide spending priorities according to their own priorities&#151;full stop. There is no question of the Welsh Assembly Government deciding their spending priorities, then submitting them to a Secretary of State in London for approval. If that were the case, it would not be devolution. My point is that the Bill uses all the rhetoric of devolution, but it does not contain the practical means to bring it about.</p>

 While I am on my feet, I will simply make this point. The debate that we have had so far has been a genuinely consensual debate. It is significant that there is cross-party agreement that the principles are desirable. Our debate is important in that respect alone. However, our debate also has to focus on the fine detail of the Bill and whether it is capable of translating into practice the fine principles that are expressed in it.</p>

 I have studied clause 6 with particular interest. Most of us agree with the Bill&#146;s intention, but one concern that we could debate further is that when we give such a power to a Secretary of State, what happens depends not just on the relationship between central and local government but on the predilections of the particular Secretary of State. I have worked for four Secretaries of State under the present Government and there were, I think, six under the previous Government. Even within the parties themselves, there are centralisers and devolvers. Does my hon. Friend think that this power could, in the wrong hands, make the situation worse rather than better with respect to devolution&#151;notwithstanding the intentions of the hon.

 The Minister makes a very good point. One of the concerns inherent in the Bill is that it puts tremendous responsibility on the shoulders of the Secretary of State at that particular time. If there were some sort of collectivity, perhaps with the Cabinet having a rubber-stamping role, that at least would be something, but the provision focuses on the Secretary of State at a particular moment. Of course, the Secretary of State may change from time to time and we must be concerned about the coherence and consistency of government over a period of time. It is not impossible, for example, for one plan to be agreed one day by one Secretary of State and then on the following day, after a Cabinet reshuffle, for a different Secretary of State who has different principles to have to agree another action plan. That is why it is so important to have some clarity and some well thought out process in place to ensure that these desirable principles are put forward in a coherent manner.</p>

 Staying with clause 6(1), the problem with the clause is that it is drafted on the assumption that the Secretary of State will rubber-stamp what is put forward. The fact that only three months are given for approval of what could be 400 plans shows that, under the Bill, the Secretary of State is not to be given any sensible consideration whatever. Let me put it to my hon. Friend that the Bill amounts to a bureaucratic process&#151;I do not think that anyone would deny that it creates a lot of bureaucracy&#151;and does not allow us to deal with an occasion on which a Secretary of State would refuse approval. It provides no mechanism for what happens after a decision is taken under clause 6(1). What happens then? No provision is made for reference back or for revision of the plan; no provision is made for a negotiating process to resolve differences. That amounts to a bureaucratic lacuna in a very bureaucratic Bill.</p>

Wales has a different devolution settlement from Scotland, but the current settlement is not fully taken into account and nor is the new Government of Wales Act 2006. That is important. Under the 2006 Act, which will be in place after the Welsh Assembly elections on 3 May, the Assembly will be given legislative powers for the first time. If we approved that legislation we would not be taking into account previous legislation that the House had approved. There will then be two Acts in place that are, to some extent at least, contradictory. When it comes to the spirit of the legislation, I imagine that the Welsh Assembly would take an extremely dim view of having a second-class status assigned to it under a Bill that is supposed to take forward the principle of devolution. It is a contradiction in terms. That is another of my concerns.</p>

Yet the need for sustainable communities was one of the main reasons for the Government&#146;s creating the Department for Communities and Local Government. The idea of sustainable communities was fundamental to that. The Department was created to work towards more economic exclusiveness in communities, and to encourage social mobility and many other things. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70119-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07011960000249">We should not forget that the Government recently produced a White Paper entitled &#147;Strong and prosperous communities&#148;, which is a groundbreaking document.

When young people come forward to express their views, they have plenty to express. They might not relate easily to traditional politicians and traditional political parties, but they have plenty of opinions on the matters that concern them and their communities.</p>

The community council was usually charged with making sure that footpaths were open and giving small grants to various community organisations. Worthy as those things are, they are not enough. If we are to involve local people in parish or community councils, we should have sufficient faith in them to ensure that attendance is worth while. I commend the Bill&#146;s reference to parish councils, but more emphasis should be given to them.

In this debate, health has been referred to in a slightly misleading way, which deviated from the thrust of the Bill before us. Nevertheless, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill represents a significant step forward in the devolution of power and public involvement, which is the subject of the debate. I cite that Bill because I firmly believe that we cannot give the impression that the issue of sustainable communities is the only one on the agenda in terms of public involvement and public empowerment; rather, it is one aspect of a broader debate. It makes sense for us to debate the principles enshrined in both documents, and I have tried to compare and contrast them in my modest contribution. In the Government&#146;s White Paper and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, those points have been given more consideration than, for example, the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) has given them.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made the important point that we should be debating the principles of the Bill. As I think we have made clear, none of us disagrees with the principles, but we must also debate the practicalities, which my hon. Friend has done very effectively so far. Perhaps the most ill-thought-out of the practicalities is clause 13(5), which states:</p>
<a name="70119-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07011960000776"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This Act shall come into force on the very day on which it is passed.&#148;</p>

A significant consensus has been established in this House, and it is necessary to bring about meaningful change. Let me read a quote from the Government&#146;s local government White Paper, &#147;Strong and prosperous communities&#148;, because it expresses very well what is emphasised in both the Bill and that White Paper. It states:</p>
<a name="70119-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="07011960000778"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we now need to give local authorities and their partners more freedom and powers to meet the needs of their citizens and communities&#151;and enable citizens and communities themselves to play their part.&#148;</p>

Regardless of what happens in terms of the passage of the Bill, we have made considerable progress. Ministers will register what has been said in our debate, and I am sure that the points that have been made will be taken into account when legislation is produced from the White Paper. We face a challenge, and the Government recognise it. I hope that the House will reaffirm its support for the Government approach, and that, in turn, the Government will take on board the views of Members.</p>

 I am grateful to be able to speak at this stage of the debate. I had intended to try to do so at a later stage, but, after having listened for an hour to the lucubrations of the hon.

It concerns the Secretary of State&#146;s veto provided for in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman wishes the Bill to be allowed to proceed and become law but with that veto removed, that is an extremely interesting proposition. The veto was included in the Bill to try to make it easier for the Government to accept it. In the highly unlikely circumstance that a local authority puts forward a plan that is manifestly absurd&#151;perhaps because a huge local democratic deficit led to the election of a number of monkeys&#151;the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to veto such a local plan. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to remove that veto and to argue for that in Committee, I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) would welcome his presence on that Committee&#151;although, in light of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s performance, I doubt that my hon.

dissatisfaction of many of our constituents&#151;across party divide, across the country and across different parts of the country&#151;that arises from the feeling that they cannot have much effect on what happens in their lives and in respect of the quality of their lives. We all know that that is the case, and we all know that it is leading to a progressive disenchantment with politicians and political and democratic institutions.

We will find that the degree to which people are disenchanted, apathetic and distrustful of politics will become unsustainable. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) says from a sedentary position that we started it. I hope that he noticed from the observations that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood made in his introduction that we are not advancing this measure in a partisan spirit, and that we accept that Conservative, as well as Labour Governments, have been part of the cause of this difficulty. We are trying to remedy a constitutional deficit in our country, and it behoves us all to take that proposition seriously, rather than engaging in partisan politics in considering it.</p>

Gentleman was shadow Home Secretary, I always found him very generous when responding to queries. He mentions shifting the emphasis to the localities. I intervened earlier on my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) about the role of parish and town councils, which cover some 16 million people in England alone. Does the right hon. Gentleman have any particular views on enhancing their powers, and does he think that new ones should be created? That could be a way of providing more accountability in respect of sustainable communities.</p>

<p><a name="st_o170"><a name="07011960000296"><a name="70119-0007.htm_spnew23"><a name="07011960000971"><b>Mr. Letwin:</b>
 That is a very interesting and serious question that I will reply to in two ways. First, yes, my hon. Friends and I do support a whole series of moves to bolster town and parish councils, and I think that I can say from the Dispatch Box today that we will support such measures when the Government bring before the House on Monday a Bill on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70119-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07011960000297">Secondly, although those measures are not in the Bill before us today&#151;not least because they are in the other Bill&#151;the two Bills are in that respect complementary, just as they are in many other respects, which I shall come to in a moment. Borough and district councils will be given significantly more power compared with central Government if this Bill becomes law. It is much easier for parish and town councils to influence borough and district councils than it is for them to influence central Government. They are manifestly much closer to the scene of the action, and much more interpenetrative. In my area, for example, district councils typically attend parish and town council meetings. I do not suppose that the Minister has time to do that in every parish and town in Britain, and nor would I expect him to. Therefore, the Bill before us moves in the direction of increasing power at a lower level even than the district or borough, but it goes beyond that. There is specific provision for parish and town councils to be part of the group of people who are actively consulted when a local plan is being made. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70119-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07011960000298">The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) has given me the chance to move on to my next point. This Bill does not create a one-off shift in the nature of our government. This is a Bill in the fine tradition of British constitutional development. It creates the basis for a gradual and progressive revolution in government over many years, because it sets up a ratchet that will exert increasing force over time. Once people comprehend the degree of power that the Bill will give them over how money is spent in their localities, they will increasingly demand more and at a lower level yet. There will be pressure for some of the decisions that the Bill conveys into the hands of boroughs and districts to be further conveyed into the hands of towns and parishes, and&#151;who knows&#151;perhaps eventually into the hands of even smaller neighbourhoods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70119-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07011960000299">I have considerable sympathy&#151;I would have even more if it had been carried forward into action in some way&#151;with the doctrine expressed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, before he occupied that post, that we should have double devolution. We certainly do not see the district or borough council as the last word in localism. On the contrary, they are important staging posts on the road towards that.</p>

 I welcome the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments, but in reality the 60 million-plus people in England do not have representation on parish and town councils. Areas outside towns have such representations, but the majority of people do not. We have to ensure that they have a voice too, because I do believe in devolving powers to town and parish councils.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. To be fair, the Government are moving towards filling that hole in representation in our cities. Town and parish councils will not necessarily be the final resting point for powers: the hon. Gentleman and I both know that some estates in our cities have identifiable communities and neighbourhoods and, sooner or later&#151;I hope sooner&#151;we need to reach a position in which they feel that they have a say over their estate. We are not there yet, but the Bill tries to begin the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70119-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07011960000302">My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood made considerable progress in anticipating the Government&#146;s arguments, and I think that I know what two of their main arguments will be. The first is that the Bill to be considered on Monday includes the concept of a duty to co-operate, in which they seek to give more effect to the spirit of local area agreements and to have agencies and Departments represented around the table in local area agreements pay more heed to local voices. I welcome that. It is a step forward. It also in no way contradicts this Bill, which would in fact take matters much further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70119-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07011960000303">I shall illustrate my point with a concrete example. My hon. Friend mentioned Kent, where some &#163;8 billion of public money is spent. About &#163;2 billion of it is spent by local authorities and some &#163;6 billion by the Government and their agencies. The local area agreement is one of the most effectively organised in the country, and it is certainly one in which everybody has tried to co-operate. It has done a great deal of good, but if one talks to people in Kent, one discovers that the degree of influence of the local authorities is heavily circumscribed, because they are not the principal budget holders. In this House we spend a lot of time legislating and talking about legislation, but we are all grown-ups and we know perfectly well that power in government today largely resides in the control of the money, not in the control of the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70119-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07011960000304">The truth is that the Bill, by enabling a significant transfer of the power over the money&#151;however it is amended during its passage&#151;will alter the relationships within local area agreements, so that the whip hand increasingly transfers to the local authorities. I say increasingly, because the Bill, by defining the role of the Minister as setting the limits of what is &#147;of primarily national significance&#148;, will create a gradually opening lock gate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70119-0008.htm_para0"><a name="07011960000305">To begin with, I anticipate that Ministers will set a fairly narrowly circumscribed area in which local authorities can control spending, and will reserve a large part to Ministers and agencies by widely defining what is &#147;of primarily national significance&#148;. Over time, local communities will demand an ever greater say, and Ministers of all Governments will come under increasing pressure to narrow the scope of what is defined as &#147;of primarily national significance&#148; and hence to enlarge the scope of local authority power.

shall see a gradual shift in the balance of power in local area agreements. If the hon.

I take it that somebody has drafted that brilliant and coruscating phrase. We heard the interesting observation that what would make the bureaucracy so unwieldy was the need for the Minister to consider many plans and for the local authority to develop large plans.</p>

It is entirely open to local authorities to do nothing whatever by way of producing plans. If local communities do not want to act, they do not have to do so. No bureaucracy will be imposed locally. It is entirely open to the Minister not to veto a single plan; indeed, in many instances, I hope that that would be the case.</p>

 I am a little concerned about something that the right hon. Gentleman just said and I would like him to clarify it. He said that there would be no obligation on the local authority to do anything and that that is why there would not be increased bureaucracy. In that case, how can a community trigger action?

 I have a horrible shock for the hon. Lady. If local people see that their local council, unlike the one next door, has taken no action and is not trying to reorder priorities, they have a thing called the ballot box at which they can vote for a different set of councillors, who will take action. That is exactly what we are trying to engender: the ability of local people, by electing local councillors and responding to the consultation when they get it, to have an effect. If the local council observes that the Government&#146;s priorities, through their agencies and Departments, are perfect locally, the councillors will suffer no consequences at the ballot box from doing nothing, because the electors will thank them. However, if all the electors would like to see x and the councillors do not achieve x, because they do not take any action, they will be thrashed at the ballot box, and good luck to the electors.</p>

 I have three examples in the Stockport part of my constituency of where the council has ignored the views of the local community: on a village green application, on a proposal to build a new primary school on a former landfill site and over the closure of the local swimming baths. That has left the community of Reddish feeling as though its views are completely ignored and it is an irrelevant part of the borough of Stockport. Unfortunately, the ballot box is not the answer, because the councillors in that part of Reddish support the local community. It is the Liberal Democrat council that has done all that.

against their area. However, he therefore ought to agree with me that the progress that we ought to make is gradually to decrease and localise the level at which such decisions are made. The point that I was making earlier is that the Bill goes some of the way towards that. It gives the power of the ballot box at one level, but we hope that there will eventually be a level that means that, in very small areas, people have considerably more direct control. I do not think that he and I disagree about the direction of movement. All that he is pointing out is that, immediately, the measure may not move all the way that we can go. If the council that he described acted in the way that he described in all parts of its district, it would get unelected. That is at least an advance on a central Government who can act against the views of an entire district or borough and yet not get unelected because they are acting in a way that pleases other people in other places.</p>

 I want to return to the point about clause 6. I think that the right hon. Gentleman was advancing the suggestion that, in effect, the Secretary of State becomes a mere cipher or rubber stamp. Obviously, if the Bill goes forward, we would like to see consensus and agreement, but there will be occasions when that does not happen. If the Secretary of State simply approves plans by rubber stamping them, without proper consideration, what about the people who are disfranchised, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)? They will be able to have the Secretary of State&#146;s decision judicially reviewed, because it was not considered and discussed properly. Equally, because there is no mechanism in clause 6, the only remedy if a plan is refused would be for the local authority to seek a judicial review of the Secretary of State&#146;s decision.</p>

 Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman has not taken advice about the Bill. The Bill has been drafted to provide a presumption that the Secretary of State will approve plans. It has been so drafted precisely to prevent the circumstances that he alludes to. The Secretary of State will not be challengeable, except under circumstances where he rejects a plan.

A genuine localist&#151;someone who is genuinely committed to conveying social responsibility for a good deal of decision making to the local level&#151;will be willing to trust that, although local people will not always make such decisions perfectly, they will by and large take them in their own best interests.

It would be hugely in the interest of not only later Governments, but this Government, for them to accept and support the Bill. If decisions are taken locally and if power increases locally, people will generally get something that is more like what they want, and the person or persons whom they will thank, oddly enough, will be the very Government who gave them that power.

In the modern world, a sense of community is more important than ever in our society. A strong sense of local community is also essential to tackle the problems of social exclusion. The Government can be proud of their achievements in that area. We have retained our commitment to it, despite the Opposition&#146;s claims that such interest in the well-being of our society is merely a gimmick designed to grab short-term headlines. Since 1997, we have consistently moved the problems of social exclusion further up the political agenda.

 Does my hon. Friend have the problem that I have in my constituency, where there is enormous concern to retain independently owned shops, particularly food shops, on the high street? The problem is not that the shopping street is run down; on the contrary, it is one of the best and most popular shopping streets in London. However, it is so popular, particularly in the evening because of its wine bars, that rents have gone up by so much that they often risk squeezing out the independently owned food shops that attract people to it.

Brighton and Hove city council has provided adult learning courses to local residents on climate change issues and the need to develop renewable energy technologies locally. Jointly developed with the university of Brighton as a community-university partnership project, the courses have led to a proactive neighbourhood engagement project with a community association that is developing proposals for energy-efficient lighting for poorly lit public pathways on a local estate.

hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd). It is an honour to be a co-sponsor of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07011960000347">We have heard a number of interesting speeches, one of which will go into my personal record book for its length. I lost track of the points that the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) was making after about half an hour, and the will to live after about 40 minutes. Nevertheless, I commend him for whatever operation was going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07011960000348">I compliment the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on a key point that they made in support of the Bill&#151;that it does not represent a trickle-down, Lady Bountiful approach to giving power to local authorities. It presents a challenge to local government, as well as empowerment. It is a challenge to communities and local government to address local problems, and it is a challenge to Government to promote the Bill&#146;s premise that communities and councils are the experts on their own problems and the solution to them. It was that premise which took me into local government, and it is a theme of what I have been trying to achieve in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000349">The solution to what has been called &#147;ghost town Britain&#148; lies not in this place or in Whitehall, but with those living in communities. The Bill is about trusting those people. Hon. Members who support the Bill tonight&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Today.&#148;] Indeed, today. It feels like tonight, after the speech from the hon. Member for Caerphilly. Hon. Members who support the Bill will be judged for that trust. Those who oppose it will have to face the rainbow alliance of organisations that supported it and the many people in their constituencies who have called for the principles of the Bill to be enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07011960000350">Many people look at tiers of government&#151;Westminster, regional, county, district and parish government&#151;in linear form. I prefer to see it as a pyramid, with a large number of councils getting closer to the people at the base of the pyramid. The Bill seeks to invert the pyramid, making central Government act in support of local government. That principle finds a ready home in the hearts of Members in all parts of the House. I commend it to all sections of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07011960000351">Among the written depositions in support of the Bill are a number from rural communities. There is a myth, which needs to be dispelled, that the Bill is directed at rural communities. My constituency is largely rural, but the Bill is as important, and in some respects even more important, for many urban communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood would not introduce a purely rural Bill.</p>

 As a Member&#151;possibly the only one on the Opposition Benches today&#151;who represents a large city, Bristol, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Bill is directly relevant to an urban community and a city centre, particularly in respect of planning classifications for housing. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) mentioned rural housing and second homes in Cornwall. We have the same problem in the city centre of Bristol, where whole streets are being bought up by buy-to-let companies to let to people who come into the city on a short-term  <br>

basis. If the planning laws were changed and local government could decide for itself whether that contributed to a balanced and sustainable community, our cities, as well as rural areas, would have a balanced population.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I echo those sentiments with reference to my own constituency. Half the population there lives in towns such as Newbury, Thatcham and Hungerford. In Thatcham and suburban parts of Newbury I see the same pressures on those communities, and the need of local people to feel that Government understand them and that Government are empowering them to solve those problems. I have seen government work from the bottom up. West Berkshire council has achieved beacon status for its promotion of parish plans, which are delivering, in microcosm, precisely what the Bill seeks to achieve. The people involved are not the usual suspects&#151;they are brought into the process from across the community. They identify the problems in that community and hold the next tier of local government&#151;as well as organisations such as the police and the primary care trust&#151;to account for the solutions. That is the principle of shifting the balance of power downwards that my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) mentioned a moment ago.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in many cases inner-city high streets are the new villages, because they are populated by people who do not want to go further away to a supermarket but want to have a baker&#146;s shop, a fishmonger and a butcher on their doorstep, in their high street? The problem is not, as it is in many villages, depopulation, but rents that are too high because of the sheer popularity of those streets. However, it comes down to the same thing&#151;it is difficult for people to get what they want, and what people in every village want, which is a high street that enables them to shop in independently owned local food shops serving local produce.</p>

 The point that derives from that is that it is easy for people on higher incomes to travel to purchase the goods that they would otherwise have bought from those shops, while people on lower incomes suffer. Too often in modern life it is tougher to be poor, sick, old or mentally ill in relatively prosperous areas, such as parts of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and parts of mine, than it is in more deprived areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07011960000356">In talking about ghost town Britain, we often, rightly, refer to the loss of shops and post offices, but it is also about services. That has recently been brought home to me in my constituency. The local magistrates bench used to sit in Lambourn and in Hungerford as well as in Newbury but, perhaps for entirely proper reasons, it no longer sits in Lambourn&#151;where the accused and everyone else used to help to set the chairs up, which was probably not the best way of running a court&#151;and has withdrawn to Newbury. Now, there is pressure from above&#151;from central Government&#151;to move that court service from Newbury to an all-purpose court in Reading. That is probably at a more beneficial cost to the taxpayer, but it is symptomatic of the problem addressed in the Bill. Not only does the  <br>

community in Newbury suffer the loss of a civic entity, and the proportionate loss of a sense of self-worth, more importantly, the people of that community are much more remote from access to that service. Where does that leave, for example, a victim of crime living in a remote village in my constituency who currently has to travel to Newbury to give evidence but in future, under the proposals that are being pushed forward, will have to travel a great distance to Reading?</p>

 I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about justice being dispensed at a local level, but can he tell me how the provision of magistrates courts would be affected by the Bill?</p>

 I certainly can, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to do so. Clause 4(3) states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07011960000359">I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. As the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) said, these matters should be discussed further in Committee.</p>

 There is another answer to the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones). Under the Bill, if a local community thought that it was a priority to keep a local magistrates court open, and if the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department thought that it would save money by doing so, it would be open to the local community to propose as part of its plan a subsidy scheme to keep the court local.</p>

<p><a name="st_o202"><a name="07011960000361"><a name="70119-0009.htm_spnew8"><a name="07011960001003"><b>Mr. Benyon:</b>
 As always, my right hon. Friend puts it so much more eloquently than I could, and I entirely agree with his point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07011960000362">Throughout the country, other services are being lost&#151;for example, ambulance stations being removed in some communities. We have always been told that all these reorganisations are for our greater good, but when something like that happens, as it did in Hungerford 10 years ago, the result is often a less than perfect service. In order to comply with Government targets on response times, it is much better for ambulances to be hanging around big urban areas such as Reading&#151;and the people of Hungerford and other smaller towns across the country lose out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07011960000363">Whether we call them &#147;reforms&#148;, &#147;reorganisations&#148;, &#147;reconfigurations&#148; or whatever, they are always driven from the top down and they always militate against local people in smaller communities. They are too often done for the convenience of the organisation than for the people it serves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07011960000364">I would like to comment on an earlier intervention by the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) in which he spoke about traffic and congestion. I shall provide one example of how the Bill will help to resolve some of those problems. In Newbury some years ago, there was a movement plan. Consultants were brought in and a plan to improve the movement of traffic around the town was developed. A presentation was made, at which all the great and good were present, and  <br>

everyone agreed that it was a good plan. At the end of the meeting, however, an official stood up and explained that the plan had to go to the Government office for the south-east and to the South East England regional assembly to have their imprimaturs put on it. I asked myself&#151;a lowly citizen in those days before I was elected here&#151;why on earth we live in a world in which a regional government, either the Government office or the regional assembly, has to tell us how the Bone Lane roundabout in the middle of Newbury is configured. That is ludicrous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70119-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07011960000365">The Bill provides an opportunity because, under it, local communities can be empowered to do things for themselves, which is why I commend it to the House. I could raise many other issues, but I want to give other hon. Members time to speak. We must pay attention to the enormous breadth of organisations that support the Bill. We must remember that hon. Members on both sides of the House support it. Ultimately, what it is all about is trusting local people to make the right decisions for their communities.</p>

One could consult the neighbourhoods in the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency and ask whether they would like a new library or a swimming pool, but resources would not allow them to be built everywhere. The council would find itself having to agree with one group and disagree with another. The point that my hon.

West Dorset also referred; indeed, the Secretary of State is mentioned nearly 40 times in the seven pages of the main part of the Bill.

It is not always possible to reconcile the two. The right hon. Member for West Dorset went straight to the heart of the matter when he said that power is increasingly translated through money, not through the law. That leads to the second paradox in the devolution debate: how to determine the allocation of resources. I imagine that those in charge of local action plans would come up with arguments for money, or arguments for a reprioritisation of local expenditure, in a way that might not be compatible with the arguments against a postcode lottery.

 I understand the Minister&#146;s desire to make progress, but I think it important for us to be clear about the nature of the Bill. It does not permit those in charge of local action plans to seek more money, but it does permit them to reorder priorities: that is, indeed, its intent. In any case in which a Minister believes that the postcode lottery is the side of the argument that wins over localism, it is open to him to define the matter as of primarily national significance. I do not think, therefore, that the Minister can use the argument that there is a problem with local authorities&#146; prioritising over matters that Ministers will have already accepted to be of primarily local significance.</p>

 I would add to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s premise the right of Parliament, as well as national Government, to have a say in the debate. The proposal to identify public money that is spent locally, some on national imperatives and some on local priorities, is one of the Bill&#146;s strengths. I believe that our local area agreement policy moves substantially in that direction, notwithstanding the scepticism&#151;not cynicism&#151;shown by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.</p>

Our LAA policy will allow the identification of money in different areas&#151;an approach pioneered by Kent county council, my own council and others. It will also allow the mandatory outcomes, as the jargon has it&#151;that on which national Government and, through national Government, Parliament can insist&#151;not just to be radically reduced in each area, but to be tailored specifically for that area. We expect each area to have about 35 goals, or objectives, in the achievement of which the council and its partners will have a statutory duty to co-operate. Those 35 targets, however, will not be the same in all areas in order to reflect the differences between areas&#151;between, say, the constituency of my hon.

We have spent nearly two years&#151;which some would say is too long&#151;in developing that policy. The role that the Bill gives to the Secretary of State, although probably well-intended, fails to deal with the difficulty that would inevitably result from local action plans that would either require more money to meet local priorities or, through local decisions, seek to gain control of moneys identified for national priorities. I am thinking of moneys such as benefits budgets or health budgets. There is an advantage to identifying what those moneys are, but the important question of how one decides on prioritisation then arises. I fear that, because of the way that the Bill is constructed, it would inevitably lead to the Secretary of State vetoing decisions, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly said. I would not have a problem with the current Government having that veto, but I suggest that future Secretaries of State might not support the localist agenda. Members should take that important point into account&#151;and Liberal Democrat Members in particular should do so.</p>

 I wish to ask some questions about the powers of the Secretary of State. Under the Bill, there would be a rubber-stamping of plans; the Secretary of State would not be able to refuse plans that were highly controversial. I also understand that the Secretary of State has to approve of the creation or abolition of parish and town councils. As I have said, I am a strong supporter of parish councils, and in my constituency a review of parish arrangements is under way.

than happy to do so. In fact, I plan to attend the annual general meeting of the Lincolnshire parish councils, at which all the parishes in the county&#151;I think that there are several hundred of them&#151;will be represented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70119-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07011960000397">Let me make two points. The House might be amazed&#151;if not frightened&#151;to learn that under existing legislation the Secretary of State takes detailed decisions in respect of parishes. Just before Christmas, I was asked to approve a capitalisation request to purchase the front door of a civic hall in a parish in the part of the world of the right hon. Member for West Dorset. I honestly did not enter politics or the Government to make those sorts of decisions, and I do not think that anybody should. On a more serious note, the proposals to allow the powers of byelaws to be set locally, without the Secretary of State&#146;s decision, are a genuinely devolutionary measure.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Minister might recall that we had a debate in this Chamber which by pure chance&#151;because the business collapsed&#151;went on for much longer than intended. It was the talk of parish councils for months, not just weeks. In a previous ministerial role, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs talked about double devolution. In so doing, our party made it clear that there will be some rough edges in the debate on how to devolve responsibility and powers. That is nothing new, so the Minister must not think that we face a particular challenge.</p>

 I remember the debate that has been mentioned very well because I arrived for a 30-minute debate but it lasted for four and a half hours. My hon. Friend&#146;s prediction that as a result of it the postbag would fill up with correspondence from parishes across England proved to be true. I wish to put on record my appreciation of the National Association of Local Councils, which represents parish and town councils, for warmly welcoming the proposals that we will debate on Monday.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that the Bill would add to the draconian powers of the Secretary of State? Under clause 6(1), he has to approve the plans, and therefore he can disagree to them. Also, the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) helpfully pointed out clause 4(3), which states:</p>
<a name="70119-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="07011960000781"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Secretary of State may by order define the services or types of services which are of primarily national significance for the purposes of subsection 2(c) and shall give reasons&#148;.</p>

 Potentially, the Bill could do that. Its proponents understandably say that there needs to be greater prioritisation locally, which is true. The underlying debate is about identifying what is a national and what is a local requirement, and what is important is the mechanism that provides that definition. I strongly and passionately believe that the work that we have done through the local area agreement process is the best way forward; however, I do not have a closed mind on that issue.</p>

The third document is the local area agreement, which I have already described. The first two documents are already embodied in legislation, and the Bill before the House on Monday will&#151;if the House agrees to its Second Reading&#151;strengthen the third. Placing a statutory duty on public sector agencies to co-operate with those plans will take the ability of local elected representatives to influence their areas and the various priorities much further down the line.</p>

 The point that my hon. Friend makes about the cohesion of communities is a strong and powerful example of the paradoxes that can emerge from localism. I hope that he realises that, given my experience of the Cantle report and the Ritchie report on local communities, I understand very well the point that he makes. The Bill that we will debate on Monday deals with safeguards against such difficulties and the boundaries of localism. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, I cannot speak for the authors of the Bill before us, but this is a matter for legitimate debate.</p>

The point has already been made about the definition of sustainability, but the definition of valid measures requires further clarification. I have already mentioned the difficulty about how control of the financing would work or how the measures would fit with the local council tax system. For example, if priorities are not being addressed, would there be an ability to raise local precepts? The right hon. Member for West Dorset said that he was in favour of a power to enable the creation of parishes, but other Opposition Front Benchers spend much of their time putting out press stories claiming that council taxes are going up because we are creating parishes. There is a valid point in that, because parishes do raise precepts, but if the right hon. Gentleman thinks that there should be a power to create parishes, I wonder what his policy is towards such raising of precepts through local taxation.</p>

 We are in a Second Reading debate and the Minister, who has obviously done serious work on the Bill, will recognise that it does not say anything about that. It does not provide for a single penny of difference in local taxation and it is explicit in stating that all that the local council&#146;s plan can do is to reorder priorities for spending money that has already been allocated by the Government to that locality.

 The right hon. Gentleman is correct. The Bill does not mention that issue, but this is a good opportunity for me to counter the story in this morning&#146;s papers, which was prompted by his colleagues, whose calculations of potential council tax figures are based, in part, on the suggestion that we will create more parishes. The right hon. Gentleman has a point about this being a Second Reading debate, but I would ask the Opposition parties whether, first, they will give a commitment that if the Bill were to become law and local priorities were not met, because the Government, supported by Parliament, felt that it would be wrong to localise certain aspects, there would not be a call for further taxation to meet those priorities.

How will the arrangements fit with local accountability for other public services? The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) mentioned the police. The police authority in his constituency is accountable to the county councils&#151;the combined police authority. Indeed, the chair of the police authority is Councillor Peter Jones, a county councillor. The police&#146;s local priorities are already governed by local authority representatives. The debate behind that, which we are having today, is the feeling that many people have that they have no influence on that, but that is why I believe that the problem is best addressed by considering the empowerment of local elected representatives as well as forums such as community calls for action. However, the measures in the Bill may be unnecessary in the light of the changes that have already been made in the local structures and other proposed changes.</p>

The Government&#146;s intention is that the performance framework&#151;the auditing of the performance of local areas, which will move from the comprehensive performance assessment to an assessment of the outcomes under the sustainable communities plan in the local area agreement&#151;will involve a radical shift towards local accountability and will be backed up by new measures on overview and scrutiny.</p>

frustration is real, although I disagree with her prescription for addressing it. That is why the changes in mechanisms for the powers of local councillors are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07011960000432">One of the points about community cohesion that concerns people across the House is how we ensure that elected councillors are the conduit of lots of decisions. How can they be neighbourhood champions, as well as representatives? One of the dangers of the debate  is that if one empowers unrepresentative and unaccountable individuals or organisations, the sorts of points that were being raised become very real.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07011960000433">My hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) raised concerns about small shops. I believe that I have answered those questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07011960000434">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs talked about his concerns about fair shares of funding and unelected PCTs. On Monday, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill is before Parliament. That will improve the ways in which local health authorities can be held to account for their decisions. The duty to co-operate in the partnerships between primary care trusts and local councils, and in particular their social care departments, is high on the list of Members&#146; concerns on both sides of the House. That is evident from the postbags that we receive. The best value duty that I have talked about and the community call for action address many of the points that he made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000435">I hope that I am not breaking the spirit of non-partisanship when I say that we cannot ignore the fact that police authorities are local authorities. They are accountable to the local authorities and through them to the people. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>The House is chuntering at that point. I wish it would do that when it is holding the Home Secretary to account for every action of every police officer in the country. I am sure that if we brought forward measures to do that, Members would scream centralisation and a lack of accountability to existing structures. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>No, the Home Secretary did not try to do that. That was the previous one. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07011960000436">My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly mentioned Nye Bevan and his own book. He made a powerful speech, based on experience. The experience of devolution in Wales has hugely informed the Government&#146;s ability to bring forward the measures that we have. I hope that on Monday he will welcome part 12 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which is on the powers for Wales. I know that my counterpart in the Welsh Assembly Government has welcomed those powers. The devolution behind the measures in the Bill on Monday throws up a deficiency in the Bill before us today, but that could be debated. I do not want to make a point of principle out of it.</p>

I share his anxieties that there may be a centralising tendency as a result of the ability to give the veto to the Secretary of State. I know that that is not the intention of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, and I think that he and the right hon. Member for West Dorset addressed that. However, I ask the House to consider the fact that, in the real world, when plans come forward from local areas, the Secretary of State&#146;s power  <br>

of veto would most probably have to be used, because inevitably political priorities&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I admire the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s knowledge and intelligence, but he must recognise the reality of politics. If, in 1985, Liverpool city council had put forward a local plan to the Secretary of State for his approval, I think that the veto might just have been used.</p>

 There was a time at which some local authorities acted in a lunatic fashion. Although I do not believe that there are any today, there might be again, and the reserved power would allow that to be dealt with. However, the Minister is really saying that today&#146;s local authorities cannot be trusted to make decisions that Ministers are willing to accept, while the rest of us are saying that local authorities must be trusted to make decisions that Ministers might not find comfortable. Is not that the nub of the argument between us?</p>

<p><a name="st_o243"><a name="07011960000439"><a name="70119-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="07011960001044"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b>
 Yes, I think that it is. The right hon. Gentleman made the important point in his speech that money is at the heart of this. I am simply saying that if an area came forward with an action plan that disagreed with the definition of a national allocation and a local allocation, a conflict in policy, although not necessarily an ideological conflict, would inevitably occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07011960000440">The Government have been accused during the debate of allocating money away from the south-east in general to other parts of the country. My hon. Friends from those parts of the country often complain that that is not true. I examined the allocation of money for local government in preparation for the debate and found that the east and west midlands were the most significant beneficiaries of the increased resources that have been allocated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07011960000441">My response to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is that people would inevitably call for more national money to be localised, but that would be possible within resources only if some of the rights available to all people, irrespective of where they live, were taken away. I do not think that he wants that to happen, so my accusation against him is one of naivety. I do not believe that the proposition that the Secretary of State&#146;s veto could not be used, or that some local areas would not put forward action plans, would reflect the reality. However, I believe strongly that our policy of joining up by way of pooling financial decisions and local flexibilities is a better way of squaring the circle.</p>

 Are not those changes structural, rather than an attempt to engage people and to increase participation in local priorities, which is the matter that the Bill tries to address?</p>

 The analysis must be right before that issue can be addressed. The hon. Lady described the process in her constituency, and I have heard similar comments on many occasions. However, what is the answer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish about his swimming pool? I do not say that because Stockport council is run by the Liberal Democrats.

county, strong arguments are always made&#151;most forcefully when it comes to planning decisions&#151;and councillors have to reconcile differences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07011960000444">There has been a tendency in this country to make local authorities bigger. The urban district councils were abolished in 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, but that did not coincide with the strengthening of the third tier&#151;the local tier&#151;of representation: parish, town, neighbourhood and community councils. We must ensure that strengthening if we are to address the frustrations to which the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) referred in her speech and her interventions, but in doing so, all of us should be honest about the fact that localism and devolution do not of themselves increase resources. Nor do they take away the right of national Governments&#151;and this House, through its role in holding the Executive to account&#151;to determine what the national priorities should be. It is that debate that led to the creation of the national health service.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07011960000653">Conscious of the limited time remaining, and keen that the Minister should have adequate time to respond before half-past 2, I will keep my comments fairly brief. I shall be able to do so because the Bill is very short, simple and straightforward. Like the Sustainable Communities Bill, which I am delighted to say has just been given a Second Reading, it would give local councils greater freedom and flexibility&#151;in this case, focused specifically on their responsibilities as planning authorities. It would enable them, if they so choose, to set higher standards for energy efficiency in their development plans than those laid down in building regulations, and allow them to make provision for sustainable energy and microgeneration requirements in the same document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07011960000654">The Bill is about enabling local authorities better to contribute to tackling the problem of climate change, which is undoubtedly the most important challenge for this planet at this time in its history. After the publication of the Stern review, surely no one can doubt either the scale of the problem that we face in global warming, the urgency with which we need to respond to it, or the fact that we will have to utilise a panoply of means to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases in general, and carbon dioxide in particular, in the years that lie immediately ahead. On Tuesday morning, Nick Stern himself made those very points in evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07011960000655">The Bill says that the planning system is one of the weapons that should be available in the battle against climate change. It says, in particular, that it can be used to achieve energy efficiency improvements, which everyone acknowledges are the easiest, quickest and most cost-effective methods of reducing carbon emissions. That is the low-hanging fruit on the climate change tree, and we are not yet harvesting it anything like as well as we should be. The Bill offers one means of turning that round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07011960000656">Similarly, there is huge scope for using the planning system in certain circumstances to encourage the generation of energy from renewable or other low-carbon sources and the use of energy from local, decentralised energy systems combining heat and power. The Bill would enable councils to limit the carbon footprints in the areas that they serve using planning policies set out in their development plans. I must confess that until the Association for the Conservation of Energy raised this issue with me, I did not know that planning authorities did not already have that freedom. I thank ACE for enlightening me about the variations in interpretation of planning policy by Government officials throughout the country  <br>

and, more importantly, for the enormous help that it has provided in drafting the Bill and campaigning to achieve its objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07011960000657">At the moment, we have a rather absurd situation in which virtually everyone believes that the planning system can, and should, play a significant role in improvements to energy efficiency and low-carbon generation&#151;our Ministers with responsibility for housing and for energy have said so&#151;but that intention is being thwarted on the ground when certain far-seeing councils try to go beyond building regulations in the production of their development plans. Ministers say that building regulations are minimum standards, but in practice officials interpreting planning policies are treating them as maximum standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07011960000658">Let me give a couple of examples. Cambridge city council tried to include in its planning policy a requirement for larger developers to provide evidence of how they have minimised energy consumption, maximised energy efficiency and considered the feasibility of using combined heat and power systems. That is not an unreasonable requirement at this time, one might think, but a Government planning inspector forced the council to water it down and said that it was unreasonable to the extent that it imposed more onerous requirements than building regulations.</p>

 I take the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. In fact, my original draft of the Bill dealt not only  with development plans but individual planning applications. I think that the development plan process will prevent unreasonable measures. If the Bill gets into Committee, I will consider setting parameters on what local authorities could put in their development plans.</p>

 I will not detain the hon. Gentleman for long, as I believe that this is an excellent Bill, which I hope will go into Committee.

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07011960000663">I was explaining what happened in Cambridge. If we reflect on the fact that it is set to expand its housing by 40 per cent. in the next 15 years, it is easy to see that a golden opportunity to limit greenhouse gas emissions is being sacrificed.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for referring to Cambridge city council&#146;s plans. Another important aspect of the problem is that local authorities can and do go further&#151;as Cambridge city council has&#151;in respect of public sector housing, but the key problem is the ability to control what happens in the private sector, which is also the key to the expansion of Cambridge. It is a matter of equality between the two sectors.</p>

<p><a name="st_o257"><a name="07011960000668"><a name="70119-0011.htm_spnew15"><a name="07011960001254"><b>Mr. Hollobone:</b>
 I used to serve as a councillor on Kettering borough council. It takes the view that under the 2006 building regulations it cannot reduce the carbon footprint in its planning applications and development plans beyond what the regulations allow. The leader of Kettering borough council is very supportive indeed of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill, and I shall certainly support it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o258"><a name="07011960000669"><a name="70119-0011.htm_spnew16"><a name="07011960001255"><b>Mr. Caton:</b>
 I am very grateful for that. The problem is that planning inspectors from different Government Departments all around the country are ruling that building regulations are a maximum standard, even though, as I have said, Ministers say that they should be a minimum standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07011960000670">Let me provide one other example. Last summer, Bedford borough council produced its draft core strategy and rural issues plan, which included a policy to reduce CO2 emissions by 10 per cent. more than building regulations allowed in certain developments. The Government office for the east of England objected on the grounds that the current planning system did not permit the setting of energy efficiency standards. That needs changing and this Bill will deliver that change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07011960000671">I would like to pay tribute to the work that the Government have already done in moving forward to achieve their objective of zero carbon homes within 10 years. The code for sustainable homes provides a good and useful measuring stick and I look forward to something above the lower star ratings becoming mandatory in the not too distant future. In the meantime, if my Bill became an Act, the code could be used by local planning authorities to provide the higher benchmark standards that they might want to specify in their policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70119-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07011960000672">It is right to give due priority to housing. As the Minister for Housing and Planning said, our homes account for &#147;more than a quarter&#148; of our carbon emissions. That is about 40 million tonnes. We also need to be looking to higher standards of energy efficiency and more and better use of low-energy carbon generation in other forms of development. The Bill will enable local planning authorities to require those higher standards in non-residential building projects.</p>

However, in respect of the main subject covered by the Bill, that statement will, if not amended, exacerbate the existing problem. I know that it is a matter of concern for local authorities up and down the country, which I am sure will be evidenced in the consultation process. As currently worded, the policy statement makes it explicit  <br>

that&#151;except for exceptional circumstances and only in a limited way after certain criteria are met&#151;councils will not be able to set energy-efficiency standards higher than building regulations. If that is not changed, the adoption of the policy statement will mean that most councils will not even attempt to set higher standards for energy efficiency in their planning policies. It would not be worth jumping through all those hoops to achieve what, in the end, would make a very modest difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07011960000674">It would be much better, I suggest, to adopt the approach in the Bill, which reflects Government objectives in dealing with climate change and Government policy on freeing local councils to deliver sustainable communities in the broadest sense of the description.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07011960000675">The Bill has wide support throughout England and Wales and its objectives are backed by many individual councils, the Local Government Association and the Welsh Local Government Association. It is supported by all 35 organisations that form the Sustainable Energy Partnership, by the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I mentioned the help that the Association for the Conservation of Energy gave me and I must also thank the Socialist Environment and Resources Association. It is an affiliate of the Labour party and its new president is Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It has worked assiduously to spread the word about the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07011960000676">The Bill is not party political but a common-sense measure, which hon.

Members who had signed the early-day motion to support the Bill&#146;s objectives stood at 224. That shows the strength of feeling on the subject in the House. In turn, that reflects the strength of feeling in local authorities throughout England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000677">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government can demonstrate that enthusiasm for the Bill stretches to embrace even the Government. However, I know that some officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government have argued hard against it. I hope that my hon. Friend will recognise that the measure is in line with Government policy. If it is talked out, there is a danger that that will convey the message that the Government say the right things but fail to exploit the opportunity for genuine action. That would amount to an unnecessary own goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07011960000687">We have important concerns about the Bill, however, and we must take those seriously. I hope that the new measures that I shall announce today and the existing policy already implemented will convince my hon. Friend that his Bill is not necessary. Although he might be disappointed in the short term, I hope that he is delighted in the medium to long term, as his work and that of others has had significant influence. My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning wanted me to share those comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07011960000688">I want to consider the scale of the problem that we face. I do not know about other hon. Members, but yesterday, when my constituents were facing hurricane-strength winds and life was being endangered&#151;tragically, 10 people lost their lives&#151;I found it more than ironic, indeed sad, that the national media were debating a reality TV programme, however serious the issues that it raised. If there are still sceptics on climate change, I advise them to follow the advice of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and to look at the scientific evidence of rapid climate change, the role that human activity is playing in it, and the threat that it poses to our quality of our life. The evidence is now overwhelming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07011960000689">The recent Stern review brought into sharp relief the need for urgent international action to prevent environmental catastrophe. It showed that taking action now is cheaper than waiting to deal with the impact of climate change. Today, not only scientific opinion but the British public at large overwhelmingly recognise the reality of climate change. Stern was clear: even though the UK is responsible for but a small share of global emissions&#151;2 per cent., I think&#151;we cannot afford to delay domestic action while we wait for an international consensus. We must also show world leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07011960000690">The Government are committed to responding to that challenge both at home and abroad. Internationally, we will continue to push for the agreement of all countries to halt and then reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Domestically, our climate change Bill will enshrine in law our commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050. That is an ambitious but necessary target. Meeting it means looking hard at how we produce energy, how we use transport, how we harness technology, and how we use the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07011960000691">In the run-up to Christmas, on 13 December, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government published a groundbreaking package of measures to tackle carbon emissions from new development and other measures to help secure sustainable development in our communities. We have called the package &#147;Towards a zero carbon future&#148; because that is where we need to be. Our proposals will make a substantial contribution to getting there, and quickly. Many commentators are calling this a &#147;green package&#148;. They are right, but the package also forms a key element of our desire to deliver better, more sustainable communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07011960000692">So what is this package? First, it includes the code for sustainable homes: a new national standard for application across England for sustainable design and  <br>

construction of new homes. By integrating elements of this voluntary code into new homes and obtaining assessments against the code, developers will be able to obtain a star rating for any new home to demonstrate its environmental performance. That will provide valuable information to home buyers, and offer builders a tool with which to distinguish between themselves in sustainability terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07011960000693">Alongside the code, we have launched our consultation on the timetable for incorporation of the energy and carbon standards set out in the code in future building regulations. Our proposals, which are set out in &#147;Building a Greener Future: Towards Zero Carbon Development&#148;, constitute a framework of progressive changes to building regulations to achieve zero-carbon new homes by 2016. We believe that that will cut carbon emissions by about 7 million tonnes a year by 2050, which is equivalent to around 20 per cent. of housing emissions&#151;or, to put it another way, more than the total amount of emissions from the eight largest English cities outside London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07011960000694">Of course there will be benefits for those who live in such homes because the energy efficiency of those homes will be higher. They will be cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Money will be saved for families, and our planet will be helped through extensive use of renewable sources of electricity. There are already examples, such as Bow Zed, which demonstrate what a zero-carbon development can look like and how it can work for ordinary families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07011960000695">To realise our goals, we propose the introduction of new standards in three steps. The first step, in 2010, will mean that homes must be built to the very highest energy-efficiency standards. The second and third steps, in 2013 and 2016, will require increasing use of renewable and low-carbon energy supplies. We recognise that there will be additional costs, but the staged introduction of the changes will give business time to adjust and, importantly, innovate, to drive them down. The Stern report demonstrated what the real costs would be if those steps were not taken, an important point made also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower. To help to stimulate the market, the Chancellor has announced that he will exempt zero-carbon homes from stamp duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07011960000696">We propose that these targets should apply only to homes at this stage, not to all buildings. We will be looking next at the best approach to reducing carbon emissions from the non-residential sector. We are also consulting on how to secure more water efficiency in new buildings. However, I want now to focus on the final part of the package, which is of most significance to the debate. I refer to the draft planning policy statement on planning and climate change, on which we are already consulting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07011960000697">The PPS sets out how planning, in providing for the new homes, jobs and infrastructure needed by communities&#151;I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) has noted the inclusion of infrastructure, because he has often lobbied and argued on the subject&#151;should help to shape places that will have lower carbon emissions, and will be resilient to the climate change that I am afraid is now accepted as inevitable.

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07011960000699">We expect this provision to be &#147;significant&#148; , to reflect the full potential of local opportunities without undermining the new development needed in communities. In the interim period, before plans are adopted, we propose that planning authorities should require a standard of 10 per cent. That is the floor standard; we can expect much more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70119-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07011960000700">The approach that we have set out reflects the important role of local government in leading, shaping and supporting regional and local strategies that help the move to low-carbon living. Appropriate technologies and their potential will, of course, vary from place to place. We believe that judgments on how new development should integrate with local potential, and the vision for securing and delivering that potential, should be local rather than national, and should form part of wider consideration of the infrastructure and services needed to secure sustainable communities.</p>

In considering and justifying any local approach, we would expect the local authority to have regard to a number of considerations, including whether the proposed approach is consistent with securing the expected supply and pace of housing development shown in the housing trajectory required by our planning for housing policies.

 I welcome the opportunity this afternoon to raise the case of my constituent, Mrs. Sharon Johnson, who has been diabolically treated by the Child Support Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07011960000723">I say at the outset that I am very grateful to the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), for his presence today and for his courtesy in contacting me to discuss the rudiments of this case yesterday afternoon. He generously informed me that in one of his last initiatives as a Back Bencher before joining the payroll vote, he himself staged an Adjournment debate on a child support case on behalf of one of his constituents. He made that point to emphasise that he felt some empathy and fellow feeling with me. I know that he takes the matter seriously and I do not seek to score a party point for the sake of it. I look forward to his considered and helpful response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07011960000724">Mrs. Sharon Johnson of Aston Clinton, in my constituency, has three children: Jade, who is 14, Sophie, who is 10, and Alex, who is six. The thrust of the matter is this in summary form. She applied to the Child Support Agency in December 2005. She of course received no written acknowledgement, which seems to be par for the course all too often. She was obliged to make phone call after phone call to seek to ascertain progress on the matter. There was none. It was very much a case of one-way traffic&#151;a situation with which all too many individuals across the country dealing with the agency will themselves be only too familiar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07011960000725">Mrs. Johnson approached me, as her constituency Member of Parliament, in March 2006. Since that time I have written two letters to the chief executive of the CSA, one letter to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and on top of that my office has had telephone communication with the CSA or the parliamentary business unit subsection thereof&#151;either I or a member of my staff made the calls&#151;on no fewer than 41 occasions. An article about the matter and the extent of the privations experienced by Mrs. Johnson appeared in <i> Private Eye</i> in November last year. The case was referred to the independent case examiner this month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07011960000726">I was relatively generous. I was willing to give the agency time to sort the matter out, if possible. Finally, my patience snapped. I thought that I had been very reasonable, and I decided to apply for an Adjournment debate in this House. I simply make the point to the Minister, and for the benefit of those listening to the exchanges today, that the fact that I had secured this debate today appeared on the Order Paper of the House on Tuesday of this week&#151;13 months after Mrs. Johnson had originally approached the agency, in December 2005. On Tuesday evening of this week, the CSA completed its maintenance calculation. Now it may be that I am excessively cynical, but I have a suspicion that there is some linkage between the public acknowledgement of my interest and the decision to  <br>

reach a basic maintenance calculation&#151;that they are not entirely unrelated events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07011960000727">There has been a sorry saga of delay and incompetence, of which Mrs. Sharon Johnson, my constituent, is the innocent and hapless victim. The detail of the matter is positively Kafkaesque, and you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the Minister of State will be relieved to learn that I do not intend to go into the seemingly interminable ping-pong match of the matter. Instead, I intend to offer a brief synopsis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07011960000728">I have three essential criticisms of the agency in this case&#151;poor customer service, serious computer problems that remain unresolved, and the breathtakingly inept handling, or non-handling, of the matter by the agency&#146;s office in Bolton. On the question of poor customer service, Mrs. Johnson was not written to by the agency: she had to chase it on the phone. The CSA incorrectly registered her ex-husband at her address, where they had lived together, and proved incapable of rectifying that simple error, despite repeated reminders. Later, it changed the records to register her ex-husband at her new address, where he had never lived, and it wrote to him at that address about an unrelated child support claim for his child from a previous relationship. I submit that fiction could not be more fantastic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07011960000729">In its infinite cheek, the CSA then advised Mrs. Johnson to wait between three and six months to see whether the error was corrected before taking any further action. When she complained, she was told that she was &#147;one of thousands&#148;. That is the gravamen of my critique of the inadequacy of the customer service that she received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07011960000730">The second issue is the computer problems. On 28 March 2006 my office was told that a case worker for this matter had not been assigned, but one would be assigned as soon as possible, the case would be prioritised and the team would have four weeks in which to assess it. Three months after that deadline of four weeks had passed, nothing had happened. On 15 June 2006, in exasperation and discontent, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. There followed regular chasing by me of the parliamentary business unit at Birkenhead. Computer failures there have been on a mammoth scale, with internal deadlines missed and documents to Mrs. Johnson sent in July last year with the most basic errors. One of the biggest computer problems was that Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case kept disappearing from the queue of tasks for CSA staff. Finally, it was decided that an expert would attempt a fix to recover the lost material and facilitate progress on the case. In fact, I am sorry to report that a relevant staff member went on holiday, and the fix was not attempted for a further two weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07011960000731">In recognition of the significant delays and incompetence from which Mrs. Johnson had suffered, she was awarded a consolatory payment&#151;I gather that that is the lexicon used to describe it&#151;of &#163;50. Finally, in August 2006, the case &#147;went clerical&#148;&#151;the term used for a decision to transfer a case from consideration by computer to consideration by an individual on paper. We were advised off the record that the CSA had subcontracted all new clerical cases to a private contractor based in Bolton. Delays meant that Mrs. Johnson missed the cut-off point for her case to be handled clerically at Birkenhead. Instead, we were  <br>

advised that it would be handled by the new firm in Bolton, whose work would start&#151;inconveniently and unfortunately for Mrs. Johnson&#151;only at the end of September 2006. Hundreds of cases were to be sent to that company from offices across the country, but we were assured in the most mellifluous tones that Sharon&#146;s case would be on a priority list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07011960000732">I put it to the Minister in all courtesy that one can scarcely believe the level of incompetence, carelessness and indifference demonstrated by the CSA in Bolton. No doubt he, as a rising star of the Government and a sympathetic Minister, will be aware of the problems at Bolton. After all, the hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions about those problems in exchanges on the statement on child maintenance made to the House on 13 December 2006. In response to probing from the hon. Lady, the Secretary of State said:</p>
<a name="70119-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="07011960000782"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Obviously, we all expect a proper level of service from the CSA, so if that is not happening, I will cause inquiries to be made.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 13 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 883.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07011960000733">A sensible statement from a sensible Secretary of State: what, one might ask, is the outcome of the inquiries?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07011960000734">I hasten to add that the staff of the parliamentary business unit at Birkenhead have been co-operative and helpful but they had their hands tied behind their backs. Bolton got off to a bad start; staff worked slowly and things did not get better. I was told that staff at the business unit at Birkenhead were not allowed to phone the Bolton office&#151;they had to e-mail. The Bolton office was supposed to respond within 48 hours; instead it took an average of six days to respond to information requests, if it responded at all. Even then, information was often incomplete or simply wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07011960000735">My office was advised by staff at the unit that Mrs. Johnson&#146;s experience at the hands of Bolton was by no means isolated or exceptional. The CSA management structure was unable to bring pressure to bear on outside contractors. The parliamentary business unit eventually told us that the issue &#147;hit the fan&#148; in November 2006 and new systems were installed, but nothing discernible happened or changed. Escalated requests for information did not receive responses. We were advised to write to the chief executive again, as management needed to be made aware of the situation. This I duly did on behalf of Mrs. Johnson on 21 November 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07011960000736">I put it to the Minister that our experience of the last month typifies the utter and shameful contempt with which the CSA has treated Mrs. Johnson and her family. In December 2006, we were verbally advised that the Bolton office had agreed to process the case within two weeks. We asked for written confirmation of that and it later emerged that the Bolton office had agreed only to respond to us within two weeks, not to process the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07011960000737">There were numerous exchanges in the first couple of weeks of 2007. Last week, the Bolton office told the Birkenhead office that nothing at all had been done with Sharon&#146;s case; in fact, her file was still in storage&#151;obviously, not only the Home Office suffers from that scourge&#151;but progress was being made, as the paperwork had been requested from storage. We are duly grateful, I am sure. Naturally, we were disgusted but not entirely surprised by that news. The  <br>

CSA&#146;s own staff agreed that something should be done about the Bolton office. I was advised that staff turnover there was high, information was excessively difficult to extract and the staff at Bolton had no concept of the fact that they were dealing with people&#146;s lives. Surprisingly, that is, I think, a conclusion that I could have reached independently, although I was grateful to have it confirmed by the impressions of the staff in the Birkenhead office&#151;I mean that sincerely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07011960000738">This week, we were told that progress had been made and that the information we received last week was given in error. We have been assured verbally that the relevant calculation&#151;Mrs. Johnson&#146;s entitlement&#151;was completed on Tuesday evening this week. She has been awarded &#163;93 a week, effective from 12 July 2006&#151;presumably, it took the agency until July 2006 to contact Mrs. Johnson&#146;s ex-husband. We have passed on those details to Sharon Johnson, as the CSA has not yet been in touch with her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07011960000740">It has failed to fulfil any of those tasks. The Home Office, on the admission of no less celebrated and illustrious a figure than the Home Secretary, has been declared &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;, but on the strength of this case, it would seem that the Child Support Agency is not even fit to open an envelope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07011960000741">I have, in conclusion, a few explicit and simple demands. After the catalogue of errors of which my constituent is the victim, it is hard not to be cynical and I would like some cast-iron guarantees from the Minister, whom, as I say, I personally greatly respect and whose interest in the matter I appreciate. When will the CSA write to Sharon Johnson to confirm the calculation? When does the CSA expect Sharon Johnson to begin receiving payments? As it took 13 months for the CSA to process her application, I hope that it will not take a similarly long period for it to establish a schedule for payment. Will Sharon be awarded compensation for the appalling failures by the CSA, which have resulted in severe financial hardship and stress for both her and her children? Finally, will the Minister please get a grip on the contractors, Vertex? We are told that the exact financial benefit of the contract to Vertex is not clear, but we are advised by the Department for Work and Pensions that the generic cost to the Department&#151;an interesting concept&#151;for the 19-month contract is &#163;23 million. The message to that contractor should be, &#147;Buck up, serve your customers, earn your keep, or clear your desks and get out.&#148;</p>

his team&#151;I know from my own constituency casework that it is not just the Member of Parliament but the constituency staff who often bear the burden of, in this case, the 41 calls&#151;on their dogged determination in pursuing Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case. They should not have had to do that, but, nevertheless, she has been well served by him and his team, while being let down by others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07011960000743">I agree with the hon. Gentleman and I regret to have to say that this case has not been handled in the manner that his constituent is entitled to expect. I apologise absolutely for the fact that the level of customer care that she received was not to the standard that I would expect for my constituents. He is right not to accept it for his. As he is aware, Mrs. Johnson first applied to the agency for child maintenance in June 2003, when she was receiving a prescribed benefit. Although he quite fairly did not comment on that first application, I want to mention in passing that it is certainly my sense that the first application was also very poorly handled, for which, again, I offer my sincere apologies. It was wrong that the agency did not contact the father of Mrs. Johnson&#146;s children in response to her first application in 2003, still less make an assessment of his liability. I am very sorry to have to say that the agency took very little action at all on the first application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07011960000744">More than a year later, in August 2004, after Mrs. Johnson has ceased to claim the prescribed benefit and was no longer required to use the agency&#146;s services, she wrote to the agency to instruct it to close her case. By way of background, it is important to note that, owing to the circumstances of the case, the amount payable to Mrs. Johnson at the time of her initial application would have been less than &#163;5 a week. However, the principle is the same. Her case was not properly handled and Mrs. Johnson and her family were not properly supported by the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07011960000745">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments focused on three specific areas: the poor level of customer service in Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case, the computer and IT failures, and the handling of the case in the Bolton office. In December 2005, as he has mentioned, Mrs. Johnson made her second application to the agency for an assessment of child maintenance against the father of her children. To begin with, that application was treated little better than the first. The agency almost immediately encountered a fault on its computer system that prevented staff from progressing Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case. At that point, the fault should have been investigated and, if no remedy could be found, Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case should have been processed clerically. At the very least, while the agency was deciding whether a system fix was possible, the children&#146;s father should have been contacted both to make him aware of Mrs. Johnson&#146;s application and to encourage him to make voluntary payments to her until his liability could be assessed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07011960000746">Sadly, and wrongly, no further meaningful action occurred on the case until the intervention of the hon. Gentleman. In July 2006, after his second letter about Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case, the agency again attempted to take the case forward on the computer system. A different error then arose for which no remedy existed, and the agency belatedly decided to make the case clerical. By that time, the agency had at last contacted the  <br>

non-resident parent, thus establishing the start of his liability for child maintenance. However, it is clearly unacceptable that it took seven months for the agency to contact the non-resident parent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07011960000747">A further delay occurred before the case was referred to the agency&#146;s clerical processing office in Bolton in September 2006. Staff there promptly attempted to obtain from the non-resident parent details of his employment and earnings, without which they could not assess his liability. It became necessary to obtain that information from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. Again, I very much regret that the breakdown in communication between staff in Bolton and the Birkenhead office that has already been mentioned led to the request to HMRC not being sent at the time&#151;October 2006. Only at the end of November was that oversight noticed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07011960000748">Meanwhile, the hon. Gentleman had written yet again to the agency about the poor service that Mrs. Johnson was receiving. In reply, the agency promised in a letter to the hon. Gentleman dated 14 December 2006 that it would make a maintenance calculation for Mrs. Johnson within two weeks. However, it failed to do so. I apologise for that failure, not only to Mrs. Johnson but to the hon. Gentleman, because he was given an assurance by the agency that was not fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07011960000749">In response to the systematic failures in the treatment and support of Mrs. Johnson and to the specific and fair points raised by the hon. Gentleman, I am pleased to confirm several matters to the House.  As has been mentioned, the agency has now  made the long-overdue maintenance calculation for Mrs. Johnson and has written to both her and the non-resident parent to advise of the amount payable and the fact that the liability is effective from 12 July 2006, the date on which the agency first contacted the non-resident parent. The hon. Gentleman asked when that communication would be sent to his constituent. I understand that it was sent on 16 January. I have a copy of the correspondence, so at the conclusion of our proceedings, I will confirm that it was sent on 16 January. If the hon. Gentleman does not have the correspondence in his possession, I will, with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, pass it on to him so that he can confirm that the letter has been processed and is on the way to Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07011960000750">The next step, of course, as the hon. Gentleman fairly said, is to obtain payment from the non-resident parent. The agency is determined to secure regular payments on Mrs. Johnson&#146;s behalf, and, if necessary, it will apply for the money to be deducted from the non-resident parent&#146;s earnings. We are committed to ensuring that Mrs. Johnson receives the maintenance that she is due and the customer care to which she was entitled when she first contacted the agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70119-0013.htm_para30"><a name="07011960000751">The CSA is ready to take any and all appropriate action to achieve payment from the non-resident parent. It will work closely with the Bolton office, and we have assigned a senior manager to monitor the case specifically to ensure that it progresses as quickly as it can in any way possible. The agency will also consider, as a matter of urgency, the extent to which Mrs. Johnson has suffered financial loss as a result of its poor handling of her case.</p>

 Again, the hon. Gentleman makes an entirely reasonable suggestion, as is typical. Of course it would be appropriate for Mrs. Johnson to provide that information, along with evidence and records to show any financial loss that she may have suffered as a consequence of the agency&#146;s series of unacceptable mistakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70119-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07011960000754">I once again apologise to Mrs. Johnson, and of course to the hon. Gentleman, for the poor service that was offered. I do not mean to detract from the issue of financial loss, but to add substance to my apology I should say that the agency has decided to award a further &#163;250 as a consolatory payment for all the delays and for the failure to respond positively to Mrs. Johnson&#146;s complaints. Of course, speed is of the essence in processing that &#163;250, as it is in the other matters that we have discussed, and I will personally follow the progress of that payment from the agency. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for the poor service that he received and for the burden that the agency placed on him and his office, but much more importantly I apologise on behalf of the agency and the Department for Work and Pensions for the poor service that Mrs. Johnson and her family&#151;her three children&#151;received from the Child Support Agency.</p>

 I do not want to trespass on the Minister&#146;s generosity excessively, but I am keen to know whether any action is planned in respect of the contractor. It is being paid a pile, and it has botched it; it ought to pay a price.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="07011960000756"><a name="70119-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="07011960001274"><b>Mr. Murphy:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman discussed the situation in Bolton in some detail, and as a consequence of today&#146;s debate, I will take a detailed look at the specific points that he raises, not just about Mrs. Johnson&#146;s case, but about the contractor. I will discuss that with my ministerial colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions. As I hope the hon. Gentleman is aware, an operational improvement plan is in place in Bolton, and a thorough review is taking place of all the communications at that office. Although that comes much too late for Mrs. Johnson, it should ensure that the circumstances that arose in her case are not repeated at that office. Of course it is not trespassing on my generosity to encourage us to consider such matters. If there are additional points that the hon. Gentleman wishes to raise as a consequence of today&#146;s debate, we will be only too happy to listen and respond to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70119-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07011960000757">It is through Mrs. Johnson&#146;s endeavours and the efforts of the hon. Gentleman and his team, and, belatedly, through the agency action, that I announced and confirmed today that Mrs. Johnson and her family will now receive the support to which they were entitled in the first instance.</p>
