 I had a certain amount of respect for the hon. Gentleman until he made that last comment.

 Absolutely.

 I am glad that he is not doing so, because it would result in a reduction in the services provided under the franchise. Because of the previous Government&#146;s failure to make any significant investment in our railway infrastructure it will take a long time to achieve the quality of service that passengers expect and deserve. Improvements, however, are on the way. The Government are investing &#163;110 million a week in the rail infrastructure, which will lead to significant benefits in performance. I must tell the hon.

What British troops are doing down in Helmand province is remarkable; tragically, we have again had to remember those who have fallen in the service of their country. They fell fighting the Taliban, however, and that fight is having huge success in the south of that country. Every time that they are able to inflict such losses on the Taliban, reconstruction and redevelopment can proceed. The new governor of the province is helping very much with that. Despite all the challenges and difficulties, there are real reasons for optimism about what we are doing in Afghanistan. The alternative was seen clearly a few months back, when the Taliban executed a teacher in front of a class for teaching girls in school. Those are the two alternative futures for the country, and I know which side we should be on.</p>

Those new or completely refurbished schools have made an enormous difference to what is happening in our country. In addition, more than 1,600 new science labs, better classrooms for more than 4,000 schools, hundreds of new sports halls and thousands of new computers and electronic whiteboards have been provided.

Moreover&#151;I am grateful for the opportunity to point this out&#151;if the additional sums for Iraq and Afghanistan are included, we have been holding defence spending constant as a proportion of our national income in what is, of course, a vastly growing economy.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the defence training review rationalisation programme. Before I do so, however, I am sure that the whole House will join me in extending their condolences to the friends, family and colleagues of Marine Thomas Curry, Lance Corporal Mathew Ford and Kingsman Alexander Green, who were killed in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq over the weekend and earlier this week. I pay tribute to their bravery, professionalism and courage. No words can express my admiration for our armed forces and the work that they do daily in the most difficult and challenging of circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07011772000162">In November 2004, the Ministry of Defence issued invitations to negotiate for two contractual packages under the defence training review rationalisation programme. The programme is a large and complex public-private partnership project that seeks to transform the way in which we deliver six types of specialist training on a defence-wide basis to support better the future needs of the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07011772000163">All bidders have put in strong bids, and I am grateful to Members in all parts of the House, who have expressed such strong support for relevant bids. I can now report that, following a detailed evaluation process, the bids from the Metrix consortium have been judged to offer the best technical and prospective value-for-money solutions to the defence training review requirement for both packages 1 and 2. As a result, we are appointing Metrix as preferred bidder for package 1 and provisional preferred bidder for package 2. Metrix has won each package independently and separately, and we now plan to take forward negotiations with the consortium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07011772000164">On 18 December, the MC3 consortium submitted an unsolicited last minute alternative proposal for package 1. That proposal was considered, but was quickly discounted as failing to meet the requirements of the invitation to negotiate. As an unsolicited proposal it was also outside the rules of the competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07011772000165">I must emphasise that identifying the best training solution for defence has been the primary consideration. The evaluation has involved some 200 subject matter experts. The training element was overseen by Professor Molyneux, an independent expert in modern training technology and e-learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07011772000166">For package 1 we are confident that we have a broadly affordable solution that will deliver modern and efficient aeronautical engineering, electro-mechanical engineering and communications and information systems training. Currently, that is delivered at nine locations, involving some 3,500 military and civilian staff providing instruction to 6,500 defence trainees at any one time. Over a five-year transition period starting in late 2008, Metrix proposes to rationalise the estate, initially on to two major sites, St. Athan and HMS Sultan. Marine engineering training will remain at HMS Sultan until 2017, when that too will relocate to St. Athan. The St. Athan site will be largely a new-build facility.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07011772000167">A small enclave will, however, be retained at Bordon for vehicle recovery training, and some communications training will continue to be delivered at HMS Collingwood. Overall, that will have a varying impact across nine sites: Arborfield, Bordon, Blandford, HMS Collingwood, Cosford, RAF Cranwell, RAF Digby, HMS Sultan and, of course, St. Athan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07011772000168">Package 2 is more complex. It aims to provide training for logistics and personnel administration, police and guarding, security, languages, intelligence and photography. Currently, that is delivered at 18 locations across the United Kingdom, involving some 2,900 military and civilian staff, and 4,500 trainees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07011772000169">The evaluation process identified Metrix as a clear winner for package 2, but we have more work to do to resolve the outstanding issues to address a significant affordability gap and to explore possible synergies with package 1, which should deliver improved value for money across the programme as a whole. Until we have resolved those issues with the bidder we cannot confirm the final approach that the MOD will take, including whether all, or part of, package 2 goes forward. However, it is only right that we inform the losing bidder that it has been unsuccessful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000170">Starting in late 2008, the current Metrix proposals would again see rationalisation to St. Athan over a five-year period. However, all training currently undertaken at Leconfield, Wethersfield and a number of smaller federated units would remain at those sites, as would the majority of training currently delivered at Chicksands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000171">Together, these proposals will embrace the very best training methods available today, in an environment designed for military learning. Full advantage will be taken of the latest technology for simulators and distributed learning solutions. The proposals will deliver top-grade single living accommodation for all ranks, with single en-suite rooms for many. New recreational and sports facilities will enhance the quality of life for our trainees, staff and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07011772000172">I take the implications of the change programme for our people very seriously. The impact is likely to be significant for civilian staff required to transfer to the new partner. They will, of course, be protected in full accordance with the TUPE regulations, which cover the transfer of undertakings. However, some redundancies following transfer cannot be ruled out, and should any occur, they will be taken forward sensitively and in full consultation with trade unions and staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000173">I do not underestimate how disappointed some hon. Members and their constituents will be where we are seeking to withdraw training establishments. That will be most keenly felt in the west midlands at Cosford, and in North Dorset at Blandford. While not wishing to pre-empt any specific decisions, I am pleased to say that there are no plans to close either site. The current training at each will continue until 2011, and the Department is exploring a number of proposals for the potential future defence use of both Cosford and Blandford. Those proposals will be announced, subject to the normal review and approvals processes, but a military presence is expected to remain at both sites in the future. At Cosford, Metrix proposes building a learning resource centre and developing a national  <br>

training research and development support centre. In addition, it will work with the Department to examine how the programme might support the establishment of the national manufacturing skills academy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07011772000174">It has been suggested that the Ministry of Defence has a conflict of interest by virtue of its minority shareholding in QinetiQ, which is part of the Metrix consortium. That was recognised at the outset. Frankly, it is not unusual for QinetiQ to be a member of a consortium bidding for MOD work, or to be a potential beneficiary as a subcontractor. Therefore, we have put in place stringent steps to separate the roles of customer and owner in relation to QinetiQ. Those steps were made plain in the prospectus to investors when QinetiQ was floated on the stock market last year, and a copy was placed at the time in the Library. I am content that the DTR evaluation process did not take improper account of the QinetiQ shareholding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07011772000175">My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence and I have written today to all those hon. Members whose constituencies are affected by this announcement, with details of the changes as set out in the winning bidders&#146; current proposals. As the way forward becomes clearer, I will update the House. I have also made available in the Library a number of key documents, including the invitations to negotiate and Professor Molyneux&#146;s letter validating the evaluation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07011772000176">I conclude by emphasising again that the bids from the Metrix consortium offered the best technical and value-for-money solutions to meet the future needs of defence specialist training. As I stated earlier, we now plan to take forward negotiations over the coming months with the Metrix consortium. This remains an extremely complex public-private partnership programme and a number of significant issues remain to be resolved, particularly over the proposals for package 2. I do not plan to make any further announcements until that work has been completed.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for his statement. May I, too, begin by paying tribute on behalf of the Opposition to the servicemen who lost their lives recently? Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of Thomas Curry, Mathew Ford and Alexander Green.</p>

I refer in particular to my hon. Friends the Members for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard), for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) and for Gosport (Peter Viggers), my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07011772000179">On the positive side, it would be good to have high-quality training, and a high-quality training establishment that might act as an aid to recruitment in the future, especially given that demographics will not be on our side. Moreover, at a time when we are celebrating the Union in this country, it is also a positive to see Wales playing a full part in the future of our armed forces. That will send the strong message to  <br>

those who want to break up the UK that far more unites us than divides us. The statement will also be regarded as a positive opportunity for the academic capabilities of the west and south-west of England, not least among which are the excellent technical skills offered by the academic institutions of Bristol and Bath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07011772000180">However, the statement is remarkable for its very opaque nature, and for what it does not tell us. Exactly why did the Metrix bid win? What were the key decisive factors that made it the preferred choice? Will the Secretary of State give us an idea of the number of redundancies that the MOD has assessed to be likely as a result of this decision? What type of alternative defence use might be envisaged for Cosford and Blandford, and when might those employed there get further details?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07011772000181">Perhaps most worrying are the financial elements of the deal. Exactly how much will the proposals cost? There was nothing in the statement to tell us that. Has the Chancellor agreed to underwrite the full cost of the projects? At a time of overstretch in the armed forces, a tight defence budget and an even tighter spending round in prospect, will the proposals be financed through a growth in the defence budget&#151;that is, with new money? At a time of inadequate service accommodation and mothballing ships, and when there are capability gaps, any further reduction in front-line budgets would be wholly unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07011772000182">Of particular concern are the terms used by the Secretary of State. He says, &#147;We are confident that we have a broadly affordable solution&#148;. It seems to me that a solution is either affordable or not. What does &#147;broadly affordable&#148; mean? When he says that we have to address a &#147;significant affordability gap&#148;, what sort of gap are we talking about? What sort of money does the Secretary of State think that that gap involves? As a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, those terms must mean something to him. The House, the country and all those affected by the changes have a right to see some numbers put on that vague terminology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07011772000183">We all want to see quality training, but I am afraid that the statement raises far more questions than it provides answers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o112"><a name="07011772000184"><a name="70117-0004.htm_spnew4"><a name="07011772000986"><b>Des Browne:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome for the obvious positive advantages that this modernisation of training for our armed forces can deliver. I agree that our ability to do that on the appropriate site, regardless of where in the United Kingdom it is, is a cause for celebration, and a celebration of the Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07011772000185">The hon. Gentleman asks for figures. He will excuse me, but considerable negotiations have still to take place with the consortium that has been judged against the evaluation process as providing both the best technical solution and the best value-for-money solution. I said that I had put significant details about that process in the Library, so the House will forgive me if I invite Members to read that information, as it is in the public domain, in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07011772000186">The through-life cost of the programme is about &#163;16 billion over 25 years, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will accept is a significant investment in the training of our armed forces. I am certain that  <br>

investment would not have been possible within the trend of defence expenditure that we inherited, and it is consistent with our ability to increase spending on the armed forces and our ambition to be able to invest more, and to increase our spending on them in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07011772000187">As for affordability, the purpose of making the statement at this time was to announce the outcome of the competition to identify a preferred bidder. In relation to both packages, significant detailed negotiation has still to take place with the preferred bidder, once identified. The competition has come to a close, so it is appropriate that there is a transparent and obvious announcement of who was judged&#151;against the transparent criteria of the competition&#151;the winner. Challenging and complex negotiations have to take place, about which there has to be a degree of commercial confidentiality. In relation to package 1, I am satisfied that we shall be able to conclude those negotiations, because the affordability of the package is broadly within the parameters that we set for ourselves. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70117-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07011772000188">There are significant affordability challenges for the second package. However, because the same consortium won each competition independently of the other, there are opportunities for synergy and savings that have to be explored. At the end of that process a decision will have to be made, but a decision may need to be made at some stage about an alternative way of providing training for the second part of the package. I make no bones about that; I am perfectly clear about it.</p>

In this case, the best indicative result at this stage of the process for the delivery of the training needs of the armed forces happens to be in the Metrix bid.

 The bidder that has been successful in this competition has proven capabilities, which were confirmed during the evaluation process. That process was technically demanding and adjudicated to the highest standards to deliver training. There is no question but that, despite the fact that we start at a high level of training for our armed forces, this investment and opportunity, when delivered, will improve training for them. The test of that is whether there is support from the chiefs of staff, and there is. The PPP is the chosen procurement method in this case because it brings private sector management expertise, which brings added value, and the ability to have significant capital investment in the estate in a short time, which would have been unaffordable otherwise. Not only that, but it gives the Department the flexibility to increase or decrease the student throughput, with the partner who is involved, over the period of the contract.

 The Minister has in the past been kind enough to acknowledge the superb work done by the leadership team in Deepcut in my constituency, which is the headquarters of the Royal Logistic Corps. He acknowledged in his statement that the future of logistics training was more complex than the move to St. Athan, but can he give my constituents in Deepcut the same assurance that he gives to those who serve in Cosford and Blandford that the site will continue to serve a defence function in future, sine die?</p>

 I am not in a position to give the hon.

I am grateful to him for recognising that the second package has a degree of complexity that the first does not; in the first package, there is much more synergy between the different elements of training.

 The Secretary of State knows that my only interest is in what is right for the armed forces; I do not have defence interests in my constituency, although I did serve myself. In today&#146;s statement, there is nothing to suggest why Metrix and Wales were chosen. It might be the right decision, but nothing in the statement made public today indicates why it was made. Will the Secretary of State elaborate, in a spirit of openness?</p>

 Coming to the House to announce a decision is, in some circumstances, quite restricting. There is a comparatively short period in which to make a statement, and I am trying to stick to that requirement. To supplement the information available to hon. Members, I have placed a significant amount of background information, including the independent verification of technical assessments, in the House of Commons Library. Members can look at that information at their leisure if they wish to satisfy their curiosity or if they wish to be certain that we have been open. A detailed, complex technical assessment of the bids was made against a number of criteria that were set out in the bid process&#151;I have made the information to tender available to the House of Commons, too&#151;and on value for money the Metrix bids were the significant winner, which is why they were chosen. We must get down to details and discuss the terms of the contract to see whether those complex services can be delivered.</p>

 The Secretary of State will be aware that the Defence College of Communications and Information Systems is located in Blandford in my constituency. The South West of England Regional Development Agency estimates that the economic footprint of the military presence at Blandford is nearly &#163;300 million a year, so the impact of any move will be significant. The Ministry of Defence has spent nearly &#163;100 million developing the Royal School of Signals at Blandford into a centre of excellence, so I think that the decision is wrong. However, I want assurances about the future of Blandford. Will the Secretary of State confirm that the headquarters of the Royal School of Signals will remain at Blandford, that the signal officer in chief will remain there, and that in future Blandford will be the natural base for all signal regiments when they are located in the United Kingdom?</p>

 I have already indicated in reply to previous questions some of the advantageous characteristics of the PPP, but the most significant advantage was that it allowed us the opportunity to make capital investment that, I candidly admit, we could not otherwise make. After decades of failure to invest in the infrastructure that delivered our training, the scale of investment required was such that it would take decades to secure it if we had used any other method. This way, however, we can secure it in the time scale that I gave in the statement.</p>

 I do not have any experience, either as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury or, indeed, as the Secretary of State for Defence, of the Treasury cuts that people keep talking about. I do have experience, however, of significantly increased real investment in our armed forces, certainly compared with the money spent on them by the Government whom the hon. Gentleman supported. I would be the first to say that we could do more if we invested more, and things that have been highlighted in recent months suggest that there are areas in which we need to invest more. I do not have with me the document to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but if its detail refers to a planned investment of that nature in his constituency, that is what is planned.</p>

 Independent audit and assessment have confirmed that the MOD is getting progressively better at investing public money so that it can deliver for our armed forces. There is no question about that, but no one, whatever party they represent and certainly no one from a party that has governed the country, can be happy with our ability to do so in the past. We must be honest, and accept that in the past we made some significant mistakes. We do not need to enumerate them, as we all know what they are. We are on a path of improvement, and we will continue along that path.</p>

It is a sad day for Shropshire, and a very sad day for my constituency. Will the Secretary of State confirm what he said in the statement about the details of the bid, and confirm that new build will be required to provide the training in St Athan, which, of course, was not the case with the Cosford proposal?

 At the risk of repeating myself, of course we will do all that we can to make sure that the best use is made of the Cosford site, to the advantage of the local community. I am not entirely sure what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question was, but he said that one bid did not require new build while another did so. In any assessment of necessary investment, there is an argument that it is a positive aspect of any bid to provide modern, state-of-the-art accommodation for our people, particularly members of the armed forces who are training.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I need your guidance because, as you are aware, in many constituencies, including my own, health issues are paramount. The loss of the proposed super-hospital for Hatfield has been very hard for us, particularly as before the election the Secretary of State for Health visited us. Since the election, I have requested meetings with Ministers to discuss the failed proposal and debts. You can imagine my surprise when I learned that the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), had been to St. Albans on 10 December, because I was unaware of that visit. I was unaware, too, that meetings were held to discuss the hospital bid. Will you give me guidance on the matter, Mr. Speaker, as the Minister has not as yet given me any indication that he will discuss the matter with elected Members, although parliamentary wannabes seem to receive that courtesy? </p>

 It is a courtesy for any hon. Member who visits another constituency on an official matter to extend notice of the visit to the Member who represents the constituency.

I do not have any powers to tell a Minister to meet a Back Bencher, but I served as a Back Bencher in opposition, and it was always good to go and see a Minister.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I, too, ask your advice as the Back Bencher&#146;s friend and as the guardian of the House against a sometimes over-mighty Executive? The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has announced today by way of a written statement the merger of English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation. This is a significant change to the machinery of government, involving millions of pounds and intimately affecting communities throughout the country. Today we are discussing the business of the House, rather than pressing legislation. Why has the right hon. Lady not come to the House to make that statement? This is a pattern on her part. Whenever matters of controversy&#151;for example, the abandonment of the home condition report element of the home information pack&#151;are before us, she makes a written statement and does not come to the House to answer questions.</p>

However, the House did not find time to give the Bill a Second Reading. Safeguarding vulnerable children is, however, the core business of Government. It is our responsibility and we cannot ignore it. We need the Bill.</p>

Of the 120 authorities that responded to my recent request for information, 71 did not know the statistic for their area, 23 could not say how many of their looked-after children&#151;children for whom they were directly responsible&#151;were reported missing to the police in 2005, and 42 did not know how many children on their child protection register had been reported missing to the police.</p>

She agreed to speak to social services, but hung up. She phoned again a few days later at 10 pm and asked for contact with social services, which was arranged by the helpline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70117-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07011772000259">Almost a month later the girl rang again late at night, saying that her mum had thrown her out again. Social services advised her to go home, but she said she would rather stay on the streets than go back. The helpline night worker was able to persuade her to talk to the police, who picked her up at 1 am, very cold and scared. This little girl is 11 years old and has special needs. Without the helpline, she would have been out on the streets on her own through several nights.</p>

Among the children whom it has helped in the past 12 months was a 14-year-old girl referred to the refuge by the police. She ran away because she was being hit by her mother. She disclosed physical abuse over a sustained period of time. She said that her mother had burned her with an iron, and showed the staff a serious scar on her stomach. She had special educational needs and attended a school for children with special needs. She had run away several times before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70117-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000261">The refuge made a child protection referral, arranged for an advocate and contacted a solicitor on the girl&#146;s behalf at her request. She said she would not go home because she was too scared. Her solicitor attended the administrative division of the High Court on her behalf. The court ordered that she should be accommodated by the local authority, pending assessment and investigation. She was placed in foster care that day. The refuge does not have funding to continue its work beyond this financial year.</p>

According to the Children&#146;s Society research, many young people sleep rough, stay with someone they have just met, or employ strategies such as begging or stealing to survive. There are serious risks to children surviving in this way. More than 8 per cent. had been hurt or harmed on the most recent occasion that they had run away. Children who were away for more than a week were twice as likely to have been hurt or harmed. The surveys indicate that over 20,000 children are missing for a week or more each year.</p>

One 15-year-old, born HIV-positive and in local authority care, was reported missing 120 times. A 16-year-old girl in care went missing 111 times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70117-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07011772000265">Yet Lancashire police, working with children&#146;s services and charities, have demonstrated that good information, appropriately shared, interviews with children and action to tackle their problems radically reduces the number of runaways, and in addition gives police the information that they need to prosecute abusers. The problem can be solved only by effective joint working. Because children who run away cross administrative boundaries, that co-operation must extend beyond the local area.</p>

We can pay our road tax online or contact friends whom we have not seen for years. Information is available to us at the press of a button. The Bill will require police and Government bodies to use technology to record when a child goes missing. Local authorities will know that a child in their care has run away before that happens 120 times, and will be able to identify and tackle problems in their care homes. The Bill will also require agencies to work together so that police officers do not return a vulnerable child to its abusers, predatory adults are not left free to pick up children off the street, and charities can access statutory support when a scared and vulnerable child makes contact in the middle of the night.</p>

It costs &#163;1,000 in police time to investigate a missing person. The young boy with impaired sight whom I mentioned earlier, who was abused at home and ran away from care 23 times, cost &#163;23,000 of police time in those three months. How much better that money could have been spent. How much does it cost to keep someone in a young offenders institute? Ninety-four per cent. of the inmates at Thorn Cross YOI in my constituency said that they had been runaways before becoming involved in crime. Early intervention can save children and save money.</p>

Some of them will have been running from serious abuse. About 8,000 of them will have been hurt or harmed while they were away from home&#151;some very seriously hurt.

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="70117-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07011772000784"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House takes note with approval of the report of the Joint Committee on Conventions of the UK Parliament (House of Commons Paper No. 1212 of Session 2005-06).</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07011772000276">Let me begin by commending to the House the report of the Joint Committee on Conventions, which forms the subject of the resolution before us. The report is an impressive piece of work that has provided us with clarity on the key conventions that must govern the relationship between this House and the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07011772000277">Before I talk about the report in more detail, I should like to pay tribute to all the members of the Committee from both Houses. Many of its members from this House are in their places today. The outcome of its inquiry and consideration far exceeded the expectations in this House when we debated the establishment of a Joint Committee on 10 May. That is a great tribute to all its members. The fact that the report is unanimous strengthens still more its conclusions about the current operation of the conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07011772000278">I pay particular tribute to my right hon. Friend Lord Cunningham, who is a very old friend to me and to many of us, and who showed his customary felicity, as well as patience, in drawing together different strands of opinion and ensuring that there was a coherent and unanimous report. When the other place debated the report yesterday&#151;I should tell the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) that it agreed an identical resolution to approve it&#151;my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor called it the &#147;bible&#148; on the existing conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07011772000279">I also pay particular tribute to one member of the Committee who is no longer with us&#151;Lord Carter, who is sorely missed in both Houses. He had a very distinguished career in the other place. I got to know him well when, as Home Secretary, I had the happy task of being the Secretary of State with by far and away the largest amount of legislation of any Government Minister&#151;some things never change&#151;and I had to persuade him of the wisdom of that legislation and the ease with which it would go through the House of Lords. He was ever co-operative, but also clear about his own opinions when my enthusiasm overtook my judgment. He is sorely missed in all parts of this House and at both ends of the building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07011772000280">Today, the House is invited to approve the Joint Committee&#146;s report. The Government have published a response to the report&#151;Command Paper 6997&#151;the remit of which, for reasons that I will explain, necessarily goes further than that of the Committee itself. However, the House is not being asked to approve that response, happy though I would be for that to be on the Order Paper as well. We are instead looking for cross-party agreement on the report of a cross-party Committee and on its description of the conventions as they stand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07011772000281">Yesterday in the other place, there was general endorsement of the Committee's conclusions, although the debate extended to include consideration of an issue raised in one paragraph of the report&#151;the application of the conventions to a future House. I will come to that later. Although it is not the subject of the resolution, it will no doubt form a substantial part of the debate. We are looking for Parliament-wide approval of the Committee&#146;s report on the current relationship between the two Houses. The Government accept the Committee&#146;s descriptions of that relationship and its definition of the key conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07011772000282">One of the fundamental requirements on the Joint Committee was to consider the conventions on the basis of the primacy of the House of Commons. Indeed, the primacy of the Commons is the fundamental principle guiding all current discussions on any future and further reform of the House of Lords, and it has not, to my knowledge, been questioned by any party during previous debates on reform.</p>

<p><a name="st_o176"><a name="07011772000283"><a name="70117-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="07011772001050"><b>Mr. Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):</b>
 But that is the very point of concern. This is being treated as a matter that is just between the parties and not for wider discussion. This House has never had a proper debate on what we want; certainly, there has been no such debate within my own party. It is not good enough to say that this can be wrapped up between the parties.</p>

<p><a name="st_o177"><a name="07011772000284"><a name="70117-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="07011772001051"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 With great respect, that is not the case. First, we are proceeding on an all-party basis. I am as partisan as the next person when necessary, but I happen to believe that on important issues of the constitution, if it is possible to proceed by consensus and cross-party agreement, so much the better, because those are the ground rules that constrain and help to determine the nature of the partisan debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07011772000285">Secondly, as I said, we had a debate about the establishment of the Joint Committee on 10 May, when I was only in my first week as Leader of the House, and I was told by those founts of wisdom, the Whips, that it would all go through on the nod. The debate then went for about four hours, not least with a good half an hour from the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who decided to open the debate when I was temporarily absent, for a couple of seconds, from my seat. He treated us to a lengthy disquisition, and very interesting it turned out to be. As often happens, the debate then took off and became a very good debate about the conventions on the relationship between this place and the other place. I am sure that the same will apply today. When we get to debate the specific proposals on the reform of the other place, much of it will be about whether moving towards, for example, an elected element, is compatible with primacy in the Commons. Much will be said by hon. Members of all parties about that.</p>

<a name="70117-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="07011772000785"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the weight of evidence on this point, should any firm proposals come forward to change the composition of the House of Lords, the conventions between the Houses would have to be examined again.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70117-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000287">Let us compare that with the Government&#146;s December response, which states:</p>
<a name="70117-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="07011772000786"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our answer to that question is that further reform should not alter the current role of the House of Lords as a revising chamber, and that the conventions governing its relationship with the Commons are fit for that purpose.&#148;</p>

 I shall deal with my right hon. Friend&#146;s point in more detail shortly. Of course paragraph 61 is correct that, were the composition of the other Chamber to be revised, and the Lords acquired an electoral mandate, the relationship between the two would be called into question and have to be re-examined in due course. However, it is important not to parody the Government&#146;s response. As my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor made clear, it is a response by the Government as whole. We concluded that the primacy of the Commons can and should be maintained, and that it could be maintained in a reformed House of the sort that I would support. It was not a cavalier judgment but was reached after careful consideration. It is fully consistent with the repeated judgments of substantial inquiries, including that of the royal commission on Lords reform.</p>

 My right hon. Friend said that the House&#146;s powers derive from its Members determining the Government. Is not that the wrong way around? We determine the Government because we are the elected Members. Our determination is based on the elective principle, not the Parliament Act or finance legislation or the fact that the Government have to command a majority in the House. It all comes down to the core issue of election. If we change that, all the other elements in the equation change, too.</p>

 I understand the argument, which is quite strong, against any change in the other place to provide for an elected element. The fact that this House is wholly elected is a necessary part of the arrangement but, by itself, it is not a sufficient part of the relationship. There are plenty of examples, which are given in appendices to the royal commission report and mentioned briefly in our response to the Joint Committee&#146;s report, of wholly elected second Chambers in other countries that are clearly subordinate and have less power&#151;in some cases, they are close to powerless&#151;than the House of Lords. It is perfectly possible to construct arrangements, depending, to put it bluntly, on what is acceptable and the constitution, whereby one Chamber is clearly supreme and has primacy, notwithstanding the fact that the other Chamber&#151;I do not support the model that I am outlining&#151;is also wholly elected.</p>

 My right hon. Friend has asked the House to &#147;note with approval&#148; the report. With a tiny caveat, I am happy to note the report with approval. However, paragraph 61&#151;not paragraph 63, as the summary states&#151;reads:</p>

Let me say, as someone who has served at a senior level in the British Government for the last  10 years, that I do not mind that.

 Does the Leader of the House agree that the sequence of events that we were engaged in was, first, trying to answer the question about the present disposition of powers between the two Chambers so that we could then debate the change in the composition of the House of Lords on the basis of an agreement, if we could reach it? The Committee did not say that there will definitely be a change, argued for or won; all it said was that the question of whether, if we change the composition, there should be a change in the relative powers is bound to come back.

It is the case that when and if we reach an agreement by vote in this House on the broad outlines of the composition of a future House, there will need to be much consideration during the subsequent processes&#151;not least the passage of any Bill&#151;to ensure some guarantee that the conventions that everyone is accepting will operate in the new circumstances.</p>

That is a further answer to the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind). The conventions are an integral part of maintaining a good, healthy, working relationship between both Houses. We agree that it would be wrong to involve the courts in a question of a breach of a convention, and the Government would not seek to do so. As we see in this House all the time,  <br>

however, conventions are none the less powerful constraining principles that must not be lightly ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07011772000340">I come to the issue of reasonable time. The House will be aware of anxiety in the Government that delays in the Lords in considering Bills were unjustly disrupting the legislative programme. The Government&#146;s manifesto of 2005 therefore proposed that the Lords should be given 60 sitting days to consider business. The Government welcome the Joint Committee&#146;s conclusion, in paragraph 153 of the report, that a convention exists that the Lords should consider Government business within a reasonable time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000341">Throughout, our primary concern has been to seek</p>
<a name="70117-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="07011772000797"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the outcome that is behind the manifesto commitment&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000342">as I explained to the Committee in June last year. That outcome is the proper consideration of Bills in the Lords, as the revising and scrutinising Chamber, and their timely return to the Commons. We are not wedded to the method specified in the manifesto and are glad instead that it has been used as a starting point for the Committee&#146;s consideration. We also support the Joint Committee&#146;s proposal that an indication could be made on the Order Paper of the other place when it has spent more than 80 days on the consideration of a Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07011772000343">The Government also accept the Committee recommendations on the Salisbury-Addison convention. This important convention is the third pillar upholding the primacy of this House. A Government must be allowed to carry through their programme of work&#151;their commitment to the electorate as outlined in their manifesto. That is vital to democracy and to Parliament&#146;s accountability to the people. The Salisbury-Addison convention was first formulated in 1945, when circumstances were very different. There was an overwhelming Labour majority in this House and a phenomenal, stupendous majority for the Conservative party in the other place. The Conservatives had more than 1,000 peers; the Labour party had just 16.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000346">There was plainly going to be grief if the House of Lords had been as assertive in 1945 as it had sought to be before the war. It was for that reason that Lords Salisbury and Addison agreed the convention. There have been changes since then, however, and we agree with the Committee that the convention has evolved over the past 62 years. It will no doubt continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07011772000347">The Committee suggests that the convention is now understood as meaning that in the House of Lords:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07011772000348">The Committee also noted that the evidence points to the emergence in recent years of a practice that the House of Lords will usually give a Second Reading to any Government Bill, whether or not it is based on the manifesto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07011772000349">The Committee did not attempt to define a manifesto Bill, and we believe that it was right not to do so. In the original circumstances of Salisbury-Addison, manifestos were commendably short. The Labour manifesto that led to the great reforming programme between 1945 and 1951 was eight pages long. Our manifesto for 2005, although replete with wisdom in every line, was 114 pages long, and even more radical than its 1945 predecessor&#151;</p>

 No, the hon. Gentleman is thinking about the 1997 and 2001 manifestos. The hair-shirt brigade, of which I am a member, won the argument when it came to the 2005 manifesto. I do not think that there is a single picture in it, except possibly one of our leader&#151;but in black and white.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para15"><a name="07011772000352">I believe, as a student of manifestos old and new, that whether they are eight or 114 pages long, they cannot be the last word, the truth and the light, on any Government policy. They have to be the subject of further consideration. For that reason, the Committee was wise not to define a manifesto Bill, or to say that there had to be some ineluctable connection between what was in the manifesto and what finally pops out in legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para16"><a name="07011772000353">We welcome the clarity that the Committee&#146;s description brings to this essential convention and agree that it is time to consider a new name, to recognise its evolution. In paragraph 115 of the Committee&#146;s report, the Committee suggests that the convention be called the &#147;Government Bill Convention&#148;. However, as we state in paragraph 27 of our response, we are aware of some concern that that name could imply that the same, more restrictive, conventions apply to the Lords&#146; handling of non-manifesto Government Bills as apply to manifesto legislation. We have therefore suggested that it might be more elegant to call the new definition of the convention the Cunningham convention, to acknowledge the work of the Committee and its impressive report. That question will not come before the House until another day, but I happen to think that it is a good idea. By convention, I shall call it the Cunningham convention.</p>

The financial privilege of this House, and the tight limits on the powers of the second Chamber in this area, are key to the way in which our Parliament and our constitution operate.

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70117-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07011772000358">In relation to secondary legislation, the Joint Committee concluded that the Lords should threaten to reject statutory instruments only in exceptional circumstances, and the Government accept this conclusion. The Government also welcome the Committee&#146;s conclusion that the Opposition parties should not reject a statutory instrument simply because they disagree with it. It is important to remember that the power to create statutory instruments, and the principles behind the primary legislation, will already have been debated and considered by both Houses of Parliament. Of course, Parliament can change the primary legislation, should it wish to do so.</p>

In relation to two of the circumstances in the Committee&#146;s list of examples, my right hon.

of statutory instruments laid has increased decade by decade. I do not agree with him, however, on the reason. As a Home Secretary who generated a large number of statutory instruments, I know that the principal reason, in relation to the legislation that both I and my predecessors put forward, was that the House had said that the decision-making power to be invested in the Secretary of State should be the subject of parliamentary accountability, whereas previously no accountability at all would have been provided in respect of that. I am aware of the common charge that the number of SIs indicates Ministers trying to avoid scrutiny, but I do not think that that was ever the intention&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Perhaps an inquiry into that is needed. A large number of decisions that would previously have been made by fiat inside Government are now the subject of SIs. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I happen to believe in the maximum scrutiny of ministerial decisions. However, if every SI had to depend on an affirmative resolution, the whole of government would gum up.</p>

 Whether or not the avoidance of scrutiny is the Government&#146;s intention, it is unarguable, on the empirical evidence, that in practice that is often the consequence. May I put it to the Leader of the House, who is both fair-minded and a serious parliamentarian, that if the Government expect their credentials to be respected and timeous consideration by the other place of secondary legislation, they would help their own cause if, more often than not, they could at least publish such secondary legislation in draft form before the Third Reading of a Bill in this place?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and we do our best in that respect. Certainly, the way in which we deal with secondary legislation can be improved. The challenge is to do that in a way that is practical and does not seize up the works. We have considered carefully recommendations in the other place&#151;an important and expanded function of the other place that has not challenged the primacy of this place but helped to underpin it&#151;from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.

It gives a number of examples of circumstances&#151;I shall just give two&#151;in which it would be right for the other place to consider rejecting an amendment. That would apply when the parent Act was merely a &#147;skeleton Bill&#148; and the content of the statutory instrument was of a kind normally found in primary legislation. Alternatively, it would apply in those common circumstances in which a Minister says to the House, &#147;Don&#146;t worry about passing the Bill, because this can only be brought in by statutory instrument&#148;, which clearly implies the possibility of that statutory instrument being voted down at some point.</p>

As has become clear, although the debate and the motion are about the conventions that govern the present relationship between the two Houses, the outcome that we were seeking from the Joint Committee was, as the hon.

As our manifesto commits us to do, we intend to hold a free vote in both Houses on the future composition of the House of Lords, following the publication of a White Paper. The Committee&#146;s report will play an important part in informing that debate. I have already dealt with the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) and other members of the Committee on paragraph 61. As I have said, we have sought to answer that question for the moment. As we spell out in our response, our answer is supported explicitly by the royal commission chaired by the noble Lord Wakeham, by the Public Administration Committee, by the Breaking the Deadlock group, and by my noble Friend Lord Cunningham, in what became the first Cunningham report. On page 7 of our response, I quote from that report, which stated:</p>

Those discussions are informing the White Paper, although the White Paper will be my responsibility and that of the Government. The discussions have confirmed, however, a genuine appetite for reform. I am not suggesting that there will be agreement between the different parties on the cross-party group on every issue; there is not. We have, however, been able to identify some important areas of common agreement, which will inform the House and other place in looking forward to reform.</p>

That does not mean that I accept every word of the report, but I approve of its overall findings. At an early stage of his speech, the Leader of the House said that the Committee&#146;s work had exceeded expectations. If I may say so, that was a generous turn of phrase, given that when the Committee was established many of us expected that far from confirming the role of the upper House and its conventions, the Government intended the Committee to seek ways to undermine that role and restrict the powers of the other place, or at least to prevent an increased or enhanced role for the House of Lords. I remain of the view that that was the Government&#146;s intention in setting up the Joint Committee.</p>

I welcome their acknowledgment of the role of the House of Lords, its effectiveness and the good workings of the conventions that exist in that House, and between us. As the Committee found, the conventions work, and their flexibility is a benefit. The House of Lords does not hold up Government business and, crucially, its process of scrutiny aids the process of developing effective legislation rather than prejudicing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70117-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000378">Let me now turn to the specifics of the report. I will deal first with the primacy of the Commons, which has already been the subject of some exchanges across the Chamber. The Committee was instructed to accept it and, having taken evidence, did not question it. I welcome that, as in my view it is the crucial underpinning of any consideration of the roles of the two Chambers. It must also be accepted, however, that any change in the composition of the House of Lords that introduces an elected element will change the relationship between the two Chambers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70117-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000379">In this regard, I agree with both my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash). It is possible to envisage a changed arrangement in which primacy remained with the House of Commons, but the nature of that primacy was different from its nature today. Although it is derived from elections and the fact that we in this House are 100 per cent. elected, our primacy is exercised by functions, and it is perfectly possible to envisage decisions in the future that would change those functions.</p>

 I am not describing a spectrum on which the degree of primacy of the House of Commons would depend on the percentage of elections to the House of Lords.

I am not suggesting that this should happen, but it would be perfectly possible in a changed environment for decisions to be made that changed those functions and thus affected the nature of the primacy of this Chamber.</p>

 My right hon. Friend mentioned the &#147;function&#148; of the other place as if it had a different function, but historically the functions are the same, involving such processes as the legitimacy of legislation and the examination of it. The diffidence that currently characterises the House of Lords results from lack of legitimacy&#151;electoral legitimacy. That is the only distinction. The conventions that have been recorded, which we are discussing today are, in fact, a reflection of the way in which the House of Lords perceives its role.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I want to return to the point about the extent to which the Joint Committee report might pertain if there were changes in the composition of the House of Lords. The Committee was absolutely clear about this, and I make no apology for repeating what it said, even though it has been quoted by other Members. In paragraph 61, in a comment that was also brought forward into the summary of the report, the Committee states:</p>
<a name="70117-0009.htm_brev3"><a name="07011772000805"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our conclusions apply only to present circumstances. If the Lords acquired an electoral mandate, then in our view their role as the revising chamber, and their relationship with the Commons, would inevitably be called into question, codified or not.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70117-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000413">It continues:</p>

What could or should be done about this is outside our remit.&#148;</p>

What I do have some difficulty with is the Government&#146;s response to that; that is where the problem lies. In paragraph 9 of page 4 of the Government response, they say:</p>
<a name="70117-0009.htm_brev5"><a name="07011772000807"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our answer...is that further reform should not alter the current role of the Lords as a revising chamber, and that the conventions governing its relationship with the Commons are fit for that purpose.

It might wish to wait to do that until after it had had some time of operating under the current conventions, but as I have said to the Leader of the House on several occasions, an elected House of Lords, or a House of Lords with an elected element, would be a very different House of Lords from that which currently exists.

Members. Just as the House post-1999, with what the Government described as its increased legitimacy, has flexed its muscles more than the previous House did, so a House of Lords with elected Members will, I believe, want to reconsider the conventions. The Joint Committee rightly said that it was outside its remit to look at a changed House of Lords, but the Government cannot sweep aside issues to do with that and assume that a changed House of Lords would have no desire to look again at such issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70117-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07011772000416">Let me turn briefly to the specific conventions addressed by the Committee. First&#151;this might initially seem to be a minor point&#151;I do not agree that the Salisbury-Addison convention should be renamed the Government Bill convention. That is precisely because of the issue raised by the Leader of the House in his opening speech&#151;that it does not apply to all Government Bills because it does not apply to non-manifesto Bills. The Leader of the House has reiterated the Government&#146;s suggestion that it might be named the Cunningham convention. I have no objection to noting the role played in this matter by the noble Lord of that name, but I see no reason to change the convention&#146;s name, because the Committee has not changed the convention and believes that it operates well as it is. Therefore, I see no reason to change the name from the Salisbury-Addison convention. Nor do I see any need to set it out in a formal resolution, and I suggest that to do so would verge on the very process of codification that the Committee rightly rejected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70117-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07011772000417">I wish to talk about secondary legislation, which has also been the subject of exchanges across the Floor of the House. It raises issues that go wider than the operation of the conventions of the House of Lords. It has been my view for some time that we need to look more widely at the way in which both Houses deal with secondary legislation, as there are problems with the current system. Those problems arise primarily because there is so much secondary legislation, and because Government have increasingly used primary legislation in the form of skeleton Bills, relying on secondary legislation to fill in the detail. While no one would suggest that it is always right for all the detail to be included in every Bill, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Secondary legislation does not get proper scrutiny&#151;and of course, it cannot be amended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70117-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07011772000418">The Government must stop taking the easy option of having primary Bills giving powers to the Secretary of State to make large numbers of regulations through statutory instruments; we need the Government to exercise restraint. It makes for better legislation if more is included in a Bill, as that allows greater scrutiny of the measures proposed. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) mentioned, in its deliberations on secondary legislation the Committee said that one of the reasons that could be given for the Lords threatening to defeat secondary legislation arose if the parent Act was a skeleton Bill and the provisions of the statutory instrument were of a sort more normally found in primary legislation. Fewer Bills, with more time for them to be properly considered and with more detail included in them, so that they could be properly discussed in both Houses, and with less resort to secondary legislation, would lead to better legislation.</p>

The House should take time to look at how it handles secondary legislation. Another issue that such an inquiry could cover is whether there should be a power to amend.

That would enable us to take on board another issue that the Committee dealt with in considering how the Lords handle secondary legislation. It made the point that the Government should be seen to take non-fatal motions in the Lords rather more seriously than they do at present. The Committee proposed that there should be a written statement in response to such motions. I share the view expressed in the debate in another place by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Strathclyde that there should be an oral statement or a debate on such matters.</p>

Houses and, crucially, give more time for cross-party discussions and for potential compromise where that was desirable. That is an issue to which both Houses should return.</p>

We all want to ensure that legislation is dealt with in a timely fashion, but it would be wrong to set a deadline for the House of Lords&#146; consideration of legislation. Moreover, the length of time taken for consideration of any Bill in their lordships&#146; House&#151;or, indeed, in this House&#151;is of course not just a matter of the time taken to scrutinise that legislation; it is also dependent on the Government business managers. Given that, as the Leader of the House has suggested on a number of occasions, we should think ahead to when we are in government, I would not wish to restrict the flexibility available to Government business managers on this matter.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend not accept that one reason why the Lords have in recent times spent a great deal of time on certain Bills is that they departed the House of Commons with very large tranches of them completely undebated and ignored in this House?

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, who was a distinguished member of the Joint Committee. If he casts his mind back, he may recall that I made that point in my evidence to the Committee. There is a real need for the House of Commons to consider how it looks at legislation, in order to ensure that we give proper consideration to all aspects of Bills. That is one reason why I referred earlier to the need for less legislation, which could then be given rather better consideration by both Houses. That would ensure that we end up with better legislation on the whole, instead of the current situation whereby significant aspects of Bills are all too often not considered by this House and have to be considered by the Lords, which does not lead to the best legislation that we could pass.</p>

The merit of our system is that, precisely because it is not codified, it can be exercised flexibly and can evolve over time to meet changing needs.

As he knows, I have real difficulty with that idea&#151;in fact, I oppose the use of preferential voting in this House. We have accepted the future use of exhaustive ballots for the election of the Speaker, but Standing Orders make it clear that even in such ballots there should be a single vote for each Member on each ballot. The idea of Members setting down preferences in a single ballot is contrary to the basic principle of voting&#151;that a proposition is put and Members vote for or against it.

I agree with the shadow Leader of the House that that should not be done. One thing that I find saddening as we proceed with our activities in this place is the unnecessary junking of things that are part of the history of Parliament and of this country. Although I was a huge admirer of Robin Cook when he was Foreign Secretary, when he became Leader of the House he had a tendency toward change for change&#146;s sake, which did no assistance to the House. An example was the renaming of private notice questions as urgent questions, for which I saw no real justification.

As I said when I intervened in her speech, there may be different ways of achieving an elected element, but it is certain that those people who were elected to the second Chamber, in whatever way, would claim that the fact that votes had been cast meant that their House had rights in relation to this House that do not exist at present.

If my right hon. Friend looks at page 122, he will see that we did not make a recommendation on composition, although we presented three possible models for the selection of regional members. Indeed, I might as well tell the House that if there had been an attempt to recommend an elected element to the House of Lords, I would not have signed the report. It was because I refused to go along with such a recommendation that we presented only models.

I said that the progress of parliamentary representation in this country was an evolutionary mess and that the commission could do no more than hope to add to that mess. I pay tribute to the Joint Committee because it has implicitly recognised that nice, tidy and convenient solutions might work in other countries, where they have things such as constitutions, but that we have a system of parliamentary representation that has evolved over many centuries.

Others might know the candidates for the Labour leadership better than I do, but I somehow feel that whoever becomes leader&#151;and therefore the next Prime Minister&#151;will not have reform of the composition of the House of Lords as a high priority.

The love and sympathy for her was evident in the way that the Lords responded when they heard the sad news of Denis Carter&#146;s death.

That option nearly won; when it was put to the test it was three votes short of a majority, as colleagues will remember. There is a perfectly respectable argument for a fully elected second Chamber, which colleagues of mine have put regularly, but there is an equally respectable argument for something that retains the ability, in a non-party way, to add people of particular expertise to those elected.

 The Father of the House has a consistent view about that and I respect it.

I have never dissented from the view that the House of Commons should be the prime House of the United Kingdom Parliament and that it will continue to be so, whatever method of election we choose, if it is the law of the land. The right hon. Gentleman and I will probably differ about the way in which we should be elected; I want this House to be representative of the views expressed by the public&#151;he does not. That is an honest and traditional debate. I do not believe that making the second Chamber of Parliament predominantly&#151;indeed, even wholly&#151;elected necessarily changes the primacy of this place, unless we make a decision to do that. It does not follow. Of course, the nature of the second House would be changed, but the constitutional relationship would not change. So far, pre-eminently among Parliaments, we have the power; we are not constrained by constitution and prevented from holding that position. We are not in France or in the United States, where the constitution governs the relationship between the two Houses of Congress&#151;the two parts of the legislature&#151;and the presidency. We are not constrained in that way, so unless we decide, and legislation changes the position, this House retains primacy.</p>

The primacy question was not asked of the Committee, but it was the first question it answered. For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee wanted to say, &#147;We agree that the House of Commons should be the prime legislative Chamber&#148;. The Leader of the House gave the reasons and the tests, which are obvious, and there was no disagreement about that either. This House is the place, where if the Government commands a vote of confidence and the Prime Minister wins the day, he or she has office; if they lose that vote of confidence&#151;as the late Jim Callaghan did&#151;they lose the right to be in government and have to tender their resignation to the Head of State.</p>

That is not a fundamental change, but it would make the constitutional position of the House even clearer. As the Leader of the House knows, my view is that whatever method of voting gets us here, we should retain primacy in this place.

 The hon. Gentleman is inverting the argument. The reason we have primacy is not because of the formulaic procedures he describes; they translate the primacy of the House, which derives from the electorate and from the fact that we are elected.

Once we change that, and have an elected Chamber at both ends of the Corridor, I do not say that the process and procedures will change, but the balance must inevitably change.

 The right hon. Gentleman is right. Of course, in one sense, the nature of Parliament will change. If there are elected Members in both Chambers they will claim an authority that cannot be claimed by a hereditary peer, a bishop or archbishop of the Church of England appointed by the monarch, a Law Lord or a life peer. I accept that. However, I have seen no proposal from any of our three parties, or anybody else, that suggests that there is on the table&#151;or likely to be&#151;something that will immediately change the House of Lords from an entirely unelected Chamber to one where everybody is elected, as we are, on the same day of the same year, with one mandate, on a platform that allows them to claim that they are the Government.

 That is a perfectly proper question and it ties in slightly to the points made by the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton. Let us imagine that later this year, in this Session, the House of Commons votes for a predominantly or partially elected second Chamber. Let us imagine that relatively quickly, as I hope will happen&#151;indeed the Labour manifesto indicated that it would happen during this period of the Labour Government&#151;we go to something that was intended in 1911, but was a bit slow in arriving: namely the completion of the process to get rid of the hereditary peers and to arrive at a democratic second Chamber. That has been on the agenda for nearly 100 years. A Liberal Government wanted to do that, but could not. The Liberals still want to do it, and we hope that, with the co-operation of progressive socialists and social democrats in the Labour party, we can deliver it.</p>

That is not genetic inevitability, but probability. People will say, &#147;We are elected now&#151; 80 per cent. of us.&#148; That will happen eventually. It will take a while in coming. If we do it by thirds, it will probably take 16 years, or 12 years, or 15 years, but it will happen. I am sure that people will say, &#147;Have we got the balance of powers between the two Houses right?&#148; But that change has been happening anyway over the last 10 years. It has been happening since the reforms of the House of Lords that got rid of the bulk of the hereditaries. It has been happening in the day-to-day arrangements. What we have been asked to do, and have done, is collect together the developments that have occurred and reassess where we are so that we know what we are talking about and what the balance of power between the two Houses is. Having decided that that is the balance of powers, and that we are going to change the structure, the issue will come back on the agenda. But we are still in control of that process. We have not lost any control over it. We will have to win an argument for saying that we want to keep the same relative power.</p>

The change in my lifetime is that when I was born, in the &#146;50s, 95 per cent. of the votes went to the two largest parties&#151;Conservative and Labour&#151;whereas now only two thirds of the votes go to the two largest parties. In the case of the great &#146;45 Government, during whose tenure the famous Salisbury-Addison doctrine was agreed between a Conservative Lords and a Labour Government with a majority in the Commons, something in the order of 35 per cent. of the total public voted Labour. At the last few elections, as the hon. Gentleman knows, just over a fifth of the public voted Labour. Parliament and the Government do not have the same authority in terms of the number of voters or the share of the voters supporting them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70117-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07011772000495">There will be an argument and that will force this House to think about whether it can sustain Governments on the basis of so small a share of the electorate. The issue that will come on to the agenda is how we can give more authority to the Government elected here. The hon. Gentleman knows what my answer will be: a more proportionate electoral system. Let me say as a postscript that I am not against single-Member constituencies being represented here. That is not my party&#146;s view, but it is my view. I understand the argument. For me, having a proportionate Commons does not necessarily mean that we have to lose the link with our constituents, which we all value. The Roy Jenkins commission, commissioned by the Labour Government, came up with a proposal that would answer that conundrum satisfactorily and that could command consensus.</p>

One of the interesting debates that is linked to that is how we guarantee that as far as we can. One of the ways of doing that is to retain a proportion of people without party allegiance. If that proportion is 20 per cent., for example, by definition we reduce the chances of any one party having a 50 per cent. share or more, because the 20 per cent. are a block and would help to prevent that.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman tries to lead me to anticipate a debate that we will certainly have. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) asked directly whether I thought that the arrangement was a convention. The Committee was not asked to adjudicate on the matter, so it did not formally propose that there should be such a convention. There were proposals on which we reached a unanimous view. The right hon. and learned Gentleman was an eminent member of the Committee, so he heard the evidence and he will remember the debate. That debate was held on the basis that it was the settled will of those involved in the House of Lords at present that no single party would be expected to have a majority in the second Chamber in the foreseeable future. That is the best answer that I can give him about my interpretation of the general view.</p>

 Of course that is the answer, and the purpose of my earlier intervention on the Leader of the House was to point that out. Paragraph 61 set out  the position at present, but made it clear that it was not for the Committee to predict the position after a change to the structure. We were not asked or given the authority to make such a prediction, and we did not do that. We recognised not that the relationship would change, but that it would be questioned. We recognised that the question would come back, not that the answer would be different.</p>

That primacy will be secured by the fact that nearly all Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the principal Secretaries of State of the main Departments, are Members of this House. By definition, that means that this is the prime Chamber. Additionally, this is the only Chamber that anyone contemplates being elected at one time. This is the place where Governments are made and unmade, the place where the Ministers are and the place that votes Supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70117-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000516">I disagreed with what the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton said about the Salisbury-Addison convention. I am absolutely against junking history when there is no need to do so. I studied history and I love it, and it is important that we remember our history. However, the Salisbury-Addison convention, named after two Marquesses of Salisbury and one Viscount Addison from the past two centuries, has changed, so we need a new convention. In parenthesis, the Salisbury-Addison convention did not bind our party, because we were not party to it. It was a convention between two parties only, made in entirely different political circumstances. Under this convention, it was agreed that manifesto Bills, as the term is generally understood, would not be blocked by the Lords, and that Government Bills would normally not be blocked by the Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70117-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000517">Occasionally, the Government try to misrepresent things, as they did in the case of identity cards recently. They pretended that it was a Government Bill, because they had said that they would introduce identity cards, but the manifesto clearly said that the scheme would be voluntary, and rolled out slowly. However, the Government then came back with a Bill that said that the scheme would be compulsory, so we cannot always take them at their word. The convention is different now, and we Liberal Democrats accept, as does the Committee, that the convention should bind the House of Lords and the House of Commons.</p>

important to note that the Lords do not normally reject secondary legislation, but they have the power to do so. The Committee set out six occasions on which the Lords must have, and retain, that power. The first occasion is when special attention has been drawn to the importance of the instrument by the relevant Joint Committee. The second occasion is when the order is a skeleton Bill, and Parliament was told, &#147;The detail will come later; that&#146;s when you can decide&#148;. The third occasion concerns orders made under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 or the Human Rights Act 1998. The fourth relates to orders that specifically require super-affirmative procedure&#151;that is, double-lock yes votes in both Houses. The fifth occasion is Northern Ireland orders, because of the unusual lack of democratic decision making and scrutiny for Northern Ireland legislation, and cases in which we are devolving primary legislative competence, for example to Wales or Scotland. The sixth occasion is when we are persuaded to delegate a power on the basis that we will have a vote later, as was the case with the provisions on jury trial included in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70117-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000519">The Committee hinted that we need a process for considering the whole issue of secondary legislation, including European legislation. I support that, as do my colleagues; there is too much legislation of that kind, and there is not enough parliamentary control of it. I support the idea that we should be able to amend secondary legislation, as that would help us to do our job better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70117-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07011772000520">There was agreement that we will not do what Labour&#146;s manifesto wants us to do and set a fixed time in which pieces of legislation must go through the Lords. The current system has not been abused. The long time that it has sometimes taken to get a Bill through the Lords has normally been due to the fact that the Government held it back at various stages. The danger is that if there were fixed times, or a limit to the number of times that the Lords could reject a Bill, the Government would play games. They would delay things until the last minute, and manipulate the timetable. We must allow the Lords ultimately to say no. The result is not that the Government lose their business&#151;the Parliament Acts are their safeguard&#151;but that they may have to reintroduce the Bill in the subsequent Session, as happened in recent times with legislation on jury trial for serious fraud cases. If we had fixed-term Parliaments, things would be different, but we do not have them yet, and until we do, we must keep the right of the Lords both to decide what is a reasonable time, and to send work back for us to reconsider.</p>

They have often saved the country from legislation that was far too authoritarian or oppressive. They have upheld human rights when the Government of the day persuaded the House of Commons not to do so. That is not to say that if there were elected people among them, they would not do just as fantastic a job. The fact that they are not elected is not a precondition of their doing a wonderful job. I hope that they will continue to be confirmed in the importance of their secondary but hugely important role of helping us to legislate well and hold the Executive to account.</p>

should legislate for conventions, as there must be flexibility. Such legislation would be a straitjacket; it would be nonsense and a ridiculous inhibition.

Having made that clear, we can improve procedures, do more to hold Government to account, and improve the way in which we scrutinise legislation. We need to do all those things, but, knowing the facts, we can do away with prejudices and decide whether we want to reform the second Chamber. My colleagues and I hope that we will create a senate that is wholly or predominantly elected. It would not change the primacy of the Commons, but it would change the nature of Parliament, which is a good thing.</p>

thing that will come out of this debate will not so much be a new Cunningham doctrine as a new Kaufman doctrine. Given the implication of the concept, &#147;If it&#146;s working, don&#146;t fix it&#148;, at first I thought that the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) was going to make a passionate defence of the idea of retaining an entirely hereditary House of Lords, but I realise that he has also described himself as a fiery socialist, so perhaps that is how one squares that particular circle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07011772000556">I was privileged to serve on the Joint Committee on Conventions, which was one of those Committees of Parliament that generated more light than heat and was very worth while. Any debate that involves the future of the upper House is bound to be controversial. I hope that the Leader of the House will forgive me if I say that this Government&#146;s record in that regard over the past 10 years has not been one of their more conspicuous successes. It was entirely understandable that a newly elected Labour Government might wish to contemplate the removal of the hereditary peers, but on the principle that if it works, do not fix it, the least that the nation might have been entitled to expect was that the Government would not move towards reforming the House of Lords until they already had a clear view of what they wished to replace it with. Yet here we are, 10 years later, with dramatic changes already having been made to the upper House, but still unaware of what the Government&#146;s proposals will be, although we are promised a White Paper in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07011772000557">Against that background, when the Joint Committee was first established there was inevitably great suspicion, and rightly so, about the Government&#146;s motives. Some wondered whether they were simply trying to demonstrate that they had a policy, with the establishment of the Committee being part of that process. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said, some worried that what the Government really wanted to do was to try to freeze the existing conventions in advance of any change in the composition of the House, in the belief that codification would make that much more likely to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07011772000558">If that was the Government&#146;s approach, it completely backfired when the Committee reached the conclusion of its deliberations. There was unanimity not only among the members of the Committee, but among those who gave evidence to it. Politicians and academics, as well as the Clerks of both Houses, made it clear that the Government&#146;s preference for codification was foolish and counterproductive. The Committee not only came down against codification, but inferred, even if it did not say so explicitly, that the whole idea of reforming the composition of the upper House without opening up a vital and fundamental debate about the existing conventions and whether they needed to be changed was something that the Government and Parliament had to take into account.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000563">One would not think that the whole idea of codification had been blown out of the water. Even more fundamentally in the longer term, one would not think that the Joint Committee is telling the Government that one cannot ignore the challenge that will be made to the existing conventions on the relationship between the two Houses if an elected element is introduced into the composition of the Lords. I want to make a couple of points about that. None of us knows the consequences of introducing a partially or wholly elected element into the House of Lords. However, two things are clear. First, the Government will not determine that outcome by themselves. They are entitled to a view, but they will be only one of many players in determining what will happen to the conventions and the relationship between the two Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07011772000564">Secondly, as other hon. Members have said, the change will not happen overnight. It will be a dynamic process, but that is not especially new. The existing conventions and the development of primacy happened over several hundred years. I have not the slightest doubt that from the moment the upper House is wholly or partially elected, the pressure will begin to build for reassessing the existing way in which primacy applies. The Government are trying to tackle that. However, all the Leader of the House could say today was that if the upper House were elected, it would be more assertive and that the Government welcomed that. I am not sure what he means by &#147;more assertive&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000565">The right hon. Gentleman tries to combine the declaration that he is happy that the upper House should be more assertive with the assumption that it cannot change the conventions or do anything other than be more assertive. What does assertive mean in that context? The Leader of the House sounds like the Englishman abroad who, on finding that he is not understood, believes that speaking loudly and being more assertive will make people understand the message that he is trying to convey. If that is the nature of the assertiveness, it does not add up to a row of beans and is unlikely to persuade anyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07011772000566">However, the Leader of the House also said in his submission and his remarks today that the Government do not mind more assertiveness as long as it does not challenge this House&#146;s fundamental primacy. Again, that sounds reasonable. I doubt whether any Member or anyone in the country would question the basic principle that the House of Commons is more important than the House of Lords, regardless of composition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07011772000567">However, as I said in an earlier intervention, the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is based on the false premise that primacy is a zero sum business. I used the example of pregnancy. One either has primacy or one does not. However, the message that many of us are trying to get through to the Leader of the House is not that primacy will disappear or that the House of Commons will cease to be the main forum for the nation&#146;s affairs, but that just as primacy changed its  <br>

nature over hundreds of years to reflect the increasing democracy of the nation and the increasingly representative nature of Parliament, if and when that principle applies to the upper House a similar process will happen. The upper House will say, &#147;We, too, are representative&#151;not in the same way or with the same mandate, but we can claim the electorate&#146;s mandate to some extent and our powers must reflect that if the democratic principle is fundamental to determining those issues.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07011772000571">In his response to the report, the Leader of the House made a point that, again, appears valid. He said that we should take into account the experience of other countries. He stressed that other countries have bicameral legislatures and that, in some cases, their upper Houses are also elected, but they do not claim primacy over the lower Houses. He asked why, therefore, there should be any change in the United Kingdom if an elected element were introduced into the upper House. Again, the right hon. Gentleman misleads himself. He assumes that we argue for a principle that when there are two Chambers, both of which are elected, they must be equal. There is no such principle; it is a question of practicality&#151;it is for the nation to decide whether, when both Houses of a Parliament contain an elected element, they should have equal or different powers. What we are arguing is not that the upper House should have equal powers, but that if it is elected it will certainly claim a greater share of the power that is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07011772000572">The right hon. Gentleman also misleads himself in not taking into account that what is unique about circumstances in the UK is that we are contemplating a fundamental change in the composition of the upper House. We are saying that for centuries we have had an unelected upper Chamber and we are now contemplating the introduction of a representative element into its affairs, so against that background the right hon. Gentleman cannot seriously be suggesting to himself&#151;even if he is suggesting it to the House as a whole&#151;that that does not have implications for the powers of the new upper House that will come into existence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07011772000573">I do not wish to detain the House.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07011772000576">He went on to say:</p>

The Leader of the House must take those matters into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07011772000580">It is worth remembering&#151;others have made indirect reference to it&#151;that the preamble to the Parliament Act 1911 made it clear that the constraints on the upper House simply reflected the fact that it was not an elected legislature at that time. If that were to change, the whole basis of the Parliament Acts would have to be reassessed and re-examined. I am not one who wishes to challenge the primacy of this House. I believe that, even if there were an elected upper House, it would be highly desirable that most of what we consider primacy to be about should continue to be relevant. We do not want deadlock in our legislative system and we do not want a situation where the Government would feel themselves equally answerable to both Houses, which might stultify the natural business of government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07011772000581">I conclude by saying that the debate is not about whether primacy would disappear. The question that the Leader of the House has still failed to address is why it would not be reasonable to assume that the primacy that this House enjoys, which has changed over centuries&#151;reflecting greater and greater democratisation&#151;would not begin to be reversed by an upper House that could also claim an electoral mandate. If the work of the Joint Committee has brought this issue into that degree of public debate, we will not have laboured in vain.</p>

 The previous speaker has just said that this is not just a debate among politicians. Well, most of this is exclusively a debate among politicians. I stand to be corrected, but I suspect that the Leader of the House is not much assailed on his soap box in Blackburn market about what he is doing about House of Lords reform. It is slightly extraordinary that, as was rightly mentioned by my right hon. Friends the Members for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) and for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), we are proposing to gridlock Government business for the next two years and override other important business with which we really should be dealing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07011772000583">I want to deal briefly with two issues that I believe are linked. The first is the evidence of the former Clerk of the House, to which I shall return in detail shortly. The other has been mentioned by colleagues on both sides of the House&#151;the contradictions between paragraph 61 of the report and the Government&#146;s response on the issue of primacy. The key element that draws those subjects together involves the underlying issue&#151;which the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) slightly evaded&#151;of where we derive our mandate from. Just as the underlying driver for capitalism is not so much a desire for profit as a desire to avoid bankruptcy, we are dealing here not so much with abstract accountability as with the ability of the public to change us, and thereby to change the Government, by voting in a clear way. Anything that moves us away from that does serious damage to democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07011772000584">In his evidence, the previous Clerk of the House of Commons, Sir Roger Sands, said of conventions:</p>
<a name="70117-0013.htm_brev8"><a name="07011772000822"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A further difficulty would be the need for adjudication once conventions had been turned into rules. Any set of rules which precisely defines what can or cannot be done must be adjudicated upon by someone. Within the House of Commons, Standing Orders and practices are interpreted and ruled upon by the Speaker; disputes about codified rules governing relations between the two Houses would suggest the need either for the establishment of some new parliamentary machinery or for some form of adjudication outside Parliament, possibly by a specially constituted court as is the case in countries with written constitutions like France or the United States.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07011772000585">I took issue with him on that matter, because I find the doctrine of an external body adjudicating over a sovereign Parliament particularly worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07011772000586">I asked Sir Roger Sands what the adjudicator would adjudicate on. I went on to ask:</p>
<a name="70117-0013.htm_brev9"><a name="07011772000823"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;How could the courts then adjudicate on whether the House of Commons had applied its rules properly or applied the rules of the relationship between the two Houses?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70117-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07011772000587">Colleagues might recall that we got quite close to that situation when a case was brought before the House of Lords over the use of the Parliament Act in relation to the Hunting Bill. It was extremely imprudent to have considered that case, because a certificate had been properly produced by a former Speaker&#151;in 1949, I think&#151;for the amendment of the Parliament Act. He was a Conservative Speaker. Under our constitution, it seems absolutely improper for the courts to seek to rule not on the interpretation of legislation but on its validity. This is a dangerous area, and we need to be alert. We must ensure that we do not go any further in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07011772000588">I turn now to the Government&#146;s response to the report. I agree with hon. Members on both sides of the House that it is inevitable that those who have the mandate from the public will seek to exercise it. After all, why else would the public have voted for them? My right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West alluded to the problem that can then arise: which mandate takes precedence?</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="07011772000589"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="07011772001202"><b>Mr. Angus MacNeil:</b>
 There is a matter that we have perhaps not faced up to in the debate this afternoon. Would the right hon. Gentleman concede that without democracy, we should be left with the corrosive practice of patronage and worse, as we have seen from the Scotland Yard investigation that is going on at the moment? I would venture to suggest that the latest new year&#146;s honours list was almost a tacit admission of foul play within patronage.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="07011772000590"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07011772001203"><b>Mr. Spellar:</b>
 That is a complete load of nonsense. If the hon. Gentleman saw fit, his party could have an Opposition day debate in which he could move that the House had no confidence in Her Majesty&#146;s Government. Under the American system, the Government&#151;and the President&#151;are elected for four years and there is a balance of powers. Under our system, however, the Government live from day to day. That is inevitable, because the only basis for government under the Westminster parliamentary system is that the Government maintain a majority in the House of Commons. That is right and appropriate, and the hon. Gentleman might wish to change things, but he could not complain if he were unable to win such a vote. That is the crucial issue. If he is right and we are wrong, the public will change their mind at the next general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07011772000591">Opposition Members have been criticising the Government for several years, but two elections have intervened since we first won power: in one we won an overwhelming majority, and in the other we won a substantial majority. The hon. Gentleman might be unhappy with the electorate about that and, like Bertolt Brecht and the central committee in &#147;The Workers Rehearse the Uprising&#148;, he might declare a lack of confidence in the people and a wish for the election of a new people. Under our system, however, the public can hold us to account at the general election, as his party has found: it has a little surge and gets a number of seats in Parliament, and then recedes again. It has returned with a few more seats, but never as many as it had at its peak.</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="07011772000592"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="07011772001204"><b>Mr. MacNeil:</b>
 Surely if the right hon. Gentleman has any confidence and trust in the public, he will have no worries about allowing the public a democratic say in electing a second Chamber?</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="07011772000593"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="07011772001205"><b>Mr. Spellar:</b>
 The problem with that is the need for clear lines of accountability, which is exactly the point to which I was coming. Under our system, the way in which not only a Parliament but a Government is elected is the same. If we have two elected Chambers, where do the Government come from? Which Chamber has the greater mandate? Which, for example, has the more recent mandate? We will come on to the slightly muddled views of the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) in a moment. If, for example,  <br>

elections are held at different times, as happens in some countries that have off-peak elections, would those who opposed the Government claim that they had put their views to the electorate more recently, so they had a more recent mandate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07011772000594">Equally, we must consider what would happen if, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey suggested, we had a different electoral system. We know how the jihadists of the proportional representation movement endlessly claim that those elected under such a system are more representative. If the other place had a different system, which was more to their liking, would not they claim that it was more representative of public opinion? Is that a mechanism for getting clear decisions and clearly electing a Parliament and a Government?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is arguing either for a unicameral legislature or for allowing people who are not elected to have some say in making the law of the land. Which is it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07011772000596"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="07011772001207"><b>Mr. Spellar:</b>
 Within the current conventions, the ability of the House of Lords to revise and to ask the Commons to think again, as outlined in the report, demonstrates that the public ultimately choose a Government, who decide. We can be asked to think again, which can create public embarrassment and put democratic pressure on us. That is what the Parliament Act says: ultimately, we can decide. The conventions say that the doomsday button does not have to be pressed every time in order for the Government, finally, to secure their business.</p>

 I am asking a more fundamental question: what entitles that group of people in the other place to have that right, as opposed to any other group of people?</p>

 There are a variety of means by which people come to that Chamber. They are nominated by the various political parties. Those parties have the ability to nominate through being represented here, so they derive their authority from the electorate. Equally, it has possibly been generally agreed that it is desirable to have people who are distinguished in their fields; even the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey argued for that. That would not necessarily mean that they were instantly electable under any system, but it might be of advantage to have their specialities represented, perhaps through having a variety of Cross Benchers. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton commented on methods of achieving that, and the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey praised the efforts of such Members. I might have some differences of view on that; I might think that they were trying to thwart the views of the electorate, who clearly wanted us to take effective action. However, a system of divided mandates and a variety of mandates is a different matter, as was pointed out by the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind).</p>

 It has been asked why such people should sit in the House of Lords. Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that many of those appointed to the House of Lords come from many important walks of life such as the arts, industry, the theatre, the trade unions, science, academia and the financial services? In an amending Chamber, their expertise can add a huge amount to legislation&#151;the good legislation that we hope will emanate from Parliament.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman omitted to mention former Chiefs of the Defence Staff and other senior figures in the armed forces, as well as members of the diplomatic corps. They also make a significant contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07011772000603">Then there is the question of what we are able to enshrine. I missed some of the context, but the Leader of the House spoke of guarantees. There are no guarantees, because no Parliament can bind its successor. The Lord Chancellor conceded as much only yesterday, when he said:</p>
<a name="70117-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="07011772000825"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Neither this House nor any political party can bind the House for the future.&#148;&#151;<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 16 January 2007; Vol. 688, c. 578.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07011772000604">That is true, and it demonstrates that pressure from those who claim legitimacy, aided and abetted by many of their supporters outside in the media, will inevitably start to move in the direction that I have described.</p>

She referred to an 80 per cent. proportion  of elected Members, and also to all those elected being independent Members. I do not know whether that observation was frivolous&#151;perhaps the right hon. Lady&#146;s language is becoming as flamboyant as her dress&#151;but it certainly suggested rather a &#147;year zero&#148; approach to Parliament. The right hon. Lady would not let me intervene on her, but I invite her to intervene on me to say whether what she said represents the view of the official Opposition.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman should have listened to what I said. As I am sure the <i> Hansard</i> report will make clear, I did not say that everyone elected to the House of Lords should sit as an independent. However, I think it would be an advantage for some Members to be independent, because that would help to ensure that the House of Lords contained people from a variety of backgrounds, not just party politicians. That is my view.</p>

 I find it difficult to understand the idea of such a mechanism in a democracy. How, in a democracy, can it be prescribed that those who will be elected by the public will, as of right and by definition, must be independents?</p>

 I did not suggest an element of prescription at any point. I would like some people to be elected as independents, and I hope that that will be the outcome in the event of an elected House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="st_o341"><a name="07011772000609"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew13"><a name="07011772001215"><b>Sir Gerald Kaufman:</b>
 The right hon. Lady has failed to meet my right hon. Friend&#146;s challenge. The electorate are sovereign. We have a House of Commons that contains two independent Members, one of them a Labour Member who was elected because of a row in the Labour party in south Wales. That does not offer a very promising prognosis for the substantial number of independents who the right hon. Lady is sure will be elected to the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="st_o342"><a name="07011772000610"><a name="70117-0014.htm_spnew14"><a name="07011772001216"><b>Mr. Spellar:</b>
 I am afraid that I must correct my right hon. Friend. In fact the House of Commons has three independents, one of whom was elected as a Labour Member and then ratted on that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000611">Let me conclude by explaining why the subject under discussion matters, and what the underlying issue is. We must have a clear understanding of parliamentary democracy and how it works. As I have said, there are differences between the British and American parliamentary systems. The American system elects an executive leader. It also elects two Houses that are representative and which, although they are the legislature, also provide the balance of powers. It also has an independent Supreme Court&#151;although interestingly, membership of it is subject to appointment by the President and ratification by the Senate. In our system, the election of Members to this House decides the Government. Therefore, inevitably, the position of the House of Lords in relation to the House of Commons is different from that of the US Senate in relation to the House of Representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000612">It is crucial that people clearly understand how they can change policy or change the Government. Measures that take authority away from this House and give it to quangos or unelected judges, and measures that divide the democratic mandate so that it is unclear who is to be held accountable, are not recipes for good government. Instead, they are recipes for democratic frustration, and that is when people start to become attracted to extremist parties. When people do not have a clear idea of how to exercise their rights, they either drop out of the political process into apathy or they start to vote for extremist parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70117-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07011772000613">That is why the Joint Committee report is right to say that if we change the nature of the House of Lords, that will inevitably have an impact and we will have to re-examine the conventions. The Government response does not properly address that fact, although it is good in other respects.</p>

 Of course none of us knows. The point has been made extremely effectively by others in this debate that, once we give to the electorate the opportunity of electing a body, they can elect whomsoever they choose. All that I would say to my hon. Friend, whose linguistic and forensic skills I greatly admire, is that all precedent teaches us that it is very difficult to get a goodly number of independents elected. In this House, we always have one independent&#151;Mr. or Madam Speaker&#151;but in all the 10 Parliaments in which I have sat, we have not had 10 independent Members in all. We have from time to time had one or two, sometimes as a result of an extraordinary circumstance&#151;a falling out in a constituency, for example, which was why Mr. Bell came here&#151;but we have never had a body of independents.</p>

As Members in all parts of the House will recognise, I will be about the House&#146;s business and have to do that, so I shall not trespass on the House by taking more than another couple of minutes.</p>

I welcome the report, which is a brilliant description of, and definition of, the existing conventions. Those conventions have been&#151;perhaps surprisingly&#151;warmly welcomed and endorsed by the Government. I welcome that. But they apply only to the present reality. We will have an opportunity&#151;the Leader of the House suggested that it would be in the spring, either just before or after Easter&#151;to debate proposals that will give us the chance to say whether we want an elected or partially elected Chamber.

definition of primacy given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea, but like him I entered the House of Commons because I believed passionately in it and its primacy. We live in a very sophisticated democracy and the historic evolution of our system means that we have in the second Chamber, partly by accident and partly by design, a greater accumulation of experience, wisdom and expertise than in any other Chamber in the world. To quote the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), who has temporarily left his place, if it ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t fix it.

 I am not sure that the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) was intended to be a shot across the Government&#146;s bows. He and I are both devout party loyalists, but sometimes we point out to Front-Bench colleagues that complicated matters facing the House can be explored in different ways.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House acknowledged that part of his engagement in cross-party discussions involves talking to the bishops. There may be a historical explanation for the bishops&#146; representation in the House of Lords, but there is no logical one. Even so, they are there, and so my right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman nods in agreement. The number of Bills taking more than 61 days has risen inexorably, from none in 1980-81 to 13 in the period to May in the 2005-06 Session. The average number of days spent on each Bill has also risen inexorably, from 36 in 1980-81 to 63 in the period to May in 2005-06.</p>

That might lead us to a view about how amendments ought to be tabled and debated, but it should not impinge on or determine our views about the structure of the other place.

 Indeed. It could be argued that more time should be given at the outset to ensure that drafting is correct. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am in favour of greater use of pre-legislative scrutiny, which would help to reinforce some of the processes that can get muddled, resulting in some of the ping-pong issues and in measures drifting down to the Lords that have not been properly debated in this place. We can get those things right in the existing structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70117-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07011772000644">I want to move on to primacy. There have been adequate exchanges about the gentle contradiction between paragraph 61 of our report and the Government&#146;s response, so I shall not detain the House too much on that point. However, it seems axiomatic that as changes are introduced, the nature of the relationship will change. The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), the hon. Member for South Staffordshire and some Labour Members have observed that we need to accept that there will be a change. I do not intend to debate whether we should have a written constitution, as I doubt you would allow me to do so, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but can we guarantee primacy without one? The House needs to have that serious debate.</p>

Friend the Leader of the House may say that the issues can be defined and codified, but that would be quite difficult without first defining the structure and purpose of the upper House. There is a complex interrelationship between the protection of primacy and the nature of the second Chamber and how it is formed. We cannot see the process as a series of simple steps; they are complex and interrelated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70117-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000646">There have been exchanges about the inequality of representatives. Can we have an elected Member of Parliament who is unequal? In this House, we fight vigorously to protect the concept that we are all equal Members of Parliament, and so it should remain. However, in the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, where list systems are in operation, there are debates about whether all Members are equal, as there are about the relationship between us and our regional Members of the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70117-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000647">I suspect that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has been as annoyed as I have been from time to time to have a Liberal Democrat MEP describe himself as, in my case, the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, or, in his case, the Member for Blackburn. It might be a matter of semantics, but that MEP is not the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. He does not have the same mandate as I have.

 It was a great honour to be one of three Conservative and Unionist Members who were appointed by the House to serve on the Joint Committee on Conventions. I found it an uplifting experience and one that taught me a great deal about what goes on in the House of Lords. Although I am prepared to confess to the House that I have long been a supporter of the House of Lords and the role that it plays in our constitution and in the way in which Parliament holds the Government of the day to account and scrutinises legislation, I have to say that, at every sitting of the Committee, I became more and more convinced that the House of Lords, as it is currently comprised, fulfils a valuable and important role. I became more and more convinced that my personal instincts about the House of Lords were merely strengthened by the evidence that was given to the Joint Committee.</p>

I found him to be an informed, kind and constructive member of the Committee. I thus join in the tributes that have been paid to him for the role that he played in Parliament as a leading member of the Government party in the House of Lords.

We know the extent to which expenses and allowances have increased in this House in recent times. If the public were really to debate the matter, I wonder whether they would be happy to pick up a large sum by way of the taxes that they have to pay to meet the cost of Members of the House of Lords. At present, Members of the House of Lords receive only reasonable expenses.

When the House of Lords sends amendments back to the Commons, it gives this House, which often passes legislation over-hastily, and in some cases actually unscrutinised, a second opportunity to look again at such legislation. To return to the cost of elections, there will be, perhaps shortly, a proposal that party campaign funds should receive much larger subsidies from hard-pressed taxpayers&#151;that is, if we go ahead with the election of Members to the House of Lords.

 Indeed, the Lords are not democratically elected, but I do not think there is any harm in that, given the role that they play in our democracy. Like other hon. Members, the hon.

Final decisions are made in this Chamber&#151;we pick up the tab at the end of the day, and we have the final decision on legislation&#151;but we consult members of the House of Lords who have a particular talent, skill or experience. Without intending any disrespect to the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), people who have recently come to serve in the House are career politicians, with little or no experience of anything other than politics. They probably went to college before becoming researchers, then advisers and assistants, and then standing as parliamentary candidates before entering the House. They do not have any experience of the real world, but I am grateful to have such experience, as I had to earn a living in the construction industry and I served as a county councillor. I speak, too, as someone with experience of procedure.

Between 1999 and 2005, the Government suffered almost 300 defeats in the House of Lords, but in four cases out of 10, the Commons, and thus the Government, accepted the result. The right hon. Member for Swansea, West rightly cited a figure of 40 per cent., so is there not a great deal of wisdom, good sense and good work in the House of Lords? Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), for whom I have unlimited admiration and regard, I think it is a good thing that the Government welcome and approve the report by the Joint Committee on Conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70117-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07011772000669">As we went through those conventions, there was nothing that led me to believe that at any stage the House of Lords was denying the primacy of the House of Commons or seeking to undermine it. They accepted it and they carried out their work bearing that in mind. The Salisbury-Addison convention was not only honoured to the letter, so to speak, of an unwritten obligation and responsibility, but in many cases applied to non-manifesto legislation that was introduced by the Government of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70117-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07011772000670">On reasonable time, another of the conventions, as I said in an intervention on my right hon.

I pick up the semi-criticism that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston levelled against me relating to the intervention on my right hon. Friend.</p>

Surely that cannot be right. The House of Lords has a constitutional right to take time properly to debate every clause and every subsection of every clause in the Bills that we send through to them.</p>

 I cannot entirely stay with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument when he says that good sense has prevailed in the process of ping-pong. Having been involved in far too many rounds of ping-pong for my own good in various home affairs and justice Bills, I know that the process is often extremely flawed because there is no recognition of the value of each House&#146;s consideration, no respect for each House&#146;s consideration, and no attempt at reconciliation of views, which ought to be an essential part of the process.</p>

 I am happy to agree with the hon. Gentleman. In the report, we suggested that there should be improvements in the way that the process was dealt with.

I am disappointed that the Procedure Committee&#146;s recommendation that the Lords and Commons should have a Joint Committee to deal with certain matters relating to secondary legislation was not accepted by the Government.

 Before I make a few observations on the Joint Committee&#146;s report, let me respond directly to the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton), who echoed much of what other Members have said during the debate. I should like to tell him a little story. A few years ago, my Government brought a measure before us with which I was not wholly happy and for which I did not vote. The hon. Member for Macclesfield nods. Then it went to the Lords, where it was improved and came back in a form with which I was happy. The Government decided to overturn the amendment from the Lords. I received a call from the Chief Whip&#146;s office. A conversation ensued along the following lines: &#147;These people aren&#146;t elected you know.&#148; I replied, &#147;I know that. What&#146;s more, I know that you don&#146;t want them to be elected.&#148; We were then mysteriously cut off. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70117-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07011772000683">The point of the story is that we must ensure that the second Chamber performs a function for us that we want it to undertake, and it must have sufficient authority to do that. Then, when I or someone else gets such a call, we can explain not why the House of Lords should get its way&#151;we have the ability to get our way, and that is right&#151;but that the second Chamber must have enough authority to ensure that we take it seriously. Otherwise, why have it?</p>

Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), who spoke of a creature that we cannot control. Does that mean that we want a creature that we can routinely control?

That is what we want the second Chamber to do for us. Then, it becomes a question of how we constitute the second Chamber so that it can do that. There are suggestions for constituting it&#151;including for election&#151;that would make that harder. If we created, through a certain sort of electoral arrangement, a second Chamber that was simply a replica of this Chamber, with the same party disciplines and lack of scrutiny, we would diminish, not improve, effective scrutiny in Parliament as a whole, even though we perhaps believed that election would achieve our goal. If one gets election wrong, it can enfeeble, not strengthen, a second Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70117-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07011772000686">We have to be clear about what we want the institution to do for us and then design it so that it can do that. We could design it in a variety of ways to secure that objective. I caution hon. Members against simply repeating their old favourite mantras about why appointment or election is the only way. Let us be clear about what we want the institution to do in our system and ensure that we get the design features to produce that outcome.</p>

I urge us all to be sure about what we think is the objective of all this&#151;and then to make sure that we get the design features that contribute to it.</p>

However, it still needs to be so constituted that it has sufficient authority and legitimacy to be taken seriously by the House of Commons.

 It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis is essentially correct, as we must have a clear idea of what the new Chamber would do&#151;a crucial prerequisite of having an intelligible and intelligent discussion about the form of its composition. I put it to the hon. Gentleman, however, that some of those who conjure up lurid scenarios of constitutionally impossible hybrid forms are people who seem to want to be the authors of self-fulfilling prophecies.

 I am very sympathetic to that point. The argument is not helped by conjuring up imaginary monsters that are going to have all kinds of catastrophic consequences. Now is the moment for some clear thinking because, after a lot of difficulties along the way, we may finally have reached a moment to begin to get somewhere. We have got some of the arguments out of our system and if we can agree on what we want reform to do&#151;I happen to think that the Leader of the House is probably the person above all others to lead the House on the matter&#151;we may be able to move forward sensibly with second Chamber reform.</p>

I join all those who have paid tribute to the Committee for a very impressive piece of work. I thought it had been given an impossible task, but it has performed it heroically. It has juggled constitutional jelly in a way that I would have thought impossible to do in such an elegant form. The task was impossible because the Committee was asked to codify conventions, and the truth is that once conventions are codified, they cease to be conventions. The task was impossible, but within that impossibility the Committee has performed an extremely valuable service.</p>

We can, however, try to understand them a bit better, and the report has enabled us to do just that. It has enabled us to understand them on a deeper level than before. However, the Committee was given the task of telling us whether it would be practicable to codify the conventions, and it has come back and said that it would not. Well, we knew that anyway because that is the nature of conventions. If they were codifiable, they would not be conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70117-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07011772000695">The Committee has also told us that if there were to be a radical rearrangement of the second Chamber, all bets would be off in relation to these understandings and conventions. However, the Government have said that that is not true. They would like the understandings or conventions to remain the same. Various Members have pointed out the conflict  <br>

between those two positions. Yes, there is a conflict between them, but it is perfectly possible for the Government to say that they would like the conventions to remain intact and to endure into a newly configured second Chamber. They cannot be certain that that would happen, but that is what they would like. That seems to be the only way of bringing the two positions together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70117-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07011772000696">I want to say a few words of congratulation and praise for a particular aspect of the Joint Committee&#146;s work, and for an aspect of the Government&#146;s response. The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) raised a point about manifestos. The report helps us greatly on this matter. All the stuff that is said about manifestos and manifesto Bills is a kind of fiction. It might be a necessary and convenient fiction, but it is a fiction none the less, and we should acknowledge that. The fact is that we do not know why people vote for or against a particular Government.</p>

We cannot say, &#147;Actually, I&#146;d rather have something from this trolley, and something else from that one.&#148; It does not work like that. It is a take-it-or-leave-it kind of trolley. Yet, after the election, the winning party says, &#147;We have support for everything in our trolley.&#148; The fact is that we have no idea whether people voted for a party because it had adopted a particular policy, or despite the fact that it disliked another.

 I mean what the Leader of the House referred to earlier when he talked about there being no zero-sum games. Up until this point, the belief has always been that if one makes one part of Parliament more effective, it will make another part less effective. That is simply a misunderstanding. The point is to make Parliament as a whole more effective. The Government are now saying that that is the point of what they are doing in relation to this House, which we have not really discussed but which is an important ingredient. If they are serious in wanting to make scrutiny here better, as I hope and believe that they are, that will contribute to that end. If we can secure a second Chamber that is more authoritative and legitimate, that will also contribute to it. Parliament as a whole will then become more effective at scrutiny. I take that to be a huge gain and a kind of breakthrough. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70117-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07011772000703">We are making real progress. We want to preserve our tradition of strong, coherent, effective government, but we must match it with a much better system of strong, coherent and effective accountability. We must set up a second Chamber that is conspicuously a House of scrutiny, which does the kind of things at which this place, a House of government, driven by party, is not very good. This is the place that Government drives and where Government and Opposition meet. It is not the place where intensive scrutiny happens. We must strengthen scrutiny in our system by having a second Chamber that does that. If we do that, it ceases to be a threat. It is not a monster, a spectre; it is our ally in holding the Government to account. If we get that right, other things have the chance of falling into place. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70117-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07011772000709">Instead, the Committee sensibly abandoned codification and restricted itself to producing various formulae to describe a number of conventions, at paragraph 283&#151;formulae, not codification.

They have also failed in a wider sense, in view of the much remarked paragraph 61. As the Committee made clear that its conclusions applied only to the current House, any attempt by the Government to use its work to bind a reformed House has failed. The Government were piqued by that, and produced a four-page response. The Leader of the House dwelt on that extensively today, encouraged to do so by a number of interventions.</p>

It does not use those powers now, for the simple reason that it does not have the moral authority to use them. A reformed House will have enough legitimacy to exercise the powers provided for it under the Parliament Acts, while also being restricted by them.

stalking the other Chamber yesterday. There was a great deal of talk about how effective the second Chamber already is, what a great job it does, and, by implication, how everything was already for the best in the best of all possible worlds. The truth is much more prosaic. We have the illusion of two-Chamber democracy, but we have the reality of something that is little more than unicameralism: a consultative assembly which, when push comes to shove, is usually too scared&#151;even in its somewhat reformed form since 1999, or whenever it was&#151;to take on the Executive and use the powers that it currently possesses.</p>

 I also happen to be in favour of a more directly elected House of Lords, but I take exception to my hon. Friend&#146;s implied comparison with the House of Commons, whose whipping arrangements, craven submission to Government and failure to scrutinise huge chunks of vastly important Bills suggest that, while we are perfectly entitled to criticise the other House, we ought also to consider the beam in our own eye.</p>

 I completely agree that we badly need reform of the way in which we scrutinise our House. One point that the hon. Member for Cannock Chase did not make that he might have made in talking about the balance between the two Chambers is that reform in the other place will probably stimulate reform here. I think that we will get a better working and functioning House of Commons, with those changes driven and forced through because of the fact that there will be some democratic competition between the Houses.</p>

The illusion suits us; it means that we can keep the power here and have that consultative and advisory body there, and we can get unicameralism by the back door.&#148; I vigorously disagree with that. I have always been in favour of having a strong Executive&#151;a Government who can get on with their job, and not be hamstrung all the time by gridlock in Parliament&#151;but I think that this Executive has become over-mighty. We must have some rebalancing of the constitution.</p>

In the 21st century, only a largely elected Chamber can provide such legitimacy. That is why I will strongly support the Leader of House&#146;s efforts to bring democracy to the second Chamber, if what he proposes is a majority-elected House. The public want that. I have been sitting in my seat from the beginning of the debate, and as far as I am aware the public and their views have not been mentioned even once.

 I am the first speaker in this debate who is neither a member of the Committee nor a distinguished Member of the House of long standing, so perhaps all that I can bring to our discussion&#151;especially at a time when all the good points have been made several times&#151;is a little naive radicalism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07011772000723">I should start by saying that I was somewhat suspicious of the Committee, but I have been pleased by the result of its labours, especially on two points. The first of them is codification. I made my view on that clear in the debate in May, and I am glad that the Committee has reached a similar conclusion: that codification of conventions would rob those who wish to design new arrangements that work of an important tool that would allow flexibility in the development of the institutional arrangements that we need. Secondly, I am delighted with paragraph 61. In fact, it is that paragraph that will lead me to support the motion; if it had instead been on the Government response, I might have been in a different position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000724">Paragraph 61 makes it clear that the conclusions that the Committee have come to have no relevance to a future situation involving a reformed House of Lords with an elected element. All the Committee is putting before us is its view of what the conventions are now. It is in the nature of those conventions that even that view is applicable only to now; the conventions will develop, even if the House of Lords is not reformed. I fully support that conclusion of the Committee, to which all its other conclusions are subject. So if there is any part of the report that I do not fully agree with or accept, I can console myself with paragraph 61, which removes any great problem.</p>

I cannot see how it is justifiable for people who have not been democratically elected to have any part in the legislative process greater than that played by ordinary citizens. The question is not necessarily expertise, but a different one: why these experts and not other experts? We all know a lot of experts, most of whom are not Members of the House of Lords, so the question that arises is: how does one become a Member of the House of Lords, even if one is an expert?

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000726">For me, the important part of the report is the one that demonstrates that, in the end, not only all the conventions but the Parliament Act itself derive their force, reason and justification from the undemocratic nature of the present House of Lords. It is the gap&#151;the difference between the two Houses&#151;that justifies what in reality are conventions that explain the House of Lords&#146; self-restraint. There is no doubt that the House of Lords has many legal powers that it does not exercise. That is because of the conventions, and because it accepts those conventions.</p>

 There is a potential reason, which I have given in the past. If the future House of Lords, albeit up to 80 per cent. elected, had different functions, particularly on the constitutional front, was elected through a different, regional arrangement and&#151;as some might suggest&#151;by a different system of election, there would be a sufficient reason for the exercising of self-restraint, which is a word that I would have used myself, had I had a chance to speak. That is the key element that would be necessary, precisely because the taxing powers&#151;the fundamental governmental powers that the hon.

 The key point&#151;this comes back to comments made by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)&#151;is that we need to explain why we have different Houses. The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) has given some possible reasons for having different functions in different Houses. When we have established those reasons, the conventions of self-restraint, or otherwise, between the Houses will flow from them. The conventions that we have now are the result of the difference in democratic legitimacy.</p>

The difficulty is one of legitimacy, which can be resolved in the long term only by ensuring that this House retains, if not an edge, at least an equality of representativeness with the other place.</p>

 There may be a misunderstanding here. What is important in any Parliament, especially an elected Parliament, is that the Government of the day have the right to introduce their major Bills and to press the issues that they think are important. However, in this House as in any other, it is essential that we understand that Governments do not automatically have the right to put them on the statute book. The whole purpose of both Houses is to try to prevent bad laws. That is why the majority of elected Members have a responsibility to scrutinise closely not only the legislation introduced by their Government, but the suggestions of others.

What appears on the surface to be this House&#146;s great strength&#151;its very power to make or break Governments&#151;is also a source of weakness.

We do not know why people vote for particular parties, but we do know that they do not know much about manifestos. Some of the academic evidence given to the Committee suggested that, when people are asked under what circumstances they think that an unreformed House of Lords should be entitled to throw out Government proposals, they do not respond by asking about what was in the manifesto. They do not care much about that; indeed, they do not respond in political terms, but purely according to whether the measure involved strikes them as good or bad.

The primacy of the Lords became constitutionally indefensible. Popular feeling and the ability to reach people to make arguments and to affect Government grew. We accept no divine right of kings. This House brought to an end the concept that a person can by right of birth be a member of a legislature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07011772000745">It seems absolutely extraordinary that anyone could countenance the fact that a legislator in a democracy is not accountable to the people for whom they make laws. The people who bear the laws must be able to hold to account those who make them. That is such a fundamental point that I am startled that a Labour Government&#151;as Mr. Kinnock would have said&#151;could countenance even the thought of the sidelining ways in which the Prime Minister frustrated Robin Cook&#146;s genuine attempt to move towards a largely elected second Chamber. It was almost a repudiation of the genesis of the Labour party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07011772000746">The conflict between the two Houses does not chill me. It is a dynamic that reinforces the people. We all have different views about what public policy should be&#151;there is nothing unusual about that. I lived under a Conservative Government who used to chant the mantra of the mandate. I live under this God-awful Government&#151;if they will forgive me saying so&#151;who also chant the mantra of the mandate. As the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Tony Wright) said, the manifesto is a curious document. None of us reads it from cover to cover, apart from those who wrote it.  The public at large are unaware of it, but it provided the justification for the Lords&#146; acceptance that the legitimacy they lacked resided elsewhere and that in the end they should defer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07011772000747">I look forward to seeing whether the Leader of the House&#146;s White Paper is a virtuous document, but if the Lords are to have legitimacy, on whatever basis, of course it will reconfigure the relationship between here and there. In truth, I look forward to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70117-0017.htm_para28"><a name="07011772000748">The public are disengaged because, somehow, we beat a drum to a tune that they no longer hear when it comes to the issues that they wish to challenge and the importance of Government. We have become machines of spin and manipulation. Where is the blockage? Most of these arguments have long been discussed and reasoned through. We have only to think of Montesquieu&#146;s misunderstanding of the British constitution, of those English gentlemen in the United States in revolt against the Crown, of the Federalist papers, and of the long debate over the very issues that trouble us now. Those arguments are there, and yet here we are talking, and the Government insist&#151;the mantra is still heard&#151;that they must get their business. That has never been a constitutional principle. It is an argument of Government, of course. The Government may get their business if they are supported by Parliament. That is the function of Parliament.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a wonderful philosophical case and, although I disagree with him about the House of Lords, I think that the points that he is making are excellent. However, is it not a fact that, until the House of Commons takes more control of its time, he will never achieve what he wants to achieve? The advantage of the Lords is that they, and not the Government of the day, are in charge of their time. They can therefore debate more issues that are closer to the people than the House of Commons can.</p>

 I am making a case for Parliament and I accept that Parliament is both Chambers. I am proud to be a Member of this House. It was an aspiration. It is part of the history of my country that we, the people, control the Government. But remember: if we have another Chamber that also has the authority of election, with the checks and balance that I seek, we have a tension. I welcome that, as I said earlier. That tension makes for better and more rational government. I have heard the word&#151;it was much used in the &#146;80s when one looked at reform&#151;&#147;gridlock&#148;. Why should we fear that? The United States may or may not be going into gridlock. The essential relationship between two institutions&#151;the Lords and the Commons&#151;is one of politics. Most people, in the spirit of comity, will negotiate. That is what we want. No one can now negotiate with a Government with a large majority in the House of Commons. In this House, we do not consider proposed legislation any more to any effective purpose. We claim that the only duties of the upper House are revising and improving, and yet when there are matters of principle, I now look to the Lords to look after my civil and political liberties. That is an extraordinary proposition. We, the people, are less attentive to many of the important things.</p>

If I were back at the London School of Economics, it would be part of the constitutional law course. Set out in the greatest clarity are the actual conventions as understood today by Members of both Houses of Parliament. However, as others have said, that is a moving feast. A convention for today may not be appropriate for tomorrow. We used to say that it was conventions that made the institutions work. In that spirit, I hope that when the Leader of the House introduces his White Paper, we will have a proper debate that does not just take place between the parties, but is wider than that, because most of us are not in the teams that lead those negotiations. We have views and opinions and what I like about the dynamic of a debate such as today&#146;s is that one hears the voice of considerate, thinking, careful Members of Parliament, seeking an ideal: the sovereignty of Parliament.</p>

result was about 411 to 20, has been justified. The reflections of the Committee, which comprised Members from both sides of the House, having examined the wording that my hon. Friend and I challenged at that time&#151;I think that our challenge caused the Leader of the House to run down the corridor to get to the Chamber on time because no vote was expected&#151;demonstrate that this House operates by behaviour as well as by rules, which is the essence of conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07011772000753">On the previous occasion, we alighted on the curious question of codification as a matter of considerable concern, so I was glad that the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), a distinguished academic lawyer who has examined these matters through the prism of jurisprudence, understood what we were getting at and spoke strongly on the subject, as did the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). The process could otherwise have easily been hijacked, with everything going through on the nod. If we had not taken such action, I am not entirely convinced that we would have been in the happy position where the matter received the responsible consideration that it has been given today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07011772000754">By reference to other constitutions throughout the rest of world, many of which were born out of, or spawned by, our constitutional experience, the situation is pretty extraordinary. There are Commonwealth countries that have written constitutions, which we do not have. However, I should add that Canada applies the doctrine of conventions. Before I became a Member, I was involved in the patriation proposals with respect to Quebec, which I advised professionally for several years. It was on the question of the Statute of Westminster that the Supreme Court of Canada decided that there had been no illegality regarding the patriation proposals for the Canadian constitutional settlement. Although there had been no breach of the legal rules, however, there had been breaches of convention because the provinces had been insufficiently consulted before representatives came to Westminster to ask whether the constitution should be repatriated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07011772000755">Huge matters can thus turn on conventions. Indeed, the relationships between the sovereign and the Cabinet and the Prime Minister and the Cabinet turn on conventions. Such</p>

They are not enforceable by the courts. They are not legal, or even obligatory. They do not have to be subscribed to, but they are. In a sense, that takes us back to the very question of who we are and what we are in this House of Commons when convened as a Parliament. In practice, we are pragmatic for much of the time. That was why I asked about the Whip system in an intervention. I am afraid that the Whip system is not subject to much in the way of conventions.

 If hon. Members knew who it was, they would be even more surprised by what I am about to say. He said, &#147;Well, Bill, you&#146;ve got your job to do, and I&#146;ve got mine.&#148; I thought that that was an interesting indication of behaviour, in a way, although that perhaps contradicts my point about the Whip system.</p>

To repeat what I said earlier, I am concerned about the fact that, these days, so little time is available in the House of Commons, because Standing Orders, which are codified rules, have been imposed on the workings of the House. That has enabled the Whip system to eliminate debate and scrutiny, as a result of which it becomes ever more important for the House of Lords to perform the excellent function that it so often does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07011772000761">It is hardly surprising that, according to the evidence in the report, there has been an increase in the number of occasions on which the House of Lords, which is not entirely hereditary, has rebelled against what has been going on in the Commons, irrespective of the number of people appointed by the Prime Minister to the other House. The Lords know that if they do not examine the issues, they might not be examined at all, and that is a very good reason for the continued existence of the House of Lords.</p>

However, that must be done without prejudice to the question, &#147;What is a manifesto?&#148; On the manner in which conventions are meant to operate, one aspect of the report that has intrigued, puzzled and slightly worried me is the reaffirmation of the fact that the House of Lords should be expected to put through a manifesto Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07011772000763">I see that there are references in the report to the fact that there should not be wrecking amendments. I have to admit to having tabled more than my reasonable share of wrecking amendments over the past 23 years, but I did so&#151;some will doubt this&#151;not just to be difficult or awkward, but because there were important questions that needed to be debated. On 10 May last year, in another debate on these same matters, I simply insisted, with 10 other hon. Friends and hon. Members, that the motion be put to a vote. In fact, it turned out that 20 people voted no in the deferred Division. We did so because we disagreed, at that time, with the way in which the terms of reference had been devised.</p>

That is what the issue of conventions between the two Houses is all about. In due course, the House of Lords is more than likely to be turned into a hybrid Chamber, in which between 70 and 80 per cent. of Members are elected. I hear what other hon.

does not prevent or in any way inhibit the necessity of maintaining the conventions, because although the Salisbury reasons for the conventions will have gone, others are inherent in the existence of two Houses, one of which has to revise, and the other of which has to govern. We are therefore right to be concerned about the nature of those conventions. There is a wonderful expression in &#147;Through the Looking Glass&#148;:</p>
<a name="70117-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="07011772000834"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When I use a word...it means just what I choose it to mean...The question is...which is to be master&#151;that&#146;s all.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07011772000765">That consideration applies to conventions, which mean what we choose them to mean. It is a question, too, of who is to be master, but the question of behaviour is at the heart of the matter. In my previous career, I looked at the conventions a great deal, and I was deeply impressed by the work of Geoffrey Marshall, who sadly died a few years ago. I had many discussions with him and he offered an excellent summary of conventions as</p>
<a name="70117-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="07011772000766"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;non-legal rules of constitutional behaviour&#148;.</p>

<a name="70117-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="07011772000835"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;rules of constitutional behaviour which are considered to be binding by and upon those who operate the Constitution but which are not enforced by the law courts...nor by the presiding officers in the Houses of Parliament.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07011772000768">That is an interesting addition to the definition, which ultimately depends on the way in which we approach the relationship between elected representatives and the strict rules that apply to the conduct of our affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07011772000769">One of the most intriguing and worrying aspects of the proposals is highlighted by paragraph 9 of the Government&#146;s response. It refers to paragraph 61 of the report by the Joint Committee, which states:</p>
<a name="70117-0018.htm_brev4"><a name="07011772000836"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the weight of evidence...should any firm proposals come forward to change the composition of the House of Lords, the conventions between the Houses would have to be examined again.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07011772000770">That is obviously the case, and it raises the question of the nature of conventions. As has been said, a convention cannot exist until it is well established. Rules and behaviour are a matter of habit, practice and tradition, and it is extraordinary that the Government should suggest that</p>
<a name="70117-0018.htm_brev5"><a name="07011772000837"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;further reform should not alter the current role of the Lords as a revising chamber, and that the conventions governing its relationship with the Commons are fit for that purpose.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07011772000771">I understand what they are trying to say, but the change in the nature of the House of Lords is bound to have an impact on the application of the conventions. As I have tried to point out, the proposal to change the Lords to a semi-elected Chamber with different functions would not in itself prevent the conventions from continuing to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07011772000772">It was odd that the Joint Committee should say that neither House of Parliament regularly rejects secondary legislation. It states, however, that</p>

the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which covers not just burdens on business, but a vast range of departmental activities, it is clear that given the huge sphere within which the Act will operate, and the open-ended nature of its provisions, those orders and statutory instruments must be capable of amendment.</p>

That was endorsed by a further vote by my party in the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07011772000776">That is an anchor and a huge opportunity. After all, we are on record as saying that we want to change the social chapter, for example, and I can think of many other examples among the huge raft of legislation emanating from the European Community and the European Union. The European Constitution has effectively gone for the time being, although Mrs. Merkel is re-introducing it today. My comments do not in any way absolve the Leader of the House of my train fare to Blackburn, in the light of what he said earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07011772000777">The necessity for us to assert the supremacy of this House lies at the heart of the relationship between ourselves and the electorate, and derives from it. It is also a matter of deep importance in the relationship between the two Houses. In relation to European legislation or devolved legislation or, for example, in relation to the question of Scottish independence, which is being raised by the Scottish nationalists, in the arrangements in the Scotland Act 1998 the question arises whether legislation should be passed in this House, as I suggested in a letter in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday, to provide for a referendum of the whole of the United Kingdom with respect to the future relationship between ourselves, Scotland and the Scottish Parliament, and also in respect of Wales and our membership of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07011772000778">With reference to the relationship between the two Houses, the question whether the legislation that will be needed is capable of being overridden by using the reserve powers of Westminster as against the Scottish Parliament to legislate could turn out to be extremely contentious. A matter of such huge constitutional importance could turn into a battleground not about a matter as irrelevant as the Hunting Act 2004, important as it was from a social and a countryside point of view, but about whether the Scottish nationalists, if they took control of the Scottish Parliament, could hold a referendum in Scotland as a devolved power. An issue of such major constitutional importance could have implications for the relationship between this House and the House of Lords. That would bring into high profile the conventions that apply between the two Houses. The issues raised in the report are of great interest. I am glad that the Committee came up with so many useful recommendations. I hesitate to say that I approve of all  <br>

of them, because some matters remain unconsidered and will develop further in future. On the whole, this is not an occasion when one would feel it necessary to divide the House, but there were important reasons for doing so when the process began.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07011772000779">In the past, it has always been understood as a matter of convention that if the House of Lords did not ultimately accept a subordinate role when confronted with the determined will of the House of Commons, it knew that its remaining legislative powers would be cut back still further. That is why it has backed off on so many occasions when ping-pong has gone on, sometimes on extremely important matters. Ultimately, that gives rise to the question of the way in which the Parliament Acts operate. Several Members who spoke about that legislation perhaps overlooked the fact that it is not entrenched. People think that it is more entrenched than it really is. It was born out of a massive row in 1911&#151;but we have had massive rows for the past 400 years. Both Houses operate best when they are acting on the basis of mutually understood good behaviour as between one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07011772000780">That pragmatic self-restraint could be put under a great deal of stress in future, particularly if there is to be an elected, or largely elected, House of Lords, which I happen to think would be a good thing. If we get the balance between the functions of the two Houses right, and if we have a different electoral cycle and system, we can avoid clashes, but we cannot avoid the necessity of maintaining the conventions in a way that prevents the unnecessary stress and tension that could otherwise arise. I look forward to hearing what the Leader of the House says by way of conclusion.</p>

He managed to do that until relatively late in the evening, but then I am afraid that he faulted himself and fell back into the condition that used to drive the Conservative Whips completely demented during the latter years of the Major Government. I am sure that the noble Lords Goodlad and Ryder will be delighted to hear his exoneration of the Whips&#146; behaviour when they were seeking metaphorically to break his legs, but I remember that the atmosphere at the time was not quite as benign.

That enables me to repeat my opening comments that the report is important and a tribute to the work of all members of the Joint Committee, some of whom were present throughout the debate. I thank them for their work and the wisdom reflected in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70117-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07011777000009">It was ungraciously suggested that the Government had decided to set up a committee on conventions because we wished somehow to restrain the powers of the other place. Had that been the case, I would have owned up to it, but it was not. The provenance of the Joint Committee&#151;the second Cunningham committee&#151;was our manifesto commitment to set up such a committee to establish a baseline and, if possible, an understanding, which has been achieved, between parties at both ends of the building about what the current conventions mean, thus forming a foundation for further discussions on the reform of the other place, to which all three parties are committed.</p>

Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and two of her colleagues sit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07011777000012">I believe that hon. Members will endorse the description and analysis of the conventions. However, as the Joint Committee said, the report describes the conventions as they apply today, with the existing composition of the House of Lords. It was easy to anticipate that most of today&#146;s debate would turn on whether the conventions could remain in force in a reformed second Chamber with an elected element, and whether they would survive a significant change in composition. Opinions will differ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07011777000013">I fully understand, for the reasons that the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) outlined, that some people take the view that the second Chamber should be wholly appointed. They believe that for a variety of reasons, but one is apprehension about what would happen to the powers of this place if there were an elected element in the other place. I have considered the matter and shifted my position. I have been informed by the reports of four previous Committees, including the royal commission, which have considered the matter in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07011777000014">My answer is this: first of all, I believe that if there is a reformed second Chamber&#151;and provided that it is not a replica or rival to this Chamber&#151;it is perfectly compatible with the widely accepted need in our system for a strong Executive.

member of a strong Executive for nearly 10 years and I opposed a strong Executive for 18 years previously. My view has not changed&#151;if there is a strong Executive, one also needs a strong Parliament. The purpose of that strong Parliament is not to cause Executive gridlock, but to ensure that Executive decisions are of a high quality and based on the right judgments and considerations and to hold individual Ministers, for example Home Secretaries and Foreign Secretaries, to account for the considerable powers that they exercise on behalf of this place and the people of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07011777000015">To pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)&#151;originally in his Select Committee&#146;s report on the future of the House of Lords&#151;we are not playing a zero-sum game between having a strong Executive and having a strong Parliament, provided that the difference in functions is understood. For sure, if Parliament ends up seeking to be an Executive by another name, there will of course be gridlock, but if there is an understanding about the balancing functions, there is no reason why there should be gridlock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07011777000016">The second issue is whether an elected element in the other place is compatible with what are regarded&#151;I believe that we are about to endorse them&#151;as the essential aspects of the primacy of this House, as expressed by the Parliament Acts, the conventions on finance, Supply and taxation, and by the other conventions set out in the report that put a gloss, for example, on the nuclear option of the Parliament Acts and enable these Chambers to function. Again, my answer is in the affirmative.</p>

The Wakeham report stated clearly in its second recommendation, which I read out in response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), firmly and explicitly that the House of Commons was the &#147;principal political forum&#148; and should have &#147;the final say&#148; in respect of all major public policy issues, including those expressed in the form of proposed legislation. The Public Administration Committee said:</p>
<a name="70117-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="07011777000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is no proposal for any major change to the role and functions of the House of Lords.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07011777000018">Significantly, the first report of the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform, which was also chaired by my noble Friend Lord Cunningham, strongly supported the continuation of the existing conventions. The terms of reference were different, so there was no need for a paragraph 61. The report stated:</p>
<a name="70117-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="07011777000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We envisage a continuation of the present role of the House of Lords, and of the existing conventions governing its relation with the House of Commons.

 If we were establishing a replica Chamber, my right hon. Friend&#146;s fears would be justified. They happen to be my fears, too, and those of anyone else who has ever thought about this matter. If we moved from the all-appointed Chamber that we have today to one in which all the Members were elected on the same day and all had constituencies, the present primacy of the House of Commons would not have a prayer. Everyone understands that; we would have two Houses of Commons. My right hon. Friend is right in that regard. However, that is not a proposition that anyone has seriously put before the House. Everyone accepts that we must avoid allowing the other place to become a replica of the House of Commons, and all the practical proposals have sought to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07011777000022">The royal commission looked at the matter in some detail, and received some mocking when it said in answer to one questioner that the proposals for an elected element in the other place would mean that those elected there would probably be elected by a different electoral system, and would certainly be elected for a much longer period than we are. There would also be restrictions on whether they could stand again for election to the other place. All those measures were designed to ensure that it was understood from the beginning that their role in the second Chamber was a different one, and that they were not there to replicate the House of Commons. Up to now, that view has all been broadly agreed and reflected in all the reports.</p>

In paragraph 34, the Clerk of the Parliaments said that</p>

There is the work done at Kyoto, and the fact that we are on track to meet the Kyoto targets for cutting emissions; there is the work that we have led on carbon trading schemes; and there is the leadership that the Government have shown on the world stage. When it comes to dealing with the effects of climate change, however, the Government&#146;s record is rather more mixed.

but I want to focus on the effects in the United Kingdom, which can be crudely divided into winter and summer effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para30"><a name="07011777000055">Winter effects include coastal erosion, with higher tides and increasing water levels as the temperature of the water rises, and coastal and inland flooding. The diameters of storm water drains are insufficient and larger diameters will be needed. The same applies to drainpipes on buildings. There is disruption to logistics in the supply chain if transport is interfered with, for example by flooding. Similarly and more prosaically, there is the problem of rats. We have more rats now because winters are less cold and they do not die off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para31"><a name="07011777000056">As for the summer effects, they include health effects such as an increased incidence of heatstroke and probably of skin cancers. The asthma season is getting longer and tropical diseases such as malaria are starting to come into southern England. Alien predator species are also coming in, there are effects on wildlife and the crops that we grow, and there is a need for reservoirs in the summer. We have had a drought in the south-east since 2004, and it is almost a year-round drought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para32"><a name="07011777000057">One subject that straddles the two crude sides of the equation that I have mentioned&#151;the winter and the summer&#151;is the issue of building regulations. We need to do more in respect of water efficiency and shade because of droughts in the summer. We need to do more in terms of insulation to cut emissions, too. There must also be improvements such as better waterproofing and drainpipes, because of heavier rainfall in the winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70117-0019.htm_para33"><a name="07011777000058">What are bodies other than the Government doing? Encouraging things are being done in the United Kingdom. Around the country, the Wildlife Trust is already dealing with the challenge. Its recent report, &#147;A Living Landscape&#148;, highlights the importance of landscape scale and gives examples of work being done. The black country urban park takes that approach in the urban area that the Minister and I represent&#151;as do you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country has been working with the four local authorities in the area to identify and improve open spaces and to develop corridors for wildlife with rivers and canals. The Smestow valley in my constituency is one such focus. As well as improving the wildlife value of the black country, that work should help to build and repair local communities and bring economic and social and health benefits to the people who live there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07011777000061">The Association of British Insurers has done excellent work on adapting to the effects of climate change. Its &#147;Financial risks of climate change&#148; document was published in 2005; its &#147;A future for the floodplains&#148; was published last July; and it also published &#147;Coastal flood risk&#151;thinking for tomorrow, acting today&#148; last November, which is only two months ago.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07011777000064">That total has increased a lot in the past four years. It recommends that Government spending on flood defences needs to increase by 10 per cent. a year to &#163;750 million by 2011. It is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07011777000065">The Environment Agency has produced a wonderful briefing, which it sent to me in preparation for the debate, on the need to adapt to the unavoidable consequences of climate change. It talks about addressing flash flooding, winter flooding, winter storms and sea level rise, threats to water supply, hot summers and threats to biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07011777000066">Last March, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs produced a document, &#147;Climate Change the UK programme 2006&#148;&#151;which is a good start. Last month, the Department for Communities and Local Government produced a consultation document entitled, &#147;Planning Policy Statement: Planning and Climate Change, Supplement to Planning Policy Statement 1&#148;. Those documents are steps forward, as is the Stern report, of course, which was published last autumn. But what worries me in particular about them is that although the DEFRA document, for example, talks about adapting to and dealing with the effects of climate change, less than  10 per cent. of it deals with that aspect of climate change. More than 90 per cent. of it deals with the causes&#151;with emissions. That balance is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07011777000067">There is a similar situation with the DCLG consultation document, which states:</p>

The PPS also provides guidance on how the planning regime should address the climate change now accepted as inevitable, such as sea level rise and higher temperatures (adaptation).&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07011777000068">But again, only a fairly small proportion of that document actually deals with effects and adaptation. The same is true of the Stern report. From memory, only about 40 of its 700-odd pages deal with adaptation. We have got the balance wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07011777000069">I salute the work of the Minister, who was in Great Yarmouth on Monday introducing an initiative to  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07011777000070">The sadness is that although we have known about this problem for a long time, many of these documents still talk about the research that needs to be done. Of course research is important, but I wish that we had started on it much more comprehensively and a longer time ago. Under DEFRA, we have the UK climate impacts programme, but my suspicion is that it is rather under-resourced. It consists of 15 scientists based at Oxford, and from what I have seen they are doing good work, but I suggest to the Minister that in order to deal with adaptation&#151;the effects of climate change, which are already taking place in this country&#151;that programme, or something very like it, needs to be expanded greatly now, instead of waiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07011777000071">I have a series of questions for the Minister, based on the proposals outlined in last spring&#146;s DEFRA document entitled, &#147;Climate Change: the UK Programme 2006&#148;. I quite understand that he might not be able to answer all of them tonight. By what date will the adaptation policy framework be published? Has the review and assessment of existing and new policies for their vulnerability to climate change impacts, and their contribution to adaptation, been completed and published? If not, when will it be published? Has the study of the potential role of regulation and standards in accelerating action to adapt, in order to inform future development of the adaptation policy framework, been initiated? If so, what is the expected publication date? If it has not been initiated, by what date will it be? What was the funding of the UK climate impact programme in each of the past five years, and what is the anticipated funding for each of the following three years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07011777000072">I should be grateful if the Minister said whether the study of the business costs and benefits of adapting to climate change has been initiated. If so, what is the expected publication date? If it has not been initiated, by what date will it be? By what date will the UK Biodiversity Partnership publish its practical guidance? By what date will the revised guidance statement on the role of spatial planning be published, if it is not the document to which I have already referred? By what date will the revised guidance on implementing flood and coastal erosion risk management measures be published? By what date will the results of collaborative research on the effects of climate change on UK priority species be published? By what date will the long-term monitoring network on the effects of climate change on UK priority species be published? By what date will the review of current activities to assess the impact of climate change on the marine environment be published?

It presents projected snapshots of Britain in 2020, 2050 and 2080. By 2050, average temperatures could have risen by 2.5C, and by 2080 by 4C. That is a massive change.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) on securing this Adjournment debate on adapting to the effects of climate change. I am grateful to him for raising this subject, because I agree that it is one about which we do not speak often enough. I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are in no way complacent about the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07011777000076">On the general point that my hon. Friend made about the number of pages devoted to adaptation, as opposed to mitigation, in the Stern report or the climate change programme review, I would point out that some of the most complex mathematical proofs are elegantly short. Some of the best books are not the lengthiest. Similarly, one cannot judge the quality of a speech by its length.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07011777000077">We all know and understand why it is vital to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. The science is increasingly widely accepted. Even countries that have been sceptical about climate change are starting to listen. In the United States, for the first time ever, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration is now saying that greenhouse gas increases are causing climate change&#151;a marked change from just a year or two ago. The publication of the EU&#146;s climate change and energy package last Wednesday shows how effective the UK&#146;s leadership has been in getting action to cut emissions across Europe. But tackling climate change requires more than just mitigation, as my hon. Friend has rightly argued. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is vital to ensure that we avoid future dangerous climate change, but we also need to adapt to the unavoidable impacts caused by past emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07011777000078">Adaptation does not signal a failure in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. Carbon stays in the system for around 100 years, and because of inertia in the climate system, the warming effects peak about 40 years after emission. So the climate change that we are experiencing now is caused by our past emissions. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped completely tomorrow, a certain amount of further climate change is inevitable. So we need to adapt to the impacts that we are already seeing, and those that we expect to see in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07011777000079">I do not propose to recount the evidence in detail, but impacts such as the 35,000 excess deaths across Europe during the 2003 heat wave, and the &#163;6 billion worth of insurance claims for flood and storm damage between 1998 and 2003 here in the UK, could become more severe and more commonplace in the future. Certainly, the weather over the past few weeks has not been what any of us expect in January. We may not have been sunbathing as they were in New York, but last night I saw people sitting out on the Terrace of the House of Commons in what should be one of the coldest months of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07011777000080">My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West rightly pointed out that last year Sir Nick Stern set out the challenges that we face. Adaptation can be complex, and there are many constraints that we need to overcome. In particular, we need to deal with uncertainty about how our climate will change and what level of risk we need to plan for. At the same time, however, Stern also argues that in many cases adaptation options will provide benefits in excess of the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07011777000081">Early action to deal with the impacts of climate change will reduce damage to the environment, property and quality of life. A study by the Association of British Insurers showed that for new developments in east London, proactive measures to prepare for climate change could reduce the annual costs of flooding by almost 80 to 90 per cent., a saving of almost &#163;1 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07011777000082">Adaptation can also provide benefits that go beyond those relating to climate change. For instance, incorporating green space in urban environments helps keep surrounding buildings cooler, improves water management, supports biodiversity, provides local recreation facilities and helps foster sustainable communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07011777000083">My honourable Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West has said on more than one occasion that we were not doing enough to deal with the impacts of climate change in the UK. He is right: we are not. Despite all the available information and evidence, only 10 per cent. of FTSE 100 companies say that they are taking into account the impacts of climate change when looking at their risk management strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07011777000084">The construction industry could be one of the sectors hardest hit by climate change, but it also has the opportunity to provide key wins on adaptation. However, more than 40 per cent. of companies expressed little or no concern about their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para24"><a name="07011777000085">We can&#151;and we need to&#151;do much more to ensure that the UK adapts to climate change successfully. Our objective must be to ensure that the UK is well adapted, in both the business and the household sector, and in government. However, it is not just a Government responsibility, it is a national responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07011777000086">Everyone needs to factor climate change into their risk-management and decision-making frameworks.

However, although we can and must do more, it is important to recognise what we have achieved already, both at home and internationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07011777000087">The UK is a world leader in impacts and adaptation work. Our climate impacts programme, UKCIP, will celebrate its 10th anniversary this year. It was set up by the then Department of the Environment in 1997, with just two people to co-ordinate impacts research. Now, it has a staff of 16 who work with a wide variety of organisations, including local authorities, planners, financial institutions, schools and public sector bodies to develop tools and methods to implement adaptation strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para27"><a name="07011777000088">Well-adapted buildings must be a priority. One example is Redhill school in Worcester, not far from my constituency, or from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. By using UKCIP&#146;s adaptation wizard, the architect and the local council have designed a building that includes a number of adaptation features, including sustainable drainage, a green roof to help reduce run-off and cool the classrooms, and overhanging eaves and canopies to prevent the school from overheating in the hotter summers that we are expecting, and are already experiencing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para28"><a name="07011777000089">Last week I met the co-ordinators of the regional climate change partnerships. They work with people from a wide variety of local sectors, raising awareness of adaptation and building capacity to implement adaptation strategies. They have set up a number of excellent projects. I mentioned the example of Redhill school, but another is the urban redevelopment project at Bilston, a borough represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. It is a classic example of what can be done. Climate change considerations were built into the project from the start, keeping extra costs down and ensuring better protection against increased rainfall and good environmental benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para29"><a name="07011777000090">The south-west partnership is working with the tourist industry to develop an adaptation action pack. The London partnership has published a checklist for development, which gives developers guidance about how to minimise climate change impacts when designing buildings. Such guidance is being used more and more widely across the UK. I could list many other excellent examples of the work of those partnerships, supported by UKCIP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para30"><a name="07011777000091">I want to highlight local government, which is of key importance. Local authorities are in a prime position to deliver adaptation on the ground. They manage a range of services and have responsibilities for a number of the functions that are being affected by our changing climate&#151;for example, flooding, social services, housing, the environment and biodiversity. A number of local authorities are leading the way and we are working with them to raise awareness of adaptation among others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para31"><a name="07011777000092">More than 200 local authorities have now signed the Nottingham declaration, committing them to take action on both mitigation and adaptation. To support their work, UKCIP, the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust have developed a web-based tool to guide local authorities through the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para33"><a name="07011777000094">Our work is not limited to the United Kingdom. We are leading the way overseas, too. We have developed bilateral programmes with China and India to support them in assessing the impacts of climate change. We are also heavily involved in international negotiations under the UN framework convention on climate change, which produced successful agreement of the Nairobi adaptation work plan in November 2006 at the climate change conference in Kenya. That five-year programme of work will assist all parties, in particular in developing countries, to improve their understanding and assessment of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, and to make more informed decisions on practical adaptation actions and measures, which will allow them to respond to climate change on a sound and planned scientific, technical and socio-economic basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para34"><a name="07011777000095">Meanwhile, the Department for International Development has ensured that its development projects are resilient to projected climate change. Its country action plans take climate change into account and it works with Governments to make climate change a real consideration in planning policy. Again, that echoes the approach that we are taking at home: adaptation must not be seen as a stand-alone policy, but as something that must be taken into account in all sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70117-0020.htm_para35"><a name="07011777000096">I want to say something about our work on phase 2 of the adaptation policy framework for the UK. As I have already said, our phase 1 consultation showed that there is much activity on the ground, but we need a national framework to give a strategic and coherent vision of what a well-adapted UK should look like. I realise that the Government need to provide strong leadership and clear direction. In phase 2, we are  <br>

drawing up a cross-Government framework, which will identify priority areas for action, where Departments can work more closely together to ensure that effective action is taken. It will define Government roles and responsibilities, encourage each Department to draw up its own assessment of climate change impacts and ensure that the Government put adaptation into the mainstream across all their work. It is my intention that the framework will be published at the end of this year.</p>

For the UK successfully to adapt to climate change, Government action alone is not enough. All decision makers&#151;in the public and private sectors, at national and local level&#151;need to take climate change into account on a daily basis and to plan for the adaptation work that will be needed for the future.</p>

Climate change is already happening, and we all need to take responsibility for dealing with the changes. Of course, we want action on mitigation so that we can lessen the future impact, but there is absolutely no doubt that winning the battle against climate change requires concerted effort both on mitigation and adaptation. Yes, we have to stop the rise in greenhouse gases, but we also have to face the reality of a climate that is changing and ensure that we are equipped to deal with it.</p>

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West on securing a debate on an issue of key importance to all our futures. He put a number of detailed questions about the climate change programme review. Given the limited time for the debate, I shall write to him about those, but I want to assure him again that the Government are not complacent and that we are committed&#151;</p>
