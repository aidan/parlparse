 I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Given that the outcome of the Poznan conference represents a watering down of the commitment by European countries to prevent global warming or contributions to it from CO2 and yet the impact of any global warming&#151;we can see this even if we are not climate alarmist, which I am certainly not&#151;will fall most severely on the poorest countries, which have contributed least to the problem, does that not mean that our obligation to help them to adapt to change is increased?

 I agree with much of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis, but not all of it. I do not think that Poznan represents a watering down of Europe&#146;s commitment. Indeed, the 2020 package agreed by Europe has helped to encourage a willingness among some of the larger developing nations, and indeed allies in other OECD countries, to negotiate seriously in the run-up to Copenhagen. The adaptation fund is just one part of the response that we need to help developing countries. I agree with him that more is needed, which is one of the reasons why, along with a number of other countries, we have commissioned a much broader piece of work in order to understand just how much additional finance, whether it be from the private or public sector, is necessary to help developing countries to adapt.</p>

Does the Minister agree that programmes such as using hydrogen fuel cells for microgeneration are important for developing local projects in areas where there is no access to electricity in other forms?

I recognise the particular expertise in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency on the development of new renewable technologies. I say to him, however, that fuel cells are some way off providing a more immediate solution to developing countries, and there are a range of other renewable technologies that we can help developing countries to deploy.

 I do not share the doom-laden scenario that the hon. Gentleman has peddled. I think that significant progress was made at Poznan. When the talks were launched in Bali 12 months ago everyone was certain that it would be at least two years before a deal was reached on climate change, but we have seen some of the key building blocks for tackling its impact in developing countries begin to be put in place, such as the adaptation fund that I mentioned earlier and action to tackle deforestation. The Secretary of State for International Development and the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change have announced a &#163;100 million contribution to help tackle deforestation and to help with taking a series of additional steps in that regard.

 As is so often the case, the right hon. Gentleman brings great authority to his observation on the regional consequences of the crisis that is contemporary Zimbabwe. It is the case that Robert Mugabe has repeatedly sought to portray this as some kind of conspiracy of neo-colonialism, when nothing could be further from the truth. The responsibility for the grotesque misrule of Zimbabwe rests squarely at the door of Robert Mugabe and those in his Government. We in the international community are clear that the strongest voices that can be raised for change are those of the people of Zimbabwe in alliance with regional partners. The cholera outbreak alone gives credence to the claim that if this issue is not addressed the regional consequences will be dire, and that is why we have been working so closely to encourage South Africa to speak up, as well as other regional partners, such as Botswana and other neighbours of Zimbabwe.

The possibility of a negotiated way forward was established in September, but tragically it appears once again as if ZANU-PF and Mugabe have rejected that way forward for their country. We continue to talk to regional partners and those within Zimbabwe who have the best interests of the people of Zimbabwe at heart, but we also have contingency plans in place so that if there is a credible prospect of recovery, we and other members of the international community will assist in that endeavour.</p>

 I think that there are two responses that we should have to the very difficult economic circumstances. The first is not to talk down confidence and not to talk down the economy. The second is to ensure that as well as interest rate cuts we have a fiscal boost to the economy. Since we are talking about retail, that is why we are taking forward a cut in VAT and we urge the right hon. Gentleman to vote for it. That is why we are bringing forward extra cash help for pensioners from the beginning of next year. That is why we are bringing forward extra child benefit, to put more money in people&#146;s pockets, and why we will have a tax rebate to help 22 million people. We take action while all the Conservatives do is carp and criticise. For the right hon. Gentleman to face these big economic circumstances and say, &#147;It is only down to interest rate cuts and we would put no extra money in the economy&#148; would make a difficult circumstance a disaster.</p>

 Several right hon. and hon. Members have raised with me the matter of the search of a Member&#146;s office. The House has recently come to a decision that the matter should be considered by a specially appointed Committee. The House has also determined that the Committee must not in any way prejudice any police inquiry or any potential criminal proceedings. There is, therefore, not yet a basis on which to nominate that Committee, since consideration of criminal proceedings is still under way.</p>

 With permission, I shall make a statement on the Government&#146;s response to Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s final report on the floods of summer 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08121768000159">Last weekend&#146;s flooding in the south-west, in which two people sadly died, reminds us of the ever-present risk that we face, and of the importance of Sir Michael&#146;s comprehensive and impressive report. In his 92 recommendations published in June, Sir Michael identified a need to clarify who is responsible for what; to ensure that the public have all the information and guidance they need; to work with essential services to assess risk and protect critical infrastructure; to have a clear recovery plan right from the start of any major emergency; and to establish the right legislative framework to tackle flooding. I can tell the House that the Government&#146;s action plan being published today supports changes in response to all his recommendations, but before setting out those changes I want to acknowledge the continuing effects of the flooding, as a second Christmas approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08121768000160">The fact that most people are now back home, thanks to a great deal of hard work, will be of little comfort to those families who are still out of their homes, or who are living upstairs in them. Our thoughts are with them, and their plight reminds us of the toll that flooding takes not just on people&#146;s lives, but on their emotions, and just how difficult it can be to get things going again. That is why, working with local authorities and the insurance industry, we will continue to do all we can to help. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, to whom I pay tribute for the extraordinary amount of work that he has done to help people affected, announced last month further help for those families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08121768000161">We have taken action in the 18 months since the 2007 floods. The Environment Agency has spent &#163;5 million on repairing defences that were damaged. Forty-nine flood defence schemes have been completed, protecting 37,000 homes, from Selby in Yorkshire to St. Ives in Cornwall and from West Bridgford in Nottingham to Worcester and Hexham, the town whose newly built defences successfully protected it from significant flooding in September this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08121768000162">Since summer 2007, more than 78,000 more people have registered with the Environment Agency&#146;s telephone flood warning system; the total is now 280,000. All local resilience forums have been briefed on critical national infrastructure in their areas, and we have brought forward to 2009-10 &#163;20 million of flood defence spending. That will mean an earlier start on those schemes, which, when completed, will protect more than 27,000 homes from flooding and coastal erosion. In total, our &#163;2.15 billion investment in flood defence over the three years to 2010-11 will protect an additional 145,000 homes across England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08121768000163">The further steps that I am announcing today draw both on the &#163;34.5 million that I set aside to implement Sir Michael&#146;s report and on funding from other existing budgets. We are creating a new national flood forecasting centre, bringing together staff from the Environment Agency and the Met Office. That will start operating in  <br>

April and will improve our ability to respond quickly, by providing better information and more detailed warnings directly to emergency responders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08121768000164">Having previously decided that the Environment Agency will take on a strategic overview for all forms of flooding, I am today announcing that local authorities will beresponsible for ensuring that arrangements are in place to assess and manage local flood risk from all sources, including surface water. In two-tier council areas, that responsibility will rest with county councils, but we will encourage them to work closely with districts, internal drainage boards and others. I am increasing funding to local authorities by &#163;15 million to allow authorities where the risk is greatest to take on that new role straight away. Part of that will be for the development of surface-water management plans. I can announce that the first six local areas that have successfully bid for the funds are Hull, Gloucestershire, Leeds, Warrington, Richmond upon Thames and West Berkshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08121768000167">In addition, I am establishing a &#163;5 million grant scheme, for which local authorities can bid to help people better protect their homes from the risk of flooding&#151;for example, through fitting flood boards and air-brick covers. That help will be available where it is not possible to provide protection through community-level defences. I am also providing funding to help the Environment Agency improve flood warnings, including moving to an opt-out system for ex-directory numbers. Furthermore, I am putting money into improving our flood rescue capability, so that we can make the best use of the skilled personnel and boats available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08121768000168">The national flood framework will help ensure that all the organisations involved in responding to floods, including those responsible for critical national infrastructure, understand&#151;and are fully prepared for&#151;what they have to do. An outline framework has already been published and the consultation that we are launching will enable us to complete the job. Meanwhile, organisations are already taking action to identify and protect infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08121768000169">On reservoir safety, we are doubling funding for inundation maps for all the country&#146;s larger reservoirs and we are providing support for local resilience forums to prepare reservoir emergency plans. We will be publishing a draft floods and water Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny in spring next year to deal with those of Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations, including clearer roles and responsibilities and strengthening reservoir safety, that require primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08121768000170">On Monday, I informed the House that we intend to transfer to water and sewerage companies private sewers and lateral drains that connect to the public system. That was welcomed by Sir Michael, and it will release many householders from a liability that they often do not know they have until something goes wrong and they face a hefty bill to sort it out. The transfer will take place from April 2011. Finally, we are establishing a Cabinet Committee to oversee work on flooding. Sir Michael will continue to be involved in reviewing progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08121768000171">The House knows that we can never eliminate the risk of flooding, particularly as climate change takes hold, but we are all determined to learn the lessons from what has happened and to be better prepared in future. All of us&#151;the Government, local authorities, emergency and other services, local communities and individuals&#151;must  <br>

take flood risk seriously. This report, and the steps that we are taking, will help us to do so and I commend them to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="08121768000172"><a name="81217-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="08121768001313"><b>Mr. Peter Ainsworth (East Surrey) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and repeat my thanks to Sir Michael Pitt and his team for the excellent work that they have done. I also commend the work of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), who has made a useful contribution on these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08121768000173">The Secretary of State is entirely right to acknowledge the human cost of flooding. I am sure that the whole House will wish to send condolences to the family and friends of those two people who tragically lost their lives over the weekend. Anyone who has met people whose homes and businesses have been destroyed by floods knows only too well that there is often a lasting, less visible, but none the less real, emotional impact on top of the physical disruption that people suffer. Some things, such as personal possessions, simply cannot be replaced by insurance. Can the Secretary of State confirm that hundreds of people are facing a second Christmas out of their homes as a result of the floods of 2007? Why have the Government not published monthly summaries of the number of households displaced, as Pitt recommended? Is it because they are embarrassed about the rate of progress?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08121768000174">There are, of course, aspects of this statement which we welcome, particularly the establishment of the national flood forecasting centre, which seems an eminently sensible way to proceed. I cannot help but observe, however, that progress in this area is glacially slow. After three years of announcements and statements of good intentions, our country is still acutely vulnerable to flood risk. The number of homes at risk from flooding has increased by 20 per cent. in the space of a few years. Some 43 per cent. of flood defence projects have been delayed, and more than half are not in their target condition. Additionally, 6 per cent. of hospitals, 15 per cent. of ambulance and fire stations and 15 per cent. of power stations are at risk from flooding. When will the natural hazards team, which is responsible for identifying risks to national infrastructure, complete its assessment? Is it not extraordinary in view of the risks involved that that work has not already been done?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08121768000175">I have to say that the Government&#146;s approach to this issue has been lackadaisical. In 2005, the Government knew that there was a problem and promised to put it right. Then they announced that the Environment Agency needed to have the strategic overview of flooding. Today it seems that local authorities will be made responsible. There is still uncertainty about who is in charge. We know the gravity of the risk, and have a wealth of recommendations on how to move forward. Pitt called for strong national leadership if his recommendations were to be implemented. Since when was dithering a feature of strong national leadership?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08121768000176">Can the Secretary of State confirm that all of Pitt&#146;s urgent recommendations have been implemented? Does he agree that his statement is no substitute for legislation? The Pitt report called for a &#147;rapid implementation&#148; of the floods and water Bill. Will he confirm that, as a result of his announcement today, there is no real chance that the floods and water Bill will make it on to the statute books before the next general election?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08121768000177">There is a sense that the Government are shunting the problem away, beyond the next election, on to local authorities. I note, however, that the Secretary of State has announced additional funding for local authorities, which must be welcome. Can he confirm where that money is coming from? Climate change will only increase the frequency and severity of flooding. As the Stern review pointed out:</p>
<a name="81217-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08121768001151"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Adaptation is the only response available for the impacts that will occur over the next several decades before mitigation measures can have an effect.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08121768000178">My chief concern today is the slow progress that the Government are making in their response to these urgent issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08121768000179">Finally, some 2.3 million homes are at risk of flooding. It is essential that we do not add to that number, so will the Secretary of State join me in calling for a clear presumption against building on floodplains?</p>

<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="08121768000180"><a name="81217-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="08121768001314"><b>Hilary Benn:</b>
 I echo the words that the hon. Gentleman expressed about the impact on individuals and businesses. When flooding happens, it is devastating. I can tell him that about 1,000 households are either out of their homes or living upstairs, and of those, 118 are living in caravans. The number is coming down by about 100 a week. We make an assessment every two months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08121768000181">I fundamentally disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s assessment of what has happened in the past 18 months. Protecting 37,000 homes since summer 2007 cannot, under any measure, be described as &#147;glacially slow&#148; progress. As he is pressing for faster progress and given that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition have indicated that from 2010-11 they will not be committed to the Government&#146;s spending plans, a lot of people would like to know&#151;he might not be able to say today&#151;what their stance is on flood defence investment, because we are all waiting to hear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08121768000182">Next, there is no uncertainty, because the steps that I have announced today and the action that we have already taken are all about people getting on with the task in hand, without waiting for the floods and water Bill, which we will publish in draft form, as I have indicated. Saying, &#147;That&#146;s what you&#146;ve got to do,&#148; to the Environment Agency and, &#147;This is what you&#146;ve got to do to deal with the problem of surface water,&#148; to the six local authorities that will start the mapping in the areas that were affected is not about waiting to change the law to require that action; it is about getting on with the job now. Then we will look at the changes that are needed subsequently. The same applies to the mapping of the risk from reservoirs. We are getting on with the job. We are not waiting, but we will change the law as necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08121768000183">As I indicated to the House when I made my statement in the summer, we have made good progress on implementing the urgent recommendations. Incidentally, the latest figures for people out of their homes are from mid-November, so there will have been further progress and a reduction in the numbers since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08121768000184">The funding that I am making available is from funding that I set aside and which I told the House about in the summer for implementing Pitt&#146;s recommendations. As for not adding to the problem, I agree with the hon. Gentleman, which is why the Government have strengthened the planning guidance  <br>

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s commitment to ensuring that Gloucestershire is part of the pilot project on surface water. That will be welcomed by residents in Barton and Tredworth in my constituency, which were flooded at the weekend. May I also urge him to continue the work on flooding with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government? We know that removing Whaddon, which lies in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), from the regional spatial strategy, which is likely to be published in the coming days, will make a huge difference to surface water in Gloucester. That surface water has to go somewhere and at the moment it largely goes to that area in Whaddon.</p>

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the huge amount of work that he did, as did many hon. Members in all parts of the House, in the wake of the flooding. I remember the conversations that we had at the time. The whole purpose of the surface water management plans is to get all the people who have responsibility for the water&#151;where it goes and where it ends up&#151;to see how they can better deal with it when large amounts of rain fall and to ensure that it can be taken elsewhere. That means dealing with a legacy of 200 years of drains and culverts that were not designed for the kind of rainfall that we have seen and for the climate change that is coming&#151;the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) is right about that&#151;and planning who is going to do what as a result, and, at the same time, taking the right decisions on planning and providing places where the water can go when new developments are made. Designing sustainable drainage systems into development is a way of avoiding adding to the problem.</p>

May I commend Gloucestershire on the excellent booklet that has been published for residents? It is full of the most useful guidance and information. It is a model of its kind and I hope that other local authorities will follow it.</p>

the question why the Secretary of State has taken so long to come to the House to give us a statement on a report that called for immediate action six months ago. Many incidences of flooding could have been avoided, had there been clarity about who was responsible for flood risk management at different levels. How many people have been adversely affected in the six months since the report was published, during which time the Government have failed to act? How many households and businesses have suffered this year because of the Government&#146;s failure to implement the recommendations more quickly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08121768000191">Furthermore, recommendation 86 in the report proposed the immediate establishment of a Cabinet Committee. We welcome the announcement today that that is going to happen, but will the Secretary of State tell us whether he thinks that waiting six months constitutes immediate action? As Scotland already has its own Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill in progress, why is this House being offered only a draft Bill, with subsequent legislation some way off?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08121768000192">Will the Secretary of State tell the House how many of the 92 recommendations in the Pitt report he has already been able to implement? Will he expand on his plans for the establishment of a national flood forecasting centre? Will he also confirm that many instances of flooding this autumn have occurred because the lines of communication have still not been corrected? Is not that further evidence that the Government&#146;s casual approach to the implementation of the report has cost many people dear? Does he accept that even a small improvement in the lines of communication could make a huge difference to those on the front line? Even half an hour&#146;s advance warning of a serious flood risk could allow householders and businesses to take vital action to safeguard their property and protect themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08121768000193">Will the Secretary of State also comment on the backlog in flood relief works in many parts of the country? Can he give assurances to residents and businesses, such as those in the Windermere road area of Grange in my constituency, that the long-awaited flood relief scheme planned for their area will actually come into being in the near future? Does he agree that there is now a strong argument for front-loading investment in flood relief schemes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="81217-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08121768000194">Will the Secretary of State comment on the continuing granting of planning permission for building in high-risk areas, despite Pitt&#146;s recommendation for a strong presumption against such development, and will he now support a review of PPS25, to examine whether it is fit for purpose? Will he also take to task the insurance industry, which promised at the time of the floods that no one would go uninsured as a result of the flooding? Now that insurance policies are coming up for renewal, many insurers are refusing to cover flood risk. Will he also take action to ensure that speedy payments are made by insurance companies to householders and businesses?</p>

bit of what he said, but I must express sorrow that he did not seem to have listened to what I was saying or, more importantly, to have noticed what action we have been taking since the summer of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81217-0005.htm_para0"><a name="08121768000197">The hon. Gentleman raised a point about lines of communication in recent instances of flooding. If he, or any other hon. Member, has an example of something that did not go right or that they are worried about, will they draw them to my attention? I am determined that we should learn the lessons and try to get things right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81217-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08121768000198">On early warning, one thing that has happened is the piloting of the extreme rainfall alert service, which I did not have time to mention earlier because there are quite a lot of things that we have done. When the hon. Gentleman has a chance to read the action plan that I am publishing today, he will see the answer to his question on that point. I should like to give the House an example. On 5 September, the Met Office forecast thunder storms and heavy showers in the south-west, and it put out one of those alerts. We have subsequently heard from Cornwall county council that the alert enabled it to pre-deploy the fire service, which, as a result, was able to rescue someone from their car at a time when the flood waters were rising by 1 ft every 20 minutes. That is a practical example of the measures that we have put in place, helping the emergency services to do a better job of protecting the public in those circumstances.</p>

In the heart of my constituency is the Farnley balancing reservoir, but it cannot cope. Every time there is a deluge, it overwhelms the local Farnley beck, which then floods all the homes around.

That was a key finding in the Committee&#146;s report and in Sir Michael&#146;s inquiry. However, given that the weather events that led to the flooding that gave rise to Sir Michael&#146;s inquiry were of an unpredictable nature, how quickly will the remaining local authorities&#151;besides the six mentioned in the statement&#151;be able to take on those responsibilities?

In agreeing with Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations, we are saying clearly today that this is a responsibility for all of us, everywhere. All local authorities need to think about what they would do in such circumstances. During the summer, and subsequently, we saw the benefit of advance planning and of the emergency rescue services.

 I welcome the money provided for Leeds city council to draw up a surface water management plan. Will the Secretary of State use his considerable influence in our city to ensure that the Liberal-Conservative-controlled council speaks to people like me so that we can raise the issues affecting people living beside Kippax and Collingham becks, people in Methley living by the River Aire, and people in West Garforth? Will he assure me that he will use that power to ensure that they speak to me, and to other councillors?</p>

 The floods in the summer of 2007 affected four rivers in Chesterfield: the Rother, the Hipper, the Whitting and the Holmebrook. The Environment Agency moved quickly to draw up plans to prevent the worst two offenders, the Rother and the Hipper, from flooding again by introducing upriver catchment areas, but the Environment Agency has warned my constituents in the affected areas that it will be at least five to 10 years before Government money will be available to enable them to be built. Can the Secretary of State offer any hope of more urgent action, or is the Government&#146;s response to residents of areas such as Alma street in my constituency, and many others, that they should simply cross their fingers and hope that it does not rain for another 10 years, because otherwise they will be flooded again?</p>

 I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents who have suffered in the way that he has described. The Government&#146;s job is to ensure that we play our part by providing more funding for the Environment Agency for flood defence work, and that is exactly what we are doing. I think I had been in the job for about a week when I stood at this Dispatch Box and announced an increase of &#163;200 million over the three years to 20010-11. It is because we have been putting in more money that we have been able to protect an additional 37,000 homes since the summer of 2007, and 145,000 homes will be protected by the end of 2010-11. We all have a responsibility to ensure that we argue the case for further investment in flood defence, because that is the only way in which we shall be able to help the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents.</p>

 When homes and businesses are flooded, very often the first help comes from the fire and rescue services&#151;I speak from experience as the cellar of my constituency office was flooded last summer&#151;but I am told that the funding formula for the fire and rescue services does not include any flood work or the resources to do that work. The Secretary of State said in his statement that he was also putting money into improving our flood rescue capability. Does that mean that the fire and rescue services will now get real support for the work that they do, which is so valued during times of flooding?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the skill, expertise and, in some cases, bravery of our fire and rescue services in helping people when flooding strikes, and I am sure all Members would wish to applaud them for that. The fact is that a considerable number of fire and rescue services have built up their capability; they have bought boats and undertaken training, for example. The additional money I am now providing is to help ensure we make the best use of the assets, because there are quite a lot of boats around from various sources and we must ensure both that they are in the right place when they are needed and that there is the personnel with the training to use them. That is what we should focus our efforts on. Most people not unreasonably think that if they are in danger because of rising water and they ring 999, they can expect the fire and rescue service to come and help. That is what the fire and rescue service does&#151;its overriding responsibility is to help people in trouble.</p>

 First, may I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s statement? It will give a lot of hope to those of my constituents who have had some very nasty experiences with flooding over the past few years. We have been working extremely hard to try to tackle the flooding that has taken place in my constituency, particularly in Great Sankey and Penketh, which has caused horrible experiences, sometimes for vulnerable people. That flooding has been caused by two things: in some cases, ineffective management of current water systems; and also the extensive building growth in Warrington over the past 20 years. Will my right hon. Friend make sure that there is effective information sharing and communication between the local authority, the Environment Agency and the utilities companies so that they can both manage current situations and plan for the continued housing growth that is due to take place in Warrington, as a designated housing growth area, over the next few years?</p>

 The single most important step we have taken to deal with the problem that my hon. Friend identifies is PPS25, because it clearly lays the responsibility with local authorities to take full account of flood risk in taking decisions. It gives the Environment Agency a statutory responsibility to be consulted&#151;the agency is, after all, the expert. The experiences of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents, and of the many other constituents who have been talked about today by other Members, reinforce  <br>

the importance of people getting themselves on to the flood warning system and of the practical change we are making to get more telephone numbers on the system, because if people get the phone call, the text or the e-mail&#151;whichever they have asked for&#151;they might be able to take upstairs the kinds of valuable possessions that have been mentioned, and they will not suffer quite as much as when they have been completely unprepared. We have a responsibility to get on that system; the number is 08459881188. If anyone is not on it, they should get on it, so they can get a warning if flooding threatens.</p>

 The source of the River Severn is in my constituency and settlements such as Llandrinio, Crew Green, Meifod, Bettws, Tregynon and Caersws have always lived with flooding. However, these communities are concerned that they could be deliberately flooded more often in order to protect larger conurbations downstream. Can the Secretary of State confirm that rural communities will not be sacrificed for the sake of towns and cities, and that we will instead find creative solutions that work for town and country alike?</p>

 We certainly do need to find ways of dealing with the problem in order to protect as many people as possible, but, as Members are only too well aware, in the end water is going to find somewhere to go. That is why understanding the likely path of that water and looking at the options for dealing with it is part of the process that we have now started and the responsibility that local authorities and others will take on.</p>

 My constituents in Kidlington, west Oxford, South Hinksey, north Abingdon and south Abingdon have been flooded by five or six tributaries of the Thames, and the Secretary of State was kind enough to visit some of those communities last year. Some of them have been flooded four times in the past nine years, and they are terrified each time that it rains that it might happen again. Therefore, can the right hon. Gentleman explain why the timetable for the adoption of private sewers appears to have slipped to 2011, and might it be possible to front-load some of the funding in the spending plan, which would enable extra schemes that cannot otherwise pass the threshold to be started now and also give a boost, as part of the fiscal stimulus, to the construction industry, which could usefully do some of the work next year, rather than in two years&#146; time when some engineering firms may be out of business?</p>

 I do not think that the transfer of the private sewers will help the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents; it depends on the source of the flooding, and it will take time to deal with that. Some of the houses I visited when I came to his constituency would certainly benefit from some of the flood resilience works&#151;we saw some homemade versions as we walked around on that occasion. We have, indeed, brought forward expenditure. The &#163;20 million identified in the pre-Budget report is in addition to the increase in expenditure we had already put in place, and it will allow more schemes to start earlier so that protection is provided faster than would otherwise be the case.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. You responded yesterday to the letter written to you last week, signed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and me. In that letter, we asked you to give precedence to our complaint of breach of privilege in respect of the arrest of my hon.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Am I right in saying that nothing you said in your statement earlier today implies that the entry and search in the precincts of the House by the Metropolitan police was lawful, as asserted by them, or that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 overrides article 9 of the Bill of Rights, which protects our constituents&#146; confidential information, the national interest and freedom of speech in this House? To help to get to the bottom of all this and to protect those rights, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to insist on the production of the Johnston report and that it be placed in the Library of the House.

The Government have tried to set up one Committee of the House, which they have not, so far, been able to establish, and several Select Committees are inquiring into the matter, but the Standards and Privileges Committee is not empowered to discuss a rather serious matter of privilege. I wonder whether you would perhaps consider whether we should examine our practices and think of some other route by which the obvious Committee to consider this might, of its own volition, decide to conduct an investigation.

I stated that I wanted a Committee to investigate the matter and to look into all the circumstances, but then the House came along and made a decision.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08121768000286">We had an interesting debate on Report last month, and I am grateful to everyone who took part in it and to the Members of all parties who have contributed to the debate as the Bill has passed through this House. We very much appreciate the continuing cross-party support for this crucial legislation, and I am grateful for the help and co-operation from all parts of the House in achieving the challenging timetable imposed on this Bill by the sunsetting of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 in February of next year. In particular, I thank those Members who served on the Public Bill Committee, and I am grateful for the good spirit and constructive approach that all sides took to those sittings. The Government have listened to a number of the arguments made, and I believe the Bill has been improved as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08121768000287">These are challenging times for financial markets and economies across the world, and I believe that the Bill is a timely package of reforms to improve the UK&#146;s framework for ensuring financial stability and protecting depositors. The Government have taken decisive action to protect the UK&#146;s financial stability during this turbulent period, including measures to recapitalise and strengthen the UK&#146;s banking sector and provide support to institutions facing difficulties, but the need for a permanent strengthening of the legislative framework in this area has been clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08121768000288">As we have debated at length during the past few months, this legislation will provide the authorities with the tools they need to resolve effectively failing banks while protecting financial stability, depositors and taxpayers, and minimising the disruption to the wider economy. Other measures in the Bill will enable the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to make faster and more efficient compensation payments and will strengthen the Bank of England&#146;s role in financial stability, with a new objective for financial stability and enhanced tools for pursuing it.</p>

 The Minister refers to the bank rescue package. When the Chancellor came before the House, he said that the implications on the public finances of that package were mostly temporary. Could the Minister set out for us which of those arrangements will have a non-temporary&#151;a more permanent&#151;impact on the public finances, so that the House is clear on that?</p>

 I agree entirely with what the Chancellor said to the House. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the statement that the Chancellor made and the information that is available in government, which, if he looks at it, he will find provides him with the answers he seeks to the question he raises.</p>

centre. First, they will extend the Treasury&#146;s powers under the special resolution regime to allow it to take bank holding companies into temporary public ownership in cases where the resolution of only the deposit taker or deposit takers within a banking group would not, by itself, be sufficient to prevent a serious risk to financial stability, public funds, or both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para18"><a name="08121768000292">The second addition is a response to the experience of the administration of the UK subsidiary of the failed US investment bank, Lehman Brothers&#151;Lehman Brothers International (Europe). The Government propose to take a power in the Banking Bill to introduce, by secondary legislation and after a formal review, a new special insolvency procedure for investment firms that hold client assets or client money. The expert liaison group, which I set up earlier this year, will help the Government in this area. Lord Myners, the Financial Services Secretary, intends to table these amendments for discussion in Committee in the other place.</p>

The No. 2 Bill that was introduced in the other place yesterday is identical in every respect to the Banking Bill that we are considering today, and the procedure allows the other place an additional fortnight to consider the Bill, which I am sure hon. Members will agree is entirely to the benefit of all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08121768000294">As the House will be aware, the Banking Bill was carried over to the current Session and, if hon. Members consent today, it will complete its passage in this House and go to the other place tomorrow. At that point, the No. 2 Bill will be dropped and all further consideration in the other place will be on the Bill sent from this House today.</p>

 Although the aims of the Bill are laudable, I wonder whether the Minister is sure that it will do enough. He may not have had the chance to listen to Sir Victor Blank on the radio this lunchtime talking about the Government bail-out. He said that the recapitalisation scheme was highly necessary&#151;and we all support it&#151;but he also pointed out the problem that the banks now have with regard to lending because of the Government&#146;s new capital requirements. Does the Minister agree that those requirements are preventing the banks from lending the money that businesses need?</p>

 I was in meetings so I was not able to hear what Victor Blank said. He is obviously a serious figure in the business community and we will want to take due account of his views. We meet him on a regular basis, and Ministers and officials are well aware of his and his company&#146;s position on these issues. From what the hon. Lady says, his comments would not appear to refer directly to legislation appropriate under the long title of the Bill, but she raises an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para21"><a name="08121768000297">The whole House has appreciated the action taken by the Government to recapitalise the banks to avoid the potential systemic risk to the financial services in this country. We need to continue to do all that we sensibly can in these difficult times, and that is one of the reasons why we have been considering whether further action is needed. I indicated the two areas in the pre-Budget report that suggested how the Bill could be strengthened  <br>

in the other place, and I think that we have broad support from both sides of the House for those sensible measures. However, they will of course need to be thoroughly scrutinised in this House and in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para22"><a name="08121768000298">I am aware that there are some areas where Opposition Members may still have some concerns, but we went some way towards resolving those in Committee and in amendments on Report. I would like to take this opportunity to provide an update on progress in some of those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para23"><a name="08121768000299">As hon. Members will be aware, clause 75&#151;the power to change law&#151;attracted significant interest in Committee and on Report. It will provide the Treasury with a power to amend legislation to enable the powers of the special resolution regime to be used more effectively. As we discussed in Committee, this is not a general power to amend legislation; it is targeted and limited. It may only be used in order to facilitate a resolution and, in using it, the Treasury must have regard to the special resolution objectives set out in clause 4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para24"><a name="08121768000300">In Committee, I agreed that I would ask the expert liaison group to consider whether the amendments brought forward on Report&#151;particularly the explicit exclusion from the scope of the power of the provisions of the Bill and underlying secondary legislation&#151;would help to reduce the possible impact of the existence of this power on legal certainty in relation to financial contracts. The hon. Members for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) and I are at one in recognising the importance of legal certainty in relation to contracts. I am pleased to report that when the expert liaison group met earlier this week, it agreed that this amendment would indeed do this. We are continuing to engage with the group on this issue, and of course the power will also be scrutinised carefully in the other place, not least by the Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform.</p>

 I appreciate the need for flexibility in these difficult financial times. Will that clause or any other give the Government the power to set up a bank in an emergency that can take over bad debts from other banks to provide a possible solution to a financial crisis?</p>

 I know that the hon. Gentleman has raised that issue before on several occasions. Clause 75 would not do what he suggests. As I say, the clause provides a targeted and limited use of power to change law to make the special resolution regime work as effectively as possible. He will be aware, from the special resolution regime detailed in part 1 of the Bill, of the exact procedures necessary&#151;who pulls the trigger, who operates the special resolution regime, and how the parties work together. We believe strongly that the range of measures that we have in place are a substantial improvement on the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, and that is one of the reasons why we want to ensure that they reach the statute book in a timely manner, given the fact that the Act is sunsetted in February.</p>

building society that was privatised in the 1980s and 1990s has failed in the past few months of this crisis. When I was asked by the Minister not to press the new clause to a Division, he said that the existing legislation would provide sufficient powers for financial institutions that emerge from the present crisis to become mutually oriented if that was desired at the time. Will he meet us to discuss that point, because mutualism provides a robustness and responsiveness that other financial structures do not, as we have seen in the past nine months?</p>

 It certainly remains my understanding that the legislation is sufficient to take into account those issues, but I would be more than happy to meet my hon. Friends to discuss that in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para25"><a name="08121768000305">I now turn to the issue of partial transfers and the safeguards that the Government will put in place to protect creditors, and particularly to reduce disruption to set-off and netting agreements and security interests. I know this issue was of great interest to members of the Committee, and rightly so. Again, I can report that, when the expert liaison group met earlier this week with officials from the Treasury, the Bank and the Financial Services Authority, they continued to make good progress towards providing for safeguards that will maintain the right balance between ensuring that the authorities have the necessary flexibility to ensure an effective resolution, while protecting creditors&#146; and counterparties&#146; interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para26"><a name="08121768000306">We are continuing to work closely with the group on refining the safeguards and, of course, we are conducting a wider public consultation. We aim to be in a position to report back, including on the results of the consultation, early in the new year. I repeat the commitment that I have made on previous occasions&#151;I see the process of producing the secondary legislation as being one of co-production. We want to work in detail with the industry to ensure that we get the secondary legislation absolutely right and that there are sufficient safeguards to protect creditors&#146; and counterparties&#146; interests. We understand the importance of that for the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para27"><a name="08121768000307">The Bill represents the Government&#146;s considered response to some of the key lessons learned during this period of financial instability. It provides a permanent addition to the country&#146;s system for financial stability and depositor protection, and these arrangements will provide the UK authorities with a refined and proportionate set of tools to deal with difficulties in the banking sector that can affect depositors and the wider economy. It is vital to get the proposals right and to ensure that the UK&#146;s framework is sufficiently robust to deal with future as well as current challenges. So I am grateful for the thoughtful and constructive scrutiny that the House has given to the Bill, especially in the Public Bill Committee but also on Second Reading and on Report. I am sure that that constructive spirit will continue during this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para28"><a name="08121768000308">The Bill is a vital piece of legislation that will enhance the ability of the authorities to secure the financial stability of the UK both now and in the future, and I commend it to the House.</p>

Bill a Third Reading when a Bill that was identical to it except for the title was given a Second Reading in the other place yesterday. That was a sign of the way in which we have sought to co-operate with the Government to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book before the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 expires in February next year. As the Minister said, we have sought to engage constructively as the Bill has passed through the House. We have not always agreed on some of its provisions, but we have sought to ensure a full discussion and full scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para29"><a name="08121768000310">I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers) and for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) for their contributions in Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport was one of four members of the Select Committee on Treasury who served on the Public Bill Committee, along with the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed). The deliberations of the Treasury Committee in the aftermath of Northern Rock and financial instability contributed a great deal to our consideration of the Bill in the Public Bill Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para30"><a name="08121768000311">We supported the Bill on Second Reading and we do not intend to oppose it on Third Reading. That does not mean that it is perfect, and, as the Minister said, there are and have been some significant concerns about it. Those concerns were particularly evident when it was first published. We welcome the fact that the Government listened not just to the concerns that we expressed in Committee but to the wider concerns of the financial services sector. We teased out some of the sector&#146;s concerns in Committee, particularly when its representatives gave evidence to the Committee. The Minister has sought to respond to those concerns. We welcome the amendments to the Henry VIII powers in clause 75, as well as the establishment on a statutory footing of the banking liaison panel in clause 10. The Minister referred to the work of the panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para31"><a name="08121768000312">We also welcome the fact that the Minister sought to consult widely on the secondary legislation and the code of practice. The Bill gives the tripartite authorities&#151;the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA&#151;quite extensive powers. Safeguards over the use of the powers are included in the secondary legislation that flows from the Bill and in the code of practice. Only when the legislation is seen as that package will outside bodies take comfort from the shape it is in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para32"><a name="08121768000313">It is worth remembering that the Bill has a very narrow focus. In the context of the current financial crisis it deals principally with measures to tackle the problems associated with a failing bank. Its provisions do not address the re-opening of credit facilities to bank customers. Although it gives the Bank of England new statutory responsibilities for financial stability and gives it oversight of the payments system, it does not address issues such as the macro-prudential regulation of the banking system, a topic that has provoked considerable debate both in Parliament and outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="81217-0007.htm_para33"><a name="08121768000314">Even on the issue of which banks are included, the Bill is narrowly focused. Clause 2 describes a bank as</p>
<a name="81217-0007.htm_brev5"><a name="08121768001158"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a UK institution which has permission under Part 4 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to carry on the regulated activity of accepting deposits&#148;.</p>

Bill would have helped the depositors of Icesave who, in some respects, are still waiting for compensation following the collapse of the Icelandic banking system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08121768000316">A point that we raised in Committee, which the Minister sought to address, was that the Bill covers only deposit takers and does not take into account institutions that are fundamental to the stability of the banking system and do not accept deposits. We therefore welcome the amendments that the Government propose to table in the other place to deal with institutions that accept client assets and trade. In Committee, we discussed Lehman Brothers, where there have been significant problems with the administration arrangements because the tools are not in place to do the job. We welcome the move to amend the Bill, but I am sure that my noble Friends in the Lords will look very carefully at the amendments that the Government propose to table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08121768000317">At the heart of the Bill are the increased powers being given to the tripartite authorities to intervene when a bank is failing and powers through the special resolution regime to enable them to resolve the problems of a failing bank. Part 1 sets out the special resolution regime and establishes the framework for putting a bank in the special resolution regime and the powers that can be used by the Bank of England or, where appropriate, the Treasury to deal with a failing bank. We talked extensively in Committee about the objectives of the special resolution regime. I do not particularly want to dwell on those subjects at this point, although I want to come back to the issue of financial stability later on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08121768000318">Although the Bill does not rank the objectives given, it has been clear from our debates that one of the most important objectives is the protection of depositors and particularly of retail depositors. Effective arrangements to protect deposits are important if we are to ensure confidence in the banking system. We saw in the context of Northern Rock the close relationship between confidence in the banking system and the moves by depositors to withdraw their funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08121768000319">The decision to put a bank into the special resolution regime rests with the FSA, as set out in clause 7. The Bill states that a bank will be subject to the special resolution regime when it has breached the FSA&#146;s threshold conditions, which are defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and defined more closely in the FSA&#146;s rule book. As currently drafted, the threshold conditions are quite broad. The Minister and I discussed the location of the head office, for example, as a threshold condition, and there are other conditions that apply to insurance companies, for example. I was grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurance in Committee that the FSA is considering the threshold conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08121768000320">We need to see increased clarity about what will constitute a breach of the threshold conditions. The FSA determined that the recent bank failures at Bradford &amp; Bingley, Heritable and Kaupthing had breached the threshold conditions but, two and a half months later, we are no clearer about how they breached those conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08121768000321">We did not make as much progress in Committee as I had hoped on the question of ensuring transparency about the use to which the Bill&#146;s powers will be put. That transparency also applies to the threshold conditions, and I hope that the FSA will bear that in mind when it looks at the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08121768000322">The special resolution regime established three stabilisation options&#151;a private-sector purchaser, a bridge bank and temporary public ownership. They will be implemented through the stabilisation powers and the transfer of shares and property. The most controversial aspect of the stabilisation regime is the bridge bank, which is the vehicle that permits the partial transfer of assets and liabilities. That proposal caused the most contention between the Bill as originally drafted and as it stands now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08121768000323">We have seen a form of the bridge bank in operation already, with the dismemberment of Bradford &amp; Bingley. Its depositors and other assets were sold to Banco Santander, while the rump of the business has effectively been nationalised by being left to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08121768000324">Some hon. Members present today did not attend the Committee stage of the Bill, so it is worth pointing out that the controversy stems from the fact that the partial transfers were regarded as a way to allow creditors&#146; traditional rights to be unpicked by Government action. The rights included the arrangements governing how transactions are settled in the City. Certain types of transactions are covered by agreements that enable deals to be settled on a net basis, according to their balance at the end of the day, rather than on a gross basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08121768000325">Regulatory capital is determined on the same basis, so there was widespread concern that the lack of proper safeguards could mean that there was no legal certainty that in-default transactions could be netted off. That legal uncertainty would have made London a more expensive to do business and undermined our competitive position. That was one source of the comments made by the financial services sector when the Bill received its Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08121768000326">The Government have taken on board those comments, and their moves in respect of netting off are very helpful. In principle, they are saying that we should follow the path of netting off and then considering exceptions, rather than setting out the qualifying financial contracts at the start. That change has been greeted positively by the financial services sector, and we look forward to the outcome of the consultation process in January.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08121768000327">Investors have also been reassured by clause 60, which provides mandatory compensation to third parties where there has been a partial transfer. It adopts the principle that no creditors should be worse off than they would have been if the bank had gone into administration or liquidation. Although that is relatively easy to say, it may be difficult to implement in practice, as the process involves a great deal of judgment by the valuer, but it gives creditors some reassurance that their rights will be properly valued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08121768000328">We have touched already on the banking liaison panel set out in clause 10, which will include representatives from the tripartite authorities, the FSCS and the financial services sector, as well as people with a particular knowledge of insolvency and financial services law. I have spoken to people in the City over recent weeks and my sense is that they welcome the panel as an effective way to look at the secondary legislation that will be introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08121768000329">As I said, the Bill is a package: in addition to the secondary legislation that will follow, it sets out in clause 5 a code of practice that will give guidance on the exercise of stabilisation powers and the bank administration  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Dec 2008">

<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>17 Dec 2008 : Column 1125</b><br>
and insolvency procedures set out in parts 2 and 3. We saw an early draft of the code while the Bill was in Committee, and I am sure that a further draft will be available to Members in the other place once the consultation process is completed next month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08121768000330">The code is important because it sets out the circumstances in which the powers will be used. The greater the clarity about how the powers will be used, the more confidence there will be in the operation of the overall regime, but that also means that there should be much greater transparency about why powers have been exercised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08121768000331">I repeat that two and a half months have passed since Bradford &amp; Bingley was subject to a bridge-bank type process, while Kaupthing and Heritable were put into administration at the beginning of October. However, there has not been that much in the way of greater transparency about the process through which the FSA and the Government went to get to that outcome. The financial services sector will learn a great deal from the explanation that is given about the exercise of those powers at that time, and that will enable it to predict more carefully how the powers in this Bill will be used in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08121768000332">We have touched already on the Henry VIII clause in clause 75, and the feedback that the Minister gave on the comments from the banking liaison group was very helpful. Clearly, however, those in the other place will look at those powers, as that is an area about which they are especially concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08121768000333">Another part of the Bill that is important in terms of the overall structure of protection for depositors deals with the changes to the FSCS. The scheme is one of the principal means by which we can protect depositors, as it gives them confidence that they will be compensated if their bank goes into administration. That needs to be thought about very carefully as the Bill proceeds through the other place, but part of the problem is that some of the detail about how deposits are to be protected will be dealt with in reforms introduced by the FSA. That is more work in progress, and it shows how difficult these matters are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08121768000334">I have spent some time looking at this Bill over the past few months, and I could talk for hours about it. On this occasion, however, I shall desist from going into more detail, although I will say that more work will be done in the other place to streamline and strengthen it. The Bill is important because it should strengthen people&#146;s confidence in the banking sector and in London as a place to do business, but it is only one of the measures needed in that regard. Other moves need to be made to restore confidence in the banking sector as a whole.</p>

 I shall be brief, as I know that other hon. Members want to contribute to this relatively short debate.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>17 Dec 2008 : Column 1126</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08121768000337">I do not want to say much on that, save that there are some very welcome aspects. The banking liaison group is a very positive innovation that will be helpful both now and in the future. It also cements the sort of relationship that we need with the City in respect of matters that at times can be very delicate. If we do not get our response right, the consequences could be very profound, and it is important that we bear that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08121768000338">The Bill does not cover important issues such as bank liquidity and capital, the appointment and qualification of directors, risk committees and so on, but they will have to be considered fairly soon. Therefore, to a certain extent this Banking Bill is just the first chapter of a continuing work in progress that we will have to keep looking at over the next few months. However, because there is a sunset clause in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, we have to put something on the stocks and the Bill can do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08121768000339">Inevitably, there are still some concerns about exactly how the provisions will work, and the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) has outlined them. We must hope that many of the provisions will not actually be required. If they are, we could be in a lot more difficulty. The Bill is a bit like bolting the stable door after the horse has gone, but it is extremely important nevertheless that it is on the stocks, although if we have to use some of its provisions we shall be looking at some stark situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para24"><a name="08121768000340">We debated the amount for the Financial Services Compensation Fund in Committee and there was some disagreement about whether there should be pre-funding, which is, rightly, not on the agenda at present&#151;clearly, the banks need all the capital they can get. One element that we did not much explore was public opinion. We have to recognise that public opinion is not particularly disposed to the provision of significantly more bail-out money. Although there are some objections to pre-funding, and even about its practicality, the industry has to realise that the idea that it can regularly come back for public bail-outs at much cost will not be sympathetically considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para25"><a name="08121768000341">The Bill sets out protection for depositors, which is important. That security, with timely payouts, is right. It was a great shame that the vast majority of the depositors in the Northern Rock queues were already protected under the deposit fund so they did not actually need to worry. They did not know that, because the fund was not particularly well known or advertised, so we need to do some real education following the Bill to make depositors aware of their protections and of what they can expect to happen. We need to give them confidence, so that if there are some ripples they will have a clearer understanding that they are protected, and that they do not have to whiz round suddenly and take out a few thousand pounds of their hard-earned savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para26"><a name="08121768000342">Banks are undoubtedly one of the most capital-hungry businesses&#151;they are always seeking capital. I have concerns that the provisions may set up some hurdles to the capital-raising exercises that will be important. Even if there are no hurdles, the process will be much more expensive than in the past, which will have an effect on the cost of money generally. We need to recognise that there will be genuine costs if banks are unable to amass  <br>

or attract the capital they will need both for their own stability and also to operate effectively for themselves and for the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para27"><a name="08121768000343">Mention has been made of the significant powers that have been given to the FSA and the Treasury, and there are inevitably concerns about them. The Minister has given us some reassurance, at least in respect of the Treasury powers, which is helpful, although there will always be concern about whether the FSA will use its triggers appropriately. We shall have to see. Overall, the situation is satisfactory. The thresholds for the safeguards may be a little low, but all such assessments are subjective, so it is difficult to prove one thing or the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para28"><a name="08121768000344">Our debates on Report were truncated because of the need to prorogue. If we had had the full time, we might have reached the amendment that my hon. Friends and I tabled to deal with the necessity for a sunset clause. Just as the Banking (Special Provisions) Act was sunsetted, we shall need to revisit some of the Banking Bill&#146;s provisions in more peaceful times, given that we have been considering it during a crisis-type situation. I hope that at some stage the Government will give our proposal some thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para29"><a name="08121768000345">I thank the Minister and other members of the Committee. The Minister was courteous and good humoured in sometimes difficult circumstances. Overall, we support the Bill. We hope that it will be further scrutinised in the other place and that it reaches the statute book before the previous measure expires.</p>

 I remind the House of my business interest recorded in the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para30"><a name="08121768000347">I, too, welcome the Bill, and I do so for two reasons. First, it begins to put the Bank of England back at the centre of our financial system, which the Treasury Committee recommended in its major report on the Northern Rock crisis. Some of the Committee&#146;s recommendations have found their way into the Bill; for example, streamlining the court of directors and giving the Bank more explicit power over financial stability. I hope that the Government will follow up those changes by giving the new deputy governor, Paul Tucker&#151;whose appointment I welcome&#151;the resources he needs to rebuild the Bank&#146;s ability to understand what is happening in the banking markets and to monitor the financial system much more thoroughly. That is an important and long overdue change. Those powers and that ability should never have been taken away from the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para31"><a name="08121768000348">Secondly, the Bill makes improvements to depositor protection, as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) said. I am not quite clear how the arrangements that the Economic Secretary proposes will be superseded by what was agreed in Brussels earlier this month. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could clarify that. If he does not have time to answer me today, perhaps he could write to me. I understand that there will be an overarching European Union framework for the number of days before depositors are fully refunded, which may be even more leisurely than the arrangements canvassed in the UK. I should be grateful for some clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para32"><a name="08121768000349">We hear constant references to temporary public ownership. What is missing from the Bill is any understanding that the arrangements being made for  <br>

the ownership or part-ownership of five of our major banks will not be temporary; they will be with us for a very long time. Further legislation may be required, but I should have liked the Government to make an attempt in the Bill to set out some rules about how those public stakes are to be managed&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) referred to that point. We have heard that the shareholding is to be directed by UK Financial Investments, which is to be set up as an arm&#146;s length body, but it is not clear whether the company will require statutory approval. It is not clear how UKFI will be accountable, although I certainly hope that it will be accountable to the Select Committee. We should all understand that, although the Government keep calling this stuff temporary, it is likely to be with us for a long time, so issues such as competition policy&#151;suspended for the nationalisation of the two Scottish banks&#151;will need to be readdressed if we are ever again to have sufficient and proper competition in the banking system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para33"><a name="08121768000350">I have now twice said&#151;on 17 October and during the Queen&#146;s Speech debate&#151;that the various measures produced to tackle the financial crisis have been necessary but are not yet sufficient. More will need to be done to get banking flowing again so that money can reach our home owners and businesses. I welcome the extension of the credit guarantee scheme earlier this week and the Treasury&#146;s admission that it will last for five years, not three&#151;nothing temporary about that. It could be a very permanent feature of our financial landscape. However, I suspect and fear that even those measures will not be sufficient and the Government may have to revisit some of the features of that desperately short weekend when the Scottish banks were nationalised. Of course, the due diligence was rushed, as I have already pointed out, but some of the terms set out over that weekend may have to be looked at again, because the money and the credit are not yet flowing, which everybody wants to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="81217-0008.htm_para34"><a name="08121768000351">That said, I welcome the Bill and hope that it makes it to the statute book in reasonable time, although even if it gets there in February, it will still be 18 months after the collapse of Northern Rock, which is fairly leisurely progress for a legislature that should have responded much more quickly and an Executive who are constantly behind the curve. However, I welcome the passage of the Bill today.</p>

 I, too, will keep my remarks brief. As the Economic Secretary knows, Opposition Members wholeheartedly support the Bill&#146;s aims and have been calling on the Government to produce such a Bill for some time, and we therefore wish it a very fair and speedy passage. Of course, we want it on the statute book by February, but in the light of the Governor of the Bank of England&#146;s remarks earlier this week, when he set out a rather worrying picture for the future of our banking industry, the best option would be for that to happen as soon as possible. It was somewhat surprising for someone in his position to make things quite so worryingly clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08121768000354">I want to make a few remarks about the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) said, we should remember how all this started, with Northern Rock some 18 months ago, when our banking system began teetering on the edge, as it has continued  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Dec 2008">

to do ever since. One of the reasons why the Northern Rock fiasco&#151;crisis&#151;came about was that, under the old rules of banking legislation, when the Bank of England offered emergency liquidity, it had to make that known. That was, in itself, a recipe for the disaster that followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08121768000355">In future, under the Bill&#146;s miscellaneous provisions, which seems a minor section in which to put an important provision, such emergency liquidity offered by the Bank of England can remain secret. Clearly, although transparency is something to be desired in a situation that can cause a run on a bank, as happened with Northern Rock, the new rules are much better, and I am glad that the Government have learned the error of their ways, inasmuch as a rescue will be attempted before the public take fright and start to queue around the block at various branches of whichever bank might be in trouble. I welcome that important provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08121768000356">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) that, although it is nice to see the Bank of England taking more of the centre stage in the regulation of our banking industry, there is more to be done in that respect. There are still problems with regard to the powers of the FSA and the Bank of England. Clarity of decision making is very important in what we now know to be such a crucial part of our economy. We are not letting banks fail&#151;they are just too important&#151;and someone therefore needs to be exclusively in charge. I hope that that role will be considered in future banking legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08121768000357">Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham, who speaks from the Front Bench, has played a much bigger role in considering the Bill than I have, and I am very glad about that because he has clearly gone into the detail. I was encouraged when he said that there is now broad agreement that the Government have got largely right their provisions for the SRR and that there is much more happiness in the banking industry and among Conservative Members about how that would take place. If I have one concern about this crisis, it is that when it is over&#151;it will be over, eventually&#151;the City of London remains an important institution for UK plc. Although we are very angry with the banking industry for the trouble that it has led us into, we must be careful in any future legislation to ensure that it remains an important part of our economy in future. We must ensure that the City is open for business and is the most attractive place to do so. It is very tempting to penalise the banking industry for how it has behaved and for what it has done, but, although we obviously have to put right what has gone wrong in our banking industry and give people confidence in it in the future, we must keep sight of the broader picture for the UK. We have a lot of jobs in the financial sector, and we want to continue to attract banks to London with fair and rational provisions that govern how any such similar situation will be dealt with.</p>

I appreciate that there have been tumultuous events in the financial markets, and I suspect that that will be so for some months to come. However, in so far as anything is foreseeable&#151;I accept that some eventualities are not&#151;we should avoid putting our banking industry into too much of a straitjacket.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08121768000360">I am also the first to accept, however, that the days in which both I and, indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) perhaps talked easily about the idea of light-touch regulation are done&#151;at least, for now. I confess that even relatively sophisticated high-net-worth individuals&#151;we have seen what has happened to such investors in one of the world&#146;s largest hedge funds in recent days&#151;have to concede that those days will, I fear, come to an end.</p>

Friend the Member for Bromsgrove pointed out, the future for London&#146;s financial centre will not be enhanced by low-regulation arbitrage, vis- -vis other financial centres going forward. Clearly, that will not be the spirit of the age for some time to come. I must confess that I am also concerned about the City of London&#146;s future role as a world financial capital. We must be entirely candid about the fact that some permanent damage has been done by recent events&#151;indeed, the same applies to Wall street&#151;and the whole Anglo-American model of financial services will need to be shaken up.</p>

That can only be further undermined by some of the unfolding scandals, and I am sure, I fear, that we have not heard the last of them. Nevertheless, I hope that the Government will take some heed of the quiet concerns of many people in the banking world. A lot of representations have been made to the Government during the consideration of the Bill, but although they broadly express support for the workings of the Bill, there are some concerns about how the compensation system will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08121768000363">I should like to reiterate the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), who hit the nail on the head. We must look at the whole issue of competition law. Above all, as we have seen with the banking mergers that have taken place and the lack of independence for some banks, there is concern that competition considerations have been flung aside. We are living in tumultuous and difficult times that are bewildering for the public and for policy makers as well; but equally, we must remember that competition law is enacted not as an added layer of regulation but to protect the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08121768000364">The bigger concern of many people is that smaller banking organisations and small organisations in the financial services world run the risk not only of perhaps over-contributing to a compensation fund, but of exiting from a lot of markets in the financial services world, simply because of those competition concerns. All too often, enhanced and enlarged regulation is a big barrier to entry for new competitors in what should be a vibrant field, full of innovation and flair.</p>

Friend the Member for Fareham rightly pointed out that some specifics will be considered in another place in January in relation to netting and set-off in the context of clause 48, but I should like to say finally that, although this is billed as temporary legislation, there is no doubt that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks said in his contribution, many of these measures will stay in place for quite some time. That means two things: first, we clearly need to give very great consideration to what we put on to the statute book at this stage&#151;that has happened here and will happen in another place in the next few weeks of the parliamentary Session&#151;but, more importantly, we recognise that this must be work in progress. I hope that the Government will pay great attention to what is being said in the banking and related industries to ensure that, where unforeseen problems arise in relation to the legislation, they are fully and properly dealt with.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate on the Third Reading of this important Bill, which comes at an important time in this country&#146;s financial history. I, too, am delighted that the Bill will put the Bank of England back at the centre of regulation. There is further to go, but I must confine my remarks to the contents of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08121768000367">I note that the Bill proposes an increased regulatory role for the Financial Services Authority. There are still huge concerns among Conservative Members&#151;and, I am sure, among Labour Members&#151;about the suitability of the FSA to deliver on that enhanced role. The FSA seems to have missed all the warning signs leading up to the banking crisis and all the warning signs in the mortgage market, and there has been a simple loss of confidence in its ability to deliver on its important role. A few moments ago, I was talking to my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) about the need to restore confidence in the regulatory regime. What happened at Northern Rock must not be allowed to happen again, and the Bill goes some way towards ensuring that it will not. My hon. Friend pointed out that the run on the bank happened because, despite assurances from the Government, the FSA and the Bank of England that there was nothing to fear about losing deposits and that those deposits were safe, the public quickly worked out that no one was in charge. As we move forward, we need someone who is seen to be in charge of regulation, so that the buck stops with him or her. I hope that the Bill sets those wheels in motion; if it does not, I am sure that we will revisit the subject in the very near future.</p>

Over time, the Government undertook an excellent preparation for the Bill as regards the consultation that went with it. That was a useful process that means that it will be robust in terms of dealing with the crises that will come next year. We would all hope that it will not be necessary to employ this legislation, but it is inevitable that there will be further nationalisations with the oncoming second leg of the financial crisis after Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08121768000370">The Bill gives additional powers to the Bank of England. It has to be asked, bearing in mind the significant failures in recent years, whether that is the right route to take. I appreciate that we have to work with the institutions that we have, and that there is only so much progress to be made by criticising the Bank and the FSA. However, the Bill represented an opportunity to give the Bank responsibilities for asset prices; obviously, that concern will now be on the downward side rather than on the upward side. The Bill should also have given more support to maintaining the banking department of the Bank of England, which is being wound down, rather extraordinarily at this time of a banking crisis. An opportunity should have been taken&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08121768000379">Let me move on from the end of term spirit to a very serious issue, which is the motion to annul statutory instrument No. 3020 relating to value added tax. There are two reasons to be concerned about the VAT change, and we want to register that fact from the Opposition Benches. Some people do not believe that there should be a fiscal stimulus or think that it would be damaging; I would expect the Conservatives to make that case in due course. My approach and that of my colleagues is somewhat different: we have no objection to the principle of a fiscal stimulus, but we think that this is a bad one that is not likely to be effective even on its own terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08121768000380">Perhaps I should start with the Chancellor&#146;s own language in the pre-Budget report, when he declared:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08121768000381">and said that he proposed to give back some &#163;12.5 billion to consumers. Our view is that that is not the best and fairest approach, that it will not help everyone, and that it certainly will not give &#163;12.5 billion back to consumers. That is not to say that it is completely hopeless. There is a case for providing a fiscal stimulus through this measure that does not rely on &#147;best&#148; or &#147;fairest&#148; or consumer stimulus. It is a somewhat mechanical approach. What will happen&#151;we can already see it happening&#151;is that this measure will be absorbed in increased retail margins for everything from small shops to Sainsbury&#146;s, Asda and Tesco. Of course, that is putting money into the economy; no doubt if Tesco earns a little bit more profit as a result, that will be reflected in its share price and feed through into pension funds. If the Government had been honest with us and said, &#147;Actually, this has got nothing to do with helping the consumer&#151;it&#146;s all about putting &#163;12.5 billion into the economy in the quickest way we can think of, and it&#146;s marginally better than dropping money from helicopters&#148;, we would find it difficult to quarrel with the logic. However, they have not done that&#151;they have grossly overstated their case, and so we need to have a look at it and at its weaknesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08121768000382">The policy makes extraordinarily optimistic assumptions about the course of the economy. It assumes, as was said in the pre-Budget report, that we expect a recovery in 13 months from now. Because of that very optimistic view of the course of the British economy, this measure could have some perverse and negative consequences that were clearly not thought through in the Treasury. As we approach the end of next year, most people will have to look forward to an increase in VAT that may be greater than a return to 17.5 per cent.&#151;to reopen the whole issue of what the Government really intended&#151;as well as an increase in income tax, although it is called national insurance. Most rational consumers will calculate that they face a reduction in real income and adjust their budgets and spending patterns accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08121768000383">There is another, more subtle effect at work. Most economic forecasters now expect that next year we will see something that we have not seen for decades, possibly generations&#151;namely deflation, whereby prices fall as they did in the 1930s and at various times in the 19th century. That is now factored into the assumptions of some of the money markets, so the Americans talk about it quite openly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08121768000384">In a deflationary world, prices fall. When consumers see prices falling, they hold back from spending, so the VAT cut has the perverse effect of encouraging deflationary expectations. That encourages people to spend less, rather than more. Those are two possible perverse consequences of the measure. I am not predicting that that would happen, but before we glibly assume that the VAT cut is simply an injection of consumer spending, I am pointing out factors that could work in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08121768000385">Secondly, on the impact of consumer behaviour, we need to take into account the fact that we are talking about a very small change. Mr. Steinbr1/4ck, the German Finance Minister who has often been quoted in the Chamber in the past few weeks, chose a singularly unhelpful example: he asked, rhetorically, whether people would respond to a change in the price of a DVD from &#163;39.90 to &#163;39.10. That is quite a good example, and I can give others: one that I have quoted in the past is the &#163;5 off the &#163;220 flat-screen TV from China. There is also the example of 60p off a &#163;25 meal. One can question how much that is likely to influence the behaviour of a rational consumer.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he is opposed to giving a typical household in his constituency a tax break of &#163;300 next year? That is what the VAT reduction does.</p>

 I shall go on to explain that we would provide the tax cut in a better, fairer and more effective way. My colleagues and I are not opposed to cutting taxes for our constituents; we just think that the tax cut could be done more intelligently and in a more targeted way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08121768000388">There is another cost factor related to the smallness of the cuts. Many shops are discounting aggressively. In an environment in which shops are cutting prices by 20, 25 or 30 per cent., the effect of the change in VAT is invisible and therefore likely to have very little impact. Before I leave that point, there are a couple of issues that I would like the Government to address. The first is a very specific but important point raised by the British Retail Consortium, which has been thinking ahead and worrying about the effect that the change will have at the end of next year. It has said:</p>
<a name="81217-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="08121768001161"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Retailers are extremely concerned at the Government&#146;s intention to end the temporary VAT reduction on 31 December 2009. This would fall in the middle of the post-Christmas sales, one of the most important times of year for the retail industry...We believe that Government should reconsider the end date with a view to extending it by at least a month.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="81217-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08121768000389">Whatever general arguments we make about the retailing impact, that is a specific technical point that I hope the Government will have taken on board. Of course, the change that the British Retail Consortium suggests would not affect the overall arithmetic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08121768000392">I have a final point to make about consumer impact. One particular sector concerned about how the tax change will feed through is road hauliers, who can of course get relief from value added tax but who will be paying increased duty on their fuel. The issue is of particular concern to hauliers operating in rural areas, and the retailers who depend on them for their supply. I wonder whether the Government have thought about the cost implications of the fact that the combination of changes to VAT and to vehicle excise duty will particularly affect rural distribution. That is of concern to many of my colleagues and to people in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="st_o182"><a name="08121768000393"><a name="81217-0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="08121768001402"><b>Stephen Williams (Bristol, West) (LD):</b>
 On the subject of costs to business, I wonder what estimate the Government made of the cost to small businesses, most of which will account for VAT quarterly. They will have suffered VAT at 17.5 per cent., but will recover it, in the fullness of time, at 15 per cent., so they will suffer a cash-flow disadvantage in the short term. They will also face real costs as they reconfigure their accounting and invoicing systems and reprint all their marketing materials. So they face real cash-flow costs and an actual cost when the change is implemented.</p>

 My colleague eloquently made a point about the administrative costs of the change, particularly for small business&#151;a point that I wanted to make in slightly more detail. As he rightly points out, in this country 2 million companies are registered for VAT, and many of them will have the kind of practical problems that he describes, which clearly were not anticipated in the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08121768000395">The Government acknowledge that the compliance costs of the measure will be &#163;300 million. Of that, &#163;90 million is simply the cost of conversion; it is &#163;50 million to cut the VAT and another &#163;45 million to convert it back again. We are talking about an enormous administrative cost, particularly to small business, in terms of managerial time and practical problems of conversion. That will substantially reduce much of the benefits. My hon. Friend mentioned some of the problems, and I shall cite a couple more from my constituency. A local garage, Broad Lane Garage, wrote to me, without any prompting from me, to say:</p>

There are very simple ways of testing the proposition that a tax change is fair. The Institute for Fiscal Studies will run through different tax changes to demonstrate their impact on different income groups. It has done that and points out that the impact of the VAT change on the richest 10 per cent. of the population will be to make them 1.6 per cent. better off, and the impact on the poorest 10 per cent. will be to make them only 0.6 per cent. better off. Obviously, most of the commodities most used by people in low-income groups, notably food, children&#146;s clothes and energy, at least at a lower rate, are exempt.</p>

Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)&#151;concerns the alternative that we would advance. As I said at the outset, we do not believe that the Government should do nothing; there is a case for a fiscal stimulus. There are two elements to our answer. First, there are tax changes that are desirable. We have argued for a progressive change in the income tax system, cutting taxes for people at the bottom end of the income scale and raising them at the top by changing the system of allowances. That would have a differential effect on spending. It would be tax-neutral; it would not affect the deficit or public debt. However, it would provide a stimulus to the economy.</p>

We ought to be discussing in more detail the kind of measures that can be undertaken in relation to social housing, which is currently frozen because of the difficulties in housing associations, to which I referred in Prime Minister&#146;s questions; the opportunity to roll out much more effectively a programme of home insulation, which is happening at a snail&#146;s pace; investments in public transport, and others.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for taking a further intervention. Does he not see a problem with fairness in his argument? Half of pensioner households already do not pay income tax. The VAT reduction is worth &#163;150 a year to them. Why is he against a &#163;150 tax break for pensioner households?</p>

 Clearly, supplementary measures are needed to deal with pensioners and people who are not in the tax bracket.

The argument about how to stimulate the economy is moving on very fast. We are talking about cuts in interest rates and about fiscal policy. The Americans are already talking about quantitative easing, which is printing money&#151;that is, dropping money from helicopters. That is the kind of environment that we are getting into. When we reconvene in the new year, I expect that the debate will have moved on to more dramatic and potentially dangerous departures in policy. Although the statutory instrument will undoubtedly inject some demand into the economy, it is seriously defective and we intend to vote against it.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the real viciousness of extreme deflationary conditions is not so much the statistical decline in GDP, which he is right to emphasise, as the entirely disproportionate increase in unemployment that is already becoming evident and is likely to accelerate in the coming year?</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="08121768000413"><a name="81217-0010.htm_spnew10"><a name="08121768001410"><b>Mr. Field:</b>
 That is my next point. I am grateful that I gave way, not because it is not always a pleasure to do so, but because my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) told me that I spoke about a VAT increase, when we are, of course, debating a VAT decrease. Given the crazy economic world we are in, it may well have been an increase, rather than a decrease. I am immensely grateful to him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08121768000414">The data published today on unemployment show just how serious the situation is. If we turn to the appendices in the pre-Budget report and look at the set of statistics to which the Government have nailed their colours&#151;levels of unemployment at the end of next year&#151;we know that with the benefit count passing the million mark today and the International Labour Organisation rate coming up towards 2 million, sadly those thresholds will be crossed much earlier than the Government hope and that the pre-Budget report suggests. I believe the Government have very limited room for manoeuvre in a reflationary package, so I again question whether the VAT decrease is the appropriate policy response. For those reasons I shall vote against the Government today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08121768000415">There are two huge pressures limiting the Government&#146;s room for manoeuvre, the first of which is the sheer size of the debt that they hope to raise in the gilt markets. I am less optimistic than most people about the Government&#146;s ability to raise that debt. Long-term interest rates will certainly be pushed up, which will damage economic recovery as a result of seeking that level of debt, and we may have the horrendous scenario in which the Government cannot sell their gilts. Then, we are in a new ball game. The Bank of England will clearly be instructed to buy those debts, and again the outcome at which the hon. Member for Twickenham hinted will be upon us&#151;the printing presses will be rolling to pay for that, with all the consequences if one major country operates that policy in isolation from others.</p>

I do not understand how the Bank of England keeps talking about deflation. Oil prices in the spot market are rising substantially. We know about the fall of sterling in normal circumstances, and we may say that these are not normal circumstances. The fall in the value of sterling already would put 2 percentage points on inflation. It is an illusory luxury to believe that somehow next year the economy will be faced with a negative rate of inflation, rather than a real inflationary threat. That will certainly put a stop to a Government strategy of wishing the Bank of England to cut interest rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08121768000418">I disagree with the policy of increasing public works advocated by the hon. Member for Twickenham. I am always delighted to see my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on the Treasury Bench, but never more so than now, because I want to suggest that public works, sadly, have a far more limited role to play in recovery than one might think. The biggest public works programme is the Olympics. In the two and a half years since the Olympic programme was announced, with huge investments from taxpayers and lottery players, the London borough of Newham, part of which my right hon. Friend represents, has issued more than 50,000 new national insurance numbers to non-British workers.</p>

That raises long-term questions about what our schools are doing if they are producing people who cannot get or hold down those jobs, but that is a debate for another day. I do not believe that using moneys to increase public investment is a viable or effective option for the Government to pursue to prevent an horrendous scenario engulfing all too many of our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08121768000420">There is, however, one thing that the Government can do, and before Christmas: reallocate the money that would be lost on reducing VAT and use it to try to extend, even more effectively, credit lines to firms that will not open after Christmas if they do not get credit lines before it. The situation is that serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08121768000421">The Government are taking some measures, and I rejoice in that fact. However, it is clear, from reports of employers in our own constituencies and from what is happening to world trade, that something most alarming is happening. I shall state again a fact that I cited in the debate on Monday: the rates for shipping and for transporting goods&#151;to China, for example, which we hope will still be an engine for getting us out of this slump or recession&#151;are one tenth of what they were last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81217-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08121768000422">That is not because the Chinese economy is seizing up, although it may well do, but because people who have goods that they wish to sell in the export market are worried about whether they will be paid&#151;in other words, about whether the bills of exchange will be honoured. In that context, we should concentrate all our attention on ensuring that we extend the lifeline to those firms, and we could do that before Christmas. For that reason, and the others that I have briefly tried to marshal, the Government should take that course with the money that they plan to allocate to reducing VAT.</p>

Member for Twickenham, who moved the prayer against this order, I believe that cuts in VAT are like spitting in the face of an economic hurricane. They will have no effect whatever, given that firms are already cutting prices by up to 50 per cent. in an attempt to survive. I beg the Government to reconsider. Nobody doubts their genuine intention to try to protect as many of our constituents as possible from the awful consequences that are beginning to unfold before our very eyes and from the horrendous unemployment that we will see after Christmas, and that has already begun.  <br>

According to him, his prescription was instantly endorsed by the entire leadership of the free world, assembled for the specific purpose of receiving his guidance. With that reassurance behind him, he returned home and used his well known and unique powers of empathy with the British people to conclude that the best way to stimulate them was to offer them a short-term cut in VAT with the promise of a massive increase in taxation just as the economy is struggling to break out of the recession and resume growth.</p>

Unlike their neighbours and competitors, which used the good years to pay down Government debt, our Government went on borrowing, so that we are entering the recession with a huge structural deficit. On top of that structural deficit, we are going to pile the additional borrowing that the automatic stabilisers naturally deliver in a recession. We shall get to more than &#163;100 billion of borrowing next year, even before the Prime Minister&#146;s proposed fiscal stimulus is added. That will double our national debt to &#163;1 trillion.

Unlike the hon. Member for Twickenham, who essentially agrees with the concept of a fiscal stimulus, but disagrees with the way in which the Government are proposing to deliver it, we have a fundamental disagreement with the Government&#146;s approach and I am seeking to explain why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08121768000448">We are considering the temporary VAT cut because the Prime Minister has boxed himself into a corner. Having proclaimed his recapitalisation of the banking system not merely as successful in Britain, but as the instrument of world salvation, he has an understandable difficulty in acknowledging the small technical problem that it is not working. Banks may have been saved from collapse, but the test of the success of the taxpayers&#146; intervention is whether credit has begun to flow in a normal, sensible and measured way through the veins of the economy&#151;and it has not. Businesses large and small cannot borrow, the housing market is at a standstill, car sales have fallen off a cliff as consumer confidence is shattered, unemployment is soaring, business failures are accelerating and home repossessions are climbing ominously.</p>

 My hon. Friend says that the Prime Minister has boxed himself in, and I agree with that, but he has done so in one particular way. He cannot rely on the fiscal stimulus because of the level of debt that he has created. Had he not created that level of debt, he would have been able to pursue his fiscal stimulus.</p>

<p><a name="st_o200"><a name="08121768000450"><a name="81217-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="08121768001420"><b>Mr. Hammond:</b>
 My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right, and the Prime Minister has boxed himself in in another way. He is now unable to recognise that the banking recapitalisation has not delivered the intended outcome. Urgent attention to the banking and credit system is what is actually required to get Britain back on track and to save the sort of businesses that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead was talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08121768000451">The Prime Minister is unable to acknowledge that his banking rescue package now itself needs rescuing, and desperate to maintain momentum, he has produced this fiscal stimulus, not on the basis of a clear analysis of its impact on the British economy, but on the basis that some economists and politicians in other countries recommend such a measure in the very different circumstances of their own economies. He is spending more money that he has not got, piling up yet more burdens for future generations and placing the economic recovery at more risk. It seems that action has become an end in itself&#151;hyperactivity as Government policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08121768000452">Our position is that Britain cannot afford this extra borrowing, and its problems will not be solved by this temporary VAT cut. What Britain needs is carefully thought out measures that address the real problem, which is the lack of credit in the economy because of the failure of the bank recapitalisation programme. It needs measures such as our national loan guarantee scheme, which would get banks lending to businesses again, and sustainable measures to deliver permanent tax cuts through restraint in public spending increases once the recession is over. What we have from the Government is a package that has stimulated no one, but will cost everyone.</p>

Member for Twickenham correctly pointed out that shops in the high street are offering 10, 20, 30 or 40 per cent. discounts, and that this small VAT change is unlikely to have any significant impact. I have just been handed some figures from the CBI survey of retailers, which has come out today, and they show a ninth consecutive month of falling sales. Those figures cover the first fortnight of the Christmas trading period, including the first 10 days of the Government&#146;s VAT cut. A net balance of 55 per cent. of firms say that their trading is worse than expected, and the trading record is the weakest recorded since the survey began in 1983. Although the VAT cut will not deliver the Government&#146;s hoped-for benefits, tax increases for everyone earning over &#163;20,000 by 2011 will deliver a disincentive to spend and a disincentive to resuming consumer confidence in the economy.</p>

He is ignoring the long-term economic best interest of Britain for his own short-term political gain. Everything is politics: the 18.5 per cent. VAT rate that he was going to levy on us after 2011 was suppressed and kept secret at the last moment, leaving a black hole in the PBR, so we are left guessing where and how the burden will fall when the recovery comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08121768000460">We face a recession born of a credit crisis. The Prime Minister&#146;s banking recapitalisation has failed to stop the rot. Businesses and consumers are sliding closer and closer to the precipice, but he refuses to act where action is needed. We have put forward a detailed package of proposals that would tackle the real problems. We have even produced a draft Bill to establish the national loan guarantee scheme, but instead of taking up our ideas to make the bank bail-out work, he has turned his back on the consensus that existed when it was announced and instead pursues a mechanical, textbook-led approach that is simply not affordable or appropriate and which will not be effective in his Britain, where consumers are over-borrowed and starved of credit, facing certain tax increases in two years&#146; time, fearful for their jobs and seeing the value of their assets shrinking.</p>

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I shall do my best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08121768000465">I greatly welcome the contributions that have been made so far, which include contributions from those on the Conservative and the Liberal Democrat Front Benches, with their slightly different perspectives on the solution. Without wishing to put him in an invidious position, I also include the contribution made by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who offers both his frank and trenchant analysis and his readiness to consider alternative solutions, which will impress us all. It happens, coincidentally, that on this occasion I agree with almost every word that he said about what should be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08121768000466">I hope that I can indulge the House for a moment and take hon. Members back down memory lane. In the early 1970s, in the days when VAT was being conceived, I happened to be the head of the economics section at the Conservative research department and was, as it were, party to some of those initial discussions. Without going into the details of those discussions, I can tell hon. Members that two things were clear in principle: first, that any tax should have a broad coverage at a relatively modest rate; and secondly, that the rate should enjoy a degree of stability, which meant that we could not keep chopping and changing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08121768000467">That was essentially a wise judgment and, in fairness to Governments since, that practice has continued. Since that period, there have been virtually a handful of changes in the VAT rate, until now, when we are, in effect, committing ourselves to two changes in one year. The measure should be called the Value Added Tax (Changes of Rate) Order&#151;one change down and one change either back to the existing level or, as is more likely, in view of what we have been told by accident, upwards from that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08121768000468">Let me make another point in parentheses. The history of the &#146;70s, which was not very happy for Labour Governments, as has already been adverted to, shows a regular recourse to the fiscal regulator. Taxes were increased or decreased by 10 per cent. at a time by order. Those changes were designed to stimulate or curtail growth in the economy, but their effects were always well below the expected level of efficiency. That, I fear, will be the fate of today&#146;s measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08121768000469">My other point goes to the politics of the thing. My political mentor, the late Iain Macleod, who sadly died before the introduction of VAT, always used to say, in his generous way, that he was not inclined to shoot even a one-legged Santa Claus, which is both a seasonal and, I hope, a material political reference. Of course it is difficult to cast oneself as the person who wants to say no to a proposal to cut taxes. The question is whether that proposal will help the economy. Is it the most effective way of stimulating the economy to deal with the consequences that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead was so right to mention or not? That is the real test of the measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08121768000470">I want to say a couple of things about the detail of the order, because I was so impressed by representations that I received this week from a constituent&#151;I have his permission to quote from his letter to me. His representations encapsulate in detail exactly the kinds of problems that will arise. Andrew Overton runs a company in my constituency called Overview Mapping Ltd, which provides vehicle tracking solutions for big fleets of vehicles and employs some 15 employees. In fairness, I do not wish to give all the details of the company&#146;s commercial situation, but it is fairly easy to derive from that a turnover, the amount of tax revenue that Mr. Overton is already paying and the scale of his business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para26"><a name="08121768000471">Mr. Overton quotes me a figure for the decline in new sales for his business from pre-existing levels&#151;that is, pre-credit crunch levels. In general terms, new sales have fallen by an order of magnitude, going from a rapid expansion to a virtual standstill. That will give the House some indication of where Mr. Overton stands. My concern, which he illustrated to me in figures, is about the likely cost of the change. His business model relies on monthly direct debit payments, on about 3,000 monthly collections. They are collected by a firm called Eazipay Ltd and processed for him. In affect, Mr. Overton acts as a conduit for VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="81217-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08121768000472">Let us look at Mr. Overton&#146;s costs. The cost of one man-week of time to effect the changes is &#163;500. The cost of amending 3,000 direct debits, at a standard charge from Eazipay of &#163;1.50 a throw, is &#163;4,500. The cost of accounts software changes, at one man-week, is &#163;500 and the cost of sending letters to all customers is &#163;500. The total cost is &#163;6,000. That is backwards for the business, not forwards. We need to reflect on that.</p>

 May I add another example to the very good one that the hon. Gentleman has just given? I visited Cotleigh brewery in my constituency, which is incurring considerable costs not only because of the VAT reduction, but because duty on beer is increasing to offset the VAT reduction. At the end of 2009, Cotleigh brewery will incur further costs in readjusting everything. The proposal is causing serious problems for businesses throughout the country.</p>

Like most other businesses, that entrepreneur in my constituency uses Sage software. He has received a letter from his accountancy support office that says:</p>

consequences that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) mentioned. I feel that it is the wrong approach. In a world in which the choices are difficult and the situation is dire&#151;we acknowledge those facts&#151;it would be better to concentrate on solutions that are specific to business and that are specifically about the availability of credit for those businesses.</p>

 I begin by declaring an interest as a director of my family retail business, which has been in existence since my great-grandfather started it in 1888. The present times are more difficult than ever before, and I have to take the day-to-day decisions in the business, because, when life gets a bit difficult, those decisions end up being taken at the top.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08121768000479">My heart sank when I saw the leaks during the weekend before the pre-Budget report was announced. I could not understand why on earth the Government were going to reduce VAT by 2.5 per cent. I actually thought that there must be more to it; I could not believe that they would be so crass as to reduce VAT by that amount. If they wanted to make an impact and give an impetus to consumer sales, they would have had to reduce it by considerably more, which would have involved huge expense and been completely unaffordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08121768000480">I will tell the Minister what the effect of this measure has been on countless retailers&#151;every retailer&#151;throughout the country. When it was announced on the Monday, I immediately phoned the shop in Uxbridge and told my staff that we would implement the VAT reduction from the next day. That was effectively a week early, because no one would come into the shop otherwise&#151;no one would buy anything that they believed was going to be cheaper the following week. We also had lots of orders that had been placed, and we had to make the decision to take a hit on those as well. Of course, the reduction is not 2.5 per cent. In real terms, it is 2.13 per cent. Consumers trying to do the mental arithmetic have soon realised that this makes hardly any difference to the price of most items.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08121768000481">So, retailers have immediately had to take a hit. We have already heard about how they have had to put in the required software and change labelling. We decided not to do that, however, and we are still taking the appropriate amount off at the till. That is cheaper and more efficient, and I must admit that I am also making the political point to our customers, because they can then see how little they are actually getting. I have tried to be as neutral about this as possible, however. I might care about this place, but I care very much about the 30 people whom I employ&#151;probably more than about anything else with regard to that business. I have asked them whether anyone has come in and bought anything because it has been reduced by 2.13 per cent., and, of course, that is obviously not the case. Perhaps the Minister will tell me what personal purchases he has made, that he would not otherwise have made, because of the VAT reduction. If he is an honest man&#151;I know that he is&#151;he will say that it has not made a blind bit of difference to him.</p>

sensible accountant of mine has told me, many a time, that turnover is vanity, and profit is sanity. It is all very well trying to reduce prices to get people to come in, but we have not had many people coming in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08121768000483">In relation to the compliance costs, why does the Minister think that it will be &#163;5 million cheaper to re-price next year than this year? Is it because there are going to be fewer shops about? And why is familiarisation going to be so much cheaper? The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made a point about the timing of all this. What is the worst time of year to put prices up? My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said that the provision would last until 1 December next year, and that there might be some change then. But who on earth is going to put their prices up at the busiest time of the year, or afterwards when the sales are on? Retailers are going to take a hit again at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08121768000484">What is the point of all this? I agree with my party and those on my Front Bench that this is not the time to be borrowing like mad, although I understand that others take a different view. I cannot go and borrow lots of money to help my business, first because I think it would be wrong and, secondly, because the banks would not let me. So why are the Government doing this? If I am being kind, I will say that it was something that they could do quickly, but actually I think that it was a gimmick and it sounded good. When he was Chancellor, the Prime Minister loved to finish his speeches with a gimmick, and he has obviously passed that on. Had the measure not been leaked, I think that the Opposition might have thought that it was a wonderful idea, for about five seconds until we worked out what it was really all about. It is a gimmick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08121768000485">I would not mind at all if the Minister were to say that he had changed his mind, and that he was going to put the VAT rate back to 17.5 per cent. and leave it there. I would even make a pledge to the consumers of Uxbridge that I would keep my prices at the 15 per cent. level because the current VAT change will not help them at all. I urge the Minister to look at this. When those at the Treasury make changes, do they ever ask real retailers and real people what they want, or do they sit down and come up with these incredibly ridiculous schemes? I was delighted to see that the Treasury did not bother working out the impacts on all the groups listed&#151;and I am not going to go through them, as I would be attacked for being politically incorrect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08121768000486">To be honest, the whole VAT change is a gimmick that will not help, but will actually have a worse effect on retailers and poor employers. As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, after Christmas lots of people will be in big trouble. People will ask, &#147;What did the Government do?&#148; and the answer will be that they took prices down by 2.13 per cent. when they were already reduced. I have to say that that is a disaster.</p>

I say that not least because the PBR post-dated the US fiscal stimulus package of $150 billion in February, the Spanish package of $18 billion in April, the October announcement by President Sarkozy of 100,000 subsidised work contracts, the &#8364;50 billion package announced in Germany and, indeed, the Japanese package of &#163;235 billion, if my memory serves me correctly, of which &#163;20 billion&#151;almost as much as the total UK package&#151;was directed at householders with mortgages. Let us have no more of this Government pretending that they have been decisive when they have not, or that they are leading, which they most certainly are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08121768000489">If the package had been announced in a full Budget, we would have had four days of debate and a Finance Bill subject to detailed scrutiny in Committee. Alternatives for how to spend 1 per cent. of gross domestic product&#151;about &#163;12.5 billion&#151;would have been varied and very clearly put. I am sure that they would have ranged from cuts in corporation tax to allow businesses that really create jobs to keep more of the money they earn in order to sustain themselves through recession to more direct public investment and everything in between. I am sure that each and every one of those alternatives would have had some merit in its own right and would have been worthy of consideration. We are, however, where we are. We are talking about 1 per cent. of GDP; it is &#163;12.5 billion and it is the largest part of the reflationary package. The bulk of the rest was &#163;5 billion of re-profiled money for direct public investment; it was not new money and it will, of course, lead to a funding shortfall in public expenditure in two or three years&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08121768000490">My criticism of the VAT proposal was that the Government were not straight with people about it. Had it been played solely as a business measure&#151;if businesses could have kept the 2.5 per cent. extra to sustain them through the recession in order to maintain, protect and preserve as many jobs as possible&#151;there would have been some merit and honesty in it. The idea of selling it on the basis that 2.5 per cent. was coming off the price of goods and going into consumers&#146; pockets was simply wrong, not least because of the heavy discounting of 20, 30 or 40 per cent. already taking place. When I bought a present for my daughter in Dundee on Sunday, there was a 70 per cent. discount on it already, so the VAT cut is simply swamped. As I said, had this been played as providing 2.5 per cent. extra to businesses, instead of the pretence that it was going to consumers, we would have been happier with it.</p>

cost to the smallest businesses is about &#163;2,500. I fear that, if the prayer were successful, they would be required to pay a further &#163;2,500, as VAT levels would have changed twice in the space of a few months. Small businesses would be burdened with a bill not for &#163;2,500 but for &#163;5,000&#151;and, in the case cited by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), a bill not for &#163;6,000 but for &#163;12,000. That would be horrendous.</p>

When VAT was reduced, the Government compensated for that outrageously with a second increase in duty on Scotch in a single year, and by increasing the duty on fuel. The prayer calls only for the VAT change to be annulled, with no annulment of the increases in duty that were introduced to offset the VAT reduction. That would land the drinks sector, the hospitality sector and those who depend on fuel with an additional charge.</p>

seen a 37 per cent. decline in the number of cars purchased in the last quarters. People cannot purchase cars because there is not enough liquidity. There is not enough cash in the system, so the finance houses will not finance new vehicles. That is the problem, and sadly the solution provided by the Government is an incorrect one. They are providing a fiscal stimulus when what is required is more cash flowing through the banking system. It is the Government&#146;s banking solution that has not worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08121768000499">I believe that the VAT reduction was also born out of panic. It is clear that a massive economic failure is taking place. We can argue about whether it is a world downturn, and of course we acknowledge that it has international aspects; but we are clearly in a worse position than most developed countries to respond to the situation. I believe that the Government were under pressure to do something, and simply grasped at a measure that they hoped to be able to implement quickly. They grasped at the wrong measure, and I suspect that they are beginning to realise that that was a mistake.</p>

On this occasion, however, the measure has been rushed through the House, and I think that if we had had the time to debate it, a different decision would have been made. As the right hon.

 I do not quite agree with my hon. Friend on that. The point made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is right: the only protection for our constituents against an over-mighty Executive and their taking decisions on the hop is that those decisions, particularly when they pertain to tax, have to come before this House so that Members, who have to go back to their constituents and hope to be re-elected, can scrutinise those decisions before they are made. The hon. Gentleman is right to say this is a serious issue.</p>

 That is a well made point. I was merely observing that there is an exception for VAT, which is why we have the VAT cut on the table today rather than a more measured approach involving our examining more sensible measures in the Budget in the round, as we normally would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="81217-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08121768000508">The other reason why this was a foolish implementation that was too aggressive and hasty is simply the amount of notice given to businesses. I declare an interest in that I am a non-executive director of two or three businesses, and it is clear that the stress and cost involved in adjusting accounting procedures and adapting to the way businesses will behave in the short term are onerous. The estimated sum&#151;I cannot remember whose estimate it is&#151;for complying with this VAT change was about &#163;300 million, with possibly a further &#163;300 million next year.

 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way again; he has been most generous.

Because of the financial incontinence of the Government, such has been the loss of confidence in sterling that even if people are going into the shops to buy imported goods at the supposed 2.5 per cent. reduction, that sum has been far eclipsed by the loss of strength of the pound. That is impacting directly on our constituents&#146; ability to buy such goods to take home for their families.</p>

I simply say that there are better things to do with &#163;12.5 billion. We need to get the money pumping round the system. Our idea, which I hope the Government will adopt, of a loan guarantee scheme&#151;a credit guarantee scheme&#151;will make a huge difference in pumping that money round the system so that people begin to get mortgages, begin to feel confident and begin to spend money again.</p>

 But the key point is that a typical family spends &#163;900 per month on VATable goods, and for them, if the reduction is fully passed on, the tax cut means that their spending last month would leave them an additional &#163;20 at the end of this month, and every month to the end of this year, or&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) said&#151;almost &#163;300 in total. That is a fair way to deliver the stimulus because lower income households spend a larger share of their income on VAT than higher income households. It is particularly helpful for families on a tight budget and it will provide the vital stimulus that we need.</p>

 I shall join the Government in the Lobby tonight, but I am concerned about the increase in excise duty on alcohol, which will adversely affect Marston&#146;s brewery in my constituency.

 That is a matter for every household to decide. It depends on the situation in which the household finds itself. I am certain that a very large number of people will choose to spend the &#163;20 extra that they will have, on average, at the end of the month, but others will choose to save it and to rebuild their household finances. Of course, it is perfectly appropriate for them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08121768000538">I want to respond to some of the points that we have heard in the debate. Unsurprisingly, we have heard some comments about Germany, which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) mentioned. The key is to look at what the German Government are actually doing. Germany has borrowings that are significantly greater than those of the UK. On 5 November, Germany announced a &#8364;32 billion fiscal stimulus&#151;a larger stimulus, proportionately, than that in the UK. I refer the hon. Gentleman and others to what the German Chancellor said last week:</p>
<a name="81217-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="08121768001171"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We support the view of the&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08121768000539">European&#151;</p>
<a name="81217-0013.htm_brev3"><a name="08121768001172"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Commission that we need to provide 1.5 per cent. of GDP for the stimulus package to strengthen the economy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08121768000540">On Monday, the German Economy Minister said that Germany had an obligation to introduce new measures to stimulate its economy. He wants Germany to introduce tax measures totalling &#8364;25 billion next year. The chief economist of DekaBank, Ulrich Kater, made the point that reducing VAT would have been more efficient than the methods that have been adopted. In Germany, the key is to look beyond some of the words to see the decisions that are being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08121768000541">This move is the right stimulus for families, for businesses and for the UK economy and I commend the order to the House.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_19"><a name="81217-0013.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="08121768001195"><h5 align="left">4.3 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="08121768000543"><a name="81217-0013.htm_spnew16"><a name="08121768001456"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 I thank the Minister for giving me 100 seconds to respond to a long and complex debate. I shall not say a great deal about his contribution. He got off to a good start by reminding us about the 1997 fiscal framework and suggested to me that chutzpah is a necessary qualification for being a Treasury Minister, which he has now done twice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08121768000544">There were two major contributions to the debate, and I just want to respond to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and the Conservative spokesman, who brought up two major issues. First, of course this is all overshadowed by the banking system and the lack of credit, and that is what we have to focus on. I have spoken about that volubly and at length, so I totally agree with that. The subject of what exactly we should do is more controversial. The Conservative proposal for guaranteed credit may have an important role, but, as I pointed out on Monday, if it is work it effectively means the nationalisation of credit. That, of course, would have major public finance implications that I do not think they have yet thought through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08121768000545">The other major issue is whether we believe that any fiscal stimulus is necessary. I am perfectly willing to entertain the dangerous idea that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead may be right and that such a stimulus may not work. If that is so, however, they should be in Washington, not lecturing us here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81217-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08121768000546">What is being proposed is just the faintest echo of what is happening throughout the western world, and especially in the US. The American Congress and the new US Administration are preparing a stimulus that is about 30 times as big as the British stimulus, in a context of even weaker public finances than ours. If it does not work, the consequences for the western economies will be catastrophic. As I said&#151;</p>

 I will be relatively brief. These two changes to the rules of our parliamentary contributory pension scheme go some way towards righting the wrongs that have occurred in the past, will be beneficially applied for Members overall, and will in some cases help to prevent what may have been abuse in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08121768001089">The first change relates to retained benefits. As you will be aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, retained benefits are the restrictions that apply to members of our scheme who have been members of another scheme, particularly a better paid one than a parliamentary scheme. Members who have retained benefits will often reach the ceiling of the amount that they can earn through our scheme well before they are due to retire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08121768001090">The Government recognised that that was unnecessary in modern conditions in the Finance Act 2004, which took away the compulsion for scheme sponsors to operate a retained benefit scheme. The problem is that if scheme sponsors&#151;including ours, the Treasury&#151;were to accept that, there would be a considerable increase in their costs. The Government, in line with many private sector scheme sponsors, have said that that would not be an acceptable increase to the burden on the scheme. <i> [Interruption.]</i> It would help me enormously if hon. Gentlemen would not have a conference in the Chamber while I am speaking. They could perhaps have it elsewhere, or be a bit quieter. It is quite difficult to put across a fairly complex point that is not always terribly well understood in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08121768001091">What is proposed in the motion, which has been accepted by the Government, is an arrangement whereby those who are affected by retained benefits can remain members of the scheme, and may continue to contribute, in a way that is much fairer. At the moment, quite a number of Members are contributing at a level that means that they will not see the benefit of the money that they are putting in; they are spending their money for nothing. That is clearly an unacceptable situation.</p>

 I have a simple question for the hon. Gentleman. He said that the proposal, which I accept and support, has been accepted by the Government. Surely the reality is that it is not a Government matter, but a House matter? The Government&#146;s view is of course of interest, but in the end it should not persuade anybody either way, should it?</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention, but of course the reality is that if the House were to put forward a motion that imposed an increased burden on  <br>

<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>17 Dec 2008 : Column 1163</b><br>
the scheme sponsor, which is the Government, the Government would be perfectly entitled to move a motion against it, and then we would not have the money to implement the measures. We therefore have to move by consent on these matters. In present circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Government to accept an amendment that would increase substantially the cost to the taxpayers; they are bearing rather a lot at the moment, and it would look rather greedy if we were to try to insist on such an increase. We are trying to find a mechanism that does not impose a huge additional burden on the Government, but that nevertheless rights a serious wrong affecting Members of the House, particularly those who saved significantly for pensions before they became Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08121768001094">The proposal will allow Members who are affected by retained benefits to change the basis of their membership of the scheme; they may go on to a new level, and contribute towards a sixtieths scheme. The present two alternatives are a fortieths or a fiftieths scheme. The sixtieths scheme will not be as beneficial, because in any given year they will not accrue as much money as they would at fortieths or fiftieths. However, it will mean that they can continue to remain members and contribute to the scheme, because at sixtieths, retained benefits do not apply under present law. They can contribute at one sixtieth without limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08121768001095">That means that those Members would not be expected to pay as much for their special scheme as those who are on a one fortieth scheme, who currently pay 10 per cent., or those who are on a one fiftieth scheme, who pay 6 per cent. It is proposed in the motion that they should pay at 5.5 per cent. rather than 6 per cent. of their salaries, and they can do that without prejudicing their rights under the retained benefits regime and without prejudicing their right to remain in the scheme for as long as they remain in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08121768001096">If Members came out of the scheme because of the problem with retained benefits, it would mean that they would no longer have the benefit of a death in service grant to their partner or spouse. That, again, is pretty unfair on Members. The proposal gets over those problems. It does not totally solve them, but it creates no cost to the scheme sponsor. Those who are at present trapped in an extremely unattractive situation can escape from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08121768001097">Members will have to make a selection. All those coming in new at the next general election will have to decide whether they want to be on the one sixtieth scheme, the one fiftieth scheme or the one fortieth scheme, and they will contribute appropriately. Following the making of the order, it will be possible for those who are at present on the one fiftieth or the one fortieth scheme to come out of that and to move to the new scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08121768001098">The Government&#146;s proposal is that that should be a once-and-for-all decision. I am not sure whether that is necessary, and I hope they may think again about that. Members&#146; circumstances change over time. People are often in the House for many years and they may wish to change from one scheme to another. We&#151;the trustees&#151;have asked the Government Actuary whether there would be any significant cost if Members could make the selection after every general election. The Government Actuary says that the cost would be insignificant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08121768001099">We have also consulted the staff of the House in the pensions unit as to whether that would involve any significant cost or problem for them, and they confirmed to me that it would not. I am therefore not sure why we cannot allow Members to make the selection after every general election. Be that as it may, I strongly recommend that right hon. and hon. Members approve the motion today, because it is very much for the benefit of Members as a whole and will right a fairly severe injustice which has applied up to now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08121768001100">The second part of the motion relates to ill-health retirement. The trustees have found that the present scheme is too inflexible. Somebody who becomes very seriously ill or disabled and is no longer able to carry on serving as a Member of Parliament or, probably, to take up any particularly remunerative employment must prove that to us as trustees, and must get a doctor and sometimes a specialist to confirm that that is the case. We, the trustees, have a consultant medical practitioner who would assess that on an independent basis and advise the trustees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08121768001101">These are difficult decisions to make, because there is often quite a fine line between not being able to do things and being able to do them, but with some difficulty. We have Members in the House who are blind, who are in wheelchairs, who have all sorts of afflictions, yet manage to carry on a very successful parliamentary career. Therefore, no one of those conditions would be enough. The condition has to be permanent, ongoing and unlikely ever to get any better before we decide that we will grant that early retirement. It is a generous scheme, similar to most others outside the House, but it means that even quite a young Member could retire on ill-health grounds and be paid the full pension that he or she would have received if they had stayed here until they were 65.</p>

 Can the hon. Gentleman give any indication of the number of Members who have applied&#151;in the past 10 years, say&#151;to be compensated under the provision that he has just described?</p>

 The past 10 years is about the whole time in which I have been a trustee. I would have thought that the number was about 30 or 35&#151;something of that order. Not all such applications have been approved, but some have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08121768001104">The difficulty is that medical situations are often a moving target. There have been radical improvements in medical science, so conditions that were impossible to treat a few years ago can now respond very well to treatment. Furthermore, we do not know what the position will be in another five or 10 years. We have to make a decision based on a snapshot in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08121768001105">The situation means that, when we are not happy with the position of a Member, we have to turn them down, even though they might have quite concerning conditions. Again, we are not particularly happy with that. We now propose a two-tier ill-health retirement scheme, which is common outside this place in the private sector. At the moment, there is nothing that we can do to assist somebody who is suffering considerably but not so badly that they cannot do anything, or somebody who has a condition that our medical advisers  <br>

tell us could be overcome with treatment, after which they could carry on working. We are therefore proposing a two-tier arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08121768001106">One of the tiers is clear: if we are absolutely satisfied about the degree of a Member&#146;s disability and all our and their medical advisers agree, then we will give that Member their full lifetime pension, starting immediately. If Members have a disability of a lower order&#151;not so severe as to qualify them for the full lifetime pension&#151;the new scheme will say that they can retire and take their pension straight away without penalty, but they will get as pension only what their contributions to date will earn. So there is an advantage to them, because they will get the money earlier without any penalty, but the quantum will be only what can be bought with what they and the scheme sponsor have paid in to date. We think that idea much fairer; it enables those who are ill but who do not fully qualify to retire on a reasonable pension and get it early, and it does not prevent those who are much more severely affected from a health point of view from retiring immediately with a full pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08121768001107">The only other part of the proposal is that we would reserve the right to review people&#146;s conditions, either up or down. If we find that somebody to whom we have given a full pension has suddenly fully recovered, is capable of doing absolutely everything and is earning a fortune doing some other job, we might say, &#147;Well, hang on&#151;perhaps the state is being a bit too generous here.&#148; The recoveries that some people make can be remarkable, as we have seen in all sorts of instances. The proposal enables us to move people up or down the scale if the appropriate evidence is available. We believe that to be the right way to proceed, and I recommend the motion to the House.</p>

 Both of the proposals seem eminently sensible. I am grateful to the chairman and his colleagues, the trustees, for considering these important matters. These things need careful deliberation, as they would for anyone else planning for their retirement. My intervention was not to suggest that if extra money were asked for from the Treasury there was not a Government interest. My understanding of the package is that it would reduce the Treasury&#146;s liability, but perhaps the Deputy Leader of the House could confirm that in a second.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08121768001109">I have two brief points, one of which relates to the first motion, which seems eminently sensible because it gives greater flexibility. That is something we would wish for others outside this place, so we are not asking for anything special. That flexibility means we can take less, or more, from our salary. We will have three choices as to how much is deducted and three choices on the length of time over which we can contribute. The proposal and that flexibility are both eminently sensible. I support what the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) said because people should be able to vary the arrangement at the beginning of each Parliament. That seems an appropriate response for the reasons that he gave: people&#146;s circumstances change and they might want to contribute more quickly to reach the maximum of the pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08121768001110">I apologise if the hon. Gentleman said this, but I want to repeat it because I think it is important. I understand that we are one of the only groups of people who are limited to a pension with a two-thirds maximum in relation to our finishing salary. That does not apply across the work force in general, but because we are governed by a special arrangement in statute, we are kept to it. The public need to know that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="08121768001111"><a name="81217-0014.htm_spnew8"><a name="08121768001995"><b>Sir John Butterfill:</b>
 That is not totally correct. If Members reach the maximum level before they are 65, they can no longer continue contributing until they are 65. Once they are 65, they can resume contributions.</p>

 I have not quite addressed post-65 circumstances yet, but I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. People who retire at the conventional retirement age would be able to contribute to a pension that would only be up to two thirds of their final salary, but he says that if people continue working beyond that, they could pick that process up again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08121768001113">My second point is that the hon. Gentleman made the extremely good point that there must be a system that allows flexibility about the amount of money people are given if they retire on ill-health grounds, which does not treat everyone as if they were the same, because obviously they are not the same. One given lump sum or settlement would be clearly inappropriate in the different circumstances that may exist. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, we need the flexibility to conduct a review if a person&#146;s health gets much worse, or if they miraculously get much better, either by virtue of science of by some other means. The public would not expect anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08121768001114">I hope that the House will support these eminently sensible proposals.</p>

 Earlier this year, the House debated the report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries regarding parliamentary pay, pensions and allowances. I am sure that many Members will remember that debate, although most of the speeches and comments related to the more newsworthy items of pay and allowances, rather than parliamentary pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08121768001116">Despite that, one of the motions passed at the end of the debate was a recommendation from the report&#151;namely, that members of the pensions fund with retained benefits should be allowed to opt for a one-sixtieth accrual rate, in return for paying reduced contributions, provided that off-setting savings could be found to make the change cost neutral. Ensuring that any change is cost neutral is important and I am pleased to see that the Government Actuary&#146;s Department feels that the proposals achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08121768001117">The changes suggested to the pension scheme are right and proper.

I appreciate that there has been some debate as regards the percentages involved, but the proposals before us provide a sensible halfway measure, ensuring that those who receive less actually pay less, while ensuring that those who do not have retained benefits do not end up picking up the slack.</p>

We must recognise the concern about the existing structure, whereby the ill-health pension for serving Members does not distinguish as to whether he or she is deemed capable of being able to carry out some other form of employment. Moreover, once a medical assessment has been made, the current procedure does not allow for reviews to determine whether it is appropriate to continue with the payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="81217-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08121768001119">I therefore welcome today&#146;s proposals, which create a two-tier level for serving MPs, which is a structure that is common in the private sector, as well as in other public service schemes. There will be a higher level of payment for those scheme members whom the trustees feel are permanently incapable of doing any form of work and a lower level of payment where it is felt that, although the member is deemed permanently incapable of performing the duties of an MP, he or she can none the less do some other types of work. It is also right that once an assessment has been made, the case and medical history should be subject to review, as felt necessary by the trustees.</p>

 I, too, pay enormous tribute to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill). I am not sure whether the job of looking after pensioners in Parliament automatically goes to a Member of Parliament who represents Bournemouth, because of the concerns of constituents there, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has plenty of experience of dealing with his constituents&#146; pension issues down in Bournemouth. I am also grateful to him because, as a long-established member of the all-party Spain group, I know that he knows the difference between a good bottle of Rioja and a not-so-good bottle of Rioja.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="81217-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08121768001122">We should also pay tribute to the other trustees and the staff who administer the scheme. Every hon. Member, from across the House, would agree that they receive a personal service from the staff who operate the scheme. Those staff sometimes have to explain matters to hon. Members whose main interest in life has not necessarily been their pension arrangements and whose first level of expertise is not in pensions.</p>

Those proposals have come from the trustees and are the result of considerable consideration by them over the past couple of years, and they were broadly outlined in principle in the debate on 24 January this year. The new accrual rate in particular makes sense. It is unfair for those who have significant retained benefits not to gain any further benefit, despite the fact that some of them pay in at 6 per cent. or, in a few cases, at 10 per cent.</p>

I am therefore grateful that instead of the current system, whereby, as has been said, either 6 per cent. of salary is paid for an accrual rate of one fiftieth or 10 per cent. is paid for a rate of one fortieth, we will introduce a new scheme, whereby 5.5 per cent. will be paid in for an accrual rate of one sixtieth. That is simply fair.</p>

 I want to allow the hon. Gentleman to correct what I said or at least to put the Government&#146;s position. My proposition earlier was that the new scheme would be less expensive to the Treasury&#151;I think that I was correct in saying that it would effectively be cost-neutral&#151;but can the Minister confirm that as he understands it the scheme will certainly not cost the public any more and that the objective of the whole package is to be cost-neutral at most?</p>

 I was coming to that. The Government reckon that the new accrual rate will cost something in the region of 0.4 per cent. of future service payments in the scheme, but similarly, the benefit of the changes to the provisions relating to retirement through ill health will be something in the region of 0.4 per cent., so the two elements will balance each other out. That is why we are glad to say that what is being put forward this afternoon is entirely cost-neutral.</p>

Member for Bournemouth, West pointed out the concerns that many have raised. First, at the moment, everyone is treated equally in the decisions that the trustees have to make, despite the fact that there may be considerable differences between somebody who is clearly permanently incapable of undertaking any future paid employment and someone who thinks that they may be able to do some work, but not the arduous work of a Member of Parliament. Furthermore, there is a concern that there is no system of review at the moment. As has been pointed out, this is not so much a question of sudden miracles occurring in people&#146;s medical conditions as of the fact that their conditions might go through different phases or cycles, during which it might be possible for them to return to work. As we know, returning to work is one of the best forms of cure for many people. We are aware that it is important for there to be a system of review.</p>

 I apologise if my hon. Friend has already covered this point. I do not wish to be accused of hypocrisy, as I will obviously be a beneficiary of the pension scheme. Does he accept that, while it is important for there to be such a pension scheme, questions are bound to be asked about the difference between our scheme and those of the millions of ordinary people who are now being forced out of final salary schemes? There is speculation, to say the least, in the present circumstances about what sort of pension most of our constituents will receive when they reach retirement age.</p>

 I very much hope that my hon. Friend will not be retiring for some considerable time.

pension arrangements. That is why the Government have been keen to ensure that these proposals, in their unity, will not cost the taxpayer a single penny more, and that the package that we are introducing today will be cost-neutral. That point could not be more tellingly made than in the present global economic circumstances, but it also behoves us to look carefully at the way in which we look after ourselves. That is why it is right that there should be a tightening of the provisions for retirement through ill health, as the trustees have proposed.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) was quite right to point out that some of our constituents are having difficulties with their pensions, but the House should be aware that, of about 770 Members who left the Commons in the past 10 years, only 34 qualified for the full pension.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. It is also true that many former Members of Parliament have to rely on the charitable funds that the House provides because, in the past, provision has simply not been adequate. Those who commit themselves to public service through the House are owed a debt of gratitude. We do not want to overstate that, but it is important that we should look at that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="81217-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08121768001132">On the matter of retirement through ill health, it is important that we should introduce the two tiers that the trustees are calling for. That will mean that those who are permanently incapable of any work&#151;including work in the House of Lords&#151;would get the full pension to which they would be entitled if they were not retiring through ill health and had been able to work until the age of 65. Others, who have only a partial incapacity and who are not permanently incapable of any further work&#151;and who might end up in the House of Lords&#151;would receive a pension only in relation to what they had so far earned by virtue of their contributions and the Treasury contributions, but that would not be actuarially reduced by virtue of the fact that they were retiring early.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="81217-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08121768001133">It is also important that there should be regular reviews. My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North asked the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="81217-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08121768001134">Finally, the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said that this was not a Government concern. I think that there are only two regards in which it is a Government concern. The first is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North said, the eyes of the nation are on how we make provision for our own pensions, so it behoves us at this particular time to be careful not to incur additional costs to the taxpayer. The taxpayer already makes significant contributions to the parliamentary pensions fund. Secondly, we are presented with a cost-neutral package&#151;as I have already said, a saving of 0.4 per cent. in one direction and an additional cost, we believe, of 0.4 per cent. in the other direction.</p>

 Prompted by what the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) said, I think I am right in saying&#151;the Deputy Leader of the House may confirm it&#151;that the average length of service for MPs is for fewer than 10 years, so we are not talking about large numbers of people with huge pensions accrued over many years. It is too easily assumed by people outside that we are here for ever, whereas many MPs are actually here for a short time rather than a long one.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I do not want to undermine the parliamentary contributory pension fund, or, for that matter, contributory pension funds in any other public service. My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) and I represent remarkably similar seats and many of our constituents will earn considerably less than we earn as MPs. Many of their public sector pensions may be secure, but that does not necessarily mean that they will be very large.</p>

accepted that recommendation, and considered it desirable for the post to be filled on a part-time rather than a full-time basis. That underlines the non-executive nature of the role, and is entirely in line with similar public sector appointments. The panel appointed by Mr. Speaker took the same view. Mr. Speaker also wrote to a number of eminent public figures seeking their opinions on the matter, and they were overwhelmingly in favour of moving to a part-time appointment. So, too, were the leading firms of recruitment consultants with whom the panel discussed the question. The post was therefore advertised as involving a commitment of, typically, three days a week.</p>

That decision, too, was made after extensive discussion and careful consideration. Again, the panel asked leading consultants for their opinions. These were consistent with the advice received from others, which was that if we really wanted to attract a first-class candidate for the post&#151;and in the view of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, the post was too important for us to settle for anything less&#151;we should not reduce the salary from the level set by Parliament.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman referred to the criteria that were adopted.

Was public service&#151;that somewhat devalued but to me extremely important factor&#151;taken into account? As I said in the Chamber recently in the context of the Information Commissioner, we keep comparing senior public servants doing important jobs with those in the private sector in terms of remuneration, while not taking into account what I consider to be the vital issue of devotion to public service, which often involves a sacrifice in view of what the individual in question could earn in the private sector.</p>

I can tell the House that two very credible candidates dropped out of this competition, in one case at the very last minute, because they had accepted other offers.</p>

The Committee on Standards in Public Life emphasised this and stressed how important it is for the Electoral Commission to have strong direction and leadership. Accordingly, the post was offered and accepted, with the consent of the Treasury, on the basis of &#163;150,000 a year for a part-time appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81217-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08121780000028">However, events have moved on. It became clear to the Speaker&#146;s Committee that the House was unlikely to support the remuneration proposal. We therefore had to reopen the whole question and, in essence, to invite the candidate, Jenny Watson, to accept a pay cut. I recognise that this could hardly be described as best practice, but it reflected the situation we were in. We were very fortunate indeed that Jenny Watson was prepared to go along with this; she could so easily have walked away from it, and the fact that she did not do so is a testament to her commitment to public service and the job. The revised salary of &#163;100,000 a year is very close, pro rata, to the salary of the incumbent, which now stands at &#163;155,000 a year and which would have been uprated next year in line with a previous resolution of the House. It is also well within the range of salaries for non-executive roles of this kind in public service.</p>

Jenny Watson has a breadth of experience few others could match. She has chaired a large public sector organisation&#151;the Equal Opportunities Commission&#151;with distinction and flair. No less important, she has experience as a regulator. Most crucially in the context of the role it is now proposed she be appointed to perform, she has demonstrated that she can lead an organisation through change, enabling it to develop and evolve without losing its focus, self-confidence or drive. She knows her way around Westminster and local government, and she has an acute understanding of diversity issues.

 I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers), and I am pleased that we are taking both these motions together because the two issues are indivisible.

Gentleman was candid enough with the House to indicate that some of these things had not been thought through, and that does not increase my confidence that the decision we are going to make this afternoon is the correct one. To put it simply, we should send the homework back. Wider consultation should be carried out within the various party groups about what is required of this post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="81217-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08121780000036">Originally the salary was going to be &#163;150,000 for three days a week, and I believe the hon. Gentleman said it was felt that that could not get past the House of Commons&#151;hon. Members may check that in the official record, if necessary. How right he was. Just because the amount is reduced like this, in an unsophisticated way, that does not mean that a salary of &#163;100,000 for this post is acceptable&#151;it is not acceptable to me, because I think it a disproportionate amount. The hon. Gentleman then prayed in aid recruitment consultants who thought this figure was okay&#151;well they would, wouldn&#146;t they? If ever there were an abuse and waste of public money, it is recruitment consultants. It is time this House of Commons baulked at this sort of thing, because many people are qualified to do this job, could do it to the satisfaction of all the political groups in this House and throughout the United Kingdom, and would do it for a much reduced salary.</p>

One of the reasons why I shall invite the House to reject both these motions&#151;I think that we will probably have to divide the House on the first one&#151;is because I want us to send the homework back. If we reject the appointment, this good lady can still be considered, but that will be following further consultation and reflection by the hon.

 The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) and I were both present for a debate about a fortnight ago on the salary of the Information Commissioner. Does he take the view that jobs such as that one and this&#151;public sector jobs on which Parliament has to make the decision, of which there are a few&#151;should have comparable salaries? Should the Information Commissioner&#146;s job be valued at the same worth&#151;per week, per month or per year&#151;as that of the chair of the Electoral Commission?</p>

 The jobs should probably be in the same band, but there is a danger of our comparing an apple with an orange. The hon.

 My understanding&#151;and I was here for the previous debate&#151;is that the Information Commissioner is an executive position. This debate is about the chair of a body, which is somewhat different. The Information Commissioner will be on &#163;140,000 a year for a five-day week. The individual we are discussing&#151;I do not know whether she is suitable for the job or not, and I make no comment&#151;will be on the equivalent of nearly &#163;167,000 a year, which is quite a bit more than the incumbent who is on &#163;155,000.</p>

Friend not agree that it is rather important to ensure right now that we have a chair of the Electoral Commission? The debate about the commission&#146;s future, which is important, needs to be held. The House is halfway through consideration of the Political Parties and Elections Bill, which will have substantial implications for the work of the Electoral Commission in the future. Does my hon. Friend not agree that in principle it would be a very good idea if we made sure that the Electoral Commission had a new chair, who could take the issues forward? Is he sure in his own mind that using the debate this evening as a substitute for the proper debate on the future of the Electoral Commission that ought to be held is a path that should not be pursued?</p>

 My hon. Friend rightly raises the critical stage we have reached both for the legislation before this House and for the work of the Electoral Commission. Of course, it is a sensitive time. I would not choose to make the changes at this stage. It is not for the House of Commons to micro-manage the situation, but my point is still valid. For instance, was it impossible to ask the existing chairman to stay on for a period? In a sense, my hon. Friend&#146;s point supports the notion that that chairman should see things through and should provide continuity. Presumably, there is a vice-chairman, who is no doubt on a substantial salary. He or she could act up. The timing is not ideal, but if we let things go we will have abdicated our responsibility to our constituents, who, if they saw this debate or noticed any reports of it, would see it as a disproportionate expenditure and an offence at this time of constraints. That is my case.</p>

Of all the ethical and regulatory watchdogs, the Electoral Commission may be the most important.</p>

That was picked up by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the ethical watchdog that presides over all the others. The hon.

That would have forced the Government to think again.&#148;</p>

 I want to start where the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) left off. I support the Electoral Commission as a body. We need it to be strong and robust and I wish it to be stronger and more robust in future than it has been until now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81217-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08121780000082">I am glad that the proposal that the commission has some political appointees has been accepted. People with political experience will help it to be more robust; they will be a minority, not a majority, and will make it do its job better. We should change our procedures so that when the Electoral Commission makes a recommendation, such as the one about individual voter registration, which has been the most controversial one recently and was referred to by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), it is automatically laid before the House. There has to be some mechanism&#151;it might be proposed by the representative of the Speaker&#146;s Committee&#151;but there should be a motion before the House so that if the Government want to change it they have to table an amendment. We would thus be able to see what the Electoral Commission&#151;the independent body set up by Parliament&#151;is proposing. Such a motion should also be laid within, say, 21 days of the commission making its recommendation. At present, when the commission makes a report, the Government can sit on it&#151;they can deliberate, form a view, stall, delay and disagree, and in the end they can use their payroll vote and their majority to block things.</p>

Through him, I thank his staff, who have been extremely helpful and made it their business to be available to MPs, both on a party and individual basis. They attend our conferences to make sure that our parties understand the score and they do their job well and publicly, so I hope we can recognise that the Electoral Commission under its first chair has done a good job.</p>

Not least because of her recent job as the chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission, in which role I have seen her work, she comes with great credibility and great authority. Hers is a very good appointment. As the hon. Gentleman said in his introduction, it is surprising in a way that her name is still in the frame, given that, putting it crudely, she got messed around in the process. She applied; she was asked to do the job at one salary, but in the end, people said, &#147;We&#146;d like you to do the job, but we&#146;re cutting the salary by a third.&#148;</p>

This is a different role. Of course, the Electoral Commission will have a chief executive as well. Question: what is the right salary? I am always uncomfortable once we get into six-figure sums for salaries for part-time jobs, but I am persuaded that, given where we are, we probably cannot get someone of the quality of the proposed new chair to do the job for less than that sort of money.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may not like the Electoral Commission. I have heard mutterings that he does not like it as a body, but it is an important, robust body, and we need it. If we are to give it authority, it needs a chair who will have authority, speak with authority, be independent and robust and speak in the public domain, and Jennifer Watson will do that in my view. It is also good that the chair will be a woman, but that is a separate but not irrelevant issue, given that one of the deficiencies of the House is the continuing relatively small number of women who are Members of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="81217-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08121780000092">The salary is appropriate, given where we are, for the job at this time. We should be grateful to Jennifer Watson for accepting the revised terms, which are much less than she had accepted. It is clear from the proposal that it will be a three-day-a-week job. She will do it full-time for three days a week. She may do more than 24 hours over the three days. I have not heard the result of the vote in the European Parliament on the European working time directive. Personally, I support the UK&#146;s continuing opt-out, and I hope that the European Parliament has voted for that. I imagine that she might do more than 24 hours a week, which would be three eight-hour days.</p>

that the salary should be the same as that of MPs. We have debated MPs&#146; salaries. We have come to the view that they should be about 60 grand. Our constituents probably think that that is about right on balance. Some of them think that it is too much; some think that it is too little. However, I want to make the wider point, although we cannot debate it now, that there is a debate to be had about the level of top salaries in the public and the private sectors. For me, the issue is that, when some of the private sector has grossly and excessively paid people ridiculous and silly salaries and failed&#151;we have now seen the result of that ridiculous overstretching&#151;it is not surprising that the public sector has had to offer higher salaries to be in the same market for good people.</p>

 I will come to that in a moment, but the reality is that people have a choice&#151;whether to go to a private or a public sector job&#151;and often, with this sort of salary, they may choose a public sector job, as Jennifer Watson did, but without such a salary, they may go off to the private sector.</p>

 Of course, the hon. Gentleman is right that the time is now ripe for a re-evaluation of top salaries in the public sector. However, does he acknowledge that the salaries attached to jobs such as this emerge from cosy, self-seeking, incestuous cabals in the recruitment agencies who promote that level of pay with little reference to other areas of the public sector? This matter has a strong resemblance to the so-called independent remuneration committees that are so evident and ubiquitous in the private sector.

From what has been said in the debate, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), she sounds like an excellent candidate for the role. However, the direction of my remarks will be to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay). The two motions&#151;one to appoint a specific individual and the other dealing with the remuneration of whoever the chair of the Electoral Commission might be&#151;will be taken together. That means that because I have severe reservations about the remuneration, which I will come to in a moment when I speak to the second motion, I will be driven to reject this candidate at this stage under the first motion.</p>

There was then, I suspect, a debate among his Committee, and perhaps others, to the effect that that might not find favour in the House of Commons and that it should rethink the approach and the remuneration. I suspect strongly, although I have no direct evidence, that he and his colleagues were right about that, and that a proposal for &#163;150,000 for a three-day week would not have succeeded before this Chamber.</p>

That is not a vast pay increase&#151;it is in the order of 8 per cent., off the top of my head&#151;but it is a pay increase. That causes me concern, given that we are discussing the chair of a body, as I said in an intervention&#151;the point was picked up by the hon.

The reason why they do not leave, and the reason why they are prepared to take a pay cut when they come here, is the notion of public service.

Member for Gosport pointed out, that that may not get through the House of Commons, and she was asked to reconsider the job at &#163;100,000 for three days a week. She said yes&#151;or the motion would not be before us. That is someone who has knocked off a third of the pay for the role that they thought they were going to get, and she clearly seems to have a notion of public service&#151;unless she could not get another job, although we know that she has one, which is another three days a week or so.</p>

There was a motion on the Order Paper some three weeks ago for a salary of &#163;150,000. I looked at that and thought it was excessive. It was equivalent to a full-time salary of &#163;250,000 a year for a chairmanship. I immediately banged down an amendment to reduce that salary to the level of salary of a Member of Parliament. I thought that that was a reasonable level of pay for a public servant. Excellent arguments have been made about  <br>

public service, which is a large factor. With the pension and other benefits that go with it, a salary of &#163;250,000 a year is a very big deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="81217-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08121780000124">Now, Mr. Chairman&#151;sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker; I think it is because we are debating the subject of the chairman of the commission that I keep making the mistake. When my amendment was tabled, the motion was withdrawn and immediately replaced with a motion for a salary not of &#163;150,000, but of &#163;100,000. That equates to &#163;167,000 a year, with pension and other benefits, which is still quite a substantial salary for such a chairmanship position. It is about the same level of salary as the Prime Minister gets. I thought it appropriate to table an amendment reducing the &#163;100,000 to the level of salary of a Member of Parliament. That amendment was not selected so we will not debate it tonight.</p>

That is quite a substantial sum, so this is not an insubstantial debate. There was a nice round figure of &#163;150,000, and now there is a nice round figure of &#163;100,000, and I wondered where it came from. Let me tell hon. Members where it came from. It was plucked out of thin air. There is no analysis, no job evaluation, no Hay-MSL comparison of salaries. All those tools are available.</p>

Were they paid a percentage of the salary? I suspect that they were, in which case they would want to see the salary higher&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Higher or lower? Higher. That is what recruitment consultants do. I know that extremely well, and the House knows that. Was there a formal analysis? Was Hay-MSL used? Was there any job evaluation? If there was, why has that evidence not been presented to the House? It seems to me that the &#163;100,000 was plucked out of thin air.</p>

When pay is being decided&#151;that is what we are doing tonight&#151;it is absolutely right that performance should be considered. What we are considering represents an increase of about 8 per cent. on the current incumbent&#146;s salary and we would all agree that performance in the job is an essential consideration.</p>

What has happened during the period of the Electoral Commission&#146;s existence? If we look at the facts, we see that it has been a conspicuous failure.

While I am on the subject, I should say that the safety of elections is also spiralling out of control. Electoral fraud&#151;particularly postal vote fraud&#151;has been getting more and more common during the Electoral Commission&#146;s term of office.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a perfectly reasonable set of complaints about our political process, but none of them is fairly directed at the Electoral Commission.

Those matters, however, are not matters for debate this evening. It is important not only that we make the appointment and ensure that the Electoral Commission should have access to the powers and constraints under the legislation that is currently passing through the House to do its job, but that it is headed in a way that makes that possible, that a public announcement is made that that is the way forward that we all want to take and, above all, that we support the independence and future work of the Electoral Commission.</p>

The more we have given away to so-called independents, the less respect we have had, because we have become less and less powerful, and less and less able to represent our constituents. We talk about independence as though it is some kind of formula but, in truth, no one is independent. Everyone brings their baggage with them. If they have no baggage, it is almost certain that they have very little judgment. So we are starting off in a difficult set of circumstances.

Members have said, the establishment of the Electoral Commission has not led to more people voting, or to young people getting more excited about politics. Nor has it led to any greater respect for people in this House. Things have got worse, not better. Is there a correlation? Well, no, because the Electoral Commission is pretty unimportant as a body. It has done nothing worth talking about, barring getting into the headlines from time to time to drag hon. Members over the coals for failing to report something on time.

It is a non-job; it is not terribly important to anybody outside this place, and we are navel-gazing again if we think that it is. As for the idea that we should pay someone &#163;167,000 a year to do the job&#151;what an affront! It is an affront at a time when people are losing their jobs hand over fist, often through no fault of their own. However, we could trace the blame for this to the people who are paid that kind of money, and more, and who have made an awful mess of the companies that they are supposed to be running. We are getting into a similar mess with this job. It is simply not worth it.</p>

What I am not prepared to do is continually undermine the power and strength of this House by giving it away to unelected people in quangoland who, if they had any respect for this place, really should not be doing these jobs at all. It seems to me that we have to be proper, right and judicial in this House in setting down the rules. If that fails, then we have the police. If it is felt that people have acted unlawfully, refer it to the police; do not go through this nonsense where these people spend 12 months testing out a decent Member of this House only to decide that there is no case to answer.

commission&#146;s proposal for individual voter registration would help to put right some of the things that have gone wrong in the past 10 years, so we need a more general debate. I would welcome a more general debate on appointments and salaries for similar reasons. However, we are not here this evening to talk about that. We are talking about the appointment of a chair of the Electoral Commission, and the remuneration that that chair should receive. The Electoral Commission does exist, and until the House abolishes it, there it is. It needs a chair; it needs to be properly led. That is what we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81217-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08121780000182">As for the appointment process itself, I absolutely reject the criticism that the selection process was not properly conducted or considered. It was rigorous, it was scrupulous, and it was properly conducted in every detail. I am proud to be associated with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81217-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08121780000183">The remuneration was also carefully considered. Our starting point was the 11th report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. We did not start by asking, &#147;How much should we give Jenny Watson?&#148; We started by listening to the Committee, reading its 11 report, and noting its call for a refocusing on the part of the Electoral Commission and its demand for leadership and direction from the commission. On that basis we consulted, discussed and asked about the terms and conditions that we would need to offer in order to recruit the very best candidates. We managed to reduce 37 candidates to five and then to four, we interviewed them all, and I am confident that we chose the best. We went into the process with our eyes wide open, knowing exactly what we were seeking to do. It was on that basis that we decided that the right salary was &#163;150,000 a year for a three-day week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81217-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08121780000184">We are, of course, talking about March 2008. The world has changed since March 2008, but when the proposal was made, it was to meet the wish of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that the motion proposing a salary of &#163;150,000 a year for a three-day week carried the words &#147;Queen&#146;s recommendation signified&#148;, meaning that it was acceptable to the Treasury.</p>

 In April, the Government produced a White Paper entitled &#147;Pharmacy in England: Building on Strengths&#148;. In response to that White Paper, the Dispensing Doctors&#146; Association carried out a survey of 6,000 of its patients. It had two key findings. The first was that 95 per cent. of the surveyed patients would find it difficult or inconvenient if their surgeries stopped dispensing. The second was that half of the surveyed households include at least one person over 65. It was unsurprising, therefore, that hundreds of my constituents wrote to me to oppose the proposals.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for giving me permission to hold this debate on the Floor of the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08121780000583">I shall begin by praising the success over the past few decades of the cervical cancer screening programme, and all those who have worked in it. They have saved many lives but, despite that success, cervical cancer still kills 1,100 women every year. Another 2,800 women are diagnosed with it each year, but I want to speak specifically about the screening of young women under the age of 25.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08121780000584">I bring this matter to the House because a young constituent of mine called Claire Walker tragically died on 18 September, a few days after her 23rd birthday. Claire was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 21, and she died leaving a two-year-old son, a husband, a brother, a sister, a mam and dad, and a grandma. Claire worked at the Washington child benefit centre, where I once worked, as did her mother. I remember when I was the trade union branch secretary 30 years ago that, along with many others, I negotiated for on-site screening for the 2,000 women who worked there.

She found the strength that she needed through Jo&#146;s Trust, a charity that helps support cervical cancer sufferers, and she also took part in television programmes and appeared in women&#146;s magazines and in newspapers&#151;always with the aim of warning others of the danger, and to provide help and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08121780000586">On the day of her funeral, her dad Bob said, &#147;She will always be the real angel of the North.&#148; She was a remarkable woman, whose family and friends are determined that her death should not be in vain. They have campaigned courageously and vigorously about the need for cervical screening of women under 25. They have had the support of many in the local community in Washington, and a petition was organised by the <i> Sunderland Echo</i> to ensure that other families do not have to go through what they have faced. Claire would have had that screening had she been born a few years earlier, or 80 miles up the road and over the border in Scotland.</p>

The latest figures that I could get from the Office for National Statistics only go up to 2005, but they show that the number of women so diagnosed totalled 42 in 2001 and 2002, 63 in 2003, 48 in 2004 and 43 in 2005. They were all young women diagnosed under the age of 25, and many health professionals believe that the figures could be much higher.</p>

issued by Drs. Sasieni and Cuzick and colleagues, which the Department of Health considered. However, many feel that the data sample used in the report was relatively small&#151;about 3,700&#151;given that 4.3 million women a year are eligible for screening. There are differences of view within the medical profession and I shall give a couple of examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08121780000589">A report recently published in the <i> Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care</i> stated:</p>
<a name="81217-0020.htm_brev15"><a name="08121780000657"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Women aged 20-24 years should no longer be given the message that screening causes more harm than good and should not be actively discouraged from screening&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08121780000590">In the same journal, Professor Fiander, in an article entitled &#147;Cervical screening in young women aged 20-24 years&#148;, wrote:</p>
<a name="81217-0020.htm_brev16"><a name="08121780000658"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The paper by Sasieni and colleagues demonstrated less protection for younger women from a normal cervical smear than for older women and paved the way for an increase in the age of first invitation for cervical screening in England. Sasieni&#146;s study did not include microinvasive cancers, for which fertility-sparing options for treatment may be feasible&#151;an advantage of early screen-detected tumours. If we accept that protection from current cervical screening is poor in young women then perhaps the response to this should not have been to start screening later but to find a better method of screening young women.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08121780000591">Another article dealing with lowering the age concluded:</p>
<a name="81217-0020.htm_brev17"><a name="08121780000659"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Delaying the age for screening eligibility carries a risk of CIN becoming more extensive, and therefore more difficult to excise, as well as a risk of progression. The NHSCSP should reconsider its decision and encourage young women to be screened, not excluding those aged 20-24 years. Facilities for taking the test should be made more convenient. Women should be informed that low-grade CIN is potentially reversible and may safely be monitored. Cervical screening also provides an opportunity for education on healthy lifestyles and safer sex while treatment should be reserved for high-grade CIN.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08121780000592">There are differences of opinion and the view expressed in the report considered by the Department is not universally shared by the English medical profession, by the chief medical officers in Scotland and Wales, or in a host of other European countries. That view has not been taken in Australia and many other parts of the world. Many people feel that the report did not look at interval analysis and that it was not designed to test the theory it used and the conclusions it reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08121780000593">Many people feel that responsibility for the burden of proof lies with those who advocate change, yet many of us feel that the case is not proven. I have talked to people in the profession over the past few weeks and many consultants and others accept that there was an element of over-treatment, but they say that the pendulum has swung the other way and there is a change of attitude in the medical profession. Some of the arguments about over-treatment are no longer made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08121780000594">The argument has been used that early screening does more harm than good, but, with greater safeguards, why should it be different for a 24-year old or a 25 or 26-year old? As my quotes from eminent medical journals showed, that argument sends out the wrong message&#151;that cervical cancer does not affect young women. Between 2000 and 2005, the number of women aged between 20 and 29 who turned up for routine screening went down from 77 per cent. to 71.6 per cent.</p>

Member long enough to recognise that the Minister will not stand at the Dispatch Box and say, &#147;We will alter the procedure and take the age back to 20&#148;, but I ask for recognition that eminent figures in the medical profession have expressed genuine and serious differences of opinion about how we approach the issue, particularly within our neighbouring nations of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08121780000596">Obviously&#151;this is connected in many ways&#151;I welcome the recently announced vaccine programme, together with the catch-up initiative, but it will still leave a group of young women who are not covered by routine screening or vaccination. I respect the Minister. She is a former health service professional. She will want to be reassured that what we are doing is absolutely right and in the best interests of young women. I should like simply to put it to her that we should analyse the available data, and that view is supported by other hon. Members. Early-day motion 195, which I submitted, has support from Conservative, Liberal and Labour Members, all of whom feel that this issue seriously needs to be revisited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08121780000597">When we look at the data, we see that we have a unique opportunity for the first time. Two different systems have been operating in England and Northern Ireland and in Scotland and Wales. If the argument of harm exists and if damage is done to young women, that would be presumably demonstrated by looking at the data on those young women under 25 who are routinely screened in Scotland and Wales. One way or the other, the argument can now be proved. We can analyse what the difference is, because we have had similar populations with similar genetic make-ups for the past few years&#151;so there is an opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08121780000598">A point that has been made to me is that the data used in the Sasieni report show that big changes have taken place. The age at which young women become sexually active has reduced. Such differences need to be assessed. In my dealings with the Department of Health, it has always argued on the basis of medical advice. Some people have suggested that cost is an issue, but the average cost of screening is between &#163;30 and &#163;40. The life chances that that has given to tens of thousands of women in Britain are quite phenomenal. Apart from the obvious cost-benefit analysis&#151;screening has saved the health service money, as well as greatly benefiting the women who have been helped&#151;to save someone&#146;s life is clearly a great advantage. The re-examination needs to take place urgently, on the basis of different age limits, as that will provide a proper opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="81217-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08121780000599">Some people feel that, when the Sasieni report came out a few years ago, the Department considered that other groups were not sufficiently involved. If the Minister is prepared to look at the evidence and data, she will see that the consultation should include other organisations that have a view. I could mention many of them, but I will cite one that has advised me in the preparation of my speech: Jo&#146;s Trust, which is a cervical cancer charity. The question that needs to be asked is what is the effective age of the first invitation in order to prevent incidence and mortality in young women in their 20s. That is the basis on which we should approach this issue.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) on securing this extremely important debate. He has demonstrated the work that he did on this subject before he came to this House. The thought and research that has gone into his contribution was obvious for all to hear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08121780000606">I would like to start by paying tribute to my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent Claire Walker, and her brave battle against cervical cancer. For such a young woman to find herself in that position with a young family is devastating, and hearing of her brave work throughout what was left of her life is something that we must all take very seriously. I hope that during my speech I will address most of the issues that my hon. Friend raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08121780000607">I offer my sincere condolences to Claire&#146;s family, her husband and her son. Of course, these sound like just words, but they are heartfelt words, because as a woman, as a mother, as a sister, and as an aunt, I know of the pressures that are on women today to look after themselves, but with the fear and dread of having bad news whenever one goes for screening. Of course, it makes it worse for the family to have this devastation at this particular time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08121780000608">The NHS cervical screening programme is a great success, and it is one of the most well-regarded cancer screening programmes in the world. More than 3.5 million women are screened every year, and experts estimate that the programme saves up to 4,500 lives in England alone. However, we cannot be complacent, of course, and we are always striving to improve the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08121780000609">Following the evaluation of a Government-funded pilot study of liquid-based cytology&#151;LBC&#151;the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence concluded in 2003 that this new technology should be rolled out across the country. I am pleased to say that the whole of England had converted to LBC by October 2008, as planned. Prior to the introduction of LBC, rates of inadequate samples were over 9 per cent. This resulted in about 300,000 women a year being screened again, just because their initial sample could not be read. As LBC was rolled out, the rate of inadequate samples has fallen every year and is now at a record low of just under 3 per cent., or fewer than 100,000 women. That means that 200,000 fewer women a year do not have to have a repeat test because their original sample could not be read, with all the anxiety that ensues for those  <br>

women and the extra costs to the service. It is important to put this on the record because it is a good and welcome change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08121780000610">The implementation of LBC also allowed us to modernise the programme in other ways. Prior to 2003, there was a longstanding inequality in the NHS cervical screening programme regarding the frequency of invitations for screening. Some local programmes invited all women every three years, some all women every five years, and some used a combination of the two intervals, but there was no clear evidence base. The Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening had always kept the issue under review and commissioned research to find robust evidence to show what was the optimal screening interval. The research, by Sasieni et al., was published in the <i> British Journal of Cancer</i> on 1 July 2003. That research recommended that women aged under 25 should not be screened, as the risk is so low that there may be more harm done than good. It recommended that women aged 25 to 49 be screened every three years, and women aged 50 to 64 every five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08121780000611">The Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening carefully considered the research at its meeting on 14 July 2003 and advised that the recommendations in the research be adopted across the NHS screening programmes, but I certainly appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s comments about the fact that the screening programme in Scotland is offered to women between the ages of 20 and 60. However, I would like to give him details on why it was decided to raise the screening age in England from 20 to 25.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08121780000612">Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25. Claire&#146;s case is of course tragic, but thankfully it is very rare. All screening programmes must do more good than harm. However, research presented to the Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening, coupled with 15 years of experience of screening, has shown that screening women under the age of 25 may do more harm than good. Women under 25 often underwent unnecessary investigations after results suggested that they appeared to have cervical abnormalities. They were, in fact, normal cervical changes, caused by hormonal changes that will normally resolve themselves naturally over time without the need for treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08121780000613">Back in 2003, when the policy was changed, the 9,000 women under 25 with a high-grade smear whom we sent each year for colposcopy would all be treated, and ran the risk of complications that could lead to infertility. Treatment relating to colposcopy using large-loop excision&#151;the most common procedure&#151;is relatively safe, but there are risks. The short-term risks include pre-operative and post-operative bleeding and secondary infection. It is possible to perforate the uterus and/or cut through the vaginal wall, which may lead to unintentional damage to the bowel or bladder. In the longer term, cervical stenosis, or narrowing, can be a problem, and occasionally there is functional damage that leads to problems with pregnancy. I am explaining the technicalities to show the extent to which the research was looked into.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08121780000614">With young women, there is the possibility of repeated loop excisions. That is not uncommon, and it means that the risk of complication is greatly increased. There is significant bleeding in 5 to 10 per cent. of cases in which a cone biopsy is necessary, and cervical stenosis occurs in 2 to 3 per cent. of patients. Hysterectomy is  <br>

occasionally necessary to delay excessive bleeding, and there are arguments about the rate of fertility issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08121780000615">Since the policy was changed in 2003, the number of excisional biopsies undertaken as a consequence of the screening programme has fallen by almost 4,000. In 2006, there were only 56 registrations, representing 2.4 per cent., of cervical cancer in women aged under 25, compared to a total across all ages of 2,321 registrations. There were no deaths from cervical cancer among those aged under 25 in 2005, according to the latest figures available to me from the Office for National Statistics; that varies slightly with what my hon. Friend said. Recent work by the National Cancer Intelligence Network, based on figures from cancer registries, shows that no increase in registrations of cervical cancer has been evident in the overall England data for that age group since the frequency policy was changed in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08121780000616">Screening women from the age of 25 helps reduce the number of unnecessary investigations and treatments in younger women. Treatments to the cervix can cause difficulties later in life, such as raising the risk of pre-term babies if a woman becomes pregnant. That, of course, will affect two lives, not just one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08121780000617">There is internationally agreed evidence that women should be screened from age 25. A meeting in Lyons in May 2004, organised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organisation, concluded that organised and quality controlled cervical screening can achieve an 80 per cent. reduction in the mortality of cervical cancer. Women aged 25 to 49 should be screened no more than every three years, and women aged 50 to 64 no more than every five years. The group that made these recommendation consisted of 26 experts from 14 countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08121780000618">Although some countries, including Scotland, still invite women under 25 for cervical screening, others, such as the Netherlands and Finland, do not start screening until the age of 30. The advisory committee on cervical screening constantly keeps the age range and frequency of cervical screening under review, but would formally review this policy only if there was new evidence that we should be screening from age 20. Ultimately, the NHS in England should not be paying GPs for a procedure that can potentially be harmful.</p>

<p><a name="st_o375"><a name="08121780000619"><a name="81217-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="08121780001156"><b>Mr. Kemp:</b>
 Earlier in the Minister&#146;s contribution, when she referred to the advisory committee, she used the word &#147;may&#148; cause harm and she has also said &#147;can&#148; cause harm. I am worried that there does not appear to be a definitive view. That is why I would like the Minister to look at the evidence. &#147;Can&#148; and &#147;may&#148; can be made definitive if we examine evidence in Scotland and Wales.</p>

Clinicians will refer women under 25 who have symptoms of cervical cancer for other more appropriate tests, and women with suspected cancer should be seen by a specialist within two weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="81217-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08121780000622">My hon. Friend mentioned our HPV vaccination programme, which we are proud of. Cervical screening is not our only strategy for tackling this dreadful disease. The HPV vaccination programme, which protects against two strains of HPV that cause more than 70 per cent. of cases of cervical cancer, commenced in September 2008 for young girls aged 12 and 13. The national vaccination programme against HPV has been extended to offer protection to an additional 300,000 girls aged 17 and 18 from September this year. A catch-up programme will commence in September 2009 and will offer the vaccine to other older girls aged 13 to 18.
