concernfor the crocodile tears expressed about youth
unemployment and the minimum wage. We considered the matter very
carefully in government after 1997. Of course, the Conservative party
then claimed that 1 million jobs would be lost as a consequence of what
they judged would be a dangerous and reckless policy. In fact, the only
people who ended up losing their jobs because of the manner in which we
introduced the minimum wages were the Conservative MPs who opposed it.
The serious point behind the measures that we took and the fact that we
introduced a different rate for young workers was our profound concern
to avoid significant youth unemployment, which is still too common in
continental Europe. The virtual eradication of long-term youth
unemployment has been one of the Government&#146;s most significant

order to achieve our ambition, and to meet the housing aspirations of
people throughout our country, we need to have a system in place that
will provide the extra supply that we need&#151;more homes in every
region. Within that general framework, we aim to give as much
flexibility as we can for local authorities to build on brownfield land
rather than greenfield land and to decide the appropriate places where
homes can be built. But the bottom line is that we must have extra
homes if people&#146;s housing aspirations are to be

absolutely right that there is a real need, for young couples in
particular, to be able to gain access to the housing market. The
&#163;60,000 house competition was designed to reduce and keep a lid
on construction costs while driving up quality standards, particularly
for smaller, two-bedroom houses. That should generate a cultural change
across the industry and keep prices down while delivering higher
standards. I hope that my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents will
benefit not only from that change in the industry, but from the other
low-cost home ownership schemes that the Government are developing. He
will know that we aim to help more than 100,000 households over the
next few years, in the run up to 2010, with specific help through
low-cost home ownership
schemes.</p><p><a name="st_o100"><a name="061010136000154"><b><a name="61010-0003.htm_spnew34"><a name="061010136000454">Mr.

of competition, some will go on the market for &#163;60,000 or
thereabouts. People will have access to them through the shared equity
scheme, and they will be able to buy a share of the house for such a
price. However, it is important to point out that that will not be the

He will know, too, that there is a priority and an imperative from

That is why the Department for Communities and Local Government,

three broad questions for the Foreign Secretary. The first is on
sanctions. Last night, the United States proposed sanctions that would
include a trade ban on military and luxury items, the power to inspect
all cargo entering or leaving North Korea, and freezing assets
connected with its weapons programmes. Japan appears to have proposed,
in addition, that North Korean ships and planes should be banned from
foreign ports and airports. Will the Foreign Secretary tell the House
whether the Government support all those proposals, or whether there
are any that they do not support? Will the Government be calling for
any further measures not mentioned by the United States and Japan? Can
she say when she expects the Security Council to reach a decision? If a
decision is made under Chapter VII and ignored by North Korea, does she
expect further steps to
follow?</p><p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="61010-0004.htm_para5"><a name="061010136000185">The second
set of questions concerns proliferation. Given that we must bear in
mind the fact that this is a country that has never developed a weapons
system that it has not eventually sold to the highest bidder, what is
the Foreign Secretary&#146;s assessment of the danger that nuclear
technology originating from North Korea could find its way into the
hands of transnational terrorists, or states supporting them? What
assessment has been made of North Korea&#146;s ability to arm its
missiles with a nuclear warhead, and to which of its missiles would
that apply? Does the Foreign Secretary agree that that means we must
expand the proliferation security initiative with the aim of
identifying and stopping sources of nuclear trafficking? Would the
sanctions being proposed at the United Nations change in any way the
powers to search ships under the initiative? How will the efforts to
intercept illicit cargoes from North Korea be made more
effective?</p><p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="61010-0004.htm_para6"><a name="061010136000186">The third
set of questions concerns the unity of the Security Council. There is
clearly a growing perception in the world that the price of stealing
one&#146;s way into the nuclear club is bearable. That is a
perception that we cannot afford to allow to continue. Is it not the
case that the Security Council members who have been united in their
condemnation of North Korea must now be united in their actions? Does
the Foreign Secretary agree that it is of the utmost importance to
preserve the unity of the UN in the coming days&#151;I am sure that
she does&#151;but that if sanctions are to be effective, they will
obviously require the full support of North Korea&#146;s neighbours?
Can she say any more about any assurances that she has received during
her discussions with the Chinese Foreign Minister about China&#146;s
approach to the issue? What contacts has she had with her counterparts
in Russia and South Korea regarding sanctions, and has this any
implications for South Korea&#146;s development of the industrial

We join the unanimity across the House in condemning the nuclear test

Security Council to drive through tough sanctions against the regime.
We join with others on both sides of the House in stressing the need
for China and Russia to recognise their responsibilities and to support
these measures. However, does the Foreign Secretary recognise that
agreement will be much harder to achieve while there is even the
prospect of military action by the United States, which would be
absolutely catastrophic? Does she agree with the former United States
Senator Sam Nunn, who said that this appalling situation represents a
massive failure of United States&#151;and, by extension,

UK&#146;s area of operation in south-east Iraq, the biggest challenge
lies in Basra city. Two weeks ago, Iraqi and UK forces began a
large-scale operation moving through the city sector by sector,
strengthening security and improving basic services. One important
element of the operation is a renewed effort to improve the capacity of
the Iraqi police and to address infiltration by militias. The operation
also includes clean-up projects, agriculture projects and projects to
improve basic services, including bringing clean drinking water to a
part of the city that has never hadit before.</p><p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para3"><a name="061010136000228">Elsewhere in the south-east,

in no doubt that this is a decisive period in the future of Iraq. There
is much debate, here in Britain, in America and of course in Iraq,
about the best way forward, but all agree that military means alone
will not be decisive. This is especially true now, when it is clear
that sectarianism and the struggle for power have emerged as a major
threat to Iraq&#146;s security. What is required above all is a
political solution. That must include a genuine effort at national
reconciliation, drawing all Iraq&#146;s communities into a political
process and away from violence. Prime Minister Maliki and his
Government are trying to deliver that. We and our coalition partners
must do all we can to support them and to strengthen their
resolve&#151;but so, too, must the international community as a whole
and Iraq&#146;s near neighbours in
particular.</p><p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para6"><a name="061010136000231">Let me
turn to Afghanistan. The achievements and losses of our forces in
Helmand province rightly have been the focus of our attention in the
last two months. The work our forces are doing there is difficult,
dangerous and exhausting. I salute them, particularly the men and women
of 16 Air Assault Brigade, who are coming home, having been relieved by
3 Commando. I shall be visiting them tomorrow to thank them in person,
but today on behalf of the whole House I should like formally to record
our recognition of the bravery, professionalism and sacrifice of that

this, the fifth anniversary of our intervention in Afghanistan, we
should reflect on the progress our efforts have brought about: 2,000
schools built;5 million children in school, a third of them
girls; more than 70 new hospitals and clinics; and 4.5 million refugees
returning home. This is not a failing
mission.</p><p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para8"><a name="061010136000233">NATO, in the
shape of ISAF&#151;the international security assistance

responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan, but as we know, the summer
has seen fierce fighting and as I made clear in a speech last month,
the persistence of the Taliban was greater than expected. Such is the
nature of operations: the enemy always has a vote&#151;and we have
adapted. But let me repeat: the force package we deployed, which we
have strengthened further over the summer, was designed to deal with
violent resistance, and in every encounter with the Taliban our forces
have defeated them. Moreover, by attacking us directly, the Taliban
have taken heavy losses, both in northern Helmand and against the
Canadians in Kandahar. We have sent a clear message that we will not be
beaten in combat&#151;a message not lost on the local population.
That has strengthened the position of local leaders, some of whom are
now pursuing peaceful negotiations with our commands and with the
Afghan Government.</p><p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para9"><a name="061010136000234">In
Afghanistan, we have now reached a key point in the campaign. On

window of opportunity. If we can build upon the blow we have delivered
to the Taliban and if we can quickly deliver real, concrete changes to
the lives of ordinary Afghans through development and reconstruction,
we can begin

we still face.</p><p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para10"><a name="061010136000235">The
assumption of complete military command for Afghanistan is a
significant achievement for NATO, but it is also a significant test.
There are still shortfalls in the planned force structure. Caveats on
the use of some forces remain. I have been in frequent, often daily,
discussions with the Secretary-General and fellow Defence Ministers to
reinforce the message that, as an alliance, we must live up to our
commitment to Afghanistan, sharing the burden and, as important,
sharing the risks. I ensured that this subject was top of the agenda at
the NATO summit in Slovenia two weeks ago, and I will continue to press
for urgent action.</p><p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para11"><a name="061010136000236">We have made some progress.
Some caveats are lifting&#151;the Poles have confirmed they will
provide a battalion, and the Canadians plan to put further troops into
the south. Importantly, General Richards judges that he has the forces
to maintain the relatively stable security situation that now exists,
but I will continue to push for his requirements to be met in full, as
a matter of
urgency.</p><p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para12"><a name="061010136000237">In Helmand,
the UK task force also faces challenges. The battles that we have
fought in the north of the province have brought us to the relative
stability that we have seen in recent weeks. Taliban activity is down
and engagement with local leaders is growing, butwe must
capitalise quickly with progress on reconstruction. We are rebalancing
our forces, taking advantage of the steady improvement in the Afghan
army and police to concentrate our forces on the central area
surrounding the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. That should increase
the scope for other Government Departments to act in safety, and it
should also increase the confidence of local enterprises and
international NGOs to begin the reconstruction that is at the core of
our strategy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para13"><a name="061010136000238">Back in
the UK, the main challenge for me, for my Department and for the joint
headquarters and the chiefs is to give our troops the resources that
they need to get the job done. That is a relentless task, but we are
rising to it. We have now almost completely deployed the reinforcements
that I described to the House on10 July, with the last
elements due in Afghanistan in the next few weeks. That includes two
more Chinook helicopters and more flying hours for helicopters across
the fleet; more capacity to train the Afghan national army; engineers
to take forward development; and more infantry.</p><p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="61010-0005.htm_para14"><a name="061010136000239">On 24 July, I announced a new

100 new Mastiff and 100 additional Vector vehicles, funded by new money
from the Treasury. We continue to invest heavily in force protection,
including countermeasures to protect vehicles against attack, defensive
aids for aircraft and personal body armour. I believe that we have
shown that we can be responsive to the requests of commanders, and we
will continue to be
responsive.</p>

for our people. I think we can do better.</p><p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para1"><a name="061010136000241">I am pleased to announce today
that we intend to introduce a new tax-free, flat-rate operational
bonus, which, for a six-month tour, would amount to &#163;2,240. For
an average private or lance-corporal, that is equivalent to the amount
of tax that they would pay during a six-month tour. It means that half
our people on operations will be better off than under a tax
exemption&#151;increasingly so for the lower paid. The most junior
will be more than &#163;500 better off after a six-month tour than if
we simply exempted them from tax. As important, everyone on operations
will be equally better off than they are now&#151;by just under
&#163;100 per week, free of tax. I would like to thank my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor for making more than &#163;60 million of new

existing defence funding away from front-line
needs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para2"><a name="061010136000242">This is a
complex area. I have been looking at these questions for weeks, but I
can assure the House that the troops who have been fighting in
Afghanistan over the summer will not lose out as a result. The payment
will be backdated to 1 April 2006, as an adjustment to pay arrangements
in the current financial year. Full details of eligibility will be made
public shortly, but I can confirm that, besides Afghanistan, the
payment will apply to our forces in Iraq and in the
Balkans.</p><p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para3"><a name="061010136000243">Finally, let
me deal with the issue of medical care for those injured on operations.
First, I want to challenge the notion that the current system is in any
way inferior to what went before. In particular, the relentless attack
on the work of the outstanding medical staff&#151;military and
civilian&#151;at Selly Oak hospital is both unfair and misplaced. I
have been there twice in recent months. It is one of the
highest-performing and most successful hospital trusts in the NHS and
provides major specialist centres for trauma, burns, plastic surgery
and neuroscience.</p><p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para4"><a name="061010136000244">Our
primary concern is to give our injured people the best medical care
available. That is to be found inside the NHS. While some have been
calling in public for a return to military hospitals, we have been
quietly getting on with the job of establishing a military managed ward
at Selly Oak in partnership with the NHS. I can confirm that this will
be operational before the end of the
year.</p><p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para5"><a name="061010136000245">I have been
open about the nature of the challenges that we face in our operational
theatres. I do not seek to hide from the House the difficulties we face
in overcoming them, but I am convinced our strategy remains the right
one. In Afghanistan, we have to tackle the south and the east if we are
to secure what has already been achieved in the rest of the country. We
have to make the comprehensive approach work, with all Government
Departments acting together to achieve our objectives. We have to get
NATO to live up to its commitments. In Iraq, we have to support the
Iraqi Government and their army and police in taking responsibility for
their own security and in holding the line against sectarian violence.
We will do all these things&#151;we cannot afford not to.</p><br>

circumstances in Iraq and
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para7"><a name="061010136000248">As I
have said several times in the House, the Opposition fully support the
Government&#146;s aims in Afghanistan: to prevent the recurrence of a
failed state and the re-emergence of al-Qaeda and the effects this
would have on Britain&#146;s security. It is more true now than ever
that NATO&#146;s reputation in on the line. Our collective security
requires a properly collective response&#151;a response that has been
notably lacking from some quarters of our
allies.</p><p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para8"><a name="061010136000249">It is,
however, the duty of the Opposition to hold the Government to account
for the means of achieving these objectives. From the outset of the
deployment to Afghanistan questions have been raised about whether too
much planning was done on the basis of the most optimistic potential
outcome. Public opinion was prepared largely for a mission that was
about peacekeeping not war fighting. From the very beginning, questions
were asked about the level of manpower and equipment being deployed
given the difficulties that might be faced. In the event, the realists,
rather than the optimists, have been proved right. Resistance from the
Taliban has been fierce and the deployment under-strength. As a result,
not only were a further 900 troops sent by the Government in July, but
NATO commanders on the ground still believe that they are undermanned.
I certainly do not agree with the assertion made by the Secretary of
State for Defence in July
that:</p><a name="61010-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="061010136000335"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;neither the

Afghanistan&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para9"><a name="061010136000250">These
major strategic questions require a great deal of analysis, which I am
sure that the House will want to give them in due course. Today, I have
a number of specific questions for the Secretary of State, relating to
our deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. These include the safety of
our troops, the need for more equipment, the calculation of casualties,
the treatment of those injured, the inadequacy of the inquest system
and the lack of reconstruction.</p><p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para10"><a name="061010136000251">Let me begin with the question
of body armour. On 18 September, the Secretary of State said in a
written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon
(Mr. Maples) that Osprey, the body armour that provides
extra protection for the neck and shoulders, would replace ECBA, which
provides only minimal chest protection. How many sets of Osprey armour
have already been provided for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and what
proportion of our troops can receive it when necessary? The correct
answer should be 100 per cent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para11"><a name="061010136000252">Let me next turn to

more helicopters. The worry is that the Government may promise what
they are unable to provide. How many helicopters do we have that could
be used in Afghanistan, but are not being used? How many helicopters do
we have that are not fit for purpose? For example, the Ministry of
Defence&#146;s own figures suggest that only 41 per cent. of the Lynx
and Gazelle fleets are fit for purpose. What requests have been made to
our NATO allies for extra helicopters? Which nations currently have the
capacity to provide appropriate helicopters, but have not done so? How
many military helicopters have we earmarked for sale to foreign
countries and why did the Government cut the battlefield helicopter
budget from &#163;4.5 billion to &#163;3.2 billion as recently as
2004? On available vehicles, how many of the Mastiff and Vector
vehicles announced in the July package have now been delivered in
theatre?</p><p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para12"><a name="061010136000253">On the issue
of casualty numbers in Iraq and Afghanistan, we want to see greater
transparency. At the moment, there are discrepancies between the way in
which UK and US casualty figures are compiled. In particular, only
casualties who are admitted for in-patient treatment or casivaced are
included in our official figures. What we are not told is the
proportion of our troops who are injured sufficiently to make them
unfit for duty, but who do not require hospitalisation. The US provides
figures on those who are injured, but return to duty within 72 hours.
Can we please have the same?</p><p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para13"><a name="061010136000254">Of those who are injured in
Iraq and Afghanistan, it is essential that they are treated by those
with thebest medical skills, but in the most appropriate
environment. No one has attacked the excellent work of the medical and
nursing staff and to suggest that is deplorable, but to have injured
servicemen and women and reservists treated in wards alongside civilian
patients is just not acceptable. Part of the healing process is about
coming to terms with the nature of their injuries and that is best done
among their comrades. We want an assurance today from the Secretary of
State that everything possible will be done to ensure that those who
return to the UK will be treated in exclusively military wards. The
British public will expect nothing less.</p><p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para14"><a name="061010136000255">Back in May, I wrote to the
Secretary of State about the unacceptable level of outstanding inquests
for those killed in action. The backlog results in families being
unable to achieve closure of the tragic events that have occurred. At
the time, in response to the request, the Government made more
resources available to the Oxfordshire coroner, yet the situation
remains completely unacceptable. The Coroners Act 1988 gives the
coroner the ability to delegate the responsibility of carrying out an
inquest to another county. Why is this not being used? Do Ministers
have the power to instruct the coroner to make that happen? If not, and
if a ministerial order is required to make that possible, the
Government will have the full co-operation of the Conservative party to
make that possible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para15"><a name="061010136000256">Let me welcome the

me ask about reconstruction. In respect of Iraq, the Secretary of State
is right to concentrate on the need for a political solution and the
establishment of an independent judicial system. However, can he remind
the House today who is responsible for the training and development of
the police service in Iraq, and why it is so far behind
schedule?</p><p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para17"><a name="061010136000258">In
Afghanistan, we are about to enter a crucial phase. We have seen fierce
fighting and an enormous commitment to defeat the Taliban. But without
substantial reconstruction on the ground, and after five years of a
foreign military presence, those in the south of Afghanistan might
rightly question why they have seen no improvements to their
infrastructure. Two-hundred schools in Kandahar, and 165 in Helmand,
are closed for security reasons, and DFID has withdrawn its only

question to the Secretary of State: what sort of security environment
do the NGOs expect there to be before genuine reconstruction begins? Do
they expect a zero-risk environment? If they do, we will never have the
basic requirements of what is needed to win the hearts and minds of the
peasant farmers in south Afghanistan. Will the right hon. Gentleman
take the earliest opportunity to impress upon the Secretary of State

body armour issue, because I know that the hon. Gentleman has a
specific interest in it, and he has expressed a view in the media about
it: 15,000 sets of Osprey armour have been deployed into the
operational theatre, and anybody who can do the simple arithmetic
required will know that that is more than the number of people who have
been deployed into both theatres. However, that does not guarantee that
there is a set for every single individual, because soldiers, like

I now tell the House that there will be sufficient body armour for

give the reassurance that nobody who is deployed in theatre into a
situation where they are exposed to the possibility of being under fire
is denied the use of Osprey armour. There are more than enough versions
of that advanced system of body armour for everybody to have them.
Therefore, I am confident that we have achieved the objective that we

that the hon. Gentleman is of course right to suggest that we should
not promise what cannot be delivered, but he should also be careful not
just to read what the newspaper headlines state that those in theatre
say about helicopters. The headlines relating to the alleged request

fellow Ministers, I am reviewing what we can do to increase the
availability of helicopters not just by generating further air frames,
but by generating the crew, spares and other support necessary to
provide that further capability, if that is at all possible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para23"><a name="061010136000265">On medical care, I point out
that, as the House already knows, those who call for the reopening of
military hospitals ought to remind themselves how we came to no longer
have such hospitals. The defence cost study 15 of 1994 was responsible
for the closure of our military hospitals, on the basis of saving
money. In fact, in the light of developments in medical practice,
closing those hospitals was the right thing to do. It is entirely
appropriate that the best care be provided to our forces, and that is
to be found in the national health service.</p><p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="61010-0006.htm_para24"><a name="061010136000266">As I said, we are seeking to
provide a military-managed ward in an appropriate environment within
Selly Oak. The hon. Gentleman associated himself with the criticisms
that others have made of Selly Oak hospital by intervening in the
debate in the manner that he did. If he is going to comment on the
quality of NHS care, he should visit the hospital. I invite him to
visit Selly Oak, to see the wards for himself and to speak to the
troops, as I have done. I visited it very recently, and the troops who
are getting that NHS help and service spoke with glowing praise for
those providing that care.</p><br>

Secretary of State agree with General Richards, who said in his radio

made by our commanders on the ground and I fully support them in that.
It appears, from the way in which they have been able to fight the

EU will consistently be faced with the challenge of helping countries

future. Part of that challenge, as he said, is to decide what measure
of security is sufficient for us to deploy people who have not signed
up to the military. Incidentally, I have to tell the hon. Gentleman
that all three forces are represented in Afghanistan and are making a
significant contribution there. We have to decide, realistically, what
degree of security we can generate in circumstances such as those in

community have ambitions to help. I am not suggesting that UK forces

corporate manslaughter can proceed only if gross negligence can be
proved against individual senior managers. That means that the courts
must judge corporate negligence on a narrow and sometimes artificial
basis. The result is that only a handful of corporate manslaughter
prosecutions have ever been brought successfully. Furthermore, all have
been against small companies, rather than large organisations such as
those involved in the tragedies that I
mentioned.</p><p><a name="st_o207"><a name="061010140000019"><b><a name="61010-0008.htm_spnew16"><a name="061010140000127">Ms

offence, imprisonment will not be an option because individuals will
not answer on behalf of any company or corporate organisation except in
a legal capacity. Fines will be unlimited and one would expect
substantial fines for the sort of offence that we are considering. Of
course, high fines have already been imposed in serious cases. For
example, in the Balfour Beatty case, the fine was more than &#163;7
million. Railtrack was fined &#163;3.5 million in the Hatfield
case.I believe that Transco was fined
approximately&#163;15 million for health and safety
breaches. When we can bring such cases under existing law, that shows
the seriousness with which the courts take them. However, the unlimited
nature of the fines and their ability to be imposed without the need to
prove individual liability, but taking into account systemic failures
in the company or corporate organisation as a whole, is a sufficient
combination to act as a deterrent to anyone who would conduct
themselves in a fashion that would put people at

already be held to account for gross negligence that results in the
loss of life, or in any other substantial loss, although a certain
level of proof is required. The Bill introduces the concept of
corporate manslaughter, which means that a corporate organisation can
be held to account if its systemic and institutionalised failures and
negligence across a range of activities are shown to have led to a
death.</p><p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="61010-0009.htm_para0"><a name="061010140000038">I will go
further than that. If the House passes this Bill, it will be possible
to take a corporate organisation to court, expose it to public scrutiny
and impose on it a guilty verdict and a substantial, unlimited fine,
while individuals can be tried simultaneously for gross negligence
leading to manslaughter. The hon. Lady&#146;s premise is therefore

which she refers are smaller businesses such as building firms, sole
traders and so on. Individual prosecutions are likely to be possible in
cases involving such bodies, and in fact most individual prosecutions
have been brought against the very firms to which she has referred.
There is a gap, as I think the whole House accepts, in taking larger
incorporated organisations to task for systemic failures across the
organisation that have sometimes resulted in a considerable number of
deaths, as I pointed out. That is where we have concentrated our
efforts.</p><p><a name="st_o229"><a name="061010140000046"><b><a name="61010-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="061010140000149">Several

Government are determined to make corporate manslaughter laws just, and
the Bill aims to create a clear and effective criminal offence. Our
approach is based on recommendations from the Law Commission and on
extensive consultation, including with trade unions, industry and those
representing the victims of work-related death, although I realise that
we have not agreed on everything in those consultations. In particular,
I am indebted to my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton,
Itchen (Mr. Denham) and members of the Select Committees on
Home Affairs and on Work and Pensions who carefully scrutinised the
legislation in draft. We have adopted a number of the
Committees&#146; recommendations, although not in every particular,
and they have had an important influence on the final shape of the Bill
in several
areas.</p><p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="61010-0009.htm_para3"><a name="061010140000049">What the Bill
does can be stated simply. The new offence of corporate manslaughter
represents an advance in two major ways. First, it provides a new test
for the application of the corporate manslaughter offence to companies
that will allow the courts to look at collective management failure
within an organisation, thus enabling, for the first time, a proper
examination of corporate negligence, on the corporate
scale.</p><p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="61010-0009.htm_para4"><a name="061010140000050">The Bill goes
further and, secondly, removes Crown immunity. That is a far-reaching
and historic development. For the first time, Departments and other
Crown bodies will be liable to prosecution in the criminal courts. I
understand that there is an argument about the extent and scope of the
measure, but I hope that we have got it right by excluding public
policy matters. Nevertheless, this will be a major step in removing
Crown immunity from Departments and other Crown
bodies.</p><p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="61010-0009.htm_para5"><a name="061010140000051">On the test
for liability, the new offence of corporate manslaughter radically
modifies the law. It moves away from the question of who managed the
company to the question of how the fatal activity was managed&#151;a
significant shift that is more than mere semantics. No longer will a
successful prosecution depend on proving gross negligence by isolated
individuals. Prosecutors will be able, for the first time, to focus on
collective failure, as I said earlier.</p><p><a name="st_o231"><a name="061010140000052"><b><a name="61010-0009.htm_spnew9"><a name="061010140000151">Stewart

intention is to target truly corporate negligence, however, it would be
wrong if organisations were prosecuted on the basis of isolated or
unrelated management failings at relatively low levels of the
organisation. For that reason, the new offence requires there to have
been gross failure by senior managers. Again, I understand that people
will want to discuss that point during our deliberations and we shall
always be prepared to undertake such scrutiny and will be able to go
some way&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i>&#151;I shall

as a consequence fail to rebalance the law in the direction of
corporate rather than individual negligence. It is critical that the
new offence has public confidence, so we are taking those objections
seriously and will table amendments in Committee. I will write to the

Thames Trains got away with a &#163;2 million fine. That is a
fraction of the money that the directors made from the two management
buy-outs that have occurred since rail privatisation. If this very
welcome measure had been on the statute book at the time of the

two provisions would be particularly relevant to the case that he

provisions&#151;unlimited fines&#151;and the second is, of course,
that on remedial orders. Fines and compensation orders are usually the
most effective ways to penalise companies that are found guilty of
criminal offences, but I fully recognise that financial penalties
alone&#151;the point that he makes&#151;may not always be enough to
change undesirable business behaviour.</p><p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61010-0009.htm_para8"><a name="061010140000060">Of course, alternative
sanctions have been explored, because the issue goes wider than just
corporate manslaughter. The Macrory review is conducting a
comprehensive investigation into corporate sanctions. Its final report
is due out this autumn and will identify a number of options, including
corporate rehabilitation orders, community projects and publicity
orders. However, the unlimited fines and the remedial orders in clause
10 are particularly appropriate to the subject that my hon. Friend
raises.</p><p><a name="st_o237"><a name="061010140000061"><b><a name="61010-0009.htm_spnew15"><a name="061010140000157">Mr.

Our understanding is that the Bill will supplement that dimension by
allowing the consideration of the institutionalised, systemic fact of
failings at a lateral level, not just among the top people and not just
where individual responsibility can be illustrated in every case. If
the Bill were to become law and a systemic failure occurred, it could
be taken into account when considering a breach of the law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="61010-0009.htm_para10"><a name="061010140000066">As I told the hon. Member for

to the question of the test for liability and ask him to address
another possible weakness in the way that the provision has been set
out? The test for liability connects the crime of gross negligence with
the duty of care in civil law. Does that mean that the crime that we

coming off the tracks killed not only passengers&#151;the company
would clearly have a duty of care to them&#151;but bystanders. The
legal advice on the Bill that I have received is that if that could

the points so far. Rather than framing the new offence solely in terms
of the way an incident was managed by senior managers, we will reframe
the test so that it takes into account the management of the fatal
activity generally within the organisation. That is the point that was
raised. However, the test would not allow a prosecution to succeed
unless a substantial element of the organisation&#146;s failure lay
at a relatively senior management level. I accept that that is a point
of balance, but it is something that we are willing to discuss. I also
think that that will provide a more flexible approach than is currently
in the Bill, because the test will encompass all aspects of the way in
which an activity was managed in an organisation. But it will still
need to be shown that a large part of the failure lay in the way in
which the senior management of the organisation exercised
responsibility. That will ensure that the offence remains targeted on
truly corporate failings, rather than just individual
failings.</p>

across the organisation has resulted in death and destruction on a

the case that directors can be disqualified if they are convicted of an

face other penalties, as an individual. What the Bill does is to make

this issue in the light of developments on corporate manslaughter, of
the report from Professor Macrory&#151;the Macrory penalties

elsewhere, separately from this Bill; there may be developments in that
regard. In addition, we are introducing the offence of corporate

the last question, but the Bill&#146;s innovative aspect lies in its
attempt to ensure corporate accountability. Often, responsibility is
not capable of being laid at the door of one person, but lies with the
corporate body overall, which is why we have introduced this Bill.
Evidence given by the HSC to the scrutiny Committees identified that
many incidents arose from systemic failures, rather than from the
culpability of the actions of one individual. The new offence reflects
that reality. It is a reality that all working people know in practice:
very often, such situations do not just come down to one culpable
director, but there are systemic failures that run through a
corporation and that are not remedied, despite the fact that the
corporation at all levels is constantly told about them by the worker,

corporate manslaughter in the absence of this proposed legislation is

Grieve:</b> I thank the Home Secretary for giving way. Can I
raise a point about public authorities? The Home Secretary makes a
perfectly valid point in saying that there might be particular problems
with public authorities in the exercise of some of their functions, but
people will find the following situation rather strange in respect of
individuals within an organisation: for instance, a hospital doctor
might be prosecuted for manslaughter and it emerges in the course of
the case that there were systemic failures in his training, and, as I
understand it, the health trust responsible for that would escape
prosecution under these provisions. I hope that we can look at that
area again. Similarly, a police authority or force could escape
prosecution for failings of their officers leading to the death of an
individual. It seems to me that what is sauce for the goose is sauce
for the gander, and if we are holding individuals to account in such
circumstances, it is very strange if we do not provide a mechanism
within corporate manslaughter legislation that also allows the
authorities to be held to
account.</p><p><a name="st_o268"><a name="061010140000110"><b><a name="61010-0010.htm_spnew13"><a name="061010140000188">John

sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, it is by definition also
true that a goose is different from a gander, and in this case public
bodies and Government Departments are different from private
organisations. Private organisations have different responsibilities,
but they are not subject to the strong mechanisms for accountability
and scrutiny to which public bodies are already accountable. All deaths
in custody are subject in public bodies to an independent
investigation. The prisons and police and others have separate
ombudsmen, who report publicly, and very often to Parliament. There is
an Independent Police Complaints Commission, for example. All deaths in
custody are also subject to coroners&#146; inquest in public, with a
jury. Individual criminal proceedings and disciplinary processes are
available in appropriate cases, and that is only in respect of the
police and the criminal justice system, which the hon. Gentleman
mentioned. Therefore there are a huge number of mechanisms that already
scrutinise public bodies and Government Departments, but that do not do
so in the case of private organisations. That is recognised in the Bill
by not applying exactly the same rules and regulations to public and
private sectors.</p><p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="61010-0010.htm_para14"><a name="061010140000112">I

that it will meet a specific failing in our criminal law. It will
enshrine in law a more effective offence of corporate manslaughter that
will properly target corporate failures and, for the first time, it
will remove Crown immunity. In short, the Bill will make justice
possible for those who are killed at work owing to gross corporate
negligence. It can never remedy those losses or compensate for the
bereavement that individuals and families have suffered, but I hope
that it will go some way towards meeting their claim that justice ought
to be extended right across the spectrum when it is demanded as a

caught between a rock and a hard place. The Government wish to improve
our body of legislation, which would be of value, but at the same time
they have very properly not been prepared to be pushed or bulldozed by

with the Home Secretary that we must deal with corporate manslaughter.
The only fair way in which to deal with manslaughter allegations
against individuals, with custodial sentences being imposed if
transgression is shown, is under the existing framework of the
manslaughter law. If we were to start departing from that&#151;some
have suggested that we should&#151;it would quickly become apparent
that people would be treated unjustly. It should not be the role of
Parliament to do that, however tempting it might sometimes
be.</p><p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="61010-0010.htm_para22"><a name="061010145000006">Having taken that
decision and gone on to examine the problem of fixing corporations with
allegations of manslaughter, which is inherent, and of which we know
from the case of the Herald of Free Enterprise, which the Home
Secretary and others cited, it seems that the Government have tried
very hard to keep the notion of corporate manslaughter and produce a
new framework that will enable corporations to be convicted. However,
they face the problem of having ended up with a Bill about which it is
at least legitimate to raise the question: what does it add to our
existing laws in practical terms? I shall concentrate especially on
that point, but before I do so, I want to consider several of the
Bill&#146;s details and flag up for the Home Secretary some areas at
which we will need to look
carefully.</p><p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="61010-0010.htm_para23"><a name="061010145000007">The Home
Secretary made it clear that the Bill is aimed at corporations. That
makes it different from the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974,
which is a much wider measure under which it is quite common to
prosecute unincorporated associations without difficulty. Indeed,
shortly before I became a Member of the House, I was involved in the
prosecution of an unincorporated association: Lloyd&#146;s Register
of Shipping. Having seen not only the seriousness of that case, which
was about the port Ramsgate walkway collapse in which seven people were
killed, but the size of Lloyd&#146;s Register of Shipping and the
importance of its role in certifying new engineering structures
concerned with the marine environment, I rather disagreed with the Home
Secretary when it was suggested that unincorporated associations might
not be an important element in ensuring health and safety at work. Of
course, I also accept that in many cases unincorporated associations
are likely to be small organisations, but if ever the Home Secretary
wanted an example of an unincorporated organisation that is not small,
there is one. I am bound to say that I am a bit worried about the
prospect of putting on the statute book legislation that cannot
encompass such an organisation, so I hope that we will be able to
consider that during the Bill&#146;s
passage.</p>

change. However, I was a little worried to note that the relevant
schedule could be added to or taken away from by way of the negative
procedure. That was not because I thought that the Home Secretary was
suddenly going to say that he wanted to remove bodies from the

if we are going to get the Bill right, we must decide at the outset who

touched on the whole issue of public authorities. The Home Secretary
was quite right when he said that I might be wrong about the NHS health
trust in the context in which I put my point to him. Having read the
Bill, I am just not sure. If someone were put on a health trust trolley
that collapsed and caused the person to suffer a serious injury, I have
little doubt that the health trust could be responsible. If a patient
falls down a staircase or is injured in a lift, it is clear that, as an
occupier of premises, the trust will be covered by the legislation.
However, the position is rather less clear to me when it comes to, for
example, the training of medical staff. In a case in which I had a
peripheral involvement, some junior hospital doctors were prosecuted
for manslaughter for killing a patient. They were very junior and their
circumstances were such that there might be some degree of public
sympathy for them, but serious criticism was made of the health trust
for the manner in which it had looked after the doctors and provided
them with supervision and training.</p><p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="61010-0011.htm_para2"><a name="061010145000010">At present, that matter is

it be covered by the Bill? I do not know. The Home Secretary might be
able to intervene and tell me straight away that I am worrying about
nothing, but it seems to me that that case reveals the grey area
between direct activities, such as running premises, and public policy
issues, such as whether enough money was spent on the doctors&#146;
training. We shall have to focus and concentrate on that
matter.</p><p><a name="st_o272"><a name="061010145000011"><b><a name="61010-0011.htm_spnew0"><a name="061010145000026">Rob

it to be a matter of the judge hearing all the evidence and then, prior

First, Crown immunity still applies under the Health and Safety at

it should not apply under the 1974 Act, but it does. Secondly, when the
Health and Safety Executive issues an improvement or prohibition

by the agency behind doors. However, under the Bill the order will be
made after a full trial in court, with all the evidence set out for the

covered by the 1974 Act, remedial orders against a Government

mind, remain somewhat opaque. That will be of key importance if the
legislation is to have any force at all. A protocol governing the
investigation of death is currently in force between the HSE, the CPS
and the police, as even today there are occasions when the police and
the CPS become involved because they believe that manslaughter
proceedings may follow. May I tell the Home Secretary&#151;this
follows on from my earlier comment about length of time&#151;that
those are complicating features in the investigation of offences? I can
only speak from my experience, but I say categorically that the moment
that the police become involved in the investigation of a health and

I was left with the distinct impression that the required expertise is
simply not available.</p><p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="61010-0011.htm_para12"><a name="061010151000009">I do not know how we will work

manslaughter prosecutions, because it took the view that, given the
complex construct that had been put together, it would not have the
relevant expertise, and involvement would in fact inhibit its other

of a warehouse does not fall within the Health and Safety

generosity in giving way. I cannot remember, but my recollection is
that most offences under the 1974 Act relating to prohibition orders
are subject to a fine, which is on a scale. However, it appears from
clause 10(4) that failure to comply with a remedial order could be
subject to an unlimited fine. If I am right about that difference, it
suggests that there is a difference between a remedial order and a
prohibition order, in terms of the fine that can be levied for breach
thereof; that would be a more powerful incentive for the
employer.</p><p><a name="st_o285"><a name="061010151000013"><b><a name="61010-0011.htm_spnew13"><a name="061010151000032">Mr.

under the 1974 Act someone who does not comply with an improvement
notice will face the end of their business, full stop&#151;they will
no longer be allowed to operate. In all enforcement proceedings in the
public sphere, history has shown that it is usually the threat of an
injunction, whichever form it takes&#151;in the civil courts or
through a magistrates court&#151;that ultimately brings about
compliance, because such an injunction means that people can no longer
earn their livelihoods and are put out of business, which they richly
deserve if they do not comply with such
orders.</p><p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="61010-0011.htm_para15"><a name="061010151000014">I have to say
that I am not persuaded by these measures. I do not, with the single
caveat about remedial orders applying to Government Departments,
whereas improvement notices do not, see their advantage. It is worth
pointing out that the Health and Safety Executive already issues
improvement notices through the Crown procedure against Crown bodies
and the use of Crown notices and censures&#151;for example, 14 in
2003-04, 11 in 2000-01, and six in 2004-05. It also occasionally issues
prohibition notices against Government Departments. That must have
worked all right, otherwise we would have heard about it in this House.
I would rather hope that the Government were complying with a procedure
that they themselves had set up. To that extent, returning to the
comments of the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore),
remedial orders may add very little to what is available in this
setting.</p><p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61010-0011.htm_para16"><a name="061010151000015">I want to

see rigorous application of health and safety in all spheres, make me
wonder whether we have not made a mistake. In the 1974 Act, Lord Robens
did this country a signal good service. It is a very well crafted piece
of legislation. I have never heard it criticised except sometimes in
relation to subsidiary regulations accused of being too onerous. The
nub of the legislation itself has stood the test of time extremely
well. The thing that it does, which the Bill does not do, is to
simplify the law in terms of the duties of care owed by employers to
their own employees and to those who might be affected by their
undertakings in such a way that over the 30-year period of its
operation there has been a series of important judgments whereby every
weasel argument that employerscan put forward to try to
justify getting themselvesoff the hook&#151;for example,
passing the buck to subcontractors&#151;has been completely and
utterly eliminated.</p><p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="61010-0011.htm_para17"><a name="061010151000016">The 1974 Act is one of the
most powerful and effective regulatory tools put on to the statute book
by Government. Far from being limp in its impact, we can see that in
recent years the fines imposed for serious accidents and
death&#151;unlimited in the Crown court&#151;have risen
stratospherically. The Home Secretary spoke of &#163;7.5 million in
relation to the Hatfield rail crash, but even for accidents that may
not result from quite such a major disaster, large fines against
corporations&#151;hundreds of thousands of pounds for single deaths
or even sometimes for the creation of risk&#151;are routine. There is
every sign that that trend is continuing upwards as a result of
societal pressure to mark disapproval of those whose safety systems are
inadequate.</p><p><a name="st_o286"><a name="061010151000017"><b><a name="61010-0011.htm_spnew14"><a name="061010151000033">Mr.

over &#163;3,000. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the instrument
of the 1974 Act has helped to get to grips with problems in the
workplace. Nevertheless, the fines that are imposed under that Act are
so small that they do not deter employers at all. I should like the

that if a large corporation such as a Tesco or a Sainsbury&#146;s
kills an employee, a fine of millions of pounds may make little dent on
its balance sheet. One of the problems that we have to face up to is
that many of those prosecuted under the 1974 Act are individuals with
very limited means. If a fine of &#163;2 million is imposed because
it marks the gravity of the offence, it will never be collected because
there is nowhere near that amount to be collected. It is true that the
company, in the case of a corporation, will be put out of
business&#151;indeed, there is authority in the Court of Appeal that
says that in some cases that may be a very good thing to do&#151;but
unless that is the intention, the size of the fine becomes rather
meaningless.</p>

want to hurt you in your pocket.&#148; I, for one, have no difficulty
with that. In many cases, however, as I am sure that the Home Secretary
has been told, the companies prosecuted will be cowboy operators,
individuals with very limited resources and companies whose only assets
are, in effect, their annual turnover and profit. In those
circumstances, courts will not impose multi-million pound fines,
because they will be shown&#151;as they are under the terms of the
1974 Act&#151;balance sheets and the accounts of the company, and if
they decide not to put it out of business, they will have to impose a
fine that is commensurate with its ability to pay it. As has often been
argued, in the case of public authorities the money that is levied as a
fine takes from them the very money to carry out the necessary
improvements to meet the standard that they should have delivered from
the start.</p><p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para1"><a name="061010151000020">I have a

themselves left with a feeling of distress and disappointment that the
horror of what has happened to a near relative has not been responded
to. I see no easy way out of that and therefore wonder whether we are
not, in enacting this legislation, making unnecessary difficulties for
ourselves. I endorse the point made before the Joint
Committee&#151;that we should have, under sections 2 and 3 of the
1974 Act, a separate aggravated offence of an act by which death
results. There would then be some sentencing guidelines emphasising
that much higher fines should be imposed in those circumstances, and we
could see whether that works.</p><p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para2"><a name="061010151000021">However well-intentioned the

justice&#151;consistently more than 80 per cent. and in some cases
closer to 90 per cent. in any 12-month period. That is because it is so
drafted and interpreted that it imposes an arm-twist on any defendant
from which they will have great difficulty in escaping. It worries me
that, in contrast, this Bill seems very complicated. Having declared my

complexity of the issues of duty and care and breach&#151;and the
fact that corporations might be more reluctant to plead guilty because
of the opprobrium attached to a manslaughter conviction&#151;that we
might end up with far more contested cases. Under health and safety at
work legislation, a contested case relating to a major disaster can
last for many weeks and cost a lot of money. It is true that that money
can usually be recouped from the defendant, unlike in most criminal
justice cases; even so, we ought to bear in mind such
factors.</p><p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para4"><a name="061010151000023">Having said

the court should not only be able to punish it severely but have the

today. There is a clear obligation under article 2 of the European
convention on human rights to secure the right to life by putting in
place effective criminal provisions to deter the commission of offences
against the person, backed by appropriate law enforcement. In certain
circumstances, this obligation requires the state to ensure that
recourse to the criminal law is possible against both private and

would be required under article 2. The Committee therefore welcomes the
objective of the Bill as a human rights-enhancing purpose. For me,
however, the acid test will be whether it will be easier to prosecute.

shouldapply to &#147;undertakings&#148;, which would
include unincorporated as well as incorporated bodies. In the case law
of the European Court of Human Rights, the public nature of a
body&#146;s function has not been regarded as a reason for excluding
criminal liability, but on the contrary has been treated as a factor
which strengthens the obligation to ensure that recourse to the
criminal law is available. The obvious answer is to revert to the
original proposal to apply the new offence to
&#147;undertakings&#148;.</p><p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para15"><a name="061010160000012">I
very much welcome the extension of the Bill to apply to the Crown, as
does the Human Rights Committee. However, my Committee considers that
the restrictions, exemptions and exclusions in the Bill will preclude
the possibility of prosecution for corporate manslaughter in precisely
those contexts in which the positive obligation in article 2 is at its
strongest, and in which a criminal prosecution should be brought: the
use of lethal force by the police or army; deaths in custody; and
deaths of vulnerable children who should be in care&#151;to name just
a few examples. This would mean that, in situations in which
responsibility for the death lay with a management failure in a public
body, rather than with any identifiable individual, recourse to the
criminal law would not be possible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para16"><a name="061010160000013">In a sufficiently serious
case, that would be likely to lead to the United Kingdom being found to
be in breach of its positive obligation under article 2 to put in place
an effective system of judicial remedies, including, in certain
circumstances, recourse to the criminal law. In particular, this would
apply to deaths in custody. It is not enough to say that there are
extensive provisions to investigate these deaths already. So there are,
too, for transport accidents, chemical plant explosions, or the humble
factory death. Individual prosecutions are not the answer either. There
is no logical reason to exclude institutional operational failures,
which may lead to a death in custody, from the provisions of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para17"><a name="061010160000014">In our report,
the Committee gives an example to demonstrate this point. The
Metropolitan Police Commissioner is currently being prosecuted under
the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 in respect of the shooting
of Jean Charles de Menezes. If the Bill becomes law unamended, and if,
hypothetically, there were clear evidence that a similar shooting was
the result of gross negligence on the part of the senior management of
the Metropolitan police, but was not attributable to one individual
officer who could be described as the controlling mind of the
organisation, it would not be possible for the Metropolitan police as a
public authority to be prosecuted in respect of the death. It would
still only be possible to bring proceedings against the Metropolitan
police as a public authority under health and safety legislation, as
now, for a much less serious offence. In such circumstances, there
would be a strong likelihood that the United Kingdom would be found to
be in breach of the positive obligation in article 2, because the
criminal offences charged did not reflect the seriousness of the
conduct which led to the death, and the judicial system in place was
not adequate to secure the full accountability of state authorities for
their role in the death.</p><br>

Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood) (Lab):</b> Have
my hon. Friend and his Committee had an opportunity to consider the
Bill&#146;s impact on the armed forces, in relation to which there is
a series of wide-ranging exclusions? As I am sure he is aware, there
have been several deaths in Army barracks in peacetime which have not
been properly investigated by the police. Coroners&#146; courts have
recorded open verdicts and expressed concern over the operation of the
Army in the
matter.</p><p><a name="st_o292"><a name="061010160000016"><b><a name="61010-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="061010160000035">Mr.
Dismore:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and the
report touched on the issue. It is interesting to note that, while
training is included, operational activities are not. That applies
particularly to the emergency services. When I was in practice, I used
to act on behalf of the Fire Brigades Union. A number of deaths were
caused by serious management failures on the part of the fire service.
As currently configured, the Bill would not include such management
failure either.</p><p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para18"><a name="061010160000017">I am
concerned about the breadth of the general exclusion for public
functions in relation to statutory inspections. Such inspections
constitute a public safeguard against death and injury. Quis custodiet
ipsos custodes? That requires clarification in the Bill. As I have
said, I am pleased that the Government have provided some clarification
in regard to emergency services, but it does not go far
enough.</p><p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para19"><a name="061010160000018">In relation
to management failure, I believe that the Government have created a
significant loophole by tying the offence to the actions of senior
managers. While the comments of Mr. Justice Sheen in the
Zeebrugge ferry disaster inquiry castigated the management
throughout&#151;which might just have meant a successful prosecution
under the Bill&#151;I am not sure whether the test would have worked
at King&#146;s Cross, for example, where the failures were further
down the food chain, but institutional in the organisation of London
Underground.</p><p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para20"><a name="061010160000019">I
believe that, in having to focus on the behaviour of senior managers,
prosecutors will face disadvantages similar to those that they face
under existing law, looking for individuals&#146;
failures&#151;albeit possibly aggregated&#151;rather than corporate
responsibility as a whole. The test would exclude prosecutions in cases
in which death occurred in a discrete part of a business,
geographically or sectorally. What of a large building site, one of
many owned by a large developer, run by a major construction
contractor? The person in charge of the site has a large say in how it
is run, but may be a very small fish in a large multinational
operation&#146;s pond which sets the parameters within which he
works, especially through finance and the deadlines required by the
contract. The Government have indicated that the test will be
reconsidered, but I believe that under the Bill as currently drafted,
inadequate management practices and systems will
escape&#151;especially in large companies&#151;exactly as they do
under the existing
laws.</p><p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para21"><a name="061010160000020">The proposed
remedial order power is very welcome, but I believe that it would be
better backed up by a contempt of court power, like any other order of
the courts. That would overcome the argument over whether the sanction
for not complying with a remedial order was correct. But I think that
we need to consider more imaginative penalties, too. As has been said,
the sanction available is the same as exists under health and

multimillion-pound fines, in some cases&#151;will be much higher, so
it must be asked whether the Bill adds value to the existing position.
I believe that the Government are right to say that they will consider
more innovative sanctions in the light of the wider review of penalties
for regulatory
offences.</p><p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para22"><a name="061010160000021">The
Government have suggested that existing legislation allows the
disqualification of directors if they have been convicted on
indictment, but that response overlooks the fact that they cannot be so
convicted, as there is no individual liability under the Bill. The
opportunity must be taken to introduce a wider, more innovative range
of penalties that are likely to provide a better deterrent to poor
health and safety practices, and to deliver justice more effectively to
bereaved
families.</p><p><a name="st_o293"><a name="061010160000022"><b><a name="61010-0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="061010160000036">Mr.
Grieve:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another
possible consequence of the Bill is that it will depress fines imposed
for deaths that are only prosecuted under the Health and Safety at Work
etc. Act? Might that not be an unintended consequence of the new
framework?</p><p><a name="st_o294"><a name="061010160000023"><b><a name="61010-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="061010160000037">Mr.
Dismore:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. He
also made an important point about the possibility that one prosecution
would fail where another might succeed. Ultimately, however, the
decision must be for the Crown Prosecution Service and the Director of
Public Prosecutions, who must authorise
prosecutions.</p><p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para23"><a name="061010160000024">What is
important is for us to look at a wider range of alternatives. A series
of suggestions have been made. One is corporate probation, a
supervision order imposed by the court on a company that has committed
a criminal offence. A court can require a company, its officers or its
directors to alter their conduct in a particular way. Those penalties
have been used very successfully in, for example, the United States and
Canada. Another option is the use of equity fines. They would reduce
the value of shares in the company, clearly bringing home to
shareholders&#151;the owners of the company&#151;the implications
and effect of the criminal offence that their company had
committed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para24"><a name="061010160000025">I think
that the Bill&#146;s main shortcoming is the lack of individual
liability. In my view, that is one of the essential requirements of a
successful reform of the law such as I proposed in my own Bill. Since
2003, the Government have ruled out individual directors&#146;
liability in criminal law, which I consider to be a tragic mistake. The
strongest incentive for an individual director would be that he could
stand in place of his company in the dock as a result of its failings,
leading to the deaths of employees or members of the public. If company
directors can face individual liability for offences committed by their
companies under the Companies Act 1989, or frauds committed by their
companies, it is so much more right that they should face prosecution
if those companies kill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para25"><a name="061010160000026">Without that, the only option
is prosecution for regulatory offences. However&#151;this picks up a
point raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr.
Clappison)&#151;there is a strong argument that it is an abuse of
process to charge a company with two

Work etc. Act, arising from the same circumstances. But without a
conviction under the Act, there can be no individual liability of
directors or managers under section 37. We could end up with corporate
manslaughter charges actually reducing the individual liability of
directors in the most serious
cases.</p><p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para26"><a name="061010160000027">Given that
clause 17 also excludes secondary offences, I believe that one of the
main requirements of reform has been rejected. After all, the purpose
of the Bill must be to act as a deterrent, which, without individual
liability, it is far less likely to
do.</p><p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para27"><a name="061010160000028">Let me end with a
short comment on jurisdiction. Much has been written about it,
especially when the failures have been in England and Wales but the
deaths have occurred in either Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, I
am anxious that we should not rule out possible prosecutions when a
death could be further
afield.</p><p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para28"><a name="061010160000029">It is well
established that inquests can be held into deaths abroad&#151;indeed,
they may be required under human rights obligations. What if an inquest
reveals facts that show that serious management failure in England led
to a death overseas, but, owing to the Bill&#146;s limited
jurisdiction, those responsible cannot be prosecuted? Of course, ships
and planes may be under our jurisdiction, but what of the package
tourist killed on a far eastern holiday as a result of the substandard
construction of his hotel, which the British-based tour company knew
about and ignored, or killed by bandits or terrorists when the tour
company had clear warnings but turned a blind eye in the interests of
profit? I believe that we would face immediate calls for further change
in the law, as has happened in relation to compensation for victims of
crime abroad as a result of recent terrorist
attacks.</p><p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="61010-0012.htm_para29"><a name="061010160000030">Having said
all that, I believe that the Government are to be congratulated on the
way in which they have engaged with so many organisations in
considering suggestions for improvement. However, given the
Bill&#146;s current drafting, I also believe that the answer to my
original proposition &#147;Will it be easier to prosecute companies
that kill?&#148; is a resounding &#147;No&#148;. While some
obstacles have been overcome, other more serious obstacles have been
created. I have highlighted just some of the shortcomings which I
believe must be addressed in Committee, so that we can all welcome the
Bill as a major improvement in health and safety in the workplace, in
our transport system and in our public services, ensuring that our
manifesto commitment for three elections is met in
full.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_5"><a name="61010-0012.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="061010163000047">6.58

identification principle&#151;the need to find individual
responsibility before one could take the corporation to
court&#151;has been the main barrier to successful prosecutions and
the Bill is supposed to put that right. To the extent that it goes some
way to doing that, despite the criticisms that we have heard today, it
is to be welcomed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para1"><a name="061010163000003">We

counted the number of promises that Ministers have made on the record
since Labour came to power in 1997. There have been 12 over those
years, beginning at the 1997 Labour party conference, when the right

concern is with senior management failure. We heard from the Home

time tonight.</p><p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para9"><a name="061010163000013">The
issue of individual liability, referred to by the hon. Member for

on the issue compared with the previous consultation. There is also the
issue of Crown immunity. The Government are right to be proud that they
are getting rid of Crown immunity in a number of areas, but many
outside this place believe that the number of exemptions in the Bill is
large and that they go extremely wide; they are not narrow, as Home
Office Ministers sometimes would have us believe.</p><p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para10"><a name="061010163000014">There is a real danger that a

duty of care. The duty of care test is relatively limited in the Bill

planted into criminal law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para12"><a name="061010163000016">The fifth area on which I want

lack of imagination in, sanctions on corporate bodies, but what about
public bodies? There is a real danger that fines imposed on a public
body will simply result in extra allocations of resources to that
public body to ensure that the public service that it provides is not
hindered. We must think more imaginatively if we are to make sure that
public organisations feel the heat of the guilty verdict.</p><br>

management failure. If the Government stick by their proposal or even
change the wording of the Bill in a minor way, they will be storing up
problems. The real problem is that the Government are giving an
incentive to delegate health and safety issues outside the immediate
realm of senior managers. According to surveys of businesses, that is
already happening in anticipation of the Bill. Directors are passing
down responsibility for health and safety matters to junior managers.
They justify that by saying that every factory in the organisation is
different, that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate and
that the local manager should decide the best way to deal with health
and safety matters. It would be perverse if the measure were to reduce
the importance of health and safety to corporations. That needs careful
examination in Committee because we could end up with a far worse
situation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para14"><a name="061010163000018">The hon.
Member for Beaconsfield, in some detail, touched on the fact that the
test for senior management failure could lead to extra complexity and
add longevity to trials as one tries to decide whether there was a
senior management failure or a failure of the wider organisation. I
hope that, when we get the letter from the Home Secretary, we can have
more detail and he will have moved significantly. If not, that will
fatally undermine the Bill. We look forward to receiving the
letter.</p><p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para15"><a name="061010163000019">On individual
liability, the Government could have approached the issue in a number
of ways. The Home Secretary is right to say that it will still be
possible to take an individual director to court on a charge of gross
negligence. However, he started his remarks by saying how difficult
that was, particularly in large organisations, so he was arguing
against himself. Clause 17 deals with the idea of secondary liability,
whereby if the corporation is found guilty of corporate manslaughter,
the individual director</p><a name="61010-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="061010163000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;cannot be guilty of aiding,

provision out of the Bill seems to us quite wrong. It could mean that
while the corporate body is penalised, the court cannot deal with the
senior level individual who was responsible. We hope that the
Government will reflect on that point again in Committee. Justice must
be seen to be done and there is a real danger that clause 17 will
reduce the courts&#146; ability to find individuals
guilty.</p><p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para17"><a name="061010163000021">On Crown

&#147;historic&#148;, the provisions represent an important move
forward. We have seen too many examples in the past of Government
Departments and agencies committing serious offences without being held
to account for them. I worry that there are too many loopholes. The
hon. Member for Hendon referred to loopholes in respect of offences
under health and safety legislation. The Government said in their
response to the Select Committee report that they would look at the
issue again. They need to do so, because allowing such an exemption
seems bizarre.</p><p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para18"><a name="061010163000022">I am

immunity for a large number of organisations. We also want to test that
argument out in Committee. Many believe that the provision will affect
the custody of prisoners, either by the Prison Service or the police or
in immigration detention centres. There is a danger of Crown immunity
preventing prosecutions where deaths in custody have taken place. The
Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#151;the hon. Member
for Hendon&#151;would probably confirm that his Committee was indeed
worried about that point. Under the European convention on human
rights, the authorities have a duty to protect prisoners and there is a
danger of this exemption preventing the Government from meeting their
obligations.</p><p><a name="st_o298"><a name="061010163000023"><b><a name="61010-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="061010163000051">Mr.

he said should not lead us to allow the provision to go through
unamended. The Home Secretary tried to argue that public bodies were
accountable in many other different ways. They might be accountable to
the prisons inspectorate and, ultimately, to the electorate. However,
there have been too many examples of public inquiries into
deaths&#151;as with the Victoria Climbi&#233; tragedy, for
example&#151;failing to result in anyone taking the wrap. We have
also seen calls for public inquiries denied because of the extra costs
involved. We therefore believe that the exemption really goes too far.
There are also complications with respect to private prisons. As we
understand it, such prisons are less accountable than was suggested by
the mechanisms that the Home Secretary attempted to pray in aid for the
exemption. That makes for an even stronger case for ensuring that Crown
immunity does not apply in such cases.</p><p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para19"><a name="061010163000025">I hope that the provisions on

points about the exemptions of different organisations being drawn too
widely in the Bill. Some hon. Members have mentioned unincorporated
organisations and partnerships, and I completely agree with what they
said. It was mentioned earlier that the Government had argued that it
was far too difficult to include unincorporated businesses into the
legislation because they had no legal identity. Yet all those familiar

concern is with how the Bill is constructed, particularly with respect
to the duty of care that corporations and organisations have to bestow
on the victim before they can be accused of an offence. We believe that
that unduly limits the new offence and that focusing on the civil law
definition of duty of care rather than the law of negligence and
criminal law amounts to a restriction. For example, one could imagine
an organisation, especially if it is a public body, having a statutory
duty under health and safety legislation, but no duty of care. Once
again, that illustrates a problem with the approach. Surely every
organisation owes a public duty not to kill a person by its gross
negligence. It is a simple as that. Linking the issue only to duty of
care tests under civil law does not go far
enough.</p><p><a name="st_o304"><a name="061010163000031"><b><a name="61010-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="061010163000057">David

about the 58 deaths of illegal immigrants in the back of a lorry. In
that case, the defendant said that there should be no liability in
criminal law because there was no duty of care in civil law on the
ground that all the parties were engaged in a common criminal
enterprise. The Bill brings that defence back for
corporations.</p><p><a name="st_o305"><a name="061010163000032"><b><a name="61010-0013.htm_spnew8"><a name="061010163000058">Mr.

issue that I want to bring to the Minister&#146;s attention is
sanctions. The Home Secretary said, though he was not speaking very
clearly, that the Government were reflecting on new sanctions for
corporates and he mentioned a few of them. We know that there is a Home
Office review, but I do not believe that it has yet been published.
Perhaps the Minister will clarify the date of publication. A Whitehall
review is taking place and it could be linked to the Bill to produce
new types of sanctions on corporates, so it will be a real shame if it
is not produced in time for the Bill&#146;s passage. I am keen to

that.</p><p><a name="st_o306"><a name="061010163000034"><b><a name="61010-0013.htm_spnew9"><a name="061010163000059">Mr.

new sanctions can be applied. Indeed, the Government may wish to leave
it to Parliament to decide, as the Bill makes progress. Several
proposals have been made. For example, the hon. Member for Hendon
mentioned equity fines and the suggestion of corporate community
service is also sensible. Disqualification has also been suggested,
although for some reason the Government appear to want to rule that out
in this Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="61010-0013.htm_para22"><a name="061010163000036">As I
said earlier, it is a concern that, while the Government are getting
rid of Crown immunity in several areas, they have not made any
imaginative proposals for sanctions on public bodies, which do not feel
any serious pain as a result of fines. The careers of individuals
running those organisations might have a black mark set against them,
but the organisation involved would doubtless simply put in an extra

Scottish Executive would make its own proposals. That was the accepted

the issue and make some proposals, which were, on the face of it, more
radical and stronger than those in the Bill. Then the lawyers in
Whitehall and Edinburgh got together and decided that it was a reserved

December 1999, a mother and father and their two children went to bed,
looking forward to Christmas. At 5.30 in the morning, their house was
blown up in a gas explosion and their lives were extinguished. That
family&#151;Drew and Janette Findlay, with their two children,

&#163;15 million may sound a lot of money, Transco was found guilty
and culpable of the deaths of the family in Larkhall because of its
corporate negligence in not spending &#163;350 million in renewing
the pipelines that would have prevented the deaths of the Findlays. It
is claimed that a fine of &#163;15 million could be viewed as a
deterrent, but it does not appear so when compared with the &#163;350
million that the corporation did not spend. The only deterrent would be
a law that holds someone responsible and influences such

criteria for success when we look back in future. If we are trying to
punish&#151;there is good reason to punish some of those evil

risky pursuits contract out the work to avoid the risk of prosecution?
That might happen even with good companies, and even when the risk is
quite small. Does the Minister agree that large corporates could set up

I disagree fundamentally with the final comments of the hon. Member for
Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), as I very much hope that
we will push forward with the Bill. Of course, we must try to improve
it, and I shall make some observations later about how I think that can
be done. Indeed, I suspect that at some time in the future we will have
to go beyond the current proposals, but first I want to return to what
my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said at the beginning of the

a few days ago.</p><p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para19"><a name="061010168000002">I
first met Maurice de Rohan in the context of the Herald of Free
Enterprise disaster. He lost his daughter and son-in-law in the
accident, but the marvellous thing about him as a human being was that
he channelled his very real grief at the totally avoidable outrage
committed against his family into a search for creative answers to the
problems posed by the breaching of people&#146;s rights under the
existing health and safety framework. I continue to be inspired by the
humanity that he displayed in that
search.</p><p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para20"><a name="061010168000003">There have
been many incidents over the years, such as the Piper Alpha tragedy,
the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, various rail crashes and so on.
We call them accidents, but really they happened as a result of gross
and culpable negligence. Unfortunately, in many cases it was never
possible to prove that culpability.</p><p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para21"><a name="061010168000004">Lord Justice Sheen conducted
the official inquiry into the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster. In
his decision, he said that the capsizing of the vessel was partly
caused or contributed to by serious negligence in the discharge of
their duties by the captain, the chief officer and the assistant bosun,
and partly caused or contributed to by the fault of Townsend Car
Ferries Ltd., the owners. The court went on to suspend the certificates
of the captain and the chief officer for varying periods, but no other
penalties were imposed, even though 180 people died in a disaster that
should never have
happened.</p><p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para22"><a name="061010168000005">My right
hon. Friend the Home Secretary has already referred to Lord Justice
Sheen&#146;s description of P&amp;O, but it is worth quoting again.
Lord Justice Sheen said that

The House must consider what a difference this Bill would have made had
its provisions been applicable to the Herald of Free Enterprise

Bill is not likely to have the same impact in cases such as the
King&#146;s Cross disaster, to which my hon. Friend the Member for

the Bill goes far enough in terms of covering everything that
Parliament should do on behalf of the people who lose family members in
the many different types of disaster that
occur.</p><p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para26"><a name="061010168000009">I hope that my
hon. Friend the Minister will look at some of the technical issues that
arise from the Bill. It is certainly true that we need to look into the
question of incorporated as opposed to non-incorporated bodies. The
hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) made a good case
when he explained why he thought it inappropriate to make that the
operable distinction in these matters. In addition, the Committee must
look in detail at the narrow definition of management. I hope that the
Minister will consider extending that definition, and I know that he
has already indicated that he is prepared to do
so.</p><p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para27"><a name="061010168000010">When the Minister
winds up the debate, will he give specific guidance why clause 18 is
needed? It abolishes the application of the common-law offence of
manslaughter to corporations. I understand that lawyers are reluctant
to have more than one offence covering any particular incident, but my
right hon. Friend the Home Secretary earlier argued that the Bill would
allow the prosecution, in the most serious cases, both of a corporation
and of individuals. Clause 18 appears to weaken that power, and we need
to consider whether it is wise to retain
it.</p><p><a name="st_o319"><a name="061010168000011"><b><a name="61010-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="061010168000076">Mr.

letting me intervene, because although it is not for me to respond for
the Government, it seems to me that if the Bill has any merit at all it
is that it gets rid of the confusion and difficulties caused by the
need to find in a corporate manslaughter prosecution an individual or
group of individuals who can be identified as the directing mind.
Removing that confusion and replacing it with the measures in the Bill
is sensible, because it relieves the court and the prosecution of that
hurdle. I agree that the Home Secretary did not have full mastery of
his Bill, but he was clear about this point, which he made a couple of
times: the individual personal liability for manslaughter by gross
negligence remains. If the Bill has merit, it is that of getting rid of
the confusion that has led to many wasted prosecutions&#151;wasted
time, emotion and cost&#151;chasing corporate defendants through the
principle of identification, so I urgethe hon. Gentleman to
reconsider his criticism of clause

really whether lawyers can define in court the right and proper way to

best help us to change the minds of employers or managers who are

indifferent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para29"><a name="061010168000014">To go
back to the Herald of Free Enterprise case, it is almost inconceivable
that we could go as far as saying that any of the senior people in
P&amp;O deliberately set out to kill passengers on the ferry. That
would be a charge too much, even for me, as someone who has the lowest
possible view of P&amp;O management at the time&#151;those sloppy
managers who were unfit to manage a large company. However, in that
context, was the law that applied to P&amp;O at the time, which
included the concept of potential corporate manslaughter&#151;even
though it was not possible to prosecute in that case&#151;so clearly
defined in the minds of management that they could take risks under
that law that they would not take under the law that we propose to
introduce? It would be incredible if there was such a fine degree of
decision making among managers about the level of risk they were
prepared to take in a given
situation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para30"><a name="061010168000015">The
problem with P&amp;O was that the company was reckless not by
deliberate action but because health and safety did not figure strongly
enough in its culture at the time. The company took no real action to
drive through a health and safety
regime.</p><p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para31"><a name="061010168000016">I hope that
the Government will continue to consider the need to make sure that
those who should drive the health and safety case through companies
have a specific responsibility. In the case of the Herald of Free
Enterprise, that was not the captain, the chief officer or the bosun,
but the most senior P&amp;O managers who failed to make the safety case
throughout their whole corporate structure and thus allowed such lax
standards that 187 people
died.</p><p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para32"><a name="061010168000017">If we are to
change that culture and to stop not only those who are deliberately
indifferent, but also&#151;much more commonly&#151;those who are
simply casual in their view of their employees and the general public,
there must be direct responsibility for health and safety. There must
be named directors for health and safety&#151;as there are for
financial duties&#151;whose role and responsibility is to drive
through regulations about acceptable standards throughout the
organisation. The health and safety directors would thus have an
adequate defence if things went wrong, because they could show that
there was due diligence in the company and a proper attempt to provide
a healthy and safe working environment. If that was not so, the health
and safety directors should end up in prison&#151;as they should have
done in the case of the Herald of Free

Wright (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con):</b> I start by agreeing
with a sentiment that has been expressed by Members on both sides of
the House during the debate: a great many bereaved families across the
country have waited a long time for this gap in the law to be plugged.
To that degree, I congratulate the Government on making an effort to do
just that. I fear, however, that this Bill is not the legislation for
which all those families have been
waiting.</p><p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para34"><a name="061010168000020">I want to
deal with two problems, both of which other Members have touched on
already. The first problem, which the Government have correctly
identified, is with the original common-law offence of gross negligence
manslaughter&#151;the difficulty of identifying the directing mind.
That is the right problem to focus on, but I fear that we have only a
partial solution, because the Government have introduced a piece of
legislation that deals with it only inasmuch as it narrows down the
offence.</p><p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para35"><a name="061010168000021">The Bill
refers to senior managers and the need to identify negligence as being
perpetrated by them as a group. I accept that that is better than
trying to find an individual manager, but it is still not quite good
enough. It will not avoid entirely the difficulty posed to the Crown
Prosecution Service and juries by the original common-law
offence&#151;trying to find out who in particular was responsible. An
element of that concept must be retained, because to determine that the
people responsible were senior rather than junior managers, a degree of
detective work is required by the CPS and a degree of judgment by the
jury. That problem has not yet been
resolved.</p><p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para36"><a name="061010168000022">The more
substantive problem, on which I want to focus specifically, is Crown
immunity. Like other Members, I applaud the removal of Crown immunity
in principle, but I suspect that through the lengthy, detailed and
wide-ranging exemptions under clauses 4 to 8, that good move has been
substantially undermined. The exemptions are far too
wide.</p><p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="61010-0014.htm_para37"><a name="061010168000023">The Government
have set out to do something worthwhile and noble&#151;to deliver a
level playing field between public and private enterprises.
Unfortunately, that is not what the Bill delivers. The excessive width
of the exemptions is wrong for two reasons. They are needlessly and
damagingly wide. I say damagingly, because the impression may be left
in the mind of the public that the Government are trying to protect
themselves from the things on which they are most vulnerable&#151;the
cases that are most likely to come to court under the Bill. It would be
most unfortunate if that were the perception given by the Government,
although I do not think for a moment that is their intention. However,
unless that part of the Bill is amended, there is a distinct danger
that that impression will be given.</p><br>

that the Government are including in the exemptions all the cases that
have appeared in the headlines in recent months and years and all the
cases in which the public might think that the Government were most
vulnerable to a prosecution in the public sector for corporate
manslaughter. In respect of this Bill, the maxim remains true that hard
cases make bad law&#151;and that includes cases that are hard for the
Government, just as it includes cases that are hard for everyone
else.</p><p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para1"><a name="061010168000025">I shall explain
why such exemptions are needless. There seems to be insufficient trust
in two important bodies in the criminal justice system. One is the CPS,
on which we rely to choose which cases should be prosecuted and which
should not, and the second, which is more important in many ways,
consists of juries. We can rely, and we have relied, on juries to make
a distinction between cases that genuinely involve corporate
manslaughter on the basis of gross negligence and those that do
not.</p><p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para2"><a name="061010168000026">At this point,
I, too, should declare an interest: as a barrister, I have had quite a
bit to do with juries in my time, and my judgment is that, generally
speaking, juries exercise common sense and good judgment, and can tell
the difference between what is gross negligence manslaughter and what
is not. However, the Government have not given juries the opportunity
to do so in relation to a vast swathe of public sector activity, and we
should give them that opportunity.</p><p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para3"><a name="061010168000027">The Government fear that the
result will be convictions for gross negligence manslaughter in cases
where, for example, the police are involved in a counter-terrorist
activity, the emergency services are involved in a rescue or the armed
forces are operating in a military situation. I do not believe that
juries, properly directed by the judge, will reach those conclusions.
So I think that we ought to trust juries, because that will enable us,
as a legislature, to present the public at large, who, as other hon.
Members have observed, have waited a very long time, with legislation
that is fair and equitable across the board, and does not make
exceptions where they should not be
made.</p><p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para4"><a name="061010168000028">Of course I
accept that exceptions should be made in some cases&#151;military
operations in the theatre of conflict are a perfectly good
example&#151;but the exemptions in the Bill are too wide. The
military exemptions do not just cover operations in the theatre of
conflict. They could be interpreted to cover even basic training. That
is too wide, and there is no reason why the Government should be
concerned about narrowing those exemptions. I firmly believe, based on
my experience, that juries are unlikely to reach the wrong conclusions
in such
cases.</p><p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para5"><a name="061010168000029">I
should like the Bill to be improved. I believe that its principles,
aims and objectives are worth while, but it is not the Bill that it
should be. It is not the Bill for which thousands of families across
the country have waited so long, and it is not the Bill that they
deserve, because it appears not to level the playing field between the
public and private sectors, although it could do so far more
effectively. It is crucial to ensure that the Government&#151;the
state&#151;legislates for everyone, not just for everyone else. That
is why the Bill needs to be improved. I hope that during its passage
through the House it will be improved, and that we will produce the
legislation for which we have all been waiting for a very long
time.</p><br>

personal interest and a union concern, as a life-long member of the

represent a significant step forward. The Government propose to
prosecute companies whose gross negligence leads to the death of
employees or members of the public. If a company is found guilty of
corporate manslaughter, the penalty will be an unlimited fine and a
possible remedial order to address the cause of the fatality. Those
provisions will cover most public sector and voluntary organisations.

introduced the Company Directors (Health and Safety) Bill in 2003, and
the second of whom is Lawrie Quinn, who introduced the Health and
Safety at Work (Offences) Bill. Both men championed this cause with
passion, skill and
persistence.</p><p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para8"><a name="061010169000004">We all
accept that the key focus of policy regarding health and safety at work
must be on the prevention of accidents and fatalities at work. The
development of trade union health and safety representatives, working
co-operatively and constructively with management, has a significant
role to play in the workplace. Labour has long argued that being green
is good for business&#151;I note that the Conservatives have now
joined us on that. We also say that good safety is good for business
because it is an investment in a company&#146;s most important
resource&#151;its work force. I look forward to support for that from
Conservative Members today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para9"><a name="061010169000005">Some of the key figures show
the extent of the problem that we face. In 2005, 212 workers were
killed in work-related accidents. As data from the Health and Safety
Executive reveal, the deterrents in place under existing health and
safety legislation are, in my view, woefully inadequate. For example,
in 2003-04, the average fine for a company where health and safety
offences resulted in a death was just over &#163;43,000. The average
fine for health and safety breaches by individual managers and
directors was just about &#163;3,300 for each offence. It cannot be
argued with any credibility that the current rules act as a
deterrent.</p><br>

have been supplied with tragic examples of death at work. One such
example brought to my attention was that of a 15-year-old boy who died
after being caught in a crushing machine, while working at a
waste-recycling site in 2001. In the court case that followed, it was
revealed that the crushing machine had been left ticking over, while a
blockage was removed, when it should have been switched off.
Furthermore, the protective guards that should have prevented workers
from climbing on to the machinery had been removed. The company was
fined &#163;32,000 for breaching health and safety law. The boy lost
his life. No directing mind and no company director was convicted of
manslaughter.</p><p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para11"><a name="061010169000007">I
understand that, according to the HSE, 70 per cent. of workplace
fatalities are the result of management failures. It should be noted
that only seven small companies have been prosecuted under the current
legislation. It is unacceptable that we have seen 11 major national
disasters from the King&#146;s Cross fire to the Potters Bar rail
crash, resulting in about 671 deaths, and not one prosecution with a
custodial sentence for corporate manslaughter under the current
legislation. That is why we need effective corporate manslaughter
legislation and why we welcome and must improve the Bill. I believe
therefore that, when accidents happen, workers and indeed the public at
large have a legitimate expectation that the company, in corporate
terms, will be brought to account and that the consequences will be
serious, not minor or
trivial.</p><p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para12"><a name="061010169000008">In 2001, the
former head of the CBI, Sir Digby Jones, said, when commenting on
proposals put forward by the Health and Safety Commission as a draft
code of practice, that he welcomed the elevation of this subject to the
same level of consciousness in the boardroom as sales and finance. I
hope that the Minister hears my point that Labour&#146;s legislation
must ensure the same level of consciousness and, most important, the
same level of
responsibility.</p><p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para13"><a name="061010169000009">No
individuals in a company are more important to ensuring safety in the
workplace than directors. They decide the level of investment and
priority given to health and safety. They decide whether their company
is subject to proper health and safety audits and they encourage
recognition of unsafe practices and their remedies. Other areas of
legislation recognise the need to impose a custodial sentence, so this
Bill must be seen to be closing an anomalous loophole or, more
appropriately, putting a wrong right. I will return to that point
later.</p><p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para14"><a name="061010169000010">I and my

directors.</p><p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para15"><a name="061010169000011">I know

other issue that I would like to address is that of penalties for
flouting the proposed new law. I have considerable sympathy for those
who argue that if directors can be given a custodial sentence for fraud
or for breaking environmental or food safety laws, that should be an
option for the punishment of corporate manslaughter. How can it be
right that an identified director can receive a custodial sentence for
fraud or the breach of environmental or food laws but, should the Bill
become an Act of Parliament, no one is to be punished by custodial
sentence when corporate manslaughter is proven and a human being has
lost their life?</p><p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para17"><a name="061010169000013">I
ask the Secretary of State to consider reviewing the liabilities test
in the Bill. The weakness of this test has been part of the problem in
getting convictions under the current law and it needs strengthening.
Will he also look at the Canadian system of corporate probation and
consider tabling amendments to include such provisions at a later stage
in the Bill? I note that Families Against Corporate Killers, which has
sent a briefing to all Members of Parliament, is calling for a voice in
sentencing for the families of those involved in work-related deaths
that is equal to the voice of families of other manslaughter or murder
victims. That proposal merits serious
consideration.</p><p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para18"><a name="061010169000014">If
anyone is in any doubt that the Bill is needed as a priority, I ask
them to look at the TUC research published last month that shows that
nearly 4,500 young people are seriously injured or killed at work,
which is 20 per cent. more than five years ago. One person under 25
dies every month in a workplace accident. We have a duty to offer the
best protection to all workers but, for those who have a full working
life ahead of them, our responsibilities are
critical.</p><p><a name="st_o323"><a name="061010169000015"><b><a name="61010-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="061010169000055">Mr.

the hon. Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) about the reasoned debate that
we have had. We all share the concern to try to find a resolution to
the problem and to make improvements to ensure that fatalities do not

that have arisen this evening are about how best we can achieve that
and whether the Bill is able to seek the punishment of those
responsible for deaths of members of the public and, most important,
employees just going about their daily work. Will it be able to bring
about a change in the culture and the mindset of companies and the
directors of organisations to ensure that we have a step change in the
climate and the approach governing health and safety so that accidents
and incidents can be prevented in future? As other hon. Members have
said, however, the Bill falls short in a number of respects. I note
that this point was reflected fairly in the Home Secretary&#146;s
speech, at least on one issue. I certainly look forward to seeing the
amendments to judge the extent to which those concerns are adequately
and properly
addressed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para22"><a name="061010169000021">The first
issue I want to consider is that of identification and of how we move
on from the current requirement in common law for a controlling or
directing mind. My concern, as has been expressed by others, is that
the Bill appears to exchange one identification test for
another&#151;that of the senior manager. The issue has been raised by
stakeholders and the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers has said
that the current
wording</p><a name="61010-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="061010169000043"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will have the
effect of fatally undermining the Bill from the outset and will result
in negligent companies and directors escaping punishment through
technical defences. Victims&#146; families will, once again, be
denied the justice to which they are
entitled.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para23"><a name="061010169000022">I note that
the Home Secretary has said that this specific issue will be focused
on, but we cannot lose sight of such a fundamental and trenchant
criticism of the structure if we are to have a law that will help to
provide the sense of justice that we want to achieve.</p><p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para24"><a name="061010169000023">On the concept of senior
management and senior management failure, it is interesting to think
what will happen in practice and what the courts will consider in
testing that when this law comes before them. Travers Smith, a City law

are responsible represent a substantial part of the company&#146;s

likely it is that individual managers will be deemed to be responsible

ways, that builds on some of the comments from the hon. Member for
Eccles. Clearly, the view that some lawyers seem to be forming is that
if one is looking at large organisations, things will be much more
difficult to pin down.</p><p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="61010-0015.htm_para26"><a name="061010169000025">Leading on from that is how
companies operate and organise themselves. For example, there may be
one very large corporate concern, but it is likely to have a holding
company at the top, a plc, a listed company and, underneath that, lots
of operating subsidiaries. I am not clear how the test will operate in
that context. To use a lawyer&#146;s jargon, does it pierce the
corporate veil or not? Ultimately, managers at a local level could be
responding to directions or a general approach from a more senior
aspect within the structure of the company, at the top. Is it possible
to look up through the corporate structure to see who is ultimately
responsible? Which corporate are we talking about? Is it the
subsidiary, the intermediate holding company, the other intermediate
holding company, or the top company? We need to be clear about the
practical implications of how large organisations organise themselves.
In many respects, one of the problems in the past has been that the
existing manslaughter law seems to enable us to pin responsibility down
in the case of small organisations, small companies and small
businesses, where one can look at the structure that is in place, but
perhaps not in the case of larger organisations, where, judging from
the examples we have heard this afternoon, it has been difficult to
establish that identification principle.</p><p><a name="st_o326"><a name="061010169000026"><b><a name="61010-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="061010169000058">Ian

Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point
that, in many respects, cuts to the heart of the argument. One of the
interesting things in the context of what the Bill provides is the
interrelationship with existing health and safety legislation, where
that personal liability exists. That connection between the two things
concerns me in terms of ensuring that, if an action is brought against
the corporate as a consequence of the Bill, that does not in some way
cut across or undermine any other actions that might lie against the
directors personally in the context of health and safety legislation.
There is a clear interrelationship that we need to look at. I listened
carefully to the Home Secretary and he seemed to say quite clearly,
&#147;No. You could have an action that would rely on this Bill and
that would not impact on separate potential actions that could lie
against managers or directors in relation to health and safety
legislation.&#148; That is a key aspect. It is the connection between
the two things that, for me, provides the solution. As the Bill
proceeds, we need to test whether that works in practice.</p><br>

Grieve:</b> I appreciate the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making, but there have been prosecutions&#151;not for corporate
manslaughter or manslaughter, but under the Health and Safety at Work,
etc. Act 1974. Although I am sure that this is not what he intended, it
would be misleading to give the House the impression that no action was
taken against those companies at all. The HSE is pretty proactive in
that
respect.</p><p><a name="st_o334"><a name="061010168000042"><b><a name="61010-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="061010168000083">Mr.
Rooney:</b> I am trying to make two points. First, there would
have been no convictions for corporate manslaughter. Secondly, it is so
difficult to mount a prosecution for the existing offence of gross
negligence manslaughter for individuals that no one gets convicted.
That is why the legislation needs to be extended to include individual
liability. There would be the same protections that exist under section
37 of the 1974 Act because the conviction of a company would be needed
before an individual could be convicted. However, there are cases when
the public demand that someone should at least be brought before the
courts so that the case can be tested before a jury makes a
decision.</p><p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para14"><a name="061010168000043">Workers are
killed in most such disasters, but many members of the public are also
killed. The trade unions have a fantastic record of fighting for such
legislation, speaking up for their members when accidents happen,
representing them and giving them a voice. However, the innocent
members of the public who are victims have no voice&#151;no one
stands up for
them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para15"><a name="061010168000044">The evidence
taken by the Committee from Disaster Action, especially that from
people from the Marchioness, was powerful. The Bill provides that
private prosecutions may not be brought without the prior consent of
the Director of Public Prosecutions, but hon. Members should read the
evidence of the people from the Marchioness and about the obstructions
that were put in their way by legislative bodies, Law Officers and the
legal system, which denied them any opportunity of justice, and then
ask themselves whether such a provision is absolutely necessary. We
need to reflect on the fact that the DPP does not have a very good
track record on the issue. As I said, this is about not revenge, but
justice for victims and their
families.</p><p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para16"><a name="061010168000045">The
Committee made extensive reference to &#147;exclusively public
functions&#148;, which is a curious phrase in the Bill. There is an
arbitrary divide between government as a provider and a supplier of a
service, because a prosecution can take place in one case, but not the
other. The definition is difficult to follow. If the private and
voluntary sectors are increasingly going to be involved in the
provision of public services, the divide will become extremely grey.
Frankly, it would be better if the provision were taken out of the Bill
altogether. Deaths in custody are still a highly emotive issue with
regard to the police force and the Prison Service. Under the
definition, I think that a private prison could be prosecuted, but a
public prison could not. This serious issue has caused trauma and
distress to far too many people, yet no one is ever held

welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to consulting the Sentencing
Guidelines Council, but if it is fair enough in the context of the
Competition Commission that people can be fined up to 10 per cent. of
turnover, something of that nature might be appropriate. I accept that
in the Bill the fines are unlimited, but relating them to turnover in
general terms is a reasonable approach. There is a danger of penalising
shareholders. Ultimately, it is not the company that pays&#151;it is
always someone else. Most shareholders are pension funds, so penalising
shareholders for the actions of individual directors is, in effect,
robbing pension funds. We must be careful about
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para18"><a name="061010168000047">My final point
is on cases involving companies that are foreign owned, as is
increasingly the case, and the difficulty of finding the senior
management who take the decisions that lead to the action on the
ground. Their being abroad can result in no prosecution being possible.
A corollary of that, as we have seen far too often in the past, is
cases in which a company is found guilty and is hit with a massive
fine, and immediately ships its assets abroad.</p><p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para19"><a name="061010168000048">We raised with the Minister
the possibility of creating the ability to seize assets&#151;not to

nothing about that in the Bill. The Minister will remember the classic
example&#151;I will not name the company involved in case I should
not, but it is the asbestos case that arose in Armley in Leeds. It took
23 years for the residents and workers to get justice, but the day they
won their victory the company shifted everything to either the Bahamas
or the Cayman Islands and the people got not a penny. We would be
remiss if we did not remain aware of that possibility and try to deal

to the present point. In 2005, the Scottish Executive published a
report on corporate homicide by their expert group. The report was
welcomed by the Labour-Liberal Executive and by the whole Scottish
Parliament, yet the Executive took no action themselves. Instead, they
deferred to the UK Government in support of the then draft Corporate
Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill, which did not amend Scottish
common law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para23"><a name="061010168000053">In June
this year, the Labour MSP Karen Gillon introduced, with all-party
support, the Culpable Homicide (Scotland) Bill, which set out the
criteria by which an individual may be guilty of culpable homicide,
what offences were considered to constitute culpable homicide and how
an organisation may be held liable for those offences. She revised the
Bill in early September, but then withdrew it on 29 September, only a
short time ago.</p><p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para24"><a name="061010168000054">It
is worth pointing out that the Scottish Bill enjoyed extensive support
among unions in Scotland and in the rest of the UK. At that time, they
felt that the Bill before us&#151;referred to as &#147;the English
Bill&#148;&#151;did not go far enough in creating a deterrent
against endangering workers and citizens alike. Indeed, the Transport
and General Workers Union, to which a number of Labour Members have
referred, says that it

account.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para25"><a name="061010168000055">However, we
are where we are, and this is not a Scottish criminal Bill, but a UK

something with which to
work.</p><p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para26"><a name="061010168000056">There are
concerns that are common to Members on both sides of the Chamber. One
is the lack of personal liability&#151;the hon. Member for Lanark and
Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood) made that point best. Other
Members spoke about the difference between private organisations and
some public bodies. There is the issue of the legal arguments about the
fact that there is still a requirement for a duty of care. The hon.
Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) put it best when he described the
inconsistency whereby individual directors were charged, prosecuted and
convicted under certain claims, but not under corporate homicide, when
the death of an individual or individuals occurred.</p><p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para27"><a name="061010168000057">I shall briefly discuss the
Scottish position, before commenting on the issue of senior managers,
as I suspect that that will form the basis of the most significant
debates in Committee and on Report. In Scotland, it is possible to
convict a company of a common law crime if the prosecution can identify
an individual or a group of individuals who were the
&#147;controlling mind&#148; of a company&#151;that is, whose
acts and state of mind could be said to be that of the company
itself&#151;and who were guilty of that crime.</p><p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="61010-0016.htm_para28"><a name="061010168000058">The new Bill certainly removes

to be committed, it is not

that means that under the Bill only failures made by the most senior
managers of a company would result in a company being prosecuted for
corporate homicide. It means, too, that however serious the failures
outside the management circle, the company may well escape prosecution
under the legislation. That poses a danger because, while small and
family businesses, and businesses with simple management structures,
may be easily subject to the new law, as they were with previous
measures, large companies with complicated management structures may
well escape prosecution. Actions taken on their behalf by junior
managers&#151;perhaps by foremen, particularly on building
sites&#151;that lead to the death of individuals could result in a
company escaping

today&#146;s debate, this is not just an intellectual or even
ideological issue. Our motivation comes from practical experience, as
was well exemplified by my hon. Friend the Member for Lanark and
Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood). In my case, as a young solicitor
in the north-east of Scotland, I dealt with many personal injury cases,
a high proportion of which came from the North sea oil and gas
industry. I remember one particular case in which an oil worker had
been seriously injured on a drill floor. The circumstances of the case
and the way in which he was treated after the incident were horrifying
but not unusual. I was negotiating damages on the worker&#146;s
behalf with a representative of an American insurance company. After we
had gone through the nitty-gritty of the case and done our bargaining,
I asked him why his company tolerated its client&#146;s behaviour and
the lack of a proper safety system. His response was fairly blunt and
shocking. He told me that it was cheaper for oil companies to pay out
higher premiums than it was to stop production or to interfere with
processes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para1"><a name="061010175000003">I am glad
to say that that situation has changed. That incident happened at a
time when the North sea oil and gas industry was being opened up and
there was a Klondike mentality. The consequences were obvious in the
number of serious injuries and deaths but, while the deaths were
limited to individual incidents, the lack of a safety culture was
tolerated, not only by the insurance companies and their clients but by
the then Government.</p><p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para2"><a name="061010175000004">My second practical lesson
concerned the inevitable consequence of that lack of safety culture: a
major disaster in the North sea. In July 1988, the Piper Alpha oil
production platform exploded and 167 men were killed. That is still the
worst ever disaster in the oil and gas industry anywhere in the world.
The then Government ordered an inquiry under Lord Cullen. As expected,
he discovered a very poor safety culture and his detailed report showed
failings around a wide range of operations and functions on the
platform.</p><p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para3"><a name="061010175000005">When I
look back at that difficult period in the immediate aftermath of the
disaster, I can remember that many people in the oil and gas industry
were stunned that the platforms that they had built&#151;even one on
the scale of Piper&#151;were not capable of withstanding an
explosion. What is more shocking now than anything else, though, is the
complete lack of surprise that we all had about just how poor safety in
the North sea oil and gas industry was. It was common currency that the
disaster could have happened on any one of a number of platforms. I
think that we all just accepted that it came with the
territory.</p><p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para4"><a name="061010175000006">It was not

inspectors&#151;the inspectorate at the time&#151;inspected the
platform and pointed out a catalogue of deficiencies. In June 1988,
they inspected it again to follow up their original inspection. It is
clear from Lord Cullen&#146;s report that none of the deficiencies
pointed out in the earlier inspections, which had led to the death of a
worker, had been remedied and that there had been no improvement. Less
than a month after that last inspection, Piper Alpha
exploded.</p><br>

the operator safety systems and even more serious failings in the
Department of Energy and the regulators&#146; inspections. There
should have been prosecutions for corporate killing against the oil
company operators and against the Department of Energy. The Lord
Advocate of Scotland decided not to prosecute Occidental and there was
no possibility of a prosecution against the Department of Energy
because of Crown immunity. Both could have been prosecuted under the
Bill. It is welcome to remedy those failures alone, particularly in the
sense that it removes Crown immunity, in circumstances that are of
course limited, but
important.</p><p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para6"><a name="061010175000008">I should
like to refer to several points of detail. Some have already been
mentioned and I shall rattle through them fairly quickly. Mindful of
the comments made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie),
I welcome the fact that we have a UK Bill that recognises that there
are different legal systems that provide a common set of principles and
approach. Company law, employment law and health and safety at work law
operate across the whole of the UK, and that approach allows us to have
some consistency. There are points of detail relating to the Scottish
legal system that will have to be addressed and I hope that the
Minister will be able to deal with them in Committee.</p><p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para7"><a name="061010175000009">On senior managers, I welcome
the comments that the Home Secretary made earlier and hope that the
Government will be able to deal with the many points that have been
raised on this issue on both sides of the House. The last thing that we
want is a Bill that provides loopholes to companies that will make it
even more difficult to get a prosecution. This is an important issue,
and I look forward to hearing the results of the Minister&#146;s
deliberations.</p><p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para8"><a name="061010175000010">The
most difficult issue, and probably the most contentious, is that of
individual liability. I listened carefully to the Home Secretary
earlier and I accept that it is important to focus on corporate
responsibility. However, I find it difficult to understand why the Bill
is drafted as it is, when individual directors and managers can be
prosecuted under section 37 of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act
1974 in circumstances in which corporate responsibility is also
relevant. It is important that Ministers should listen to the strong
points that have been raised on this issue today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para9"><a name="061010175000011">There is also the question of
the extent of liability and the exclusion of non-incorporated bodies
and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North (Ann
McKechin) wants to make an issue of that in relation to the difference
between partnership law in Scotland and England. That provision creates
a particular problem, because the building and construction industry
has one of the highest rates of industrial injuries and deaths, and a
large proportion of the contractors and sub-contractors in that
industry are not incorporated bodies. We must look at the issue very
carefully.</p><p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para10"><a name="061010175000012">The Bill
provides for only two penalties: fines and remedial orders. I shall be
interested to hear how the Minister expects clause 10 to operate in
this respect. It is unfortunate that the Government have not taken the
opportunity to be more imaginative in regard to the way in which
penalties could be applied. I know that representations have been made

it has proposed a penalty of corporate probation, which is quite a
novel idea that I had not heard of before the TUC raised it with me. I
have now been given an extremely interesting paper on it. The
disqualification of directors, among other measures, could also provide
incentives to ensure that companies take the legislation seriously and
make a real commitment to improving their safety
culture.</p><p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para11"><a name="061010175000013">I think that
I am the only person to raise this next issue. I practised law for the
last time nearly 20 years ago, so I am rusty, but I was a wee bit
worried when I read clause 22(2), which provides:</p><a name="61010-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="061010175000074"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Section 1 does not

understand the principle that legislation should not be retrospective.
However, that subsection seems to provide a defence to a company that
had procedures in place before the commencement of the Act that
resulted in the death of one of its employees after its commencement. I
might be misreading that provision&#151;as I said, I am very rusty in
the legal area&#151;but I hope that a court would not use it as a
basis on which to acquit if a company had done nothing since the
establishment of its procedures until the death of the worker in those
circumstances. If there is a fundamental weakness in a safety system,
or a decision that leads to a death, that is a continuing matter until
it is changed or until there are consequences. I would not want to rely
on the ingenuity of the judiciary to make that decision for me and I
would be grateful if the Minister could examine that subsection
again.</p><p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para13"><a name="061010175000015">For many of

the Bill will help many people to find some closure and I support it
wholeheartedly.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_15"><a name="61010-0017.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="061010175000079">8.59

of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve).
He took a very reasonable and well-informed view. We need to see how we
can improve this legislation. The first thing that strikes me as being
in need of improvement is the complexity. We can improve the Bill
through simplification. It deals with a complex area of the law and, as
the debate has shown, it is not without complication itself. We must
remember that it will have to be implemented by the courts and
understood by juries, whether or not they benefit from the services of
the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. They need to understand the
legislation, and there needs to be as little room as possible for
escape through the loopholes that complexity inevitably
brings.</p><p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para16"><a name="061010175000019">The Bill
also needs to establish effective deterrents. We are talking about a
very serious crime, with the most serious of all consequences. Of
course the vast majority of employers are responsible and caring
people, but a small minority are unscrupulous and irresponsible, and in
some cases criminally
negligent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para17"><a name="061010175000020">The issues
at stake are profound. Serving on the Joint Committee of the Home
Affairs and Work and Pensions Committees, which looked into the Bill, I
was struck by the evidence that we heard from groups and individuals.
It brought home to me&#151;if it needed to be brought
home&#151;just how profound the issues are, and just how tragic the
consequences can be. There was, for instance, the evidence from the
mother of Simon Jones, on behalf of the Simon Jones memorial campaign.
The Home Secretary mentioned that lady in his speech, and his quotation
from her words was
apt.</p><p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para18"><a name="061010175000021">Let me briefly
remind the House of the background to the case. Simon Jones was a
24-year-old university student taking a year out in 1998 who signed on
at an employment agency to obtain work. One morning, without prior
knowledge of where he was being sent, he was put in a taxi and sent to
Shoreham docks. Within two hours of his arrival, he was dead. I am sure
that all of us who heard the evidence from that lady before our
Committee, and that of many other groups&#151;including evidence on
the Marchioness case&#151;were moved, and understood the need to
establish effective deterrents to try and safeguard employees and
members of the public as much as
possible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para19"><a name="061010175000022">We need to
view the Bill according to the criteria set out by my hon. Friend the
Member for Beaconsfield. We need to ask what difference it makes and
what, in practical terms, it adds to the existing law. We hope that it
will make a difference, but I have one slight reservation on which I
should like the Minister to comment. I have some idea of the extent of
the problem, and it must be emphasised that we are talking about a very
small minority of employers, but all the indications are that there is
a problem that needs to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para20"><a name="061010175000023">According
to the explanatory notes, it is estimated that between 10 and 13
additional cases of corporate manslaughter will arise following the
implementation of the new offence. Does that figure do full justice to
the extent of the
problem?</p><p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para21"><a name="061010175000024">As for
penalties, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield
about the level of fines. We must have appropriate levels that create a
deterrent. Let us look at innovative penalties for the offence, bearing
in mind the obvious restrictions on the type of penalty

it was fully prepared to accept the proposal as a good basis to

Katy Clark (North Ayrshire and Arran) (Lab):</b> I am grateful

it goes. As we have heard many times today, we have waited for a long
time for the Bill. Many on this side of the House and in the wider
Labour and trade union movement&#151;as well as those who have been
directly affected by incidents, particularly in the
workplace&#151;have campaigned long and hard for legislation that
will protect all those in the workplace. We wanted a Bill that would
cover all employing organisations, whether public, private, voluntary,
incorporated or unincorporated, and the individuals who own and manage
them. The Bill must hold all of them accountable under the
law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para23"><a name="061010175000027">Clearly the Bill
in its current form does not go as far as that. We have heard many

that the Bill will help some
people.</p><p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para24"><a name="061010175000028">We heard a
number of powerful examples from hon. Members, such as my hon. Friend
the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran), of situations
where the Bill might provide great assistance. We know that, every
year, more than 100 people die in the workplace. Last year, 384 members
of the public died in the workplace as a result of negligent employers.
We know that 1,000 other people died in road traffic incidents related
to the workplace. Many other incidents are not recorded, including
incidents that happen at sea but not
logged.</p><p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para25"><a name="061010175000029">We are told
that 70 per cent. of those incidents result from health and safety
failures and negligence by management. We are aware of the scale of the
problem and of the human tragedies that are involved. A constituent
came to me because her 37-year-old son was killed last year in a
workplace incident. She said that it was &#147;a mother&#146;s
worst nightmare.&#148; Her son was incinerated at work as a result of
failures in health and safety in the workplace as well as failures in
legal practices. That was also a tragedy for his wife and two young
children.</p><p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="61010-0017.htm_para26"><a name="061010175000030">The reality
is that many of those affected are young people and they are most at
risk, which makes it an even greater tragedy if there is an incident.
It is vital that we make sure that we have a legal regime that provides
effective sanctions to ensure that management are not willing to take
risks with the health and safety of their employees. We know that we do
not have that now and we know that Scottish law on culpable

feeling on this issue up and down the country. We saw it at the Trades
Union Congress last month, when policy decisions were taken to seek to
strengthen the Bill and we saw it overwhelmingly again at the Labour
party conference, where the importance of effective individual
sanctions and the responsibility of directors was emphasised. As we
move through the process, I hope that those issues will be looked at
again, so that we move forward from what is already good legislation to

ability to bring successful prosecutions at the corporate level.

that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has indicated that he is
prepared to reconsider the issue. The issues of penalties and corporate
probation periods are also
important.</p><p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para3"><a name="061010175000047">I shall
concentrate on the issues pertaining to Scots law. As my hon. Friend
the Minister is aware, the addition of Scotland to the Bill was a last
minute call. As a result, Scotland has not benefited from the wide
consultation on the Bill that has happened in England and Wales or the
scrutiny of the Select Committee. That places a greater onus on the
Government to try as hard as possible to ensure that the Bill works for
Scotland as much as it does for the rest of the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para4"><a name="061010175000048">I say that
because the Stockline factory explosion occurred two and a half years
ago in my constituency, killing nine people. As many other hon. Members
have mentioned today, the human cost of death at work affects so many
families in this country. In the past 10 years, the rate of fatal
injury in Scotland has, with the exception of only one year, remained
significantly higher than that in the UK as a whole. Similar
differences are evident in the figures for major injuries.
</p><p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para5"><a name="061010175000049">Scotland has a
different legal environment for enforcement. Prosecutions must be made
through the Procurator Fiscal Service rather than taken directly to
court by the Health and Safety Executive. The Procurator Fiscal Office
faces great challenges in its work load and it is perhaps unsurprising
that few members have great experience in the health and safety aspect
of the law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para6"><a name="061010175000050">Sadly,
the courts in Scotland tend to fine much lower amounts than those in
the rest of the UK. In 2004-05, the average fine per conviction was
&#163;4,846&#151;a decrease on the previous year of &#163;8,191.
We need a much better partnership between the Health and Safety
Executive, the Procurator Fiscal Service and judges if we are to stop
being the poor relation in the UK when it comes to health and
safety.</p><br>

the common law definition of manslaughter by gross negligence in the
Adomako case in 1997. It based its description on the civil law
interpretation of a breach of a duty of care. However, the definition
is the exact opposite in Scotland, where, in the Transco case, which my
hon. Friend the Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East (Mr.
Hood) mentioned, Lord Osbourne
commented:</p><a name="61010-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="061010175000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However,
it is quite clear to me that the two definitions are fundamentally

the Bill is enacted, it would not provide equivalence for Scotland but
create a definition of a crime that would apply only to corporations
and specific Crown bodies and not to individuals and other
organisations that the measure does not cover. I do not propose that
the Home Office start interfering with Scots criminal law&#151;my
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary can rest assured about that&#151;but
I hope that he will engage in urgent consultation with the Scottish
Executive as well as specific institutions such as the Scottish Law
Commission on the best legislative route to ensure coherence for the
victims of the crimes that we are considering.</p><p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para12"><a name="061010175000056">Partnerships are excluded from
the Bill on the basis that, in England, they are not a separate legal
entity. However, the opposite is the case in Scotland. Partnerships are
a separate legal entity and it could be argued that it would be logical
to include them inthe
Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para13"><a name="061010175000057">Pages 25 and 26
of the Joint Committee report recommended that the Government provide
certainty on the law of causation by including the Law
Commission&#146;s original provision in the Bill. The Government
rejected that, based on several recent English legal cases, on page 8
of their response. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary confirm
whether the Department has taken specific advice on the matter as it
relates to Scots law? If so, what were the conclusions?
</p><p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para14"><a name="061010175000058">Clause 16 refers to
prosecutions only by the public authorities, but for some odd reason,
it does not refer to Scotland and I therefore presume that private
prosecutions in Scotland would be permitted under the Bill as it
stands. Special constables are covered in only England and Wales. I am
sure that we shall try to iron out those points in Committee.</p><p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para15"><a name="061010175000059">Like many other hon. Members,

many anomalies that have occurred over the years. However, the
Committee that considers it will have a difficult job.</p><p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para16"><a name="061010175000061">Unlike many hon. Members who
have spoken, I do not have a legal background. However, I have a partly
trade union background. I cannot claim, like the hon. Member for Eccles
(Ian Stewart), to have been born a trade union member, but I was a
member of the Fire Brigades Union for many years, and I am proud to
have been a member.</p><p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para17"><a name="061010175000062">In that regard, I want to
stress that one difficulty in the Bill has to do with Crown immunity.
There is a difficult line to be drawn. I am sure that everyone in the
House is proud of our firefighters and emergency services, but if we
are not careful the people involved will think twice before they
respond to an incident, such as rescuing someone from the ice, for
example. They might not be worried about their own safety so much as
about the safety of the officers who follow, because they might be held
responsible in a court case if something goes
wrong.</p><p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para18"><a name="061010175000063">That is one
example of how Crown immunity could cause a real problem, but the House
will recall the explosion at the Buncefield facility in my constituency
on 11 December last year. The HSE had inspected the depot two weeks
before the explosion took place. I accept the many stories that we have
heard today about how bad employers and companies did not do the work
recommended after health and safety inspections, with the result that
accidents happened and lives were lost, yet that is not true of
Buncefield. I shall not pre-empt Lord Newton&#146;s inquiry, but the
evidence is that the HSE inspection found everything at the depot to be
safe. Even so, two weeks later, every safety device there
failed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para19"><a name="061010175000064">I am not a
lawyer and have no legal background, but I am pretty sure that the Bill
means that the HSE would be exempt from prosecution if it were found to
be negligent. This afternoon, I asked the House of Commons Library to
confirm that. It is a brilliant organisation, and it very quickly
produced a document for
me.</p><p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para20"><a name="061010175000065">In its first
paragraph, the document from the Library states that schedule 1 of the
Bill would mean that the HSE would be liable to prosecution, but the
next paragraph makes it clear that a judge would determine whether it
owed a duty of care. This House should make such decisions: as we have
heard already today, it is very dangerous to leave them to
judges.</p><p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para21"><a name="061010175000066">I welcome the
Bill very much, on behalf of all workers and members of the public.
However, the Minister and other hon. Members face a very difficult job
in taking it through the House. The exemptions for Crown immunity go
too far, especially as they apply to the Ministry of
Defence&#151;another subject about which I have a little knowledge,
although I do not have time to go into detail now. On the other hand,
we must be careful not to damage the ability of firefighters and the
members of the other emergency services to do their jobs in the way
that makes us all so proud.</p><p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para22"><a name="061010175000067">I wish the Minister and the

Eccles (Ian Stewart) said that 212 people had died in workplace
accidents in 2005-06. He also highlighted why we need to set out
directors&#146; duties, but the number of fatalities seems to have
reached a plateau over the past few years, even though the health and
safety code was revised in 2000. I welcome this Bill, as it will help
to create a health and safety culture that will allow progress to be
made.</p><p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para24"><a name="061010175000070">Of the total
of 212 accidents in 2005-06, 92 occurred in just two
industries&#151;construction, and agriculture, forestry and
fisheries. Moreover, 54 per cent. of the total number of fatalities
were caused by only three types of accident. The first type involves
moving vehicles or moving objects, especially on construction sites;
the second is people falling from heights and the third is falling
objects. Those fatalities could be prevented. In fact, the Health and
Safety Executive says that 70 per cent. of such accidents are
preventable, so the important thing is to take action to prevent
them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para25"><a name="061010175000071">The Bill will
stimulate a change in culture. The measure needs strengthening. Being
able to identify directors will give us the opportunity to move the
safety culture forward, because the board of directors&#151;the
boardroom&#151;decides on the allocation of resources for health and
safety. That is why it is important that we can identify directors. It
would not mean that we were taking revenge on companies&#151;the

stimulate a safety culture that results in a change that reduces
accidents. The legislation is important in that respect. We need to be
able to identify the director because that would ensure that resources
are put into dealing with health and safety. We would be able to create
a different culture and move the plateau for injuries and fatalities in
industry, which we have been unable to do since
2000.</p><p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para27"><a name="061010175000073">My right hon.

to the Government for avoiding the easy option of allowing Crown
immunity to remain and for ensuring that the protection of the

individuals who suffer through unlawful actions. The Bill provides
further recognition that human rights do not stop at the factory gate,
the entrance to the barracks or the gangway of the naval
vessel.</p><p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para31"><a name="061010180000005">The Bill
would benefit from clarification and strengthening in several respects.
First, the law should be fair to those who may be charged with offences
under its provisions, but it must also be robust, to enable enforcement
agencies to hold to account those responsible for the
offences.</p><p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para32"><a name="061010180000006">Secondly,
with special regard to the armed forces, we must ensure that the
curtain of military silence and cap-badge loyalty that falls over fatal
incidents cannot be a barrier to effective investigation. We need to
ensure that the soldier who speaks out is protected. The whistleblower
plays a vital role in the prevention of all corporate crime.</p><p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para33"><a name="061010180000007">Thirdly, we need to recognise
the right of victims and to give bereaved families a clearer role in
the process. Victims have a right to expect justice. We should be
looking for ways in which their involvement and participation in the
investigation and prosecution may be enhanced. The involvement of
bereaved families would serve the interests of justice and assist the
effective prosecution of
offenders.</p><p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para34"><a name="061010180000008">I have set
out my hopes for the Bill, but I have concerns, which have been
expressed by other hon. Members, about the possible exemptions created
for activities that are not a &#147;relevant duty of care&#148;. As
a member of the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, I note the
concern expressed in the joint report on the draft Corporate
Manslaughter Bill that preparation for combat operations might
encompass routine training. I note especially that, in response to
recommendation 37, the Government said that they would provide further
clarification. In fact, the Bill extends the exemptions to include
training of a hazardous nature.</p><p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para35"><a name="061010180000009">All hon. Members recognise
that the military are in a unique situation. Of course, combat must not
be included in the Bill&#146;s parameters, but other areas should be
included. I should like the Minister to clarify exactly how the Bill
will help members of the armed forces to find redress if they are asked
to carry out tasks that are unnecessarily hazardous and have no
reasonable military purpose, yet are stated by the military command to
be in preparation for an operation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para36"><a name="061010180000010">I am sure that my hon. Friend

causation that preparation can stretch? In May 2003, a soldier who was

has been some discussion about whether the Bill should apply overseas.
Will it extend to military barracks overseas? Again, there have been
such deaths overseas: 20-year-old Private David Shipley died in Germany
in 2002, as a result of drowning in a pool that should have been
emptied. The English coroner remarked that the account of Army
witnesses &#147;bore all the hallmarks of a concocted story&#148;.

killing.</p><p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="61010-0018.htm_para39"><a name="061010180000013">I could give
many more examples of unfortunate deaths that have involved
coroners&#146; inquests and where serious doubts have been expressed
about what happened. Coroners and the Health and Safety Executive have
found&#151;for example, in the case of Corporal Jason
Pears&#151;that there was a corporate responsibility behind such
deaths, yet no one has been prosecuted. We cannot continue to allow
that to happen. The Bill gives us the opportunity to address the
concerns of Army families throughout the country, where there is a
clear indication of corporate responsibility in such deaths, and I look
forward to the successful passage of this
legislation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_22"><a name="61010-0018.htm_ordayhd4"><a name="061010180000027">9.39

accidents.</p><p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para4"><a name="061010180000020">Some of
those accidents have led to the deaths of perhaps one or two people,
and some, like the Herald of Free Enterprise at Zeebrugge, which was
mentioned by one of the Labour Members with shipping or maritime
experience&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon. Member
for Dover (Gwyn Prosser) is not in his place at the moment. In the
Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, as in King&#146;s Cross and some
of the other railway disasters, huge numbers of people lost their
lives. So, what do we do about that? What do we do that is sensible and
practical?</p><p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para5"><a name="061010180000021">Of course,
every fatality is a terrible thing for the family involved. For
example, most people who have had a loved one killed in a car accident,
as a result of careless driving or of someone at the wheel being well
over the limit, want something to mark the appalling tragedy that has
hit their family. Often the victims&#146; families leave court
feeling that they have not had their genuine concerns assuaged.
Parliament must do what is right, of course, but it must also limit
itself to doing what is possible. We must not over-promise and we must
not increase expectations to a level at which they cannot be met, and
thus decrease public confidence in the justice system or the law-making
system as a whole.

armed forces and the emergency services. There have been some
interesting discussions about the way in which the penalties and the
remedies that the Bill provides should operate. There is room,
certainly under the clause 10 remedies, for some quite imaginative
thinking. There was concern, for example, that company directors could
not be disqualified under the Bill. Well, who knows? Perhaps a
thoughtful Minister at the Home Office might come up with a draft set
of guidelines that would, for example, lead to amendments to the Bill
that would allow for one of the remedies to be that a particular
individual should no longer be allowed to serve as a company director,
either for ever or for some period of time. The Committee ought to
focus its mind on that sort of thing. I am sure that the Government,
with all the assistance that they have at their disposal, will be
willing to consider that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para7"><a name="061010180000023">I dare say that the Home
Secretary, in his opening remarks, did not display his usual mastery of
his brief. He may have been distracted by what was going on in the
other place, where I fear the Government suffered a serious defeat on
the proposal to abolish the prisons inspectorate. However, he was able
to take on board the fact that there is an area of concern about the
liability of unincorporated bodies. We may well see more of that in
Committee.</p><p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para8"><a name="061010180000024">I have
only a very little time left to sum up, which I do not mind at all
because that has made it possible for 20 speakers to get in ahead of
me. I am pleased to say that during the debate broad themes have
emerged. First, there is the need for the Bill to work. Secondly, there
is the need for the Bill to have UK applicability. That point has been
made by Scottish Members, as well as English Members. There is also a
need to make sure that the remedies and the penalties fit the crime.
Above all, we want to ensure that when the Bill comes into law, as it
no doubt will, it does so in a fashion that does not allow anybody to
say that it was but a gesture Bill that was not designed to improve, or
to change the culture of, safety in the workplace, and that the only
important bit about it was its name.</p><p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para9"><a name="061010180000025">The words &#147;corporate
manslaughter and corporate homicide&#148; ring loudly across this
Chamber, but we need to be sure that the Bill&#146;s title is not the
best part of it. It is the guts of it&#151;the body&#151;that is so
important, and this Parliament, including the Standing Committee, need
to concentrate very carefully on the detail of these proposals. A Bill
that sounds good but does no good is no Bill at
all.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_23"><a name="61010-0019.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="061010183000372">9.50

is not here by accident&#151;it has not simply come along without a
great deal of thought. As all Members have said, the issues that we
have to face are clearly complex. Yes, the Bill has been a long time

and I am proud of that fact.</p><p><a name="st_o352"><a name="061010183000004"><b><a name="61010-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="061010183000375">Mr.

am very proud to be associated with it, but surely the real meaning
behind it is not that we want to punish those who have killed people,
but that we want to prevent them from killing people in the first

will be hard to achieve.</p><p><a name="st_o353"><a name="061010183000005"><b><a name="61010-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="061010183000376">Mr.

right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said when he outlined the Bill
this afternoon, there are differences between us, but we should not
lose sight of the nature of what we are trying to achieve in respect of
corporate manslaughter. The Bill builds on the health and safety
legislation that Labour Governments have introduced over many years,
and which we are very proud of, particularly the Health and Safety at
Work, etc. Act 1974.</p><p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para12"><a name="061010183000007">The Bill is a short one but as
we have heard today, the debate that it has generated is not without
contention; there are complex issues that we have to face. However,
there is no real argument as to whether the current law of corporate
manslaughter is working: it clearly is not. It does not provide justice
and it does not apply fairly to organisations. As has been said, this
is about trying to bring about a culture change within
organisations.</p><p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para13"><a name="061010183000008">As
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)
said, the winding-up time has been limited because of the need to
ensure that Members were able to contribute to the debate. Many issues
have been raised and I shall try to deal with as many as possible; I
shall write to Members on those that I am unable to deal with. As the
Home Secretary said, we will let Members know about the amendments that
we want make, particularly on the liability test.</p><p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para14"><a name="061010183000009">The hon. Member for
Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) expressed the concern that the
Bill might not add anything to the existing health and safety
legislation. For the families of those killed through the abject
failure of organisations to meet their health and safety
responsibilities, the Bill is far from pointless. It is important that
culpable behaviour be properly labelled, especially to the relatives of
those who have died.</p><p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para15"><a name="061010183000010">Several Members raised the

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 265</b><br>might deal with this issue, but he was then very clear and at pains to
say that it does not.</p><p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para16"><a name="061010183000011">The problem with the law is
that corporate liability is contingent on individual liability. That
does not work because the nature of decision making in complex
organisations is such that responsibility can rarely be laid at the
door of a specific individual, which has made it difficult to prosecute
large organisations for manslaughter. The Bill tackles that specific
problem. It establishes a new basis for liability that shifts the focus
from the conduct of individuals and places it on the management of
systems and processes. The Bill is concerned with creating an effective
corporate offence, not individual
liability.</p><p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para17"><a name="061010183000012">We have
heard concern from hon. Members on both sides of the House about the
senior manager test. We have taken seriously the points made about the
test during consultation on and scrutiny of the draft Bill. Our
intention is to make corporations liable when the organisation as a
whole has utterly inadequate practices or systems for managing health
and safety. We introduced the concept of failure at a senior level to
provide reassurance and clarity on the fact that the offence should not
capture failures at just a juniorlevel. The measure was widely
misinterpreted as reintroducing a form of liability that was reliant on
finding individuals who could be taken to represent an organisation
guilty of
manslaughter.</p><p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para18"><a name="061010183000013">As my
right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said, we will bring forward a new
test in Committee that will achieve our aims in a way that does not
risk the reintroduction of an identification obstacle. We will make the
amendment available to the Chairs of the Work and Pensions Committee,
the Home Affairs Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
which have played a crucial and central part in what we have tried to
achieve with the
Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para19"><a name="061010183000014">Our debate also
touched on the position of public bodies and activities not covered by
the Bill. It is quite wrong to say that the way in which we have
approached this effectively brings Crown immunity in through the back
door. The existing law of corporate manslaughter has no application to
the Crown at all. We have lifted Crown immunity for the new offence
because the Government believe that it is right that the offence
applies equally to the public and private sectors when they are engaged
in similar activities. It is right that Crown workers are protected by
the Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para20"><a name="061010183000015">The Bill
comprehensively covers the Crown&#146;s duties to provide safe
systems of work for employees and in the workplace. Enabling the
judicial scrutiny of breaches of those duties in the context of
manslaughter is an unprecedented step. This is not about applying
criminal law to the way in which core Government or public functions
are carried out. Carrying out such functions involves fundamental
public matters, such as the allocation of limited public resources and
protecting the public from harm that is often created by
others.</p><p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="61010-0019.htm_para21"><a name="061010183000016">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) asked
whether public and private prisons would be treated differently. As far
as the Bill is concerned, they are both in for employer duties and the
safety of premises, but they will both be out for dealings related to
operational prison activities.</p><br>

report, which is about corporate sanctions, rather than duties on
directors. In Committee, we need to examine the duty of care,
directors&#146; duties and disqualification. However, we believe that
they are all affected by other aspects of Government policy, notably
the Companies Bill and issues affecting the Department for Work and

David Wilshire (Spelthorne) (Con):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Speaker. Earlier today, you and many hundreds of us
attended a memorial service for our good friend Mr. Eric
Forth. Is there in any way in which Standing Orders allow us to have
put into <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow that, had Mr. Forth been
here tonight, he would have opposed both of those procedural motions,
because they were things that he
hated?</p><p><a name="st_o355"><a name="0610112000333"><b><a name="61010-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="0610112000683">Mr.
Speaker:</b> I remember the right hon. Member, Eric Forth,
with great fondness, but I do not think that Standing Orders can
reflect anything other than the fact that the hon. Gentleman has now
put the matter on the record&#151;that, had Eric Forth been present,
he would have opposed those motions. Of course, the one thing that he
taught us all was to keep within the strict rules of the House. That
was his expertise and he never gave the Speaker any problems because he
always kept within those rules. We all regret the passing of Eric
Forth, especially today when we attended his memorial

Jones (Warrington, North) (Lab):</b> In 1998, this Government
became the first to take the needs of carers seriously when they
established the national carers&#146; strategy to look across
government at the needs of carers and to recognise the enormous
contribution that they make to their families and to society as a
whole. Since then, much has been achieved, which I want to recognise
and applaud before I go any further. The carer&#146;s premium, for
instance, has increased from &#163;12 to &#163;25.80 a week and the
carers&#146; grant to local authorities to provide additional breaks
for carers, which was &#163;20 million when it was introduced in
1999, went up last year to &#163;285 million. The state second
pension will enable carers to build up pension credit of their own over
time. All that is good and valuable, as is the support that the
Government gave to the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 and the
decision to introduce into the Work and Families Act 2006 the right to
flexible working for carers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0610112000337">While we recognise the progress
made, we all have to be honest and say that we need to go further. We
need to do so not only for the sake of carers, but for ourselves,
because the changing needs of our economy and the skills shortages that
we will face in future mean that we are going to need carers who are
able to combine their caring with paid work. Now that the Government
have given carers many more rights at work, our task is to ensure that
they can exercise them for the benefit of themselves, their families
and society as a
whole.</p><p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0610112000338">All the
indications are that many carers wish to combine their caring with paid
work. In fact, 80 per cent. of carers are of working age and they
already form 12 per cent. of the work force. If they are to exercise
their rights successfully, it is important that they are not driven out
of the work force because they cannot receive the support that they
need or because it becomes financially unviable for them to work. In
order to ensure that that does not happen, we need to achieve two
things. We need to look carefully into the support available to carers
and into how the carer&#146;s allowance currently operates. That is
what I shall concentrate on tonight.</p><p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0610112000339">Very few carers&#146;
assessments even now ask about their wish to work or their current job.
Although the 2004 Act ought to change that, the cultural shift is
taking a very long time to come about. In addition, I believe that the
carer&#146;s allowance as currently constituted leads to real
injustice and amounts to a massive disincentive to work. At
&#163;46.95 a week, it is already the lowest income replacement
benefit and it is for a minimum of 35 hours of caring. Because of the
rule that one must not be gainfully employed, once one earns more than
&#163;84, the allowance stops. There is no taper; it is a complete
cut-off.</p><p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para5"><a name="0610112000340">In providing
an example of what that leads to, I cite the case of Mrs.
Lesley Jarvis. She was one of the carers that I was privileged to meet
on the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers carers&#146;
day last June. I really mean that it was a privilege, which will

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 274</b><br>become apparent when we understand what Mrs. Jarvis does. Her
husband had a massive stroke and needs 24-hour care. Her family helps
to care for him during the day, but she looks after him during the
evenings and at weekends. That allows her to work, but by making the
huge effort to keep herself in employment, she earns too much to
qualify for carer&#146;s allowance. Mrs. Jarvis works in
retail, which is a euphemism for not being paid very much. In terms of
the carer&#146;s allowance, too much need not be very much at
all.</p><p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0610112000341">Another case
cited by USDAW is of a gentleman who gave up work to care for his
mother. He now works from 7 am to 1 pm and cares for his mother until 7
pm each evening and at weekends. He earns &#163;150. In effect, with
both his caring and paid work, he works12 hours a day, seven
days a week, for &#163;150. That is intolerable in a strong economy
in the 21st century. It is even more scandalous when we realise how
much carers save the economy. They do not do it for that
reason&#151;they do it for love&#151;but it is undoubtedly true
that their unpaid caring saves us an extraordinary amount of
money.</p><p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0610112000342">It costs a
minimum of &#163;377 a week to keep someone in a local council home.
It costs &#163;1,000 a week to keep someone in an acute hospital
ward. It is estimated that carers, as well as improving the quality of
life ofthe people for whom they care, save the
economy&#163;57 billion a year. That is the entire cost of
the NHS and &#163;10,000 per
carer.</p><p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0610112000343">In return, we
not only give them very little, but subject them to massive bureaucracy
when they want to work. Maggie Hughes is another carer whom I met that
day. She told me that if carers are close to the&#163;84
earnings limit, they are kept on a non-established list. That means
that they have to keep producing wage slips and letters from their
employer and filling in forms. That is very time consuming. She also
found that going back and forth to the Benefits Agency used up a lot of
time and energy that, together with work and caring, she simply did not
have. We can do better than that for people who are making such an
effort to help themselves.</p><p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para9"><a name="0610112000344">We have to do better, not only
for the carers, but for ourselves. Our working population is declining,
relative to the rest of the population. The Government rightly want to
encourage work for those who can, for their own benefit and that of the
economy. But our social care system relies on an army of unpaid carers.
The Pensions Commission tells us that whatever choice we make on
pensions we will all have to work longer, but it is estimated that by
2037 we will need an extra3.4 million carers just to cope with
the rising number of elderly and frail people. We are living longer and
as a result we spend more years in ill health. Even over the next 20
years our economy will need an extra 2 million workers. Only a quarter
of those will come from school leavers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para10"><a name="0610112000345">As the Education and Skills
Committee, of which I am a member, points out, that means that adult
skills will be vital in the future. We cannot afford to lose the skills
and experience of people who have caring responsibilities. We have to
find a way of squaring the circle, because that is vital to our future
economic prospects. It has other benefits. Keeping carers in work
allows them to keep their skills up to date, so that when they are
ready to go back to work full time, they are

which many carers suffer and it has health benefits. Most importantly,
it helps to keep people out of poverty, both when they are caring and
later as they get older.</p><p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para11"><a name="0610112000346">Yet we make it more difficult
for people not only to stay in work, but to get back to work. There is
no mechanism for allowing carers to try out a job and perhaps go back
on benefits if it does not work out without going through the huge
bureaucratic process all over again. When people want to try to study
to improve their qualifications, they encounter the same problem with
carer&#146;s allowance: if they study more than 21 hours a week, they
lose all their carer&#146;s allowance. Yet many vocational
qualifications require more than 21 hours a week of study. What sort of
message does that give people who are doing their best to improve their
situation? It is more worrying when we realise that the peak age for
caring is between 45 and 64&#151;exactly the age when people have
acquired skills and experience and progressed in their jobs so that we
can least afford to lose them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0610112000347">If we examined what we would
save in carer&#146;s ill health, the contributions that people in
work would make&#151;it is estimated that one in three carers who are
currently not in paid employment would like to be, if they had the
opportunity&#151;and what we would save in future in pensions and
benefits, we might realise that it would pay us to ensure that more
carers could stay in
work.</p><p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0610112000348">Although I am
making the economic case, it is fundamentally a matter of justice.
Sometimes we simply have to do the right thing because it is the right
thing to do. It is intolerable that people who carry such a heavy
burden and save the economy so much money are forced into poverty as a
result. That often happens. A survey by Carers UK showed that one in
five carers have had to cut back on food; one in three find difficulty
paying utility bills and, astonishingly, four out of 10 find that
trying to pay for the support and services that they need causes them
financial hardship.
</p><p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0610112000349">Let me quote Maggie
Hughes again&#151;I hope that she will not mind. She also works in
retail and cares for her disabled son. She
said:</p><a name="61010-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="0610112000357"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When my
other children could not look after Stephen on Saturdays, I had to pay
someone to look after him. This didn&#146;t work out as it was
costing me more money to pay someone to look after Stephen than I was
earning.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0610112000350">That is the
Catch-22 into which we put many people. They cannot earn too much
because they lose carer&#146;s allowance and that means that they
cannot afford the services that they may need.</p><p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0610112000351">More than that, we ensure that
carers live in poverty in future. One in three have no savings. There
is nothing to pay for the breakdown of something in the house and no
resources for their old age. Although the state second pension will
help many carers, it is not a substitute for being able to work and
build up a better pension in one&#146;s own right. Yet because of the
&#147;gainfully employed&#148; rule, those who work find that they
are excluded from many other benefits such as statutory sick pay,
statutory maternity and adoption pay and pension contributions. We are
storing up a problem for the future. We must tackle it.</p><br>

difficulty is not an excuse for not starting on something. The
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire) has a good track record
and is concerned about the issue. We need to ensure that carers get the
support and equipment that they need quickly to help them to work, not
only because it is their right but because it is that of the people for
whom they care. We should examine the way in which carer&#146;s
allowance works, with a view to ensuring that, in future, it is an
allowance with a taper, which rewards work rather than acting as a
massive disincentive to
work.</p><p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0610112000353">We should also
look at making an exemption in respect of the number of hours of study
undertaken by people pursuing a recognised vocational qualification. In
addition, we should consider establishing a scheme, similar to the one
that operates for disabled people, that would allow carers to try going
back to work but then to return to claiming benefit if that does not
work out.</p><p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61010-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0610112000354">At the
Labour party conference, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said that
he wanted the honours system to reward people such as carers and home
helps. I agree 100 per cent., but he would agree with me than an MBE is
not much use to people who cannot pay their bills or who face poverty
in old age. It is time for us to look at the problem very seriously and
to give carers the recognition that they deserve. That is in their
interests, but it is in our interests

of Apex Scotland&#146;s employees and volunteers, as well as some of
its clients. Later that afternoon, ironically enough, a constituent
visiting my surgery told me that he had an excellent rapport with Apex
Scotland and with the Department for Work and Pensions, and that he had
been able to help a young man to take advantage of the new deal and
perform 16 hours of work a

in the House understand, caring is not something that other people do;
it is often something that we shall do at some point in our life, which
gives us empathy with some of the issues that have been raised tonight.
As my hon. Friend pointed out, there is an ageing population and an
increased demand for care at home. People do not necessarily want to
move away from home so the role of informal carers is set to become
even more significant in the
future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0610111000009">We all
recognise that for some carers&#151;perhaps those with a disabled
daughter or son&#151;caring can be a lifelong commitment; it is not
something that they can opt out of when it suits them. My hon. Friend
said that the caring peaks are for people between the ages of 45 and
64, when their parents are growing older, and that is certainly
reflected in the number of people receiving carer&#146;s
allowance.</p><p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0610111000010">I realise
that my hon. Friend wants to focus on issues that mainly affect carers
of working age. However, she will recognise that many carers over
pension age are still very much engaged in caring responsibilities.
That is why provision for carers has developed over a broad

hope that my hon. Friend will recognise in particular that the
Government&#146;s removal of the age limit for claiming
carer&#146;s allowance has given an additional 188,000 pensioner
carers access to an additional amount through pension credit, which
means that they are up to &#163;26.35 a week better off than other
pension credit
recipients.</p><p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0610111000011">Carer&#146;s
allowance is a non-contributory and non-income-related benefit for
those providing informal care. It helps carers who are not entitled to
other help from social security or who do not have significant
part-time earnings, or no earnings. It is in fact an income replacement
benefit. The earnings limit is one of the benefit&#146;s essential
features. From 2001, we raised the limit from &#163;50 to &#163;72
a week&#151;an increase of more than 40 per cent. We also aligned the
amount withthe lower earnings level of national insurance
contributions so that it increases every year, which was not the case
before 2001.</p><p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0610111000012">The limit
is currently &#163;84 a week, as my hon. Friend indicated. However,
people can receive carer&#146;s allowance with earnings well in
excess of that amount. In line with the general rules in social
security, when someone claims the allowance their gross earnings are
converted to a net earnings figure by deducting income tax, national
insurance contributions and half of any payments to a personal or
occupational pension scheme. There are also allowances for the business
expenses of self-employed
people.</p><p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0610111000013">Perhaps I can
illustrate the process by quickly describing a couple of real case
studies, as the impression has been created that &#163;84 is the
limit that a person can earn. A woman who looks after her partner is
receiving carer&#146;s allowance. She decides to work part-time and
her weekly earnings, net of income tax and national insurance
contributions are &#163;150. She has to pay a carer to look after her
husband, Peter, while she is at work, which costs &#163;85 a week.
Half her net earnings, or &#163;75 a week, can be allowed towards
that expense, reducing her net earnings figure for carer&#146;s
allowance purposes to &#163;75 a
week.</p><p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0610111000014">I appreciate that
such calculations may seem difficult during a short Adjournment debate
at the end of an evening. However, we make allowances for certain
expenses, and they allow individuals to earn significantly more than
&#163;84 a week, as my case study has indicated. I recognise that we
need to get that message across far more clearly to people who are
either thinking of finding employment or who are currently in
employment. I could give the House a similar example of someone who is
self-employed if I had the
time.</p><p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0610111000015">I recognise that
my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North thinks that we should
not just introduce a taper but perhaps remove the earnings limit
altogether. I understand that the ambition to do more for carers is
something that echoes around many parts of the House, and we are always
considering what more we might do to help them. The problem is that, if
we lift the earnings limit, we would remove the rationale for
carer&#146;s allowance itself, which is to provide a measure of help
for carers who are disadvantaged by limited employment opportunities.
Those who provide 35 hours of care a week will tend not to have high
personal earnings. It is the minority who are in a

the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)&#151;the
introduction of a tapered earnings limit for carer&#146;s allowance.

was reduced by a percentage of their earnings, not by the
total.</p><p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="61010-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0610111000017">I must be quite

additional complexity to the system and incur quite significant
additional administrative costs. However, I hear what my hon. Friend

almost every other week or month, or whatever, to get some sort of
qualification for her carer&#146;s allowance. In fact, her
