With the Government owning 67 per cent. or thereabouts of some of the banks, surely the Government should be putting more pressure on those same institutions to lend the money and to reduce the charges that are now being faced, so that people can get on with their business and unemployment can be maintained at a low level in Ayrshire.</p>

Points were made in that meeting with small businesses about the availability of credit, which is why we have taken the measures that we have. The Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that it will commit &#163;25 billion of additional lending, while the Lloyds group has announced &#163;14 billion of additional lending, as part of the asset protection scheme. That is legally binding, because we need to ensure that Scottish businesses&#151;particularly small businesses, but also businesses across the whole of the UK, not just in Scotland&#151;can access credit and trade again, as part of a future recovery.

 I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has met small business leaders and the First Minister to discuss the economic situation in Scotland. However, I am disappointed that once again post-meeting reports were characterised by the First Minister and the Secretary of State briefing against each other. When will we see the mature relationship between Westminster and Holyrood that we should expect in order to tackle an economic crisis of this scale? Perhaps the Secretary of State can make a start on this new relationship today by embracing the Chancellor&#146;s call for humility and collective responsibility and apologising to the people of Scotland for the multitude of economic mistakes that his Government have made.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point, which I know is particularly relevant in his constituency, as it includes a large number of financial services sector workers. What has happened has, unfortunately, led to the portrayal of all those in the banking sector as being greedy and in receipt of enormous bonuses. As he knows and as we all know, a large number of people working in banks in the back office or as bank tellers, for example, are on very average wages and they work very hard. Some of them may have had share options, which are now more difficult. It is important that we stop demonising all bank workers simply because of the irresponsible behaviour of a tiny minority of those who previously had leading and well paid positions in these organisations.</p>

 The fact is that the international regulatory regime did not keep pace with a remarkable change in the global movement of finance&#151;a fact now well acknowledged across the world. That is why we need, as part of the G20 process, a new architecture for regulation. Banking will never be and should never be the same again. As for the hon.

Many Scottish families have people who have lost their jobs over the past few weeks, as has been confirmed today.

 I would like to add my own expressions of sympathy and condolence to the family and friends of the three soldiers who tragically lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last week. With the death toll among our brave servicemen and women now at more than 150, it is right that we should pause to reflect on the immense sacrifice that they and their families have had to endure in serving this country and, of course, the people of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90318-0003.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000121">Does the Prime Minister believe that the culture of frenzied target setting that has been introduced into the NHS by his Government had any role to play whatsoever in the horrific events that occurred at Stafford general hospital?</p>

 May I and Health Secretary first say that we apologise to those people who have suffered as a result of the mistakes that have been made at Stafford hospital? Everybody who uses the national health service has a right, if they put their faith in the NHS at that hospital, to expect the highest standards of treatment. These were not the highest standards of treatment. They have now been investigated, and they fell far short of the standards that people expect. The first thing that we have to do is to assure the families of those who have suffered and relatives who are grieving and who want answers to their questions that there will be independent reviews, if they seek them, of their families&#146; case notes so that they can be assured of what has happened. That is the first thing that we will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90318-0003.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000123">The second thing that we have to look at is whether this is a generic problem or a problem at a specific hospital. I am assured by the Healthcare Commission&#151;the chief executive has made a statement today&#151;that there is no equivalent case in all the other NHS hospitals across the country. We should therefore focus on the individual mistakes that were made by management and deal with them. A further inquiry is going on to look at what happened between 2003 and 2005. At the same time, the Care Quality Commission is looking into what lessons we can learn in general from what happened.</p>

 When doctors at that hospital have confirmed that they were instructed by their managers to abandon seriously ill patients and to treat people with minor ailments instead in order to meet the Prime Minister&#146;s targets, it is not enough to talk of reviews, inquiries and to blame other people. Will he scrap the mad targets that make hospitals tick boxes rather than look after the desperately ill?</p>

Those low standards of management in the hospital, therefore, must be dealt with by our review.</p>

It is not unreasonable to say that hospitals should have the highest standards of care and ensure that there is a wait of only 18 weeks between a person seeing a doctor and getting an operation.

First of all, all disciplinary matters are being dealt with at the moment by the new chief executive, who is looking at what has happened in the hospital over these last few years in the light of the Healthcare Commission report. I think that he will agree that first of all, we have a Healthcare Commission report that will be followed up by a review into what happened between 2003 and 2006, and an inquiry by George Alberti about whether the standards that have been raised are actually satisfactory for people in the area. At the same time, the Care Quality Commission will look at the standards of health care overall, and look at whether there is an early warning system that could be better in future for dealing with such problems. Individuals, of course, can bring what cases they wish, but I think that they will welcome the fact that the individual case notes are to be made available to them, and are to be reviewed independently.</p>

 On Saturday my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) and I visited Basingstoke and North Hampshire hospital to see an out-of-hours medical service provided by local GPs. It is a fantastic success story called Hantsdoc. It has been rated the best health provider in Hampshire, it has nearly 100 per cent. customer satisfaction, and it is locally run and locally devised. Is this not a better model than the top-down, target-driven, Whitehall-imposed approach that seems to be, sadly, less successful elsewhere in the NHS?</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about Stafford hospital, following the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation published yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09031887000153">The report details astonishing failures at every level, and shows that for patients admitted for emergency care at Stafford, there were deficiencies at every stage. The Healthcare Commission found disorganisation, delays in assessment and pain relief, poor recording of important information, symptoms and requests for help ignored, poor communication with families and patients, and severe failings in the way the trust board conducted its business. While the management was obsessed with achieving foundation trust status, the wards were understaffed and patient care seriously compromised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09031887000154">The report cites incidents of patients left without food or drink for days because operations were delayed, of nurses who had not been properly trained to use basic, lifesaving equipment, and of patients admitted to A and E being triaged by receptionists. It notes that there was a dangerous lack of experienced staff, observation and monitoring of patients was poor, essential equipment often was not working, and there were no systems in place to spot where things were going wrong in order to make improvements. In short, it is a catalogue of individual and systemic failings that have no place in any NHS hospital, but which were allowed to happen by a board that steadfastly refused to acknowledge the serious concerns about the poor standard of care raised by patients and staff.</p>

 I apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS for the pain and anguish caused to so many patients and their families by the appalling standards of care at Stafford hospital, and for the failures highlighted in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000157">In the course of my statement I will set out the actions that we will take in response to the report, but I want to begin by summarising the events that led to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation. The Commission became aware of high mortality rates for specific conditions or operations at the trust during the summer of 2007 through its routine analysis and a statistic known as hospital standardised mortality ratios, more commonly called SMRs, produced by the Dr. Foster research unit, based at Imperial college.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000158">Whenever the Healthcare Commission is alerted to unusually high mortality rates, it initially asks the trust to provide further information to explain such anomalies. High standardised mortality ratios are not necessarily an indicator of poor clinical performance and nor do they signify that there have been avoidable deaths, but they do act as a screening tool to identify the need for investigation. Further analysis showed that there were consistently high mortality rates for patients admitted as emergencies going back over several years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000159">The trust repeatedly dismissed the significance of these statistics, saying that they could be explained by the problem it was having with the recording of data. The accuracy of information coding&#151;that is, the system  <br>

for cataloguing types of surgical and other interventions&#151;had historically been poor in the trust, and the internal group that the trust itself had set up to consider high mortality rates assumed that they could be explained by coding errors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000160">The Healthcare Commission refused to accept this explanation and launched a full-scale investigation in March 2008. In May of that year, following its first visit, the commission asked to see the chief executive and set out its immediate concerns about the poor patient care and inadequate staffing levels that it had observed. Since then, there has been gradual improvement. The Healthcare Commission states in its report that</p>
<a name="90318-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09031887000161"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Trust deserves credit for progress on infection control and for responding positively to the concerns of the Commission.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09031887000162">On an unannounced visit in February to the accident and emergency department, the Healthcare Commission noted significant improvements. Its visit raised no immediate concerns about the safety of patients admitted to the accident and emergency department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000163">However, the failures are stark and they occurred over a substantial period of time. Patients will want to be absolutely certain that the quality of care at Stafford hospital has been radically transformed and, in particular, that the urgent and emergency care is administered safely. I have today, jointly with Monitor, asked Professor George Alberti, the eminent physician and national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, to lead an independent review of the trust&#146;s procedures for emergency admissions and treatment and its progress against the recommendations in the report. He will report in five weeks&#146; time and his findings will be published to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09031887000164">The Healthcare Commission has told me that it is confident that Stafford hospital is an isolated case, and that having looked at other trusts with similarly high standardised mortality ratios, it is reassured that a similar succession of serious lapses in care has not occurred elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09031887000165">The National Quality Board has been set up to look at how organisations work effectively together in patients&#146; best interests. It is composed of representatives of the royal colleges, patient groups, regulatory bodies and clinical experts. I have asked the board to look at how we can ensure that any early signs that something is going wrong are picked up immediately, that the right organisations are alerted and that action is taken quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09031887000166">The public and the House will want to know how the problems at Mid Staffordshire could have remained undetected for so long. One of the reasons why the Healthcare Commission began its investigation was that after having been initially alerted to the problem in the trust, it became clear that there had been serious failings for some time. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s report raises serious concerns about why the primary care trusts and the strategic health authority either failed to spot the problems at the trust or, having spotted them, failed to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09031887000168">Our principal concern today must be to reassure the families and friends of patients who have died at Stafford hospital that they will be able to ascertain whether any of the failings detailed in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report contributed in any way to the death of their loved ones. As the Healthcare Commission has said, it is not possible to determine conclusively from any set of statistics whether there were any unavoidable deaths owing to poor standards of care&#151;that can be done only through a case notes review. I can confirm that the new leadership of the trust will respond to every request from those relatives and carry out an independent review of case notes to determine whether or not the care that they or their loved ones received was appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09031887000169">The failings at Stafford hospital are inexcusable. I hope that we can close this chapter in the hospital&#146;s history by acknowledging and addressing past failings and by ensuring that lessons are learned by government and the NHS at all levels to make sure that these terrible failures are never allowed to happen again.</p>

<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="09031887000170"><a name="90318-0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="09031887001022"><b>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b>
 The House will be grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement and will share with him the apology that he expressed on behalf of the Government and the NHS to all the families and patients adversely affected by the events at Stafford hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09031887000171">We were all shocked and appalled at the failings in patient care at the hospital. There was a systematic failure in respect of patients receiving emergency care. Triage was done by unqualified receptionists; treatment was carried out by too few, too poorly trained doctors and nurses; there was inadequate staffing in the emergency department and on wards; nurses were poorly trained; patients were pushed out to the wrong wards, where the care that they needed was not available; patients were left in pain; patients were left without food and drink; basic hygiene needs were not met; nil by mouth patients were left for days waiting for operations; cardiac monitors were switched off because the nurses were not trained to use them; there were too few critical care beds; and there was a failure to prevent blood clots that went on to kill patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09031887000172">A number of things were lacking in the Secretary of State&#146;s statement. I say first that it would have been better for him to have acknowledged the role played by Julie Bailey and the Cure the NHS campaign in Staffordshire in calling attention to what had happened at Stafford hospital. As the Healthcare Commission said in its report, when it launched its investigation there was an unprecedented level of response from patients and relatives who wanted to tell its representatives what was happening. That, frankly, is illustrative of the abject failure of the NHS to listen to what patients and relatives were telling it about what was happening at the hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09031887000173">We do not know how many patients died needlessly, but we do know that the board of the trust did not listen to complaints from patients and their families, or even to the doctors and nurses on the front line at the  <br>

hospital. The board did not devote its efforts to the quality of care for patients but was obsessed with financial results, organisational change and targets&#151;not with the care and safety of patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09031887000174">Our job is to find out not just what happened, but why it happened&#151;and, by doing so, to ensure that it does not happen again. Clearly, the board of the trust was appointed to this task, but it should not have been simply left to get on with it. What was the primary care trust, which was responsible for commissioning services from the hospital, doing about the situation? The Healthcare Commission report says:</p>
<a name="90318-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09031887000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Staff from the PCT involved in commissioning told us that they inherited a chaotic situation&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09031887000178">The strategic health authority was, until February 2008, responsible for the performance management of the trust. IT saw the mortality data at the same time as the Healthcare Commission, asked what was happening, sent the university of Birmingham to do an academic inquiry and came away, apparently reassured, that it was a matter of coding. Why did it not get to the truth of what was happening? Why was it that a year ago, the chief executive of the trust, who was responsible for what was going on, said:</p>
<a name="90318-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09031887000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We worked with the Strategic Health Authority and investigated this apparently high mortality rate and concluded that it was due to problems in the way we were recording and coding information about patients.

Why did the strategic health authority have the wool pulled over its eyes? Given that the then chief executive of that SHA, Cynthia Bower, has since been appointed by the Secretary of State to be chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, which will take over the Healthcare Commission&#146;s responsibilities in two weeks&#146; time, is the Secretary of State confident that the CQC will intervene where necessary in future, and that it will be effective when it does so?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09031887000181">When the Secretary of State passed to Monitor the application for this trust to be a foundation trust in the summer of 2007, one of his jobs was to assure himself that there was a good quality of care. Did he simply tick a box called &#147;They&#146;ve met the four-hour target in A and E&#148; or was there any additional evidence? It should have been his job to know that the Healthcare Commission had initiated an investigation into the trust. Even if the Healthcare Commission did not tell Monitor, it was his job to do so, and there is an admission in the Department of Health documents that that should be part of the process.</p>

There is a systematic problem here. Will he ask the National Quality Board to look at the structure of targets so that it delivers on performance management and continuous improvement without the distortion of clinical priorities and clinical decision making, which has followed on from the application of the four-hour A and E target?</p>

Indeed, I said in my statement that patients and staff raised concerns over a long period, and we can look at the number of complaints that went through the process. Let us remember that before the early part of this century, there was no independent regulator and no proper complaints procedure. A complaint would only have ended up in the trust&#151;there was nowhere for it to go after that, and there were no statistics. Accident and emergency was a data-free zone. We can go back only about as far as 2001 to get any real indication of what happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para31"><a name="09031887000191">What we know is that in the three years 2005-06 to 2008-09, there were 43 complaints by patients at the hospital. That is not unusual, incidentally. What is unusual is that 32 of those complaints were upheld at the level of the Healthcare Commission, which is where complaints now go beyond the local trust. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) says that we have just stopped that. We can debate those issues, but it is very important to talk about what happened at Stafford. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said that we have to know how this happened. He made a valid point about patient organisations including Cure the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para32"><a name="09031887000192">As for why it happened, the hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the primary care trust. Actually, we have to put that in the plural&#151;it was primary care trusts at the beginning. I believe that there were two or three before the reorganisation. Now there is one, but previously there were a number. The reason why I am asking David Colin-Thom&#233; to look at that as far back as 2002 is precisely that we need to know what the primary care trusts were doing. We need to know why the strategic health authority, too, was not picking up on the problem on behalf of its patients. That is a central feature of what the SHA and PCTs are meant to do as commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para33"><a name="09031887000193">All that we know&#151;the hon. Gentleman will have seen this in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report&#151;is that there is a turgid argument about coding errors. It was pointed out by the Commission for Health Improvement in 2002, when it examined Stafford as part of a rolling programme of looking at every hospital in the country, that the system of collecting data was poor. That then seems to have become the major reason why no one would examine what was actually happening to patients and patient care. The SHA commissioned Birmingham university to produce a report, which once again seemed to suggest that the problem was all about coding errors. We should pay tribute to the Healthcare Commission, which, having listened to that over and over again, refused to accept it and actually went in to see what was happening in the hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para34"><a name="09031887000194">I do have confidence in the Care Quality Commission, not least because this House has given it greater powers than the Healthcare Commission has. Looking at what happened at Stafford, although no one knew it when we were debating the matter, there is no better argument for why those registration and other powers are so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para35"><a name="09031887000195">The hon. Gentleman asked when the information was passed to Ministers, and he made a point about how the Healthcare Commission could have tackled the problem much earlier. This was approved in the Department before I arrived&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, he asked me when I approved it, so I am just answering that I did not approve it; it happened before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90318-0004.htm_para36"><a name="09031887000196">The simple fact is that the approval was for a system that looked to the future. The consideration was whether the board had a strategy for the future&#151;the hospital had a three-star rating from the Commission for Health Improvement&#151;and whether it was capable of carrying it out. At that time, in June 2007, there was no indication of a Healthcare Commission inquiry. Indeed, the commission itself was alerted by the Dr. Foster figures in the summer and autumn of 2007.</p>

That is the commission&#146;s decision, not ours. It is an independent regulator&#146;s decision to do that. What the commission did&#151;I think it was the right thing to do&#151;was not wait for 18 months until it had produced a report but immediately call the chief executive to a meeting and say, &#147;There are serious concerns.&#148; Obviously it had to produce a report with recommendations, but it said that those concerns had to be tackled immediately. It states in its report that the trust did start to tackle those issues, although the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that we have to be confident that there is not still a state of denial in the trust. I am still not confident about that, for some of the reasons that he gave. That is why I have asked George Alberti to go immediately and produce a report in five weeks.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is an important point. Staff said in the Healthcare Commission report that their managers were pushing them on this issue, on the basis that they had to meet the target. However, I have just explained that A and E was a data-free zone. Horrendous things were going on there, including 12-hour trolley waits, that needed to be tackled. The argument made by the College of Emergency Medicine and the Royal College of Nursing is not that we should do away with targets. Indeed, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire himself said yesterday, in a very measured statement, that he has no problem with time limits&#151;he did not use the word &#147;targets&#148;&#151;but that they must never be used as an excuse to damage patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90318-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000203">We must not let the management of Stafford off the hook through some suggestion that patients cannot be treated reasonably and quickly unless we do away with standards for patient care. There is no excuse for getting untrained receptionists to triage nurse, and there is no excuse, least of all targets, for leaving someone with a broken thigh bleeding in A and E for six hours without any attention. There is no excuse for the chronic understaffing that took place at Stafford. I therefore believe that although there may be an attempt to score a few political points here, to the people of Stafford targets are not responsible for what happened in that hospital. The problem was poor management and inadequate staffing.</p>

 The report makes it very clear that the care failings ran deep and wide. It is less clear why that performance attracted the highest, three-star rating and foundation trust status just last year. I put it to the Secretary of State that the big challenge now is to get that hospital performing to the right standard every day for every patient while totally reconstituting the trust. May I ask him to lead from the front and come to Stafford to meet people in the hospital and talk to the patients groups that he praised in his statement?

Conditions were described by one relative as being reminiscent of the workhouse, which is a shocking comparison to make. There has clearly been an absolute dereliction of the duty of care, which should shock us all. Stafford is not a private hospital, for which we can all blame uncaring shareholders. This is the NHS, and that is what makes it so utterly shocking.</p>

It is the Government&#146;s absolute responsibility to ensure that we eradicate that sort of experience from the NHS. It must never happen again. In saying that, I am conscious that it was not that long ago that we considered the abject neglect that was found in Maidstone hospital. There are therefore repeated examples of those concerns.</p>

So far, we have received an apology from him and the Government only for the failure of others. It is a strictly limited apology and further investigation is required.</p>

Such an inquiry should consider the following matters. First, it should examine the need for justice for patients and relatives who have suffered so much. Secondly, it should consider the rigid operation of the four-hour target and the bullying that too often surrounds it&#151;when one goes to hospitals and talks to emergency care practitioners, one hears that that plays a part. Doctors are told to divert from important care to treat people who are close to the four-hour target, and nurses have been threatened with the sack if the four-hour target is breached. It is extraordinary that the statement did not mention the four-hour target, given that the report refers to it.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman is wrong to call for a public inquiry. We have a very good Healthcare Commission report, which underlines the difference between what has happened and the Bristol royal infirmary inquiry, which considered the position between 1984 and 1995, when there was no commissioner or independent regulator. There was no one to go in and examine the matter and no information. Now, the Healthcare Commission has provided an excellent report. We need to do more&#151;that is why I said that events from 2002 to 2005 need to be examined. We need to be reassured that things are happening now.

 My hon. Friend is right. The Healthcare Commission makes recommendations about what the trust must do, especially about the extraordinary fact that the board, when it met, dealt with only high-level stuff. It never received any complaints. To revert to an earlier point, the staff complained regularly. There was only one consultant in A and E when there should have been around four. There were three matrons in a hospital that now has 12 and should have had that number all along. Patients and staff made those complaints regularly, but they never reached the board.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has vociferously and persistently raised the case of concerned constituents. Indeed, he represented Stafford until 1997, so I listen with more than usual respect to what he says. The point about the case notes review is that no public inquiry or anything else can determine whether a patient died unnecessarily other than by having clinicians go through the case notes, so offering that to the loved ones of people who have died is absolutely right.</p>

With the greatest respect, I do not think that a public inquiry will take us any further forward. Yes, there was a public inquiry into legionnaires&#146; disease at the same hospital in &#146;84, but there was no independent Healthcare Commission at that time.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point, which is central to the issue that we are discussing. I do not think that Bill Moyes or Monitor could have made any other decision. Let us not forget that the decision on Stafford was made before the Healthcare Commission decided that it needed to investigate. Yes, there were issues to do with the high standardised mortality ratio, but there are such issues in many hospitals. Once the Healthcare Commission decided formally to investigate on 18 March 2008, the hospital already had foundation trust status. Why did Monitor do that?

I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman accepts that, because that is what the Healthcare Commission says. Anyone who has seen any NHS worker anywhere in the country who looks at what happened would be appalled. The chief executive of the NHS has today written to every trust board, drawing their attention to what happened at Stafford and asking them urgently to review the situation to ensure that they are doing the things that the Healthcare Commission has recommended Mid Staffordshire trust must do, which includes ensuring that patient complaints reach the board.</p>

The National Quality Board, among other things, will ensure that quality is central to everything that happens in the NHS&#151;again, that came from the Darzi review. The process will involve presidents of royal societies and, crucially, patient representatives, as well as the regulators. They will be focused completely on ensuring the introduction across the country of quality metrics, CQUIN&#151;commissioning for quality and innovation&#151;and all the other terminology that is important to clinicians, so that quality becomes the organising principle of the NHS. It is their job to ensure that that takes place everywhere across the country. With that drive and commitment by clinicians, who were paramount in shaping Darzi&#146;s review, my hon.

There are 115 foundation trust hospitals that do a terrific job and whose standards are very high. They are part of the NHS, but it is quite right that they should have that extra freedom if they prove worthy of it.

The Children and Young Persons Act 2008 includes radical measures to improve the experience of young people in care, to deliver high-quality corporate parenting, to listen and respond to young people, to bring stability and continuity into every aspect of child care and, perhaps most of all, to create an uncompromising culture of high aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90318-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000274">It has been suggested that this Bill is not necessary because the regulations and guidance relating to the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 already place a general duty on local authorities to ensure that they provide suitable accommodation to care leavers. Certainly, a number of local authorities have developed exemplary good practice in supporting care leavers, including minimum standards to determine suitability, which they apply locally. The current framework should ensure that all care leavers are being placed in suitable accommodation that adequately meets their needs. In fact, however, the evidence from care leavers themselves and their care workers shows that in far too many cases it is not working. If the guidance from 2001 is not yet working and vulnerable young people are being placed at risk, we must conclude that a step change is needed&#151;and it is needed now.</p>

Last year, 24 per cent. of care leavers left care at 16, and 15 per cent. left at 17.

The whole panoply of comprehensive spending reviews and three-year plans that we have had from the Prime Minister over the last 15 years has been junked without a word of explanation to Parliament or the public. If somebody does not review spending when they have the biggest budget deficit in the country&#146;s history, they really must have abandoned all the basic responsibilities of government. On the plus side, however, this means that the Chief Secretary has more time on her hands&#151;more time to plan her budding leadership campaign, of which we read in the newspapers, and more time to join us here.

 Setting aside the political rhetoric&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I think we have heard a lot of that today. Setting aside the political rhetoric, does the Conservative party accept that as part of any fiscal stimulus internationally, it is inevitable in this country as in other G20 countries that both debt and borrowing will be a higher percentage of GDP, rising in every advanced country above the 3 per cent.? If the Conservatives do accept that, what is their strategy for tackling Britain&#146;s position?</p>

 Well, I can actually. The answer to the question is as follows. Of course, in a recession Government debt increases&#151;and, by the way, when we go into a recession with a 3 per cent. Budget deficit, it is likely to increase above that in the recession, because tax receipts fall off and welfare payments increase. Those are the fiscal stabilisers, and that provides a fiscal stimulus. That was a debate that was had in this country and many others over many decades since the 1930s. We  <br>

have not proposed in any way to tamper with the fiscal stabilisers. What we opposed was the debt-funded discretionary cut in VAT. The question that Labour Members have to ask themselves is this: have they got any evidence that that has in any way stimulated the economy or encouraged anyone to spend any more money? Every single major retailer has come out and said that it was a waste of money and it has not worked. The one thing we can be sure of is that it has, in a discretionary way, added to a very significant borrowing problem, and the shocking figure we will get on Budget day will be the size of the fiscal deficit that this Government are saddling this country with for many years to come. It will be the highest in our history, and the Labour party&#146;s reputation for economic incompetence is not only apparent for all to see today, but it will be hung around their neck for a decade to come.</p>

Friend brings me on to the subject of Government schemes, which I want to touch upon now that I have taken those interventions. Four months ago, we argued from this Dispatch Box that the urgent priority was to get credit flowing again to businesses large and small, so that they stayed afloat and people were kept in work. We proposed a national loan guarantee scheme as a big, simple and bold answer to the problem that everyone, from the Governor of the Bank of England to the head of the CBI to the trade unions, had identified as the most important problem facing British business. We also said that to help with the cash flow of smaller businesses while they wait for that credit, we should allow them to defer their VAT bills and we should reverse the rise in their small companies tax rate. To help the unemployed get back to work, we suggested a national insurance rebate for any employer who took them on. At the time, the Government&#151;particularly the Prime Minister&#151;of course dismissed every single initiative out of hand. Now, four months later, they are struggling to introduce them.</p>

The automotive assistance programme is supposed to help the car industry. Two months after it was launched, there is no evidence yet that a single car manufacturer has been helped. Earlier this week, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform floated the idea of a car scrappage scheme. Today, the Treasury is briefing the media that it is not in favour of the scheme. That one did not even last a week. My hon. Friends will recall that the home owners mortgage support scheme was announced by the Prime Minister in the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, yet we are now in March and that scheme does not exist; the number of repossessions is rising, thousands are losing their homes and not a single home owner has received support.  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90318-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09031887000374">The problem with the argument that the recession came from America is that it does not explain some basic facts. Of course there has been turmoil in the world financial system and huge problems in America, but was it America that caused British families to become more indebted than American families or that caused British house prices to rise twice as fast as US house prices? Was it America that caused British banks to lever up 37 times their capital&#151;almost double the leverage of their US counterparts? Was it America that gave Britain the largest budget deficit in the developed world? Was it an American politician who said with the hubris of &#147;peace in our time&#148; that he had &#147;abolished boom and bust&#148;? No, it was a British politician. The Turner report, which was published at midday, blows apart the Prime Minister&#146;s claim that all was well with the British economy until we were hit by a transatlantic storm. It supports the Conservative argument that the problems in the British economy are deep-seated and that the model of growth pursued over the past decade is fundamentally broken.</p>

 I get the point. The scheme would be of the same nature as the guarantees we offer for interbank lending, and would be scored in the same way.

The scheme would be administered by the banks, because they have the commercial judgment&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I do not suggest that the Government should engage directly in making loans to small and medium businesses, or even large ones. The banks can do that with the support of the Government and the guarantees provided by the Government&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I do not know why Labour Members are so surprised. This is the scheme that the Government are supposed to be setting up, but it has not actually happened yet. Of course, like with a good commercial loan, there would be collateral, but the point is that businesses cannot get commercial loans and there is no credit flowing in the economy, because of the credit crunch.</p>

We all have an obligation to ensure that our constituents and businesses in our areas are aware of the additional help that is available. Unfortunately, that additional help is not supported by Opposition Members because they are not prepared to put in the investment or the finance to support it.</p>

 One of the success stories of the UK economy has been the north sea oil and gas industry, which has more than 500,000 jobs, has provided a third of corporation tax revenues this year and makes a contribution to the security of our energy supply. The big challenge is that the new companies that have been driving the exploration were reliant on the lending from the banks that has dried up and has still not come back. One proposal from the industry, which we should look constructively at, is to bring forward the tax relief that it receives on exploration so that it is payable up front to encourage more cash flow and to get the industry investing again. That would keep the industry going through this trough so that it is there when the economy picks up.</p>

 The hon.

The consequences for economic prosperity and political stability were devastating.

 The right hon. Lady has not mentioned consumer confidence. With repossessions going up, mass unemployment and holes in people&#146;s pension funds as a result of the falling stock market, does she accept that there is a sense of insecurity in the country from the cradle to the grave? What are she and her Government doing in delaying the schemes on homes and jobs that would make a difference?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say it is important to support consumer confidence. We have to do more to put more money in people&#146;s pockets at a difficult time and to help to support the economy in different ways.

That is why it has cut interest rates significantly, and that has put hundreds of pounds a month back into the pockets of mortgage holders. With the support of the Government, the bank is now using &#163;75 billion to increase the money supply by buying further assets in the market. That is already having an impact on the markets.</p>

there has been a reduction of &#163;100 billion in the lending in this country by foreign financial institutions. Near my constituency, for example, an important development for the area has been jeopardised because the Anglo Irish bank has pulled out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90318-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000430">Right across the country, there has been a reduction in lending as a result of the credit squeeze and of the fact that banks are no longer lending to each other.

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90318-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000431">The first such measure, obviously, was to make sure that the banks were still standing. Without banks, there can be no bank lending. Our recapitalisation of the banks in October was critically important to keeping them lending. The Opposition supported that at the time, but they have prevaricated over the matter since then. They have made it clear that perhaps they no longer support what I believe was a hugely important measure to support our economy&#146;s financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90318-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000432">The second measure was to make sure that the banks were strong enough to withstand what is now a global recession. We had to be certain that they were strong enough to deal with their capital and liquidity problems, and with their toxic and problem assets. For that reason, we have put in place the asset protection scheme, which has very clear and binding lending agreements. As a result, banks are now pledged to deliver more lending to businesses and mortgage holders in the coming financial year than they did in the preceding year.</p>

Japan&#146;s manufacturing output has fallen by 40 per cent. in three months, and countries across the world are being hit in a very substantial way by the global credit crunch.

 I am very grateful to the Chief Secretary for giving way. A number of hon. Members are clearly worried, not about the announcements of guarantee schemes but about their delivery and the extent to which credit is getting through. I know from my own constituency surgery how large the problem is, so will the right hon. Lady undertake to give us the figures on the amounts that have been lent under these schemes? Will she do so on a regular, monthly basis as part of the monetary statistics that are published by the Bank of England? In that way we can assess how much credit is getting through to businesses.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks an important question, and I shall give him some examples. It is clear that we need to be able to make sure that the lending is getting through, but we must also recognise that the scale of the withdrawal of credit by foreign institutions in this country means we must do a huge amount of work on a range of different fronts. That is why it is important to look beyond bank lending and lending to business to find other ways of supporting demand in the economy through this difficult time. I know he would agree with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90318-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09031887000447">The hon. Member for Eastleigh asked for details of some of the specific schemes. For example, additional funding from the European Investment Bank of over &#163;300 million was announced for small and medium-sized enterprises was announced in November&#146;s pre-Budget report. That has now been approved, while the enterprise finance guarantee scheme is in the middle of processing 400 loans, worth over &#163;40 million, to businesses that otherwise would not be able to access funding. The commitments made as a result of the asset protection scheme amount to &#163;25 billion from Royal Bank of Scotland and &#163;14 billion from Lloyds. That is in addition to the further lending that Northern Rock has committed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90318-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09031887000448">One of the most important schemes that we have put in place is the one that allows businesses to defer taxation.

 I must make a little progress and set out the additional support that we have put in place to help people through these difficult times. For instance, 12 million pensioners have received &#163;60 each since Christmas, but that was opposed by the Conservatives. Moreover, 7.5 million families have received an increase in child benefit, another move opposed by the Conservatives. We have increased the investment in the Warm Front scheme so that more homes can be insulated, but that has been opposed by the Conservatives too. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Opposition Members can shake their heads, but such measures are all part of the fiscal stimulus that their party has opposed.

 Let us just deal with the specifics of the VAT cut. It means that at the end of each month, households across the country will be better off by an average of &#163;20. The VAT cut is supported by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said that the effect is equivalent to an interest rate cut of around 1 per cent.

borrowers. It therefore has a fairer impact than simply using monetary policy to support the economy. The Office for National Statistics has said that price cuts have been passed on to consumers in 70 per cent. of cases, and Goldman Sachs has argued that the VAT cut is already having a beneficial impact on retail sales. It is right to support the economy, and to put that extra investment in. As a result of the measure, we are already getting billions of pounds of extra money into our economy. We believe that it is right to help the economy through a difficult time.</p>

 May I raise a different subject with the right hon. Lady, namely the impact that the changes in the discount rate are having on pension schemes? The deficit arising from reductions on the stock exchange is dwarfed by the deficit arising from changes in the discount rate. People are now technically much more in deficit than they were. That is creating a problem for the pensions regulator. It is also creating another potential problem, which I have discussed with the Pension Protection Fund. Unless something is done about that technical problem, firms will go under because they cannot sustain their pension scheme. Otherwise viable companies will be asked by the PPF for contributions that are wholly unaffordable. We need a longer perspective; we need a moratorium until we get out of this situation, if we are to keep some of the companies concerned alive.</p>

There is to be an increase in pensions of &#163;4.55 a week, a new health in pregnancy grant, and &#163;1.2 billion extra for jobcentres, to help to get people back to work. That &#163;1.2 billion was opposed by the Conservatives. There are to be new recruitment subsidies for those who have lost their jobs; that was opposed by the Conservatives. There are to be new apprenticeships for school leavers; that was opposed by the Conservatives. There is to be &#163;3 billion of extra capital investment to support thousands of jobs. There are to be repairs to primary schools, new roads and new homes; that was opposed by the Conservatives. Extra help for mortgage holders to prevent repossessions, and extra help for businesses through the new schemes, were all opposed by the Conservatives. All that help is being introduced in a mere matter of months, but it was opposed by the Conservatives. They call for more, but they want to spend less.</p>

They are confused; they have not said whether they are guaranteeing new loans or existing loans. They will not price on risk, yet they claim that no losses will be made. That is simply not credible. They claim that the scheme can be introduced straight away, yet they have given no proper detail. Most important of all, they have not been prepared to put any money behind it. The shadow Chancellor claimed that the scheme</p>

The truth is that the scheme would cost money if carried out in the way proposed by the Conservatives, but they are not prepared to put any cash behind it.

 If the Government are doing all these wonderful things, why has the International Monetary Fund said that the recession will last longer in this country than in any comparable economy?

 My right hon. Friend mentioned that one needs to believe in action in order to pursue it. One also needs to understand the problem. She will have noticed that every time she mentioned the global nature of the credit crunch, her words were met by derisive calls from the Opposition, who do not seem to understand or accept the global nature of the problem.

 My hon. Friend is right. The fact is that no matter how tight the regulatory system is in any one country, no country could escape the impact of the global recession because of the interconnectedness across borders, and the way in which credit flows across borders.

 I am sorry, but I will make some progress. Conservative Members do not understand that if we do not act, it will cost us more. If, in the early &#146;90s, the Conservatives had provided something similar to the fiscal boost that we are providing, they could have saved 300,000 jobs. If they had done something similar in the early &#146;80s, they could have prevented an entire generation from being scarred by long-term unemployment. It is worse than that: they do not want simply to do nothing&#151;they want to make things worse. They want to cut &#163;5 billion from public spending at the end of next month. That means cutting spending on housing by at least &#163;800 million from next month, just when the construction industry is in real difficulties. That is the equivalent of 10,000 new homes for social rent. They want to cut the budget for training and science. They have said that they would restrict it to 1 per cent. That means cutting it by at least &#163;900 million from next month, at a time when young people need extra support. That is the equivalent of cutting 220,000 apprenticeships. They want to cut investment in transport infrastructure just when we need to invest in the infrastructure for the future.</p>

Yes, we will expect the public sector to deliver even greater efficiencies to support the economy in future. But here is the difference between us.

In some ways, the motion understates the case. To take the problem of repossessions, the Government have four schemes, not just one&#151;none of which, as far as I can establish, is properly operational&#151;plus an empty property clearing house, which does not seem to be working with any volume, and a social housing building programme, which is virtually at a standstill. So even if we take one narrow area, there is very little progress to report.</p>

 I am sorry to intervene so soon in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, but in fact interest payments on mortgage interest have been in place since January, and the mortgage rescue scheme is also in place, with housing associations and local councils able to use it now.</p>

 The schemes have been institutionally established, but the question is whether people are benefiting from them. Even the most optimistic in the housing sector are saying that at the very most at the end of this financial year, 10,000 to 12,000 of the 75,000 repossessed households will have had access to these schemes. I hope that it is more, but that is the position.</p>

message has yet entirely percolated through to those on the Opposition Front Bench, which I will illustrate with reference to what I think is their central argument: that there is a general problem of debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90318-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09031887000524">There is a key phrase in the motion, which the Conservatives repeat often, so they clearly believe in it:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/debtext/90318-0012.htm"/>


<a name="90318-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="09031887000874"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;including a build-up of government, corporate and personal debt which has left the UK more exposed than other countries&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09031887000525">Of course, Government, corporate and personal debt are fundamentally different; they are different in origin and in consequences. I can understand why spin doctors might have said to the Conservatives at some point, &#147;This is all very complicated. Let&#146;s simplify the message. Debt is a bad thing&#148;, but such debts are different, and I hope that they appreciate that, because there are some important policy implications. It is useful to take the three bits and analyse them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09031887000526">First, the Conservatives are absolutely right that there has been a dangerous and, in the UK&#146;s case, almost unique expansion of household debt to unprecedented levels&#151;the highest in the western world, in relation to disposable income. However, I thought that I heard the Leader of the Opposition apologise on Sunday for not having spotted that until the last year. That was big-hearted of him, and he deserves credit for that. He would have been even more big-hearted if he had acknowledged that six or seven years ago Liberal Democrats were warning of precisely that problem. None the less, it was a big step forward. That is household debt, and we are now in agreement that that is a big problem lying at the heart of a lot of our difficulties. It is that model of a rapid growth in consumption fuelled by consumer debt, which the Conservative shadow Chancellor described, that is not sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000527">Secondly, is it true that there is a problem of corporate debt in Britain? Clearly in one or two institutions there is. There was massive leverage in the investment banks and there was a business model in the private equity companies that was based on private debt, and it is right to draw attention to that. However, the shadow Chancellor may have forgotten that two years ago he appeared at the British Venture Capital Association and referred to private equity and its leverage in these terms:</p>
<a name="90318-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="09031887000875"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On these occasions, it is usual to praise your hosts and audience. Tonight that is easy. Private equity is a beacon of British excellence. The importance of your contribution to our economy is, I believe, rightly reflected in the tax treatment that you receive.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000528">That was praise of a highly leveraged business model, but are the Conservatives saying that the hundreds of thousands of companies that belong to the Federation of Small Businesses and chambers of commerce and the members of the CBI are systematically over-leveraged or imprudent? Is there any evidence for that? I do not think so. Anecdotes suggest&#151;I am sure that many Conservative Back Benchers will reflect this&#151;that after British companies had their last bad experience of very high interest rates, most of them cut back substantially on their borrowing wherever possible. I just do not see the point about lumping corporate debt in with household debt; it is a fundamentally different problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000529">If that is an issue, why are the Conservatives now promoting a loan guarantee scheme, the whole purpose of which is to guarantee additional debt for companies?  <br>

I am not saying that it is a bad idea. It is a good idea, which deserves support, and I have supported it. It is not quite as simple and straightforward as they have argued, because it is complicated to asses risk, but it is fundamentally a good idea. But if debt is a problem for companies, why guarantee them to take on more? Would it not be more sensible to support debt equity conversions, or other forms of company financing?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. He refers to companies that were in his view perhaps under-leveraged, but they were prime pickings for the private equity houses to buy, to increase the leverage and to take a one-time benefit from that increased leverage. Does he have any suggestion to prevent that sort of behaviour in future?</p>

 I take a cue from the Conservative shadow Chancellor&#146;s comment about tax treatment. The logical course would be to withdraw interest relief. I do not know whether the Conservatives would go to such radical lengths, but that would be the solution, as well as the capital gains treatment, which is still favourable.</p>

 Unusually, I am not following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Is he saying that there will not be any need for, or we should not make available, subsidised or guaranteed loans, which are one and the same thing, in a recession, which is precisely the period when companies cash flow and profits drop because volumes drop? It is that period that the Opposition&#146;s ill-conceived or not yet explained loans scheme is designed to cover.</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="09031887000534"><a name="90318-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="09031887001226"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was listening; I said that I thought it a sensible idea. It is rapidly becoming redundant, of course, because if banks are nationalised, as some of the major ones now are, why would we want to guarantee their loans? That would be the state guaranteeing the state. None the less, the concept is right, and I have supported it and do support it; I hope that it comes into practice as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09031887000535">Let me turn to the issue of public debt. Of course it is right&#151;and the Conservatives are right to stress this&#151;that, looking forward, there is a serious public financing problem. There is a major structural deficit arising from the collapse of income from the City and the housing market, and any Government will face very serious difficulties in reining in public expenditure in those circumstances. However, acknowledging that point is different from arguing that there is a legacy of excessive public debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000536">The Government can make their own case, but it is simply a matter of fact that at the beginning of this crisis the level of public debt to GDP was less than it was at the end of the golden legacy of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). The shadow Chancellor said that such debt was potentially&#151;he was talking about 60 or 70 per cent. of GDP&#151;higher than ever in British history. I have a chart that covers the past 200 years, and it shows that only in the past 30 years have we gone anywhere near 50 per cent. of GDP.</p>

There is a lot to be said for that period of government. Supermac pointed out at the time that we had never had it so good. When he said that, public debt as a share of GDP was more than 100 per cent., twice the current levels. [Hon.

 May I ask the hon. Gentleman a question about that very point? As he and I have discussed before, one of the problems is Government creditworthiness.

 With the greatest respect to the hon.

That is indeed at a peacetime high and, as I said in my speech, was forecast in the pre-Budget report to be 8 per cent. Many now suspect that it is at 10 per cent. or higher; we will find out in the Budget. That is the serious problem that the country faces. We went into the downturn after a long period of economic growth carrying a 3 per cent. budget deficit and climbing public debt. That was the problem.</p>

 We are getting to the bottom of the confusion, which I do not think is mine, to be fair.

 That totally ignores the other side of the balance sheet. The banks will have to be, and should be, reprivatised in&#151;I do not know&#151;about eight or 10 years&#146; time. As the right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well, when they are, all those assets will be realised. So the debt liability is completely different from the debt accrued as a result of previous deficits. The right hon. Gentleman, who is probably one of the most financially sophisticated people in the House, should surely realise that distinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09031887000547">The obsession with the legacy of debt seems to be inhibiting Conservative Front Benchers in taking what seems to me to be simply a realistic view about the need for a fiscal stimulus. The view that they take&#151;that one should not have a fiscal stimulus over and above the automatic stabilisers&#151;is so extreme. I do not think that any other country in the developed world now takes that view. I managed to unearth only two from the International Monetary Fund: the first is Argentina, which is in the middle of a financial crisis, and the second is Switzerland, which is not allowed to have a fiscal stimulus for constitutional reasons. The Conservatives are arguing for a policy of complete abstinence when it comes to additional fiscal stimulus. That seems utterly wrong during a crisis of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09031887000548">Most of the burden of fighting the recession is being carried by monetary policy. That is absolutely right; we are seeing the implementation of the ideas that Mrs. Thatcher, as she then was, brought in with Professor Walters and the others&#151;of concentrating on interest rate cuts, expanding money supply and letting the exchange rate float. Fundamentally, that is how the British economy is being driven and that is right. However, it seems entirely sensible to put on top of that a modest fiscal stimulus, and I do not understand why the Conservatives have locked themselves into a completely reactionary position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09031887000549">The fiscal stimulus is small&#151;less than 1 per cent. of GDP&#151;and the Conservative party is completely unique among parties in the developed countries of the world. Moreover, its position is blinding the party to the real criticism. The proper criticism was tellingly made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) from his standpoint as a business person: it was that the value added tax cut was entirely the wrong way to do it. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has tried to give a defence of it, but I do not think anybody believes it. It would have been much better to have used the money in targeted public investment. Everybody can make up their own list, but we, for example, argued for social housing, home insulation programmes and public transport&#151;things that could be mobilised quickly. At the end of that investment, we would have had an asset. That would have been a better approach. It is much better to criticise the Government from the standpoint that the VAT cut was a wasteful, foolish way of giving a stimulus than to say that we should not have any kind of fiscal stimulus at all.

 I am just posing this as a question; I do not actually know the answer. A few weeks ago, Paul Volcker made a speech about the intrinsic problems of the American economy. One of the things he said was that in the past decade, there had been a sharp increase of about 5 per cent. in aggregate expenditure&#151;that is, public and private and capital formation put together&#151;to the point of about 105 per cent. of GDP. We have the same situation; for us it is about 103 per cent. One of the points about the external borrowings is that they constrain what we can safely do before running into the creditworthiness problem. How would the hon. Gentleman get around the fact that spending got us into this problem and that spending therefore may not take us out in a safe manner?</p>

 The serious argument is that if we do not have a productive fiscal stimulus of some kind and do not take people out of unemployment, which is what a fiscal stimulus tries to do, the Government will then be borrowing to keep people unemployed instead of borrowing to keep them in work. A fiscal stimulus is a much better way of using the Government&#146;s balance sheet and borrowing capacity than just allowing unemployment continue to grow&#151;which the Government then have to continue to finance.</p>

 I am puzzled by that number, which the Chancellor used on Monday. I checked up afterwards on where he had got it from. I think that he added together the VAT cut, which is less than 1 per cent. of GDP, to the bringing forward of public investment; I think that that is how he got that number. The problem is that that bringing forward of public investment is not happening for the reasons given by the Leader of the Opposition in Prime Minister&#146;s questions. We know that colleges in our constituencies have spent a small fortune doing feasibility studies or preliminary works, and that they have now been told by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills that they are not allowed to proceed. That public investment is being stopped and it will be clawed back during the next financial year of 2010-11. One asks a basic question about where the stimulus is and what will happen to it.</p>

 I apologise to the hon. Gentleman; I may be particularly inarticulate today. I thought that I made two very simple points.

I have to say that we have become progressively disenchanted as it has become clear that the Government have taken on ownership and responsibility for the banks without having a clue as to what they will do with them, and without exercising any effective governance. The banks are still completely unclear as to whether their primary job is to lend more or to accumulate more prudential capital&#151;they are torn between those objectives. The Government are not giving them clear instructions. They do not need to get involved with the administration of banks, where they obviously have no competence, but they should give them a basic sense of strategy. They have still not sorted out the appalling remuneration arrangements, and the Conservative shadow Chancellor was right about that. There does not appear to be any structure for dealing with those arrangements. We have a shocking situation where semi-nationalised, nationalised or guaranteed British banks seem to take it for granted that they have a perfect right to avoid paying UK taxes&#151;there has been no effective attempt to clamp down on that&#151;and five months after the beginning of the capitalisation programme, that is simply not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90318-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09031887000559">Another aspect of the banking issue is the future-looking exercise by Turner. I guess that most of us have not had time to read it in full, but we had a brief reprise of it from the Conservative Front Bench. Most of Turner&#146;s points are fairly uncontroversial. Clearly, the wrong model was pursued early on, but speaking as a veteran of the legislation relating to financial services, it is fair to say that there were not too many people on the Conservative Benches at the time who warned about light-touch regulation and its consequences, or about the problems associated with process regulation.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right. The Conservatives did do so, and from day one, they have been consistent on that point.

 I read that bit because I anticipated such an intervention. Turner says, and he is absolutely right, that regulation should remain nationally based. There is clearly scope for more effective European co-operation; the hon. Gentleman may remember the chaos that resulted from the Irish breaking free last autumn, with separate guarantees on banks.

If he were more generous, he would acknowledge that my party was saying that five or six years ago, but none the less, we are on the same page, and that is the correct way forward. The other major issue that Turner is ambiguous about, unfortunately, is the much more important question of splitting banks so that the British Government and the taxpayer are not responsible for global banks, many of which have a large &#147;casino&#148; operation, as it was called by the Governor of the Bank of England.

It might have been a bit too technical, but underneath it is the fundamental point that we must consider: how serious are the debt levels that we have built up? Although debt will increase as a percentage of gross domestic product, all the best forecasts that I have seen are still projecting that when we are out of the recession in 2011 or 2012, we shall have a considerably lower debt as a percentage of GDP than Japan. The figure is out of all proportion there at more than 100 per cent., which is where we were under Supermac.

 The &#163;3 trillion is thanks to the commercial judgment of the relevant banks, to which the Conservative party would give another &#163;50 billion.

In a recession&#151;this is going to be a deep one and some forecasts point to another 1 million unemployed still to come&#151;the Government cannot get the sort of security that they can reasonably expect in a normal trading environment. In a normal trading situation, the Government will get good assets and take full charge of all the assets that they can get hold of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90318-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09031887000599">In the present situation, however, we might have to relax the strict criteria that the Government normally apply, in relation not only to the working capital guarantee&#151;it is crucial that we get that out there and working quickly&#151;and to the automotive programme. At the moment, that programme is drawn up in a very restrictive way, in that the capital investment needs to involve new, green technology in order to qualify. If we apply that criterion too strictly, however, it will probably impede access to the programme. Perhaps we need to take a more generic view. I congratulate the Government on the &#163;27 million capital gift to Jaguar, which proves this point.

 It seems to me that we cannot arrive at the right prescription for the future of our economy unless we gain a clear view of why we are where we are. We cannot expect to be led out of our current crisis by a Prime Minister who puts his head in the sand. Before prescription, however, there must be diagnosis, and it is in that spirit that I offer my remarks this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90318-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09031887000602">Of course it is true&#151;we can all agree on this&#151;that we are in the throes of an international recession, or something worse. Of course it is true that almost every other country is affected in one way or another, to a greater or lesser extent, but we are almost uniquely vulnerable. We are almost uniquely ill equipped to deal with the calamity that has befallen the world, and we need to consider the reasons for that. They are not too difficult to identify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90318-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09031887000603">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), the Leader of the Opposition, was quite right, last Friday, to accept responsibility for the things that we got wrong. We certainly failed to anticipate that the crisis we now face was anything like as serious as it has proved to be, but there are two main reasons for our present plight. Both of them were directly the responsibility of the Prime Minister, and, in respect of both of them, we certainly warned of the consequences. I have looked at the record, and I am in a position to answer the question posed from a sedentary position by the Exchequer Secretary earlier, when she asked, &#147;Where were you?&#148; I shall do my best to answer that question during the course of my observations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90318-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09031887000604">The first of the main reasons for our present plight that I, at least, have identified was the ill-advised decision, taken by the Prime Minister in 1997, to transfer supervision of the banking sector from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority. The Bank of England had hundreds of years of experience and expertise in supervising the banking sector of our economy. The Financial Services Authority was new. It had none of that experience and none of that expertise, and, as we know, it has since admitted that it fell down on the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90318-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09031887000605">It has been suggested that the Conservatives criticised the transfer to the Financial Services Authority only with the benefit of hindsight, but that is simply not the case. When that catastrophic decision was taken, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) was shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the debate on the Second Reading of the Bank of England Bill on 11 November 1997, he said:</p>
<a name="90318-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="09031887000878"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With the removal of banking control to the Financial Services Authority...it is difficult to see how and whether the Bank remains, as it surely must, responsible for ensuring the liquidity of the banking system and preventing systemic collapse.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09031887000607">That, at least, is one of the answers to the question posed by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) a few moments ago. My right hon. Friend also said that he feared</p>
<a name="90318-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="09031887000880"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that the Government may, almost casually, have bitten off more than they can chew.

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000609">The second main reason for our current plight is the level of indebtedness that we as a country, collectively through our Government and as individuals, have incurred. Here, too, there were warnings, and they, too, are on the record; I am afraid that some of them came from me. I drew attention on 9 July 2002 when I was shadow Chancellor to the savings ratio, which was then at an all-time low; it has hit many more all-time lows since. On 30 July 2003, I warned that savings had halved under Labour, that the Government were borrowing more and that families were getting deeper in debt. On 17 March 2004, replying to the Budget, I said that it was</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000610">When I proposed at the 2005 election that a Conservative Government would make &#163;12 billion of savings, I said that &#163;8 billion of them would go not to cut taxes but to reduce Government borrowing, which was far too high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000611">Of course, I was not always thanked&#151;I suppose I did not expect to be&#151;for my pains. Anatole Kaletsky in <i> The Times</i>, for example, complained that throughout my tenure as shadow Chancellor, I had been issuing dire warnings about the economic and financial outlook. I had said, he complained, that Labour economic policies were doomed to failure, that overtaxed consumers were living in a fool&#146;s paradise of unsustainable borrowing and that the British economy and the Government&#146;s popularity were kept afloat artificially by a bubble of house prices and mortgage debt. He said that if the Tories started thinking along those lines, we would be making a big mistake. Well, of course, in terms of the outcome of the 2005 election, he was absolutely right, but was he right in the wider sweep of history? I simply set what I said on the record and leave others to decide who it was that was making the big mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000612">Throughout all this time, of course, the Prime Minister was proclaiming that he had put an end to boom and bust&#151;and you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do not think he was trying to deceive us; I think he genuinely believed it. Perhaps the worst thing he did was deceive himself. It was because he was genuinely convinced that he had ended the economic cycle that he did not fix the roof while the sun was shining. After all, if we think that the sun is never going to stop shining, why on earth would we bother to fix the roof? As we know, the Prime Minister is still in a state of denial. That is not the least of the reasons why he is incapable of leading the country out of the mess we are undoubtedly in. It is, I am afraid, a very big mess indeed.</p>

The suggestion that is often implicit in the first of those two questions is that next year or the year after, we shall return to the world that we knew two or three years ago. That notion seems to me to be completely misplaced. We will be in a new world, a different world, with challenges every bit as formidable as those we face at the moment. We will be able to overcome those challenges only if we have leadership that is prepared, in the words of the excellent speech made the week before last by my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor,</p>

 I did not doubt that there would be a fair smattering of the &#147;I told you so&#146;s&#148; in today&#146;s debate, and I am afraid we have heard quite a few from Conservative Members so far.</p>

having negative equity, for instance&#151;that is a huge disappointment, although it should not prevent us from fighting to try to ensure that the home of that person and his or her family is secured. Impatience is expressed by Members throughout the House, including&#151;quite rightly&#151;the Opposition; but the Opposition speak as though nothing is being done, which is certainly and absolutely untrue. Business Link has been doing enormously good work in the south-east, carrying out health checks on our businesses to ensure that they are in the best possible position to fight off the recession.

They are also getting out and explaining to businesses just what is available to them. That is the difference between the Conservative and Labour positions: we have schemes and plans that are available, and business organisations are able to share information on them. Geoff Williamson, the chairman of my local small business federation, sees me in good times and bad.

 The hon.

Therefore, the projects she talks about, to do with holding back payment and building up such debt, could be the very death knell of the businesses she wishes to save.</p>

Having an enormous amount of debt and then having to defer further payments is a difficult position to be in, but we need to have these devices in place to allow businesses to plan for difficult times. That is exactly what we should be doing: giving this direct help to our businesses in our towns, cities and rural communities.</p>

A growing number of companies are expanding their apprenticeship programmes to ensure that they are fit for the future.

When issues emerge to do with the delivery of schemes put in place by the Government, it is often because the schemes are being delivered by other institutions. It is difficult to keep a handle on just how institutions such as local authorities are performing and how quickly they are ensuring that all the initiatives are in place. I ask the Minister to ensure that we audit all those organisations&#151;both county councils and borough councils&#151;to see how quickly they are putting in place some of the fantastic schemes available to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09031887000633">It would be very silly to assume that it is just working-class and other families who are suffering in this recession. We have to accept that there are those who are managing businesses who are in some difficulty. I have spoken to people running businesses who are close to tears when they feel that their business is on the edge. It is always really helpful to get Business Link involved to give them help and advice&#151;that has been incredibly useful. When the economy is in difficulty, we need to think about the softer side: how do we support people in difficult times and give them the necessary help and advice? This morning, I spoke to the Rev. Jonathan Baldwin, who is the chaplain at Gatwick airport, and heard about the invaluable support that he is giving to managers and workers at the airport. We need to thank such people in this House, because although this global downturn is causing enormous pain and hardship, there are people out there who are keen to assist in ways for which we will never be able to thank them; we must know that they are in place, working.</p>

That was a devastating experience in Crawley, but the jobcentre opened its office at the weekend, interviewed Excel Airways people who had lost their jobs in such a horrible way and got them into new jobs as quickly as it possibly could.

 Let us first of all get rid of some of the nonsensical soundbites that the Government offer in substitute for serious analysis and debate. I am glad that the Government no longer talk of &#147;no more boom and bust&#148;. Even they see how absurd that is, but it is disappointing that they still tell us that they made the Bank of England independent. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) explained, the Government did grave damage to the Bank of England, which we highlighted at the time and continue to highlight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09031887000637">In the report by the group I chaired, which the Govt often misquote, we made a big thing about how the Bank of England was gravely damaged in 1997, which made it very likely that when a crisis struck the Bank would be unable to handle it properly. It was damaged not only by the removal of responsibility for financial regulation of the clearing banks&#151;something that a central bank needs to do so that it knows the day-to-day positions and the true financial state of those banks&#151;but by the removal of the responsibility to manage public debt. Anyone who understands money markets knows that public debt is the life and substance of the money market. The Bank of England was blind and deaf in its own money markets, because it was no longer in daily contact with clearing banks&#151;one side of the equation&#151;and nor was it handling minute by minute the Government debt requirements. No wonder it made an awful mess of the money markets in 2007 and 2008. No wonder it was not sighted in the massive credit explosion that the regulators allowed the banks to perpetrate, and that created this immediate crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para23"><a name="09031887000638">We now have two more soundbites substituting for serious policy and analysis. One is that this is a global crisis, as if in some way that excuses the Government of all responsibility. Their refusal to understand that we have a worse version of the crisis than others is extremely depressing. Their refusal to admit that the global recession is happening for different reasons in different places means that they will find it very difficult to tackle the problem here in Britain. They do not seem to understand that the crisis is very different in Japan, Germany and China&#151;the successful saving and exporting countries&#151;from the crisis in Britain, the US, Ireland and Spain, the over-borrowed, over-extended credit countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para24"><a name="09031887000639">The exporting countries merely face the very serious problem that their export markets are temporarily very badly damaged, but they have strong fiscal positions and strong savings, while the heavily borrowed countries have a double crisis. We have the downturn in activity, like the successful exporting countries, but we also have extreme credit crunch problems, meaning that we do not have the financial flexibility to pump up our economies and return to previous levels of activity. The levels of activity reached in 2006 and 2007 were unrealistic, and were sustained on a sea of debt and those funny instruments that were allowed by the Government&#146;s regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90318-0014.htm_para25"><a name="09031887000640">The Government now say that the problem was created by deregulators, as if a deregulatory Government had been in charge in Britain for the past 11 years. However, never has more regulation been put on the statute book than in the past 11 years. Every feature of the financial regulatory system that they inherited was taken apart and recreated with far more cost, far more expense, many more regulators and far more complexity. Anything that has gone wrong on their regulatory watch is the result of their style and choice of regulation, and it certainly was not deregulatory.</p>

mortgage process regulation than this country has ever known at the same time as we have had more dodgy mortgages than this country has ever known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09031887000642">Mortgage process regulation does not stop credit over-expansion. It does not tackle a credit crunch. I find it very odd that intelligent Ministers cannot understand that point; perhaps they deliberately misconstrue it. It seems so obvious to me that they were regulating the wrong things in the wrong way and that they were not doing what a regulator should do. When businesses can extend credit and lend lots of money to people and companies, we should control their cash and capital to ensure that they are prudent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000643">The massive expansion in bank balance sheets should have been ringing alarm bells by 2004-05 in the Treasury and with the Chancellor, let alone in the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England. It was ringing alarm bells on the Opposition Benches, as we have learned today. I shall not treat the House to loads more quotes or say that we saw all this coming, as that does not matter. What does matter is that the Government did not see it coming. They were not listening, they were not watching and they were not carrying out their prudential activities sensibly and well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000644">What should the Government do now? They are making a worse crisis now than the one that they are talking about. We know about the over-expansion of credit, and they do not talk about how they brought that to a grinding halt in a very damaging way&#151;that was the second part of the crisis. We might go into a third crisis if they do not control the public accounts and the public obligations sensibly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000645">There are huge disputes about what should be factual matters. It seems very clear to me that this country is massively indebted in the public sector, and that that debt has expanded many times in the past two years as a result of the policies that the Government have been pursuing, both through their running of large deficits and, more importantly, through their very expensive policies of support, subsidy and guarantee to the banking sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000646">Let us look at the figures. The Government admit&#151;I think&#151;that there is public borrowing of about &#163;700 billion. If we add in private finance initiatives, public-private partnerships, Network Rail and some other off balance sheet liabilities, that figure is about &#163;1 trillion. I hope that they would accept that figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09031887000647">There are, too, about &#163;1 trillion-worth of unfunded pension liabilities. The Government can say that it is not convention to put them on the balance sheet in state accounts, but it is convention to put them on the balance sheet in the corporate sector. Indeed, it is a legal requirement to do so&#151;imposed by this Government and strictly enforced. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) might think that I have made a mistake and I am misrepresenting those figures, but I assure him that pension liabilities are liabilities of the state. They represent money that we do not have and that we have to pay out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000648">On that basis, the figure is &#163;2 trillion, but to get the Government&#146;s true financial position we then have to add something for the banks. If we took on the Government&#146;s private sector accounting rules, we would have to put on the balance sheet the gross liabilities of the banks that we have bought, in the proportions of the shareholdings that we have acquired. That would  <br>

add another &#163;2.5 trillion&#151;for the banks, the liability is &#163;3 trillion, and we own most of that. That adds up to &#163;4.5 trillion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09031887000649">Of course, those banks have some assets. I am pleased to say that we will not lose &#163;2.5 trillion, but I fear that we will lose quite a lot of money on these banks. We have, after all, already lost &#163;24 billion in about six weeks on the RBS shares that we bought, based on the losses that RBS has had to report after the shares were purchased. We have lost &#163;10 billion on the HBOS shares that we have bought so far, based on the losses that HBOS has had to report through its profit and loss account. The losses on the shares, based on the current share prices, are similarly very large figures. We can lose a lot of money on this.</p>

 The Office for National Statistics is going to demand quite a big recognition of these banking risks. That recognition may not be for the full amount that I have suggested, but it will take our total indebtedness as a country, as defined by the ONS, to well over 150 per cent. of national income. That is well above many comparable countries around the world that have not blundered into so much bank ownership as this country has through the actions of the Government.</p>

First of all, they must recognise that the risk is colossal and that, if they get it wrong, taxpayers could be left hopelessly stranded and have to pay enormous losses. They must recognise that house prices are still falling, that the mortgage experience is deteriorating and that there could be more bad loans than we know about. They must recognise that the corporate sector is in deep trouble&#151;I fear that there could be many more bankruptcies in the months to come&#151;and that corporate loan books are still deteriorating at a terrifying rate.</p>

stop paying people &#163;200,000, &#163;300,000 or even &#163;400,000 a year when they are making colossal losses that the taxpayer has to stand behind. It is grotesque that we, the taxpayers, are now expected to stand behind people who want to earn &#163;200,000, &#163;300,000, &#163;400,000 or &#163;500,000 a year, with pensions to match, even though their banks are loss making and need state capital and subsidy to survive.</p>

I am all in favour of people in the private sector getting great bonuses and lots of money if that is what they deserve and if they do it in the normal way, but I also think that they have to live with the downside. High rollers who get it wrong should get no benefit from doing so, and it is deeply offensive to many people in this country&#151;and I am sure, in their honest moments, to many Labour MPs as well&#151;that this Government are far too generous with the subsidy and capital that they give to the broken banks. The result of the Government&#146;s actions is only that there is a delay in adjusting those banks and getting them sorted out so that they are in a position to behave normally again.</p>

They must sell some of their foreign banks and some of the assets that are good so that they can get cash to do something with. There has to be a patient and difficult case-by-case analysis of every loan on their books, and there also has to be some intelligent banking to see how many people can be got through the crisis and how many unfortunately cannot. For the latter category, it may be better to close the loan down quickly before there are more broken dreams and more lost money.</p>

They are not being given that remit, even though it should be very simple: cut the risk and the losses, get us out of dangerous things like investment banking activities, sell some of the good overseas banks because we need the money and should not be standing behind them.</p>

have brought their banks down. He gave us the benefit of his wisdom&#151;his speech was full of &#147;I told you so&#146;s&#148;&#151;and rightly drew attention to the background to the present crisis, but he needs to be a little careful not to skate on rather thin ice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09031887000662">The build-up of debt through credit and housing bubbles, the deregulation of financial markets, the removal of the capital adequacy ratios from the reserve requirements of the Bank of England, the development of private equity and hedge funds, the light-touch regulation in the City and the development of the bonus culture were all main characteristics of the uncontrollable boom of the Thatcher era. One needs a little more humility and a little less &#147;I told you so.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="st_o352"><a name="09031887000663"><a name="90318-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="09031887001280"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that Baroness Thatcher left office more than 19 years ago, and that when she did, the banks were carefully controlled and had to have a lot of capital relative to their loan books?</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="09031887000664"><a name="90318-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="09031887001281"><b>Mr. Meacher:</b>
 I was referring to a boom that led to a most serious bust between 1990 and 1992. That bust was the result of the boom being allowed to get out of control, so I do not think that all the lessons are on one side. As I say, history points to a rather different story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09031887000665">The debate hinges on the fact that the Government have always rightly insisted&#151;I do not think that anyone really disagrees with this&#151;that they had to save the financial system from total collapse in order to preserve the real economy from deep recession by restoring lending to business, preferably at pre-crunch 2007 levels. What has actually happened&#151;here I agree with what the right hon. Member for Wokingham said&#151;is that unimaginably stupendous sums of taxpayers&#146; money have been spent on recapitalising the banks and insuring them against their ill-acquired mountains of toxic assets. However, lending to businesses and home owners has hardly increased at all, although such an increase was the whole aim of the exercise. Indeed, the banks actually decreased lending in the last quarter of 2008, and they announced not long ago that they are reducing it further in the first quarter of 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09031887000666">That in turn has forced the Government to try to substitute for the banks turning off the taps by increasing their lending to some stricken parts of industry. A notable example is the car industry, but the Government have also increased lending to some other industries. That substitution cannot possibly be more than extremely limited, because the deficit in the public accounts is already enormous, and it can certainly never begin to measure up to the scale of normal bank lending to the economy, which usually runs at something like &#163;500 billion a year. The fate of the whole economy continues to depend on the banks.</p>

<p><a name="st_o354"><a name="09031887000667"><a name="90318-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="09031887001282"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman is making a powerful speech, and I am grateful to him for giving way. Does he see the dilemma faced by the banks? The Government are saying, &#147;You must lend more money to business&#148; on the one hand, and &#147;You have to get your capital ratios up&#148; on the other. How can banks do both?</p>

the banks are to resolve those issues. In my view, if the banks are to have the state behind them, restoring lending to the wider economy should take absolute priority. That is the overwhelming requirement, and that is the central point that I wanted to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09031887000669">The policy has been eye-wateringly costly, yet it has not even achieved that one main objective. It is bitterly ironic that a different strategy not only could have achieved that main objective in full&#151;it could still do so now&#151;but could have done so at a fraction of the cost, and I want to show how. Why was that different strategy not followed? This is probably where I part company with the right hon. Member for Wokingham. There was just one thing blocking the use of that strategy, but that one thing is, I suspect for both Front-Bench teams, the biggest inhibitor in the entire neo-liberal lexicon: the horror of the public sector. The amount of money that has been spent on avoiding it is truly prodigious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09031887000670">Some &#163;26 billion was spent initially on Northern Rock&#151;a sum slightly larger than one third of the entire nation&#146;s education budget&#151;but the Government were still forced to acquiesce, reluctantly, in nationalisation. A year later, in September 2008, the Government spent &#163;42 billion bailing out Bradford &amp; Bingley. A week later, they made &#163;300 billion available for a credit guarantee scheme, plus &#163;200 billion for a special liquidity scheme and &#163;37 billion for a bank recapitalisation plan. The banks, of course, were delighted; they took it all with relish. They used it to consolidate their balance sheets, but they increased their lending very little, if at all, so the Government went further. In January this year, they offered another &#163;55 billion to protect the banks in respect of corporate debt. Last month, they made available a further &#163;500 billion for an asset protection scheme to cover bank losses. Altogether&#151;this figure has already come out in the debate&#151;the Government have offered some &#163;1.15 trillion to the banks, a sum equivalent to 78 per cent. of the UK&#146;s entire GDP, yet still bank lending to business and to household customers is stuck at a level that is causing business bankruptcies and joblessness to rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09031887000671">The obvious question is whether there is or was an alternative. I believe there clearly is. That is best illustrated by the RBS saga. After the catastrophic takeover of ABN Amro, RBS, as we all know, chalked up in 2008 the biggest corporate loss in British history&#151;&#163;28 billion. So the Government stepped in with a &#163;20 billion recapitalisation for the stricken bank. Even that did not staunch a massive further slide in the RBS share price, and by 20 January this year RBS stock, which was worth &#163;78 billion in 2007, had had its value reduced in the marketplace to less than &#163;4 billion, a staggering loss of 95 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09031887000672">The Government then provided yet another &#163;25 billion recapitalisation. What all that means is that instead of trying to bribe RBS and, of course, other banks, although RBS is the classic example, with colossal subsidies to increase their lending into the wider economy&#151;an objective that we all want to see, although there has been extraordinarily little success in respect of the sums concerned&#151;the Government could have taken over the bank at a tenth of the cost and thereby, with proper governance, secured the full increase in lending that was desperately needed.</p>

I shall give another example. With its very high level of toxic assets threatening now to bring down the whole new Lloyds banking group, HBOS, which was valued at &#163;35 billion a year ago, could instead have been bought in the stock market for &#163;6 billion last October. Instead of &#163;11.5 billion of taxpayers&#146; money being pumped in to assist the merger with Lloyds TSB, it could have been purchased at half the price and&#151;this is quite important&#151;the merger that is dragging down Lloyds need not have taken place. The cost via the public ownership route of returning to full-scale lending for the economy would therefore have been hugely less than under current policy, and also than under the Opposition&#146;s national loan guarantee scheme, which I do not think would have achieved the same objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90318-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09031887000675">Admittedly, and here again I slightly differ from what the right hon. Member for Wokingham said, &#163;1 trillion or more of public funding is currently at risk to assist the banks, but I assume that only a portion of it will be used, although we have been told that RBS wants to shift &#163;325 billion of toxic assets into the asset protection scheme; and Lloyds is now thinking of transferring &#163;250 billion, while Barclays is waiting on the edge. As long as it does not get into public control, it wants to put all its toxic assets, running to a few hundred billion pounds, into that scheme.</p>

That is an astronomical figure, and recovering from such a deficit could take several years. That is one powerful reason for not going down the route of the toxic assets protection scheme and these repeated capitalisations. But I continue to think that the overriding argument for the public ownership alternative is that rapidly restoring normal levels of lending&#151;I do not believe that there is any other way of doing that&#151;within the economy would largely prevent the enormous cost of rising bankruptcies and joblessness, which we are told could rise to 3.5 million, which we are now seeing throughout the economy.</p>

shameless greed and the enormous bonus awards for failure of the RBS and HBOS directors just make monkeys out of the Government, as do also the extraordinary contortions dreamt up by Barclays to preserve its bonus culture intact, from Bob Diamond&#146;s &#163;36 million a year downwards, plus its aggressive, convoluted tax havens maze, robbing the taxpayer of, it has been calculated, about &#163;1 billion a year. Against that background, as we have seen in the last few days, the Chancellor is reduced to publishing soon a code of practice, which is not enforceable, unless he makes it enforceable in some way, stating that the banks are expected&#151;expected&#151;to obey the spirit as well as the letter of the law. I can only put it to the Chancellor that the only way to end this humiliating charade, with the banks running rings round the Government, is public ownership. I am quite prepared to say that it should be temporary; I am not in favour of public ownership for its own sake, but&#151;temporarily at this time&#151;it seems to make a hell of a lot of sense. That is the only way we can achieve what is needed.</p>

It exposes more sharply than anything that I can think of in recent years just how deeply embedded is that ideology in the minds of the political and economic leadership of this country. That probably applies to both parties. I think it is the defining element of the neo-liberal era. Adopting the most obvious, pragmatic and appropriate solution to public ownership at least cost in the current financial meltdown is not an ideological stance, but rejecting it out of hand certainly is, and the Government should think again.</p>

He said:</p>

more than any economist before him, the importance of confidence; he first referred to it as &#147;animal spirits&#148;, the driving part of the economy. He recognised that confidence was ephemeral, but that it was not irrational.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000686">If it is difficult to raise capital and get loans, if markets are uncertain and if there are problems of demand or lack of demand&#151;indeed, if there are prospects of high taxation in the future&#151;confidence is enormously harmed. My point is that the Government&#146;s management of this issue in the past year or two has added dramatically to our problem; it has reinforced the position highlighted by the IMF&#151;that we will probably face a longer recession than anybody else. There are many other structural reasons, but that is one of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09031887000687">At first, that was almost inexplicable to me. Why were the Government so slow, timorous and ham-fisted about their handling of the banking crisis? After all, there is no shortage of examples of how&#151;and, indeed, of how not&#151;to handle one. Anybody who understands capitalism will recognise that banking crises are not that unusual. They happen quite a lot, and there have been a few in the past decade or so. This is not a new point, but it is now widely recognised that the Swedish banking crisis was handled well and that the Japanese one was handled badly. Interestingly, the Government have mimicked not the Swedish example, but the Japanese one. What is the difference? Each country started&#151;like all Governments, ours included&#151;by underwriting the bank depositors. That was quite right; that is how to stop a run on a bank. It is straightforward, although expensive in some senses, and it has to be done. There is no choice about that stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000688">It was in the second stage that the Government deviated from the Swedish example. I hope that the House will forgive me if I recount that example. The Swedish Government said to their banks, &#147;You will identify the full extent of all your losses and liabilities before anything else happens. If you do not, there will be no support.&#148; That is a clear and brave thing to do; perhaps our Government did not do it because it is so brave. What is the advantage of that approach? First, it makes the shareholders meet the losses first, as is entirely proper in a capitalist economy; that also reduces the taxpayers&#146; loss. Secondly, it pre-empts all the problems of bonuses, pensions and pay-offs that shame all of us who believe in a free market economy. Shareholders who have just lost their entire wealth are not about to stand for that sort of behaviour; Lord Myners might, but those shareholders, I am afraid, will not. Thirdly, the approach identifies the banks into three categories: those that do not need help; those that can reasonably use help to serve the nation&#146;s needs for borrowing and industry capital formation; and those beyond recall&#151;those now known in the parlance as the &#147;zombie banks&#148;, which are the dead banks to which we are still giving transfusions of taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09031887000689">The approach is tough, but it is a necessary precursor of what we should have done in this crisis. That shock action in Sweden stopped what is known as a liquidity asset spiral&#151;the continuing reduction of the assets on which the banks base their value and activities. It was predicted that the disposal of toxic assets in Sweden would take 10 years; the vast majority was done within three years. What was the cost to the nation? If we count interest, it was 2 per cent. of GDP; if we do not, it was nothing&#151;zero&#151;because the issue was addressed   <br>

up front. The action stopped, throughout the whole Swedish economy, what is known by the technicians as payment uncertainty: the fear that the next customer will not pay the bill, and the fact that someone cannot get credit insurance. Such things vanish when the problem is dealt with.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the right hon. Gentleman. Before the Government intervened, people in the press were highlighting what had been done in Sweden. The Government seemed to adopt, as he said, what the Swedes did, but a toxic bank has not been set up to carry toxic assets in this country. I would like to hear his views on that.</p>

 The Government did not do what the Swedes did. They did not carry out that up-front identification. The best example of that came during the past couple of days in relation to the Lloyds-HBOS merger, which was forced through incidentally by stopping the action of our competition laws. That was wrong; this is what they are for to a certain extent. The merger was forced through so fast that Eric Daniels, an extremely good banker until this point, had to admit to the Treasury Committee that he did not carry out due diligence. It is the first time in my political and business career that I have ever heard of a major acquisition taking place without due diligence. What have we done? We have taken one destroyed bank and probably created two destroyed banks. Once we have the relevant information, we can make rational decisions about what to do about individual banks. If a bank is dead, it does not mean that the depositors disappear or that the loans disappear, but it is necessary to break it up and parcel out the components to others who can better manage them. That did not happen in this case, and it was a great failure. I am sorry to say that it amounts to a failure of courage.</p>

There are good reasons for public works investment during a recession, but probably demand management is the least good of them. I do not have time to go into the matter in detail, but all we have to do is look back at the supposed great revolution of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the United States. In the 1930s, the United States had five years of bad recession, and did not recover to its trend growth until 1942, in the middle of the second world war. We had Treasury officials who were very old-fashioned and resisted Keynes, and we had two years in recession and were back on trend by 1937. We ought to be a bit careful about assuming that such actions will work because they carry a lot of consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09031887000693">We have a structural problem to deal with. I mentioned to the hon.

That is a detailed variant of a structural problem in the world as a whole. In America, household consumption is 70 per cent. of GDP; our household consumption is about 63 per cent. of GDP; and Chinese household consumption is 40 per cent. of GDP. The consequence is a massive flow of money,  <br>

which still goes on and is unsustainable at those levels. At the end of the day, whichever Government deal with the matter will have to resolve the problem in the long run of bringing aggregate spending into line with our economic capabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09031887000694">I have only had a chance to see the summary of the Turner report because a copy has not been put in the Vote Office&#151;at least not when I was able to go there. In essence, Turner calls for anti-cyclical asset requirements, which is very sensible. That policy did not save Spain, mind you, but by itself it is worth while, although not a game-taker. He calls for a general increase in capital-asset ratio levels, which is fine. That is very sensible, but expensive for the banks. He asks for balance sheet rules specific to risk, which is also sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09031887000695">I really would like the Minister to respond to what I have to say on the FSA&#146;s attitude. Historically, the attitude of the FSA has bordered on the criminal, partly because it has been the victim of a massive confusion of aim. For example, there used to be something called the regulation T scale. It encouraged the movement of assets from American balance sheets to British ones because they did not meet regulations properly put in place in New York, which were set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its regulation T. That was actively encouraged by the FSA, with the result that we had a large quantity of poor-quality assets on British rather than American balance sheets. We should ask, for example, why nearly all of AIG&#146;s losses were in London, why so much of the securitised mortgage asset base was in London and why most of the companies involved will never pay taxes in my lifetime because of their accumulated losses. That situation is the result of a massive confusion of aim by the FSA, which actively encouraged it in the fond thought that it was a way of helping the City of London. In fact, it brought very low-quality business to the City.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09031887000696">The problem is that checklist regulation almost never works very well. That is what the FSA is based upon&#151;a tick-box approach to regulation. It is worse in complex systems, because people find ways around it, and in fast-changing systems. When the two of those come together, as in most of the investment banking sector, there is a very difficult problem to resolve. The intelligent thing to do is separate out the part of that sector which matters most to us and the economy and which we cannot afford to fail&#151;namely the high-street and commercial banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90318-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09031887000697">The real answer&#151;not the short-term answer but the long-term structural answer&#151;must be to separate the commercial banks from the investment banks, so that we can regulate the commercial banks tightly, ensure they provide capital for everything from mortgages to business loans. At the same time, that would enable us to allow a much lighter regime for the area that needs to be innovative. That is not just my view but that of Paul Volcker, Nigel Lawson and, I gather from what the hon. Member for Twickenham said, the Governor of the Bank of England. That seems to me the only way ahead for our financial sector.</p>

 It is a pleasure and a privilege to take part in this debate. When I looked at the Conservative motion, I thought it was somewhat lightweight and out of touch, that it did not address the issues and that it was politically provocative. I have to say that the speeches that we have heard, including those from Conservative Members, have not been like that. A number of them have been very thoughtful and interesting. I have not agreed with all of them, although I have found myself in agreement with certain elements.</p>

Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), we were getting into a debate about what was good debt and what was bad debt. I had thought about that before, but I began to focus on it in a way that I hope is a bit more effective. In debates such as this in the past, we have all had strong views about what levels of deficits on borrowing are sustainable in the economy, what level of long-term debt we could live with and the role of automatic stabilisers, which is a big issue between the United States and Europe. We have all had views about regulation, and most of us who have taken part in these debates over the years have words to say about it.</p>

Perhaps it will be relevant when history is written, but we will not move forward as a nation if all we do is throw abuse at each other about what we have said about these and other issues over the 10 or 20 years for which some of us have been in the House. Some of us have been in the House a little longer and have doubtless thrown the abuse for longer.</p>

I believed that the Chinese and Indian economies would be sufficiently buoyant to ensure that the rest of the world did not get dragged into a deepening recession. When I campaigned for the then Senator Obama in Illinois in June, I took the opportunity of visiting a banking friend in the United States, and he said, &#147;You&#146;ve got this wrong. This is pretty serious&#151;we don&#146;t know how bad it is, but it&#146;s grim.&#148; That is where we are now.</p>

The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) quoted Keynes. I do that occasionally, but I would like to cite a neo-Keynesian this afternoon&#151;J. K. Galbraith. When he gave evidence to the congressional committee on the economy in 1954, when the Americans believed that another fairly deep recession might be beginning, he said that the problem in 1929 and, to some extent, in 1954, was where the wise got their wisdom.

 I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, and if I had stuck to my speech I might have come to it myself. However, as long as we are moving broadly in line with the changing debt and deficit financing levels of comparable countries&#151;the United States, Germany, France, Japan and so on&#151;and as long as we are moving on the same track, even if it is an upward track, I would not expect that confidence to go. As long as that confidence does not go, the relative strength of the currency will be retained.

international agreement between the countries that are running surpluses and those that are running deficits to act together. That would mean the Chinese starting to spend a little more in China, which would mean that they would not have to export so much, which in turn would mean that we would not have to import so much from China, meaning that we would not have such difficulties with deficit financing. Providing that there is an international agreement to take that on board, we will find a way out of this mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09031887000712">Those on the Conservative Front Bench have to face up to the hard-line decisions. They have to recognise that the enemy is not inflation. The enemy was inflation for a number of decades, but the enemy today is deflation. The great danger is that we do what was done in the 1930s. Before Keynes got his way and before Roosevelt introduced the new deal in 1933, the world economy was in a serious position. Instead of trying to stimulate the economy by having programmes of public expenditure and keeping interest rates as low as possible, we had the opposite. In the early days of the recession, in &#146;29, &#146;30 and &#146;31, we had high interest rates. We even put interest rates up initially, until we realised the folly of doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000713">When interest rates went down, the economy did not respond to them and people said, &#147;What now?&#148; It was at that point that Keynes said, &#147;You might want to have some public expenditure&#148;&#151;the right hon. Gentleman and I might agree at least on what was said historically. Today we are in the same position. We have a choice of ways to stimulate the economy. We can have some tax cuts&#151;I think that that will be essential&#151;to give a boost quickly. I am not a 100 per cent. believer in the VAT cut, but whatever one might say about it, it is a quick way of having an effect throughout the economy. We need to look at the VAT cut again in a year&#146;s time and see whether it has had an effect. I suspect that my initial reaction was wrong and that it will have more effect than I thought it might.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000714">We also need programmes of public expenditure as the economic stimulus is taken forward, and we have choices on what that expenditure should be. Some aspects of public expenditure are automatic&#151;they just happen, because of the stabilisers in the economy. That is usually pretty good, because people who need the benefits usually spend the money that they get, which is good for stimulating the economy in the short term. If the Minister is going to give us a taste of what might be in the Budget, I hope that we might hear something along those lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000715">On public expenditure on public works, as it were, there are various areas of our economy where we have obvious needs. We need to get parts of our transport system right and now is the time to do that. We need to spend money on education and skills to ensure that when we come out of the economic difficulties that we are currently in, we have people who can take up the future challenges and compete internationally. There has been talk around the Chamber of cuts in expenditure for further education colleges, but that is not true.</p>

 By common consent, we are facing the worst recession in a generation and, as each day passes, we hear more and more gloomy reports. I fear that matters will get very much worse before they get better, and that our constituents have cause to be anxious. For 10 years, the Prime Minister has posed as the man whose command of economic affairs was so all-embracing that he had abolished boom and bust, and thanks to whose stewardship and management of our economy, Britain led the world. There was no acknowledgement of the role played by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), or, indeed, of his predecessor, the noble Lord Lamont for his legacy of a successful economy, which was bequeathed to this Labour Government. That was, of course, all the work of the brilliant incoming Labour Chancellor, whose endless skills stopped short only of alchemy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000721">Suddenly, however, as everything turned to worms, we learned that our problems were the fault of everyone else&#151;of the global economy. I hope that everyone has noted how the word &#147;global&#148; has been used on every conceivable occasion. That was designed deliberately as a tactic&#151;one that would have been worthy of the good German doctor&#151;to impress upon our people that this was all someone else&#146;s responsibility, and that responsibility did not lie here. Then the hapless Sir Fred Goodwin and his pension were invoked to distract the public&#146;s attention from the architect of this disaster. As interest in him wanes, the laissez-faire market economy has been identified as a villain requiring a form of regulation, which I understand the Government described last night in chilling terms, saying that the banks</p>

I believe that the banks must accept a large share of the responsibility, because they were responsible for making the decisions on to whom to lend money and on how to devise the various mechanisms to lubricate the economy. There is no doubt in my mind that the explosion in the number of complex products developed an inverted pyramid, and my right hon.

little idea of where the real risk lay, and that the banks lacked the appropriate internal procedures and checks. A former chairman of RBS, Sir Tom McKillop, admitted as much yesterday. When asked whether he was sure that he could understand the full complexities of the sophisticated loans that his bankers had created, he replied:</p>
<a name="90318-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09031887000885"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You said &#145;full complexities&#146;. I would say no.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09031887000726">There is also the matter of poor lending. It is entirely right that people have referred to what has happened in the United States. An interesting article appeared in <i> The New York Times </i>on 30 September 1999, in which it was pointed out:</p>
<a name="90318-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="09031887000886"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Fannie Mae, the nation&#146;s biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people&#148;.</p>

There was political pressure to lend, and that was being mirrored at home by the Prime Minister, who wanted to increase social inclusion so that those who were a notch below creditworthiness could also be lent to. In that perceptive article, which I commend to my hon. Friends, it says:</p>
<a name="90318-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="09031887000887"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times.

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09031887000729">The second issue I want to address is regulation. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) pointed out, the Bank of England had been responsible for banking supervision for centuries; it understood the system and the system understood it. The &#147;Old Lady&#148; understood. I recall when I was with Bank of America Ltd in the 1970s, my boss was called in; I asked &#147;How did it go, Bob?&#148; and he said, &#147;Fine, no problems&#148;. We asked whether the Bank of England had anything to suggest, and he said, &#147;Well, it thought our Polish book was a bit longer than we might like&#148;. That meant that, on the following day, our exposure to Poland was reduced&#151;no diktat, no law: it was done because the Bank of England knew what it was on about and its advice was accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09031887000730">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe also drew attention to the fact that we have warned consistently of the danger of transferring responsibility for banking supervision from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority. Interestingly, in the debate on the Financial Services and Markets Bill on 28 June 1999, the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), claimed somewhat extravagantly:</p>
<a name="90318-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="09031887000888"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Bill gives the FSA the statutory basis and powers that it needs to be the world's leading regulator of financial services.

The independent financial advisers gets the third degree and Goodwin gets the K. That is the way the FSA and its progenitor, the Prime Minister, worked. Now the Government are threatening to impose a draconian regulatory regime. What is wanted is not more regulation, but more effective regulation, which has been lacking.</p>

I hope to make it clear to the House that I believe he is the architect and the man responsible. One of the most unattractive&#151;indeed, offensive&#151;sights has been how openly the Prime Minister appears to have been revelling in this crisis. He was down and out in October 2007; all of a sudden, a crisis came along and he blossomed. As I have explained, the banks have played their part, but the Prime Minister, the most overrated Chancellor in my lifetime, bears a heavy burden. He destroyed the pensions industry; he destroyed the tried and tested system of banking supervision; he failed to rein in irresponsible lending; he promoted imprudent lending by pressing banks and other financial institutions to lend to those he described as &#147;the socially excluded&#148;; he sold off 60 per cent. of the UK&#146;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce&#151;close to a 20-year low, and, I remind the House, a fraction of today&#146;s price of $900. The Prime Minister imposed a growing tax burden on the people of Britain which, according to the OECD, has risen from 39.3 per cent. of GDP when he took office to 42.4 per cent. in 2006, and rising. He also permitted a 13 per cent. increase in public sector employment when private sector employment grew by only 5.7 per cent. All that has happened under the Prime Minister&#146;s watch and he must be made to accept responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90318-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09031887000743">Let me define neo-liberalism. The theory is that the market should determine individual actions, that we should support privatisation and deregulation and trade and financial liberalisation, that we should shrink the roles of the state and of trade unions because they interfere with the workings of the market, and that, on an international level, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should carry out the structural adjustment programmes that introduce such ideas into the societies of developing countries.</p>

Those involved in the neo-liberal revolution of the mid-to-late 1970s promised that an economic panacea could be delivered that would mean growing wealth for everyone, but that was far from the case.

This is the result of three decades of this economic system working through. I could go on and highlight the figure for child poverty in the east end of Glasgow, which is, I think, about 98 per cent., or even state that four out of 10 kids in London are brought up in poverty, even though the richest square mile of the country is located in the city.</p>

post-industrial age, and how the provision of services was the way forward and the production of things something from the past. We were told that Britain was in a uniquely strong position in this new economic order because of the history, experience and international reputation of the City of London, and that the City, and all that it brought with it, would be the golden goose for the economy. This is clearly not true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09031887000757">Like the industrial revolution, the financial revolution has affected us in every corner of our lives. Let us take our attitude to housing. A home is now a speculative investment, a source of access to greater credit or a piece of equity that can be realised at some point. Housing has become a national obsession, and that has severely distorted the economy. I saw some figures suggesting that, at its peak, the buy-to-let revolution &#147;contributed&#148;&#151;I use inverted commas&#151;four times more to the UK economy than the motor industry. To pick up on the comments of the hon. Member for Aldershot, I believe our economy is dangerously unbalanced and needs adjusting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000758">What situation are we in today? Is this merely a re-run of the 1980s? I would argue that it is a re-run of the 1930s. There is evidence of a 1930s-style downturn. The current decline in financial markets has continued for 17 months to match the rate of decline after 1929, which is the most severe recorded. The decline has not yet carried on for as long, but it is following the same path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000759">I was going to look at the effects on the real economy. The latest figures released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for world trade up to December 2008 stand out. They suggest that the economic downturn is set to be the worst since 1929. We have heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton about the huge sums of money that have been put into the banking system. It is now clear that the banks should be nationalised, and they should be driven in their investment policies by social need, not the need for profit. I was also clear&#151;I warned the Chancellor about this some time ago; not that he listens to me&#151;that the bankers would take the money and put two fingers up at us. That is precisely what has happened. I am glad that the Treasury Committee Chairman has effectively called for the nationalisation of the banks.</p>

 Consumer confidence is one of the most important aspects of this recession and where it is going. I agree with the hon.

confidence after the crash, and he largely succeeded, although I should say that a lot of the myths about the new deal are wrong, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) made clear. The Americans did not have many shovel-ready schemes&#151;to use the jargon of the time&#151;which meant that they were not able to put as many people to work as quickly on those great schemes as they had hoped; in fact, it was five years before the main schemes were working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09031887000763">The key effect of the new deal and the way in which President Roosevelt announced it and pressed it forward was to build consumer confidence; people felt that there was a plan and a way forward&#151;a definite approach. That certainty of approach led to the rebuilding of confidence; companies started to take on labour, and projects that were nothing to do with the Government started to be undertaken and commerce started to revive. The steady hand on the tiller was as important as those new deal schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000764">What worries me about the current situation&#151;the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) made this point&#151;is that it has not been clear to many people exactly where we are with this recession, as it gradually seems to get worse with every piece of news that we get. I was talking to some American officials at the embassy last week, and they were describing their shock at the fourth quarter unemployment figures in America. They said that to lose 651,000 jobs in one month was shocking; in fact, President Obama called the set of figures &#147;astounding&#148;. Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s had been expecting a relatively modest recession in terms of the number of job losses, and its chief economist, David Wyss, said:</p>
<a name="90318-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="09031887000896"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Up until the third quarter, we thought we were on track for a relatively moderate recession, but then in the fourth quarter, everything fell apart&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09031887000765">That makes the point quite well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09031887000766">This country is in danger of underestimating what we are dealing with. Yesterday, I was surprised to read in the <i> Evening Standard</i> that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was saying proudly that unemployment was rising more slowly than in the previous recession; it was as if he could be sure about that. Yet, today we were given the worst figures ever for a rise in unemployment&#151;the 0.5 per cent. increase was higher than the previous record, in March 1991.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09031887000767">The Government need to bear in mind the effect that unemployment has on consumer confidence. Someone who has just lost their job, whose home is on the line and who is worried about a repossession is not going to go out and spend money. My goodness, such a person would be careful; they would try to repay debt and so on. The Government are working against a moving picture&#151;every month&#146;s delay at the moment means another 70,000 people unemployed and looking for work. It is an urgent problem that needs tackling, but the Government&#146;s schemes for jobs and homes seem to take for ever to put in place. Sometimes we just have to act. The Conservatives have been saying for months that you&#151;I am sorry, I mean the Government. I am getting over-excited&#151;</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a passionate speech on behalf of his constituents and of everyone who thinks that the situation is getting worse and that we need to see some action. Does he agree that one of the problems with the overload of initiatives that we have seen the Government announce in an attempt to tackle the recession is that rather than do the planning before making the announcement, they have done it afterwards?

 I could not agree more. It is classic new Labour spin: they say &#147;Let us make an announcement and get it in the media,&#148; and of course it is half-baked and not ready to go. That saps confidence and people do not believe that there is a steady hand at the tiller. We saw with Northern Rock all the dithering and not knowing what to do, and how damaging it was for public and consumer confidence. All these schemes are announced, but they do not come in on time.

 I was surprised by the comments of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). The opening speech made by his Front-Bench spokesman made no proposals other than the perpetually fed-out idea of a &#163;50 billion loan guarantee system. There was nothing else. Where was the beef? This was an opportunity for the Opposition to set out what they would do if they were in government, and they have come up with one scheme that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) was able to start picking holes in during the debate.</p>

I would never want what my family went through&#151;thankfully for a relatively short period&#151;to happen to any other family if it was avoidable.</p>

We simply heard the claim that the &#163;50 billion loan guarantee scheme would suddenly release funds into the economy and everything would be hunky-dory. It is quite clear that although lending is enormously important, we have a global recession and the real economy is starting to be hammered, too. That shows that the solution is not just about providing greater lending in the economy. I want to say a few words about how we got here.</p>

One example concerned the complexity of the derivatives that have been developed in the past two decades and the complete failure of senior managers to understand the risks involved. The classic example of how we got into this mess involves Lord Aldington, the UK chairman of Deutsche Bank. His bank had to write of billions of dollars worth of dodgy derivatives&#151;collateralised debt obligations&#151;the week before he gave evidence to the Committee. The Chairman asked him to explain what a CDO squared was, but Lord Aldington said that he did not deal in that sort of detail.</p>

To be fair, some financial institutions such as Legal and General were trying to persuade the RBS board in early 2008 to sack Fred Goodwin and Tom McKillip as the bank&#146;s chief executive and chairman. They felt that the bank was following a model that was far too risky, and they were proven absolutely right.</p>

 I listened with interest to what Opposition Members said about how removing the regulatory role from the Bank of England has led to the present difficulties, but the same situation exists in the US, Japan and across Europe. Yes, there have been serious failures of regulation, and I accept that the FSA and other regulators got into a tick-box culture that meant that they were not looking at the big picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09031887000786">The classic case that should have sounded the warnings was Northern Rock. That involved another tick-box culture where everything, according to the regulator, was in order, yet its business model was totally dependent on the wholesale credit market. As soon as that dried up, Northern Rock&#146;s business plan collapsed, after which the bank went belly up and had to be rescued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09031887000787">The problem was that the regulators were not looking at the other banks either.

It is the huge commodity spike that took place in late 2007, which peaked when the oil price reached nearly $150 a barrel in July 2008. My concern is that when we come out of the recession, there will be another commodity bubble, which will prevent or delay recovery. The Government, through the G20, should look for a way to ensure that commodity markets are far better regulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para25"><a name="09031887000791">Finally, the G20 is a real opportunity for us to ensure that there is quality regulation throughout the world; to be seen to be acting together to address the problems, particularly in the developed world; and to look at how we can co-ordinate fiscal stimulus. At the end of the day, manufacturers here and in, say, Germany are dependent on both countries&#146; economies to create demand for products, whether those products&#151;cars or whatever&#151;be German or British. Co-ordination is a key to that. I am sure that the Government will do what they can to ensure that the G20 is a success, both on the regulatory front and when it comes to addressing the overall problem in the economies of the world.</p>

 I ask the House to note my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. First, I want to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) on a really impressive opening speech on an important motion. Although we are talking about a very complicated area of policy and politics, he expressed how people feel today. He set out how they view the Government&#146;s activity, and how they rate its effectiveness&#151;or, more precisely, its ineffectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90318-0018.htm_para26"><a name="09031887000793">I had not intended to make this point, but I want to mention the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#146;s somewhat smug reply to my hon. Friend&#146;s speech, in which she referred to the early &#146;90s. I do not know where she was in the early &#146;90s, but I was there; I know what unemployment looks like, and I know what redundancy looks like. Moreover, I know that it does not help the people who are in the thick of it&#151;in the construction and building materials industry&#151;when those who were not there think that they can preach to others. Those of us who have been through a recession know what is absolutely essential: confidence, stability, the cost of capital and, above all, having capital available. Whether a business person is on the shop floor, out there making the roads or even in the boardroom, what makes the difference when they take their risks and make their decisions is knowing that those things are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09031887000794">T he Government of the day were certainly not blameless, and I was critical at the time, but they recognised the issues and helped us to restore and retain jobs. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#151;this is why I make the point&#151;could not have sounded more shrill and insulting to the stalwart people who soldiered through that time. I hope that she will reflect seriously on the fact that her comments do not play well with the people whom she claims to represent as a Minister of the Government. One need only look at the current number of housing starts, which are at 5,000 a month. In the very worst of previous recessions, they were about double that, at 10,000 a month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09031887000795">Given today&#146;s unemployment figures, we need to recognise that this recession puts other recessions into the also-ran department. The rate of the rise in one month is sufficient to make most people afraid; it is eye-watering compared with the rates in previous recessions. Let us not for a moment try to pretend, as the Government have done today, that the recession is not deadly serious, and that many people in our country are not frightened. Frankly, they are right to be afraid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09031887000796">We may say the usual knockabout stuff about an apology-free Prime Minister, the &#147;Blame anyone but me&#148; attitude, and the fact that we are now in the Brown bust, despite the Prime Minister&#146;s claim that he would get rid of boom and bust. Many right hon. and hon. Members sought to include those points in their speeches, but let us not forget that in recessions, the victims are people&#151;our constituents. The remedy is to back business, and for people to get back to work in those businesses. I know that this sometimes pains the Government and many Labour Members, but whether they like it or not, when we talk about business, from the shop floor to the boardroom, we are talking about the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09031887000797">Yet again, as in all recessions, it is the private sector that takes a disproportionate share of the pain. Those in the private sector are ultimately the wealth creators, the risk takers, the entrepreneurs and the investors. Now that I am in the public sector, I understand why I was so angry with it when I was in the private sector. It seemed to think that a recession was something that happened to other people, not those in the public sector. In a recession, the national interest is damaged and deeply affected for everybody, but we all depend on the private sector for growth, wealth creation and ultimately the tax revenues that fund all our choices and democratic opportunities, and we must back it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09031887000798">I received an e-mail from Robert Jenrick, who relates a story about Newcastle-under-Lyme, where another good business has fallen victim to the economic crisis&#151;a local engineering firm for over 40 years, and exactly the kind of respected employer of skilled workers that we must ensure survives the recession. Its parent company is Wrekin Construction, a profitable business which recently built Keele university&#146;s science park. The business collapsed after Royal Bank of Scotland, now majority owned by all of us as taxpayers through the Government, demanded repayment of its entire overdraft. A similar thing happened as a result of a demand from Midland Bank in the north-west back in 1979. I should know; it had a big effect on my family. More than 500 jobs may now be lost as a result of the engineering firm&#146;s collapse. That could be unnecessary, provided the banks start lending again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09031887000799">Among all the issues bearing down on this country now are the initial crisis, the banks&#146; inability to continue lending, and the fact that they had to hunker down and recognise that they had made some serious misjudgments. They had got out of control, they had lost what it was truly to be a banker and had become financial speculators and product innovators while most of those who had supervisory responsibility did not know what those products did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09031887000800">It is vital that we all club together to help in political terms and get the banks lending again. Without lending, we cannot fuel, preferably from the bottom up&#151;from the SMEs up&#151;the necessary business activity. We cannot support bankers who have decided to take public money to support themselves. We are right to be angry and to challenge the intention of those banks to continue to pay bonuses. They say they are contractually bound, but I would have said of those who might have been expecting a bonus, &#147;Let them sue for it.&#148; It may have been interesting to see how many of the arguments they advanced to get their entitlement, as they see it, would cut any ice. We must maintain that supply of fuel to business, and at present it is not getting through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09031887000801">The key to success, as we know, is confidence. We start from a poor base. The uncertainties, particularly in relation to corporate tax, mean that most businesses have not been investing in their future, in innovation, in competitiveness and in ensuring that they can capture and retain markets, as they would have done had normal investment taken place in the so-called good times.</p>

 I will not, as we are all constrained by the time limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09031887000804">It is important to recognise that we start from a low base of business investment. Even in these tough times, businesses have to think about where, if they can get capital, they place that capital to ensure that they are best positioned for recovery, so that they do not find themselves disadvantaged by the recession, which has largely had nothing to do with their good business activities and everything to do with another part of the economy. In addition to all that others have said, I suggest that there is an opportunity for the Government to&#151;let us call it this&#151;steal our policies, including the &#163;50 billion national loan guarantee scheme. Despite the various attempts by various Whips and others to rubbish that, nothing has been proved against it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09031887000805">We have also proposed a tax break for new jobs, making sure that we reduce employment costs for small businesses by cutting national insurance, and helping small business with their cash flow by delaying VAT bills for six months. Through the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform we need to tackle the credit insurance calamity, which is causing major problems of supply. The Government are not prepared to acknowledge that and Lord Mandelson is apparently unwilling to meet leading retailers to discuss it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09031887000806">Another point, which I hope I will be able to discuss later with my right hon. and hon.

of trying to get a balance between equity and debt risk into new and start-up companies and early development companies. That was a success story, and I do not think that the conditions today are dramatically different, so we should look to those lessons. But perhaps, rather than being owned by the Bank of England and the clearers, such an entity might be very interesting to the venture capital trusts that are looking for opportunities to get their money to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09031887000807">I have to report an insidious and worrying effect of the Government&#146;s increasing involvement in the everyday aspects of our lives. As some may have read in the press, my constituent , Geoff Robbins, who has a thoroughly sound business, rang up his bank, RBS, for a normal merchant account, and after the usual questions, the final one was whether he had any political or judicial affiliations. Can you believe it? A well-known journalist tested that and received exactly the same reply and the bank was embarrassed and had to backtrack. That is a sign of the times. When banks start to become state-owned, people begin to worry that unless they are something to do with Labour they will be disadvantaged. That is a deeply worrying development in our national life. One has only to pose the question in the future: Labour or Conservative, which is safer? The answer is Conservative.</p>

 I am sorry that I was not here for the opening speech, but we had a homecoming parade in Northampton, and I congratulate both the Royal Lancers on their wonderful parade and the people of Northampton on turning out in record numbers in brilliant sunshine, showing the enormous support in the town and the country&#151;and in the county.

I have also had the privilege to sit on the Treasury Committee for the past four years and have heard the evidence of all those involved in the banking crisis. It has been clear throughout that nobody predicted it, gave the warnings or said what action they could have taken at the time that would have prevented it. However much hon. Members might say that they gave warnings at the time, it is clear to those of us who sat through the evidence that people did not recognise the size and scale of the problems until it was very late indeed.

was not as a Member of Parliament making speeches in this place, but outside reporting on them and dealing with the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09031887000813">For example, in the 1980s recession, I saw the consequences of a Government who did not invest enough in the Department for Health and Social Security, and in particular in social security offices. In Birmingham, when unemployment rose, the offices were overloaded and they shut down. For nine to 10 months people simply did not get any benefits. That is why the Government are right to invest in the Jobcentre Plus offices and to think carefully about how they will support people who need advice and retraining, and, yes, benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09031887000814">During that recession, the Conservative Government were also not prepared to invest in training. As a result, one of the most talented work forces in the world&#151;the car workers of Birmingham&#151;found themselves unemployed with no opportunities to retrain. That is why I particularly applaud the investment that this Labour Government have made in apprenticeships, schools and universities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09031887000815">During the recession of the &#146;90s, my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary and I were both in south London and saw its consequences. The then Government, who had no commitment to tackling inequality, allowed people in London to work on &#163;1.20 an hour when people in Canary Wharf and the City were still making vast amounts of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09031887000816">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) was right: what the Government have done is risky. However, it is absolutely right to intervene&#151;and with real force. Last autumn, the recapitalisation was needed to prevent a major bank from collapsing. The asset protection scheme frees up the banks&#146; balance books to enable them to start lending. There is also the quantitative easing; it would, I suspect, have been extraordinarily difficult for the Bank of England to manage both the quantitative easing and banking supervision. The division of responsibility at the Bank was right, although the FSA has clearly had difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09031887000817">Furthermore, it was right for there to be a fiscal stimulus. It would have been wrong if the stimulus had gone into public sector infrastructure spending at that stage, because that is notoriously slow. I would have preferred the stimulus to have gone through tax credits rather than VAT. It would then have been more targeted at the people who needed it more, and some of the retailers would not have been able to massage the figures.</p>

Some of the items will even find favour with the Conservative party. First, the Government should make sure that when something is announced, it is available. Some of the measures put in place are available, so this is not a criticism of all the Government&#146;s schemes. However, there have been real difficulties, particularly with the mortgage rescue scheme. That scheme was announced and people thought that it would be available, but it has taken a couple of months to put in place. Most people&#151;certainly my constituents&#151;are realistic about what happens. They make plans on  <br>

the basis of what is on offer. If they think that something is on offer, they will plan around it. If, however, they then find that it is not, they get very cross.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09031887000820">On the home ownership front, can the support for mortgage interest be extended so that it is made available to some extent to people on contributions-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;perhaps through a link to the tax credit system? In my constituency, there are one and a half incomes per household, so if one person loses their job the income is still too large to qualify for support for mortgage interest. People might lose their homes, so I ask my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary to look at that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09031887000821">In particular, will the Government put pressure on the banks regarding the conditions imposed on recapitalisation? The banks should maintain their 2007 levels of lending, and we should get monthly rather than just annual reports. The banks are obliged to provide that level of lending and there is clear evidence that the money is not getting through. The Northamptonshire chamber of commerce kindly organised a business advice surgery for me at which businesses raised issues, and that was the No. 1 problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09031887000822">One of the other problems was that, because of very low interest rates, banks were recouping some of the money that they would otherwise have got by increasing arrangement fees and other hidden charges. I hope that the Government will put real pressure on the banks so that they cannot use other means to make life difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises. If banks are reviewing their loan books, which they obviously have to do, they should not be punitive or trigger problems for fairly sound firms, which are finding their way through current difficulties, by stopping draw-downs on existing loans, for example, which is what HBOS did to one of my constituents, threatening 50 jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09031887000823">I hope that the Government will implement quickly the recommendations of the Turner report. The Government called for it, and it is important to recognise that. In particular, I hope that we will implement the recommendations on credit ratings agencies and on remuneration policies. While there has been much focus on Fred the Shred&#146;s pension, we have not heard so much about the fact that bonuses encourage inappropriate risk-taking, which needs to be dealt with.</p>

In these hard times, it is important that our party and our Government hold fast in the great crusade that has won them credit not just in this country, but around the world. It has been one of the defining policies of this Labour Government.</p>

By contrast, the United States economy&#151;I know that the Prime Minister likes to contrast us with the US&#151;will contract by 2.6 per cent.

and tax revenues from the City alone are expected to drop by up to 40 per cent., with a loss of up to &#163;25 billion in tax revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09031897000009">Unsurprisingly, sterling has collapsed to a 23-year low of $1.35 from a peak of $2.11 under a year ago. Let me remind the Prime Minister that it was he who said, in 1992, that a weak currency arises from a weak economy, which in turn is the result of a weak Government. The problem began the day that the Prime Minister stepped into No. 11 Downing street. In making the Bank of England independent, removing debt management to the Treasury and removing day-to-day supervision of the commercial banks, he left the Bank, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) pointed out, blind in one eye as to what the Government broker was up to, and blind in the other as to what was going on with the clearing banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09031897000010">It was the Prime Minister who set up the tripartite system of regulation between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA, with no one ultimately taking responsibility when the economy began to unravel with the collapse of Northern Rock. Indeed, in his Mansion house speech of 16 June 2004, he said:</p>
<a name="90318-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09031897001166"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want us to do even more to encourage...risk takers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09031897000011">On that policy, he was certainly successful. As we heard, he sold gold at the bottom of the market, at an average price of $275 per ounce, when its price subsequently rose to almost $1,000 an ounce, costing the public purse &#163;5 billion. He also abolished tax benefits that pension funds had gained from advance corporation tax, costing pensioners &#163;5 billion a year and diminishing the value of personal savings by more than &#163;100 billion. His tax credits system is in tatters, with more than two thirds of recipients receiving the wrong amount at one point. There have been &#163;5.8 billion of overpayments, with &#163;500 million written off so far and another &#163;1.5 billion unlikely to be recovered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09031897000012">In the meantime, debt ballooned. While the Prime Minister sought to maintain his golden rule of keeping net debt at about 40 per cent. of GDP, he put more and more debt off balance sheet so that by the time I wrote my pamphlet &#147;The Price of Irresponsibility&#148; for the Centre for Policy Studies last October he was hiding &#163;2 off balance sheet for every &#163;1 that he was keeping on balance sheet. Not surprisingly, he become known as the Enron Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09031897000013">Today, the situation is even worse. If public sector pension liabilities and private finance initiative schemes are added to the on-balance sheet debt of recently nationalised banks, total debt today is not the &#163;700 billion that the Government acknowledge, but as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham indicated, a whopping &#163;4.6 trillion. In other words, it is not 40 per cent. of GDP or even 48 per cent., as the figure of &#163;700 billion implies, but almost 300 per cent. That is about &#163;200,000 for every household in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90318-0019.htm_para31"><a name="09031897000014">According to some estimates, it will take us until 2030 to bring the debt to GDP ratio back to 40 per cent. That is the Prime Minister&#146;s legacy to our children and our children&#146;s children. Yet in October 2008 he said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09031897000016">What is the Government&#146;s solution? The VAT cut cost &#163;12 billion, and in the words of President Sarkozy it has &#147;absolutely not worked&#148;. The Monetary Policy Committee has cut interest rates to a record low without benefits being passed on to businesses and borrowers. I learned in a recent meeting with the Essex branch of the Federation of Small Businesses that many businesses are having either facilities withdrawn or spreads widened. A case in point is an automotive parts manufacturer in my constituency that has a &#163;2 million loan outstanding. Notwithstanding the economic climate, it is still generating &#163;2 million a year of cash flow, yet an internal decision taken at its bank that automotive loans should be withdrawn has meant that a perfectly healthy business is facing closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09031897000017">The banks are not reciprocating taxpayers&#146; continued trust and investment in them by maintaining support for perfectly healthy businesses in my constituency, in Essex and up and down the country. The Government have made a number of headline-grabbing proposals, including those noted in the motion: the working capital scheme, the national internships scheme, the asset-backed securities guarantee scheme, the homeowners mortgage support scheme, the car manufacturers finance guarantee and so on. None of them has yet been implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09031897000018">In the meantime, by scrapping the 10p tax rate the Government are hurting some of the lowest-paid in our country. The problem is compounded by the record low interest rates, which are hurting millions of pensioners up and down the country, some of whom are receiving 0.1 per cent. interest on their savings accounts. Only two years ago, in a speech on 11 May 2007, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="90318-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="09031897001168"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If you work hard, you&#146;re better off. If you save, you&#146;re rewarded. If you play by the rules, we&#146;ll stand by you.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09031897000019">However, in all their proposals the Government are doing absolutely nothing for those who have been thrifty and saved all their lives, especially pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09031897000020">On 21 March 2007, again only two years ago, during his Budget statement the now Prime Minister reiterated his mantra that we would never</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09031897000021">Yet today we face one of the worst budget deficits in living memory, record borrowing both on and off balance sheet, a collapse in sterling, unemployment breaking the 2 million barrier&#151;as the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) acknowledged, it is likely to climb to 3 million&#151;and an economy shrinking both this year and next at a rate greater than almost any other western economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09031897000022">Still the Prime Minister refuses to acknowledge that if he is not the cause of the collapse of UK plc, he is its architect. For that, at least, he should come to the House and apologise to the British people for taking Britain from boom to bust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09031897000024">The debate has been interesting. I was at school in the early 1970s, when there had been a liberalisation of credit and a property boom. In 1973, 1974 and 1975, we had a bust. The difference was that the Bank of England created a lifeboat so that Slater Walker was wound  <br>

down, along with several other banks and institutions. I think we had a problem with Burmah Oil, which ran out of cash and lost its shares in British Petroleum to the Government, who bailed it out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09031897000025">The crisis was similar, but the difference was that the Bank of England knew what was going on, got money together and sorted out the banking system in a few years. The changes that the Prime Minister made when he was Chancellor to the independence of the Bank of England have made a difference to our regulatory regime. Had the Bank of England retained its former role, I cannot conceive of being where we are today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09031897000026">Having said that, the City is a vast institution and we have some sophisticated banks. Our country rather depended on our property values and there were imbalances in the world economy, in which many countries generated too much in savings but Britain did not save enough. Savings flowed into our British economy and our banking system used them to sustain a property boom. Inevitably, the bust followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09031897000027">To be fair, no one could foresee that the billions of pounds in the wholesale money markets would disappear as quickly as they did. If one is honest, one must recognise that that has probably caused an unprecedented problem. However, it has always been clear that that sort of money is hot money and that, in the long term, the most sustainable form of investment in the economy is savings and people putting money in banks in an old-fashioned way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09031897000028">There is now a massive hole in the British economy, which must somehow be plugged. It means a major adjustment to housing prices&#151;the sooner that occurs, the better, so that the market can start to function normally again. Sterling has been devalued, and although I have mixed feelings about it, we can say, &#147;Thank God we&#146;re not in the euro,&#148; because it means that the British Government can use economic and monetary policy by reducing interest rates and, to some extent, letting the currency take the strain. We also have the automatic stabilisers and the modest economic stimulus that the Government introduced, although I am not sure that the latter will make much difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09031897000029">Three things have caused a major problem. First, as the crisis has unfolded, the Government have been behind the curve because they have come back with progressively bigger bail-outs and further help for the financial system. That has knocked confidence because people do not know where it will end and there have been a few surprises. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) set out what happened in Sweden, where everybody had to come clean to ascertain the damage at the beginning of a crisis. That would have been a far better way of dealing with the damage to our financial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09031897000030">Secondly, although many of the Government&#146;s announcements have been broadly welcomed, it is a fair criticism that the detail was not worked out before the announcements were made. There has been a tendency to try to get headlines in the newspapers. Even when the schemes have been worked out, many people in the banking system and various other parts of the economy are not always aware of the detail. Many bemused businesses and constituents who have read about schemes in the newspapers have approached me to ask, &#147;What&#146;s going on? Can we get it?&#148; There is genuine confusion.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 1006</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09031897000031">Not only do more details need to be worked out, but there has to be more collaboration with the financial system and a system for disseminating information. In times gone past, benefits have been advertised in order to increase take-up among people. The Government ought to consider advertising as a means of getting across the message about where people can access schemes. The Minister has talked about a website; perhaps advertising the website would be a way of getting that message across. When people are in need and they think that some help is out there but cannot find out where it is, that tends to cause confusion and make them feel rather dispirited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09031897000032">Thirdly, the Government have to give a clear lead about where we are going. It does not help that at each stage of the economic crisis the Government have tended to go for a rosy scenario. The last full Budget was a &#147;hope for the best&#148; Budget. The growth figures in the pre-Budget report looked unrealistic even then, and they will need to be revised. The economic situation is deteriorating, but that was always likely to be the case. We will have a new Budget in April which will contain even more red ink detailing the Government deficit and Government debt, and the predictions of growth will probably be downgraded again. That knocks confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09031897000033">My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), who made the first speech that we heard this afternoon, put his finger on the main problem, which is the fact that the banks have had a bail-out but have been given mixed messages about what to do. We all have evidence that ordinary banking involving making loans to companies&#151;many of them viable and profitable companies&#151;is not occurring. There is a credit crunch in the British economy that is having an effect on businesses that are long-term and viable, but which face real problems in the short term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09031897000034">The Government have to iron out their version of the relevant scheme to try to get money moving in the economy. I have been in business for most of my life&#151;I have a background in construction and property&#151;and I have never known a situation like this. It is dire out there. Many people are hanging on by their fingernails. We need clear leadership from the Government about where they are going and clear information about the schemes that they are promoting, because we are going through a very difficult time indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09031897000035">We have had the financial shock and now we have the shock of the recession, with many people losing their jobs. However, levels of personal debt are substantially higher today than they were in the early &#146;90s. That means that if people&#146;s incomes are diminished, it does not take very long for them to get into serious financial problems, even with the help that is available through the various schemes. That will eventually create a problem for the banking system, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09031897000036">We are in for tough times. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton that our economy might be configured very differently at the end of this recession and that we may look at things differently. We have to use our good offices to resist protectionism, which is a cul-de-sac, but we also have to get our banking system working properly, otherwise the long-term consequences and the damage to the social and economic fabric of our nation will be dire.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), who made a powerful speech about the issues that affect people. I was particularly taken by his remarks about the pound. The pound has gone down from $2.11 to $1.35, which represents other countries&#146; views of how bad our economy is. However, we are talking about a market mechanism that has worked well, because it means that our exports are now cheaper in America. American imports are more expensive in this country, which is also the market working. However, as my hon. Friend said, that would not have happened if we had been in the eurozone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09031897000038">I refer Members to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests, and particularly to the fact that I am a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09031897000039">I have learned a lot from sitting here for several hours today. The speeches from both sides of the House have been useful, new ideas have come up, and things that I had not thought of have been mentioned. I find it disappointing, however&#151;I say this with sadness&#151;that the Chancellor was not here today. It is also particularly disappointing that we have not had a debate on the economy in Government time. All these billions of pounds have been spent without the issue being discussed in detail in the Chamber. I want to say to the junior Minister that I think it unfortunate that the Chancellor was unable to attend. I notice that he was here for Prime Minister questions, but I am sure that he had a pressing engagement in a television studio somewhere in the country afterwards. I am making a serious point about what I see as a discourtesy to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09031897000040">I want to turn first to unemployment. I have run a manufacturing company and a service company, and the most difficult thing that I ever had to do in business was to tell people who had worked for me for years that they no longer had a job. I had sleepless nights beforehand, and sleepless nights afterwards. It was the worst thing that I ever had to do in business, so it gives me no pleasure at all to read out these figures. In February 1997, there were 2,063 people unemployed and claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance in Wellingborough. Unfortunately, the figure today is 3,098. That represents a 50 per cent. increase since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09031897000041">I recall that the Conservatives were thrown out of power in 1997 on a landslide, partly because of what had happened in the economy. I think that we have now reached a desperate situation in my constituency, and I say that with no satisfaction. We face a real problem. Thinking back to that rather nice little tune, &#147;Things can only get better&#148;, I can tell hon. Members that they certainly have not done so in Wellingborough. We are significantly worse off than we were in 1997, and I fear that that situation is spreading across the rest of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09031897000042">I recently received a phone call from the managing director of a large employer in my constituency.

It is a very good, well-established company that employs a lot of people, but, like everyone else, its orders have gone down because of the downturn in the  <br>

economy. So what did one of the banks that we now own do? It went along to that company and said, &#147;By the way, because your level of interest to turnover has fallen below a figure that we don&#146;t like, we are going to increase the interest on your borrowings by 2.5 per cent., or &#163;750,000, a year.&#148; That could force this very good company either to lay off staff or to go under. That cannot be&#151;I know that it is not&#151;what the Government intended the banks to do, but that is what is happening in Wellingborough now, and it worries me greatly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09031897000043">One of the reasons that that is happening, in general terms, is that the banks had two options. One was to lend money to companies; the other was to get their capital ratios up by reducing such lending. The banks have gone for the latter incentive to improve their capital ratios. There is a strong argument for the Government giving a lead in the other direction on this. We cannot ask the banks to do both; it has to be one or the other, and they need some direction. I shall come back to the banks later if I have time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09031897000044">I want to talk about the business of bringing forward capital projects to increase employment. I see that as a very good idea. If capital projects could be brought forward, we would get the benefit of employment as well as a capital asset at the end of the day, which seems perfectly reasonable to me. In Wellingborough, however, we have a very strange situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09031897000045">The further education college was given the go-ahead for a major redevelopment and it spent &#163;1 million just getting it all arranged. Unfortunately, this major redevelopment also means knocking down the existing premises, moving on to a car park and allowing for the whole redevelopment of the town centre in Wellingborough. The go-ahead was supposed to be given on 17 December, but when 17 December came, no go-ahead was given. It was supposed to come last week, but the same thing happened again. We are told that the reason for the delay is that a Government quango had said to too many colleges that they could expand, so they have been left without the funds. Well, if now is not the time to bring forward funding for FE colleges, I do not know when is. I ask the Minister to address that. The Government said, quite logically, that something was going to happen, but it has certainly not happened in my patch&#151;indeed, just the reverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09031897000046">On the theme of bringing forward capital projects, it does not seem to be happening in the NHS. My constituency is seeing the closure of an out-patient facility. In fact, a quarter of the people in Rushden wrote to me to complain about the closure, but the replacement facility, which is in another constituency, is not going ahead; there is a delay. That new facility could go ahead in my constituency right now; the land and plans are available, so why is it not being done?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90318-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09031897000047">Let me deal with an issue where I think the Government have made a complete mess of investment in the banks. They have gone into the mode of saying, &#147;We must do something; we must do something. We must get a press release out; it does not matter what it is, but we must get a press release out.&#148; I do not expect the Minister to nod in agreement, but I am sure that some wise heads in the Treasury were saying that the schemes must not be announced until they are place. However, I also bet that some spin doctors were saying, &#147;We must get it out; we must get it out&#148;. I think that is what has happened.</p>

I know that it has ballooned into billions and billions more, but if we go back to that initial &#163;37 billion, the share subscription documents that the Government drew up must have been drawn up on the back of an envelope. They produced preference shares and we were led to believe that that was how this would go forward&#151;with a 12 per cent. coupon, non-cumulative, that was going to be redeemable after five years.

 The country is facing its biggest economic crisis in a generation. In the last 24 hours, we have heard from the International Monetary Fund not only that Britain&#146;s recession is deeper than that of any other western country, but that next year, while they will be growing, we will still be shrinking. We have seen unemployment figures rising at the fastest monthly rate since the 1930s, topping the 2 million mark. According to many commentators&#151;indeed, according to the hon.

Against that backdrop, we have had to debate the economy in Opposition time&#151;and we are debating it without the Chancellor, who cannot even be bothered to turn up to defend himself and his boss, and his own policies, and respond to the momentous economic news that we have heard today, although he was in the Chamber for Prime Minister&#146;s questions not 10 minutes before this debate began&#151;so much for the Prime Minister&#146;s commitment to restoring the supremacy of Parliament.

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09031897000056">We called today&#146;s debate because people throughout Britain who face redundancy, short-time working, layoffs, pay cuts, business failures, negative equity and repossessions cannot understand why Parliament is not debating the economic crisis all day, every day&#151;never mind why it has not debated it this year. &#147;Real help now&#148; is the slogan, and I have a copy here of the glossy brochure that the Government have produced to promote it. But we have heard from Members this afternoon how hollow that slogan is, and it is clearly not a piece of rhetoric that the Chancellor is prepared to come here to defend. Nevertheless, I have to say&#151;perhaps the Exchequer Secretary will convey this to the Chancellor&#151;that even without him we have had a useful debate. Let me now mention just some of the important issues that have been raised in the course of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09031897000057">The shadow Chancellor, my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), set the tone with a forceful case against the Government, along with a devastating analysis of Labour&#146;s failure to prepare the British economy for the problems that we now face and its continued failure to address those problems once they were upon us. Some of my hon. Friends offered specific examples of the failure of the Government&#146;s announced programmes to deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09031897000058">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made the important point that there is a distinction to be drawn between the institutional implementation of a programme and that programme&#146;s delivery of results at the sharp end. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) gave examples of constituents to whom the loan guarantee schemes were simply not available. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) of the inability of a constituent of his to access an announced career development loan, and, perhaps even more worrying, the unawareness of his local jobcentre staff of that scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09031897000059">My hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick) gave an example of a denial by banks of access to one of the guarantee schemes for a company in his constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) told us just how patchy knowledge and awareness of those schemes is, not just among jobcentre staff but among businesses. That point has been reinforced by the director general of the CBI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09031897000060">I think it was my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson)&#151;although he is a relatively new Member, he obviously has the knack of seeing right through the issues&#151;who identified the problem, which is the Government&#146;s instinct to announce first and work it out later. His point was reinforced by the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), who said that when something is announced it must be available. I hope that those on her party&#146;s Front Bench will take that message on board. She went on to explain the disappointment, confusion, dismay, anger and frustration caused when schemes that are supposed to be available are simply not there. That confusion, particularly in relation to help in the job and housing markets, adds to the loss of confidence, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) pointed out, is so important at a time like this. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) reminded the House that Keynes himself came to recognise the critical role of  <br>

confidence in an economic recovery. The recovery of confidence is, as a number of hon. Members pointed out, a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition for economic recovery and must be a principal focus of the Government&#146;s attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09031897000061">Several hon. Members focused on the underlying problems in the banking system. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden drew attention to the very different models of Japan and Sweden, and the banking crises they had both suffered. He noted that the Government appear to be following the Japanese model of fiscal loosening while failing to get to grips with the problems in the financial system, and to be shying away from the Swedish response, which was ultimately successful. He offered a credible explanation for that choice: the Swedish route, of recognising the problems in the banks up front and taking them explicitly on to the balance sheet and dealing with them, requires some tough decision making, while the Japanese approach pushes the problem down the line to be dealt with and paid for later on. We all know that this Government&#146;s inclination is to push problems down the line&#151;certainly beyond May 2010&#151;even if that gives rise to the risk of zombie banks being created, as my right hon. Friend suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09031897000062">My right hon. Friend and a number of other Members referred to the challenge of defining the limits of taxpayer responsibility for banks in future, whether by some Glass-Steagall type approach or by other means. There was general consensus that the taxpayer will not in future be prepared to stand behind the kind of behaviour we have seen in the investment arms of banks. We will have to find a way forward&#151;looking at the Turner report and the recommendations of Sir James Sassoon to the shadow Chancellor&#151;to build a new structure that will protect the taxpayer while allowing a banking system to operate for the benefit of the real economy in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09031897000063">My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) reminded us of the flimsy basis on which the Prime Minister&#146;s reputation for financial management was built. His great coup of the Bank of England reform of 1997 is now exposed as having delivered a dysfunctional regulatory system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) said, the problems we are now facing began on the first day of this Labour Government, when the now Prime Minister crossed the threshold of No. 11 Downing street. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe reminded us&#151;contrary to what some Labour Members suggested&#151;how he and others were warning in November 1997 that this undermining of the Bank of England would create &#147;a field day&#148; for &#147;spivs and crooks&#148;. Again, in 2002, 2003 and 2004, when he categorised the then Chancellor&#146;s Budget as a &#147;credit-card Budget&#148;, he&#151;and others&#151;were warning of the hollowness of an economic model that built an economy on the sand of excess debt. The truth is that my right hon. and learned Friend and other hon. Friends have been consistently warning about the risks the then Chancellor was running with the economy, and they have been consistently ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09031897000064">Several Members referred to the confusion in Government policy towards the banks&#151;on the one hand urging greater lending, on the other hand urging them to rebuild their balance sheets. Several Members also gave examples of banks that do not appear to have received the message from head office of the deal that the Chancellor and Prime Minister tell us they have done on extending lending to businesses that need support. This problem urgently needs resolving if the measures that the Government have taken are to deliver a freeing-up of lending at the sharp end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09031897000065">There were a couple of interesting speeches made by those on the Labour Benches. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) used the D-word about this recession&#151;I am sure that he will get a note about that later from the Whips. He accused the Conservatives of not being prepared to face up to what he called the &#147;new economic situation&#148;. I should say to him that it is precisely because we are facing up to the fact that the challenges that the economy faces are on a scale not seen before and that the changes we will see in it require a sea change in our thinking that we have resisted signing up to the easy consensus being offered by Labour Members. We have insisted on taking on the chin the really difficult challenges that have to be dealt with. It is he and his colleagues who are not prepared to face up to the fact that their Government did not prepare the United Kingdom to be able to withstand this downturn&#151;they are the ones who are guilty of gross negligence and dereliction of duty in preparing the UK for the problems it faces today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09031897000066">Anyone listening to this debate would recognise that there have been massive failures of Government policy, both in the decade to 2007 and in the Government&#146;s response to the crisis since. I do not know where the Chief Secretary to the Treasury stands on the issue of apologies, but her boss and her husband have given one, yet the Prime Minister still insists on saying that he has &#147;nothing to apologise for&#148;&#151;that is how the British people will remember him. He will be remembered as the Prime Minister who brought destruction upon the economy, but who says that he has nothing to apologise for&#151;not the failure of his regulatory system, which contributed to the global crisis in the first place; not his failure to manage our public finances, which meant that we went into this recession less well prepared than any other major economy; not his hubristic claim to have abolished boom and bust, which led many people to borrow money they could not afford, a decision that they regret now and will regret for the rest of their lives; not his grandstanding abroad when he should have been fixing the problems at home; and not his endless stream of ineffectual announcements, which are still not delivering today for the businesses and the households of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09031897000067">A Prime Minister who implemented a financial regulation system that has failed so catastrophically, who operated a model of economic growth based on unsustainable public debt, unsustainable global imbalances and unsustainable household debt and who cannot acknowledge those failures, even now, cannot be part of the solution. He is the problem, he is the past, and the sooner we move on to the future, the better for Britain.</p>

mention a few of the contributions that I have enjoyed listening to this afternoon. First, I should mention the one made by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson). He pointed out the untenable Conservative position of calling the Government response to the current conditions inadequate, while being against the Government&#146;s spending, which is needed to pay for any action at all. The speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) recognised the really difficult times for people and businesses that the current conditions we are battling are causing us to have to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09031897000069">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) and my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon) gave us a critique of neo-liberalism and, in some cases, a timely analysis of the problems of inequality. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) cited Galbraith&#146;s statement about where the wise got their wisdom, but pointed out that the Tories are not ideologically comfortable with the direction that is needed to get us through the current problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) made an extremely good speech, talking passionately about the unfavourable consequences of the Conservative do nothing approach to the recession of the 1980s and 1990s, contrasting that with the Government&#146;s action so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09031897000070">The main themes of the speeches by Opposition Members can be summed up in two words. Many Opposition Members, including the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and the hon. Members for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#146;Brien) and for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), talked about the need to restore confidence. If they wish to restore confidence, why do they go around scaremongering about levels of debt? Why do they talk down the British economy and emphasise the negatives, rather than help us battle the serious problems that we face?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09031897000071">Other Opposition Members talked about how the problems here were caused by the Bank of England and the creation of the tripartite arrangements, but that has not had anything to do with the global recession that we now face. In fact, the problems of the global credit crunch have been manifested in every country, despite very different styles of financial regulation. Clearly, there are lessons to be learned, and Lord Turner has talked about some of those in the publication of his report today, which the Chancellor requested last October. The problems are deeper, as Lord Turner pointed out, and include the complex financial engineering that was going on, and the global imbalances between saving and spending, which manifested themselves in low-priced credit. All those issues have to be solved if we are to create a sustainable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para15"><a name="09031897000072">This debate has demonstrated the real differences that we have with the Conservatives over how to tackle the unprecedented economic challenge that we now face. The Conservatives like to insist that somehow the downturn we are now experiencing is all the fault of our domestic policy. In fact, the credit crunch began in the American sub-prime mortgage market. As it has reverberated around the world, we have seen a noticeable deterioration in global economic prospects. In the last quarter of 2008, the world economy shrank for the first  <br>

time since 1945. The IMF now expects global growth to be negative in 2009. That will be the first global contraction for more than 60 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para16"><a name="09031897000073">The battle to end this global financial crisis and return the world to sustainable growth demands new ways of thinking and new ways of acting, both domestically and internationally. There are three priorities. First, the global economy is interconnected, so we can succeed only if we work together. Secondly, we need to stimulate demand and, thirdly, we must reform both regulation and international financial institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para17"><a name="09031897000074">Whether the Tories like it or not, the fact is that the problems we are facing are shared across an interconnected world. It is only by acting together that we can tackle them effectively. That is why the G20 conference is so important. Our national action will be more effective if it is accompanied by globally co-ordinated responses. That is especially true of boosting demand and reforming regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para18"><a name="09031897000075">What have we heard from the Conservatives to match the scale of the task that we face? The need for major changes to our systems of financial services regulation is obvious&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para23"><a name="09031897000084">The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) expressed similar concerns. Four years later the then shadow Chancellor, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), announced that an incoming Tory Government would abolish or rein in the FSA because of its &#147;intrusive regulatory regime&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para24"><a name="09031897000085">In March last year, in the middle of the credit crunch, the Leader of the Opposition was still at it when he said:</p>

 Does my hon. Friend find it strange that the Conservatives in opposition now castigate the Government for proposing to double the national debt in the light of the worst world recession since 1946, yet the previous Conservative Government doubled the national debt when there was not such a deep world recession at all? They were the profligate ones, whereas we have had to pick up the pieces and pay down some of that national debt.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para26"><a name="09031897000089">Are the Conservatives in favour of boosting demand to give real help now, just when it is needed, at the beginning of a recession? No, they are not. They are alone in the world in proposing huge spending cuts. They would repeat the mistakes of the past. They would take us back to the 1930s by weakening demand just when it needs to be strengthened. They have proposed to cut &#163;5 billion from current spending plans by April this year. That is two weeks from now. Two days ago, the Leader of the Opposition was saying that Labour&#146;s determination to support demand and protect real people from the effects of the downturn was unaffordable. He said, &#147;Does that mean some areas will be cut? Yes it does.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90318-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09031897000090">The Tories also opposed the &#163;20 billion injection of demand into the economy that we announced at the pre-Budget report. That means that based on the policies that they have announced&#151;we have heard precious little of most of them&#151;they would take &#163;25 billion of spending out of our economy just as the recession is at its worst. They would let this recession take its course, whereas with real help now we have ensured that 12 million pensioners have received a &#163;60 extra payment since January to support them at this difficult time&#151;the Tories, however, are opposed to it.</p>

 I am grateful for this opportunity to raise the question of the proposed eco-town at Ford, which would lie in my constituency, and also, should it be given the go-ahead, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). It is a proposal for 5,000 new houses, and the size of that development means that the settlement would dwarf any of the existing settlements in my very rural constituency of Arundel and South Downs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09031897001116">I have three key concerns about this proposal, which are widely shared by the local community and by the elected local authorities. These concerns are: the impact on the countryside and the rural character of the area; whether we have adequate infrastructure to support development on this scale; and the democratic issue&#151;whether there is consent on the matter, whether people are being properly consulted and who should decide where development should go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09031897001117">First, I shall talk about the impact on the countryside. I do not know whether the Minister has been to this part of the world, but Ford is a tiny village that lies in the Arun valley, below Arundel, which is a stunning location sited on the edge of the south downs. The Ford eco-town would be very close to an area of outstanding natural beauty and potentially a national park if the Government were to give it the go-ahead. Were an eco-town, effectively a new town of 5,000 houses, to be located at that site, it would clearly dwarf the existing hamlet of Ford and effectively join up small villages including Yapton and Climping. It would create what would amount to a new sprawl of development that would not just include the eco-town itself but begin to join the existing villages. At a stroke, open countryside would have been transformed into a suburban setting. That is unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09031897001118">I was also immensely concerned by how the developers sought to promote the development by arguing in their initial literature that it would be on a brownfield site. Yes, an airfield forms part of the site, but in fact 87 per cent. of the construction would be on greenfield land. The Government&#146;s own sustainability appraisal identified a number of key weaknesses in the Ford eco-town proposal, including the fact that the site is almost entirely greenfield and that there would be building on high-grade agricultural land&#151;at a time, by the way, when we should probably be increasing food production in our country and worried about food security. The appraisal also stated that</p>
<a name="90318-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="09031897001179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;although the area is not designated there is still a potential to change the setting and character of local villages&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09031897001119">such as those that I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09031897001120">The flood risk also needs to be addressed, and the Government acknowledged that, too, as a key weakness in their sustainability appraisal. The appraisal acknowledges that as a coastal area, Arun district is</p>
<a name="90318-0022.htm_brev7"><a name="09031897001180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;likely to experience some of the most severe impacts due to climate change&#148;,</p>
</ul><br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 1026</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09031897001121">and that there is a particular risk to ground water supplies. In an era when we have to be concerned about climate change, those should be serious concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09031897001122">The second category of objections that I wish to raise are those related to infrastructure. The developers originally told us that they would be able to spend &#163;200 million on improving local infrastructure, of which, I should emphasise, we already have a significant deficit. We have very congested roads, including the A27, which is meant to be a coastal highway but is in fact a coastal car park. It is congested at key times, which I believe contributes significantly to the relative deprivation of Littlehampton and other coastal areas. Frankly, despite their proximity to London, the poor transport links of those areas have made them unable to share in the economic gains that other areas in the south-east have made in recent decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09031897001123">It is that absence of adequate infrastructure, even with the current level of housing, that is of particular concern to local authorities. Clearly an additional 5,000 houses would create a huge challenge, for instance through the additional cars on the roads, even if it is supposed that a proportion of those cars would not be used because of the nature of the eco-town proposal. I make no general comment on eco-towns; I am making site-specific objections to the Ford proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09031897001124">The reality is that even in a city such as Brighton two thirds of households use cars, and that is in a city that is reputed to have exceptionally low car use. In my rural constituency there is 85 to 90 per cent. car ownership, and those who do not have cars are significantly disadvantaged. They cannot get about in rural West Sussex, even if they live in villages that are served by railway stations. I do not believe that the existence of a railway station at Ford&#151;there is a question about whether it needs to be moved&#151;is adequate mitigation against the loss of access that people would suffer if a new town were sited in the middle of the countryside, from where it is frankly unrealistic to expect them to be able to get around except by car. That is a major flaw in this particular scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para15"><a name="09031897001125">The Arundel bypass has been awaited for decades. At one stage, it was about to be put in the Government&#146;s programme, but it is now a distant prospect, which will not even start until 2016. According to West Sussex county council, the indications are that the bypass is being pushed back, not forwards. There is a genuine question about whether the eco-town would be viable without a bypass around Arundel, given all the additional traffic that it would generate. There is also a conflict between the Government&#146;s advisers, who said that it would be wrong to build a bypass, and the developers, who originally said that one would and should be built and that they would provide money for it. Now they say that the eco-town does not depend on the bypass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90318-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09031897001126">It is impossible to conceive of siting a new settlement of 5,000 people without that upgrade in the key local road. It would mean major traffic congestion in the villages and in Arundel. That is a severe flaw in the scheme. Will the Government tell us whether plans for the Arundel bypass will be brought forward as part of the proposal for the eco-town?</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/debtext/90318-0023.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para0"><a name="09031897001127">There is a further discrepancy in some of the developers&#146; infrastructure promises. They say that they will produce a waste facility, but it will clearly rely on importing enormous amounts of waste from outside the proposed new settlement. The sustainability of that is questionable.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 1027</b><br>
Where will the waste come from? The proposal is out of kilter with West Sussex county council&#146;s existing programme. It has invested massively in a new waste treatment plant in the north of the county, to which the county&#146;s household and municipal waste will be taken. Another flaw therefore lies at the heart of the proposal. Lorry movements into the eco-town will pose a significant challenge to the concept of an environmentally friendly development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09031897001128">Let me deal with the democratic problem. The Government have effectively said that 11,500 houses are to be built in the Arun district in the next 20 years and that figure was recently increased. It is a huge number for a rural district to absorb. We can argue about whether it is a proper number&#151;my view is that it is an unsustainably large number of houses to seek to build in the district without creating major implications for infrastructure and the rural character of the area. Nevertheless, if that number of houses is to be accommodated because the Government say so, the local authority should decide where they are located. Arun district council has the knowledge and experience and can assess local opinion to make the difficult decisions about where the houses should be. There is a further question about whether eco-town numbers would add to the 11,500 or be subtracted from them. We cannot get a clear answer from the Government, and I should be grateful if the Minister felt able to provide one this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09031897001129">There is huge public concern about the proposal. Thousands of people have marched and 10,000 have signed a petition to oppose the plans. The relevant local councils, all the parish councils, Arundel town council, the county council and, above all, Arun district council, oppose the scheme. Arun has to consult about it now as part of its local development framework process, but it initially expressed opposition to an eco-town. It should decide where development goes&#151;I do not believe that it should be imposed on local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09031897001130">I should be grateful if the Minister agreed to meet my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) and me to discuss those issues before any decision is made. I hope that she will understand that the local concern about the issue is very great indeed. I fear that a significant part of my constituency is about to be irrevocably transformed, and I cannot overestimate to the right hon. Lady the seriousness of the issue or how it is regarded locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09031897001131">I would be very grateful if the right hon. Lady would agree to meet us. Indeed, we have written to ask whether that would be possible. However, I made an error in writing to her in omitting to mention that we briefly met the former Minister for Housing, the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), which was most welcome. She made a brief visit down to the constituency, but we would nevertheless be extremely grateful if the current Minister for Housing agreed to meet us to discuss our concerns, in particular those about the latest assessment of the scheme&#146;s financial viability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09031897001132">I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to raise those concerns about the proposed development on behalf of almost every constituent who has written to me. There has been near unanimous opposition to the scheme. That is what I wish to relay to the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o403"><a name="09031897001133"><a name="90318-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="09031897002214"><b>Mr. Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) for securing this debate and for setting out the concerns about the proposed Ford eco-town so well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09031897001134">There is almost unanimous opposition to the proposal to build 5,000 homes on a pristine piece of Sussex countryside that links the beautiful historic town of Arundel to the River Arun and the spectacular marinas and beaches of the seaside town of Littlehampton in my constituency. People are angry about the proposal because it takes a top-down approach to planning, as my hon. Friend said, that completely circumvents the planning processes and the views and experience of local people and elected councillors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para7"><a name="09031897001135">The draft planning policy statement breaks precedent by being site-specific, instead of setting out general principles. As the chairman of the South East England regional assembly has said:</p>
<a name="90318-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="09031897001181"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The principle and location of eco-towns should be considered through normal development plan process, and the PPS and Eco-towns Programme should not supersede or over-ride local and regional plan-making.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para8"><a name="09031897001136">It is also clear from the sustainability appraisal that a development at Ford will be far from ecologically friendly or sustainable. In particular, it is clear to anyone living in that part of West Sussex that life without a car is extremely difficult, as my hon. Friend set out so well. The proposals are vague about how people could live at Ford without a car. We already suffer from an incomplete A27, which turns into a single-carriageway around Arundel and Worthing, frequently creating traffic congestion at points during the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para9"><a name="09031897001137">Arun district council has conducted two thorough select committee inquiries into the proposals. Among its many conclusions, the council has said that</p>
<a name="90318-0023.htm_brev1"><a name="09031897001182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;without a by-pass for Arundel, major development in this location would cause significant congestion on the strategic and local highway network, and the Council does not accept that car reduction measures would be sufficient to mitigate this impact acceptably&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para10"><a name="09031897001138">Similarly, the A259, which runs from east to west in my constituency, is already congested for long periods at peak times. Cars from 5,000 houses would simply compound that problem. There is also a lack of clarity about whether the small railway station at Ford will be moved west and about whether it will have parking for 500 cars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para11"><a name="09031897001139">Clearly some people will make money by turning agricultural land worth &#163;4,000 an acre into building land worth &#163;1 million an acre. As my hon. Friend said, 87 per cent. of the land is pristine, high-quality agricultural land. Even with that cash, however, we do not believe that it will be possible to deliver the three new schools, the social housing, the water recycling, the energy system, the new roads, the new bypass or the bunding for the river to protect against flooding that appear to have been promised at one time or another in this process. The financial viability study concluded at page 34 that</p>
<a name="90318-0023.htm_brev2"><a name="09031897001183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there are material uncertainties over the nature and cost of transport solutions required to meet Highways Agency requirements, small movements in the cost of which could adversely impact the viability of this proposal.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para12"><a name="09031897001140">People in my constituency are not nimbies. We understand the need for new housing, but in numbers and in locations that are sensitive to the environment in which we live and which are based on decisions taken locally by elected councillors sensitive to the views of the people whom they represent and sensitive to the fact that tourism is still a large employer in Littlehampton and Bognor Regis. That particular stretch of countryside is key to the beauty of the area and the attractiveness of both seaside towns for tourists. As the select committee concluded:</p>
<a name="90318-0023.htm_brev3"><a name="09031897001184"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Eco-Town would have a significant and damaging impact on the existing community, and would result in a substantial adverse change in the character of the District and this part of the coastal plain.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para13"><a name="09031897001141">A campaign has sprung up, entitled Communities Against the Ford Eco-town&#151;CAFE&#151;and my hon. Friend and I have been involved in it since the beginning. It has been highly effective in analysing the developers&#146; proposals, the Government&#146;s planning policy statement and sustainability appraisal, and the financial viability study. On behalf of the whole community, I should like to thank Derek Waller, Terry Knott, Vicky Newman, Tom Sawyer and Susan West, among others, for the fantastic job that they have done in revealing all the many flaws in the proposals for an eco-town at Ford. The Minister&#146;s time would be well spent if she personally read their submissions and, as a consequence, dropped Ford from the list of eco-towns.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) on securing this debate, and I welcome the opportunity that it offers to set the record straight on a number of the points that he has raised. I should also say at the outset that I have received his request for a meeting with him and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), and I am happy to agree to that. I hope that that will give us an opportunity to explore these matters in continuing depth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para14"><a name="09031897001143">First, I want to remind the House of the general principles behind eco-towns, before I turn to the specifics of the Ford proposal. By now, everyone should be familiar with the long-term need for more housing in the country. The most recent projections, produced only a few days ago by the UK statistics authority, serve only to underline and reinforce that case. The number of households is now predicted to grow to 27.8 million by 2031&#151;an increase of 6.3 million even over the 2006 estimates. The House regularly debates the impact of the pressure on housing; we are all familiar with its effects. Families are unable to find suitable, affordable housing; young people are unable to take their first step on to the property ladder. We are also familiar with the need to build housing that responds to, and helps to, reduce the impact of climate change. Our housing currently makes up about a quarter of the UK&#146;s carbon emissions. That fact gets less publicity than some of the more glamorous venues, but it is infinitely more significant, particularly at the present time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para15"><a name="09031897001144">There is no single answer to any of these challenges. We will need co-ordinated efforts to increase supply and to raise standards for all new housing. Although there is no single answer, we can accelerate innovation and  <br>

promote best practice through exemplar projects such as eco-towns, showing what is possible and what is achievable. Eco-towns are just one of the options that local authorities can choose to adopt when planning to meet the challenges in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para16"><a name="09031897001145">As my predecessors and I have repeatedly made clear, we are absolutely determined that only the best proposals will ultimately be taken forward. We have put in place a process for scrutinising and consulting on the proposals, and it is designed to be fair, rigorous and transparent. As requested, we have recently extended still further the deadline for consultation until 30 April, to give people even more chance to have their say. The intention is that the first eco-towns will be taken from drawing board to development over the next couple of years, with more to follow and up to 10 under development by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para17"><a name="09031897001146">Before I turn to the specifics of the Ford proposal, I want to make it very clear indeed that absolutely nothing that I say here tonight should be taken as any indication of the likely outcome for the proposal, or as pre-empting the shortlist. And of course, even were Ford or any of the proposals to make the final shortlist, they would still be subject to further testing through the planning process. That seems to be an aspect of the handling of this issue that is little understood. Ford is just one of a number of locations being considered for development of an eco-town. It is present in my mind, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you have an interest in another of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para18"><a name="09031897001147">The proposal at Ford is for 5,000 homes, including 2,000 affordable homes, and it also proposes creating around 4,000 jobs, along with schools, green spaces, community and sports facilities. Such a proposal has the potential to make a significant contribution in an area where the shortage of affordable housing is particularly acute. In 2007-08, just 53 affordable housing units were completed in West Sussex&#151;an increase, I might add, on 2006-07, but it is nowhere near adequate to meet local need.</p>

<p><a name="st_o405"><a name="09031897001148"><a name="90318-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="09031897002216"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 When we meet, I will explain in detail why those figures are not correct, but the Minister should also know that, although the current recession is delaying them, 1,350 houses are waiting to be built, of which 40 per cent. will be social housing. That makes a significant contribution to people in the A, B and C categories on the Arun district housing waiting list.</p>

<p><a name="st_o406"><a name="09031897001149"><a name="90318-0023.htm_spnew2"><a name="09031897002217"><b>Margaret Beckett:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I have always been a strong believer in evidence-based policy making, so I will look very closely at any evidence he puts before me. I recognise that Arun district council has recently made progress in developing its core strategy and, as both hon. Gentlemen will know, an eco-town is just one of the options being proposed and now consulted on for the area. The alternatives up for discussion are sustainable urban extensions or, indeed, expansion of inland villages. This process of consultation should help the local authority to determine the best solution to meet local need. I hope that both hon. Gentlemen will continue to challenge the authority to maintain the momentum to build on recent progress and start to deliver results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09031897001150">Both hon. Gentlemen asserted a number of reasons why Ford would be an unsuitable site for an eco-town. I note those concerns: these are, of course, the very issues that this process of consultation and scrutiny is designed  <br>

to draw out. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned, the sustainable appraisal of the site has highlighted similar issues, particularly potential congestion on the surrounding road networks, but also the use of greenfield land and potential concerns about flooding. The sustainability appraisal also noted the potential strengths of the area, including the facts that there would be minimal impact on the local ecology and that the nearby railway station could expand to cope with increased demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para20"><a name="09031897001151">Overall, Ford, like the majority of locations so far put forward, has been assessed as in category B&#151;it might be suitable, subject to meeting specific planning and design objectives. It might be helpful for the sake of clarity if I said here that the concerns and objectives that have to be met differ with each set of proposals. But whatever they are, they have to be met with each set of proposals. The very point of this whole process is to evaluate all the evidence to make an informed decision, highlighting the weaknesses so that developers have a chance to address them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para21"><a name="09031897001152">We have always been clear that we are setting the standards very high and that not all the proposals will be successful. The sustainability appraisal, the consultation feedback, and a financial viability study will all help to inform decisions on the shortlist of locations that will be taken forward. I anticipate that that would be the start of the eco-towns programme, rather than the definitive list because I expect that, over time, more such proposals will come forward through the local and regional planning process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para22"><a name="09031897001153">Let me touch on two of the more general points that have been made: the suggestion that there has been a lack of consultation, and the suggestion that there has been an attempt to undermine the planning process. Neither of those assertions has any basis in fact. As I have said, we recently extended the consultation programme, and these proposals are absolutely not about imposing development on local communities. On the contrary, we take the view that it is vital for residents to have every opportunity to have their say, including those most in need of affordable housing, whose voices may be drowned out by a vocal and active opposition. We are making clear what is being proposed, and asking for views on the overall programme and the individual standards being set.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90318-0023.htm_para23"><a name="09031897001154">Let me repeat that all proposals that make the shortlist will still need to be tested through the existing planning process, and that that in itself offers a further opportunity for consultation and debate.

the judge noted that the Government had acted properly throughout, and dismissed the review on all grounds, saying</p>
<a name="90318-0023.htm_brev4"><a name="09031897001185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the government is using, rather than outflanking, the planning system. This process would not necessarily compel the grant of planning permission for a location on the list.&#148;</p>

 I am conscious of the time, and I want to raise one more issue on which the hon. Gentleman specifically asked me to comment. If local authorities include an eco-town in their future housing plans, they can be assured that that will count towards future housing targets, which in many places are likely to be more stretching.</p>

I am encouraged by the information from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that other proposals are being considered, because such development is very necessary. It is not enough for people to reject the eco-town proposal out of hand. If it proves not to be the right answer, constructive alternative proposals will be needed.</p>
