<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51206-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 The north-west of the county is currently served by rail services operated by the Central Trains and Midland Mainline franchises. In October, we announced a new structure of rail franchises, to be implemented following the expiry of the current franchises. Services will then be provided by a new unified East Midlands franchise.

<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51206-01_spnew0"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 The Burton-upon-Trent to Leicester route, including the third oldest rail line in England, runs through the heart of the national forest, crosses three counties, links two regions and serves Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Coalville in my constituency. Since Beeching killed off passenger services, our area has been transformed economically, socially and environmentally and there is huge support for the return of passenger rail services. Can the Minister indicate how a local community can proceed in the light of the fact that the county council&#039;s support has cooled dramatically since political control changed in 2001? Perhaps he could include me in the consultation on the successor franchise to which he has referred.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51206-01_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I am happy to commit to ensuring that my hon. Friend and other local MPs are included in the consultation on the new franchise. There are two routes by which a case can be made to return services to that line. One is to go back to the local council and convince it to include it in the local transport plan. The other is to have it included as a priced option when the franchise is let in a couple of years. The local community needs to proceed on either basis.

<br>&nbsp;<br>makes it difficult for people to come to London, for example, to see a show and get back to Wellingborough or Leicestershire. Can he use his good offices to encourage Midland Mainline to change its view?

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51206-01_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 We will certainly relay the hon. Gentleman&#039;s views to the operator, but I understand that the changes were made in response to passenger loading.

 (Lab/Co-op): I join my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) in wanting to see passenger services extended in north-west Leicestershire, as we achieved for the service from Leicester to Loughborough. Is the Minister aware that the future of the Ivanhoe line, which is part of the package to which my hon. Friend referred, will be in danger if Leicester city council, which has also changed political control, decides to withdraw its &#163;400,000 subsidy to that service? Is not that a retrograde step when we are trying to increase passenger use, particularly on local trains and local runs, to reduce congestion both in Loughborough and in Leicester?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51206-01_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 My understanding is that the city council has decided to withdraw its funding from the scheme, which I am sure local people will take into account when the council comes up for re-election. Continued support for the line now depends on the view of the county. We are still waiting to hear whether it wishes to continue to support that line.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51206-01_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Central Trains franchise is changing anyway. Whenever franchises change and are re-let, there is widespread consultation and the franchise process takes into account issues such as further expansion in the area. Again, it will be for the hon.

<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51206-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Ms Karen Buck): </b> 
 In introducing regional funding allocations for transport, housing and economic development, we asked regions to provide us with advice by January 2006 on their regional priorities. We are aware that some regions have elected to establish regional transport forums to assist their work, but the structure and tasks assigned to such bodies is a matter for individual regions to decide.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51206-01_spnew8"><b> Dr. Pugh: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her answer. In just a few weeks, the regional transport boards, controlled by the Government offices, will submit what are virtually 10-year regional transport plans, prioritise millions of pounds of expenditure, disappoint many, but affect every community, business and council, with minimal consultation and limited democratic debate and feedback. Is such haste wise or necessary, and will not it produce divisive or poor outcomes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51206-01_spnew9"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I am sorry to hear from the hon. Gentleman that he is not happy with the consultation. We took the decision not to impose a particular model of consultation on the regions, but as this is likely to be the way of the future it is important that regions make the best use of their consultation options, whether with businesses or communities. When we come to consider the plans again next spring, we will examine the matter carefully. We will want to see that they have demonstrated robust consultation processes.

<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51206-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister ensure when cross-examining those regional bodies that they have come forward with projects that can tackle, at least cost and in the best way, the underlying problem of shortage of capacity of all kinds in our transport system? I would rather she were consulting elected local government but, given that she is going to do it in that way, will she ensure that those bodies are asked the right questions and come forward with bottleneck-reducing schemes, particularly ones that can be privately financed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51206-01_spnew11"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 That is absolutely central to what those forums should be doing. We are asking them not just to look at their transport priorities&#151;it will indeed be a question of setting priorities; there is never enough money to cover everything that everyone wants to achieve&#151;but for the first time in this process to balance transport investment with housing and economic development, rather than taking investment decisions in silos, as they have done in the past. This is the first time that we have taken such an approach, but it is the future and I expect it to be built on as the years go by.

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51206-01_spmin2"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 The Department for Transport is developing a local transport note on traffic calming, and updating its code of practice on consultation with emergency services when traffic calming measures are proposed. Both documents will include references to road humps and are planned for publication early next year.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51206-01_spnew12"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 I am delighted that new guidance is coming out, but will the Minister ensure that it deals with motorbikes&#039; ability to go through the middle of concrete cushion road humps, on-street parking on such humps and whether emergency service vehicles such as the Nottinghamshire fire engine can straddle them?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51206-01_spnew13"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I can certainly reassure the House that those issues will be taken into consideration when we prepare the guidance because my hon. Friend has been invited to be a consultee in that process, and he has doubtless made these very valuable points to the team putting the guidance together. I should point out, however, that no one set of traffic calming measures is right in every location; some will work and some will not, depending on the particular circumstances. It is important that local highways engineers make local decisions and pick the right traffic calming measure for the local area.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51206-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk)</b> 
 (Con): I agree with the Minister that such decisions should be up to local engineers. Is he aware, however, that although some traffic calming schemes in my constituency have been a great success, other sets of road humps have been a failure and have given rise to collateral damage such as property subsidence? What advice can he give to local residents who have had problems with property subsidence and who want those road humps if not removed, then at least reconfigured?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51206-01_spnew15"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The only advice that I can give is for the hon. Gentleman to work with local highways authorities to ensure that they get feedback on these matters and that the collateral damage, as he describes it, is known to them. It is perfectly possible for authorities to redesign an area once traffic calming has been shown not to work; that has happened in my constituency and it doubtless happens in many others. People such as the hon. Gentleman can campaign to ensure that local highways authorities remove such traffic calming measures if they are not working.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51206-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton)</b> 
 (Con): May I commend the Department for Transport on supporting English Heritage and the Campaign to Protect Rural England in their efforts to improve streetscape and the design of traffic calming measures such as road humps? In particular, I commend the document entitled &quot;Streets for All.&quot; Streetscape is a very important environmental issue, but the trouble is that the Department&#039;s good intentions in encouraging better design and reducing street clutter never get followed through because there is no funding incentive. Moreover, the Audit Commission and the local government ombudsman say that this issue has nothing to do with them. What financial incentives, along with guidance, is the Minister prepared to instigate so that councils throughout the country will try to improve our streetscape environment&#151;speed humps, street clutter and everything else&#151;and not just let things deteriorate, as they are currently doing?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51206-01_spnew17"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support for the Department&#039;s initiatives and I agree that streetscape is important. We should try to reduce clutter wherever possible, and when doing so ensure that that is compatible with road safety, which, as he will doubtless agree, has to be the No. 1 priority. There may well not be the financial incentives that he is looking for, but there are plenty of other incentives to encourage local authorities to act, not least of which is the local electoral process. If local authorities are not being responsive to this matter, they will not get re-elected.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51206-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Ms Karen Buck): </b> 
 Free off-peak local bus travel in England for people aged 60 and over and disabled people will come into effect on 1 April 2006. The necessary order was laid in Parliament on 28 November. The Government are providing an extra &#163;350 million in revenue support grant for 2006&#150;07, which will be sufficient to fund the cost to local authorities.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51206-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hepburn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will know that the metro makes up a substantial part of the transport system in Tyne and Wear and is used by thousands of pensioners. While I welcome the news of extra finance, there will still be a substantial deficit in Tyne and Wear after the provision of free travel for pensioners. Can she review that decision?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51206-02_spnew1"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I am conscious of the representations that Nexus has made on that issue. The &#163;350 million provided by the Chancellor is to fund free off-peak bus travel and it is a generous boost to bus travel. It is up to local authorities to make the decision to make any additional provision for other transport modes or to extend the scheme in other ways. I am afraid that I cannot give my hon.

<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51206-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean)</b> 
 (Con): Welcome though the scheme is, one problem in areas such as mine is that many constituents wish to travel to towns, to shop or visit friends, across district and national boundaries, and that limits the benefit of the scheme. The local authority, although it may wish to extend the scheme, may simply not have the resources. What help can the Minister provide?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51206-02_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The idea of a fully national concessionary scheme is attractive, but it would cost an extra &#163;160 million. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that his party is committed to providing that extra sum, perhaps he could advise us of that. Transport competes for priority in public expenditure with other services and, at the moment, we are working on the &#163;350 million investment in bus travel that I have mentioned.

The South Yorkshire passenger transport executive has now informed us that First South Yorkshire is not willing to sign up to the previously agreed deal to fund the concessionary travel scheme. What advice can my hon. Friend offer to the South Yorkshire passenger transport executive to correct that unsatisfactory situation?

<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="51206-02_spnew5"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I am aware that in these processes some robust negotiation usually takes place between the bus companies and the local authorities about the concessions. The Government are funding bus services overall by almost &#163;1 billion and providing an additional boost of &#163;350 million. Inevitably, service levels across the country will vary, but I hope that that investment will be welcomed on both sides of the House as a major step forward in providing concessionary transport to an important and vulnerable constituency.

 (Con): In constituencies like mine, community transport run by charities&#151;such as those in Bakewell and Eyam, Ashbourne and Amber Valley&#151;provides a valuable and essential service for older people. What arrangements are being made for those services to benefit from the scheme?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="51206-02_spnew7"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 It is for local authorities to decide, according to their resources, whether to invest in other forms of transport, be that community transport schemes or token schemes, which can be more applicable to rural areas. Some local authorities, such as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Jeff Ennis), already fund the concessionary scheme above the present level. Local authorities across the country are taking decisions to meet the needs of the local communities in different ways, and they will have to decide how to use the money that was announced by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government yesterday.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="51206-02_spnew9"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I do not accept that the sum available will create that shortfall. The &#163;350 million that my right hon.

It is always inevitable in the development of any formula that there is a risk that not every authority will be satisfied. We consulted with the Local Government Association about the formula and amended it to weight it more heavily towards the uptake of concessionary transport, and in so doing we went a long way to meet the concerns of Nexus, which we appreciate has a particular problem.

She has confirmed that today in answer to questions from both sides of the House. She also said that people using dial-a-ride and community bus schemes may have to pay, too, unless local councils

</p>





<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="51206-02_spnew11"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I absolutely refute what the hon. Gentleman says. Since the announcement was made in the Budget, it has been clear that the concession extends and builds on the existing scheme, which is free off-peak travel for pensioners within their local authority area. That has never differed, and it has been raised on a number of occasions in the House and outside&#151;it builds on the existing scheme. To create a national scheme would require primary legislation and, as I said earlier, an additional &#163;160 million. I confirm to the hon. Gentleman that the concession that was announced builds on the provision that I have outlined.

 The hon. Gentleman should tell us what arrangements his party has made to extend the scheme. It is a very generous extension to concessionary transport and builds on the existing scheme, which is for local transport. That is consistent with the announcement that my right hon. Friend made at the time of the Budget. It is consistent with the form of words that we have used throughout. At present, local half-price transport on buses is available to pensioners and people with disabilities and we are putting in an extra &#163;350 million to take that up to a full concession.

 As I said at the last Question Time, I am aware of the problems in relation to capacity at Manchester&#039;s Piccadilly station, particularly in relation to some of the train services. Network Rail is looking at those. Part of the problem is that we are dealing with a network in that part of Manchester that was essentially built by the Victorians and does not lend itself that easily to being expanded without quite major engineering works, but we want more people to use the trains&#151;indeed, more people are using trains now than at any time since the second world war&#151;and Network Rail is aware of that and is doing what it can to build on capacity.

 I would write to the SRA except that I abolished it, so I do not actually think that a letter would achieve the purpose that the hon. Gentleman hopes to achieve. However, I certainly agree with him that out-of-town railway stations can play an important part in attracting people to drive there, leave their car and take the train for the rest of the journey. I said at the start that there is no predisposition in favour of one type of station or another; each one needs to be looked at on its merits, and anything that encourages people to use the train must be a good thing.

 The policy framework for developing airport capacity to 2030 was set out in the White Paper that we published in December 2003.

In particular, have they discussed the possible expansion of Heathrow with a third runway?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="51206-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Yes, of course, those Departments have because the White Paper that was published two years ago was an expression of Government policy, and therefore represents the Government&#039;s collective view. It is patently obvious that both of those Departments&#151;the Treasury, in particular&#151;take a great interest in all matters that might involve public expenditure one way or another. The White Paper sets out a measured, balanced development strategy, which takes into account not only environmental considerations but, crucially, the fact that we must have airports that will allow people to travel to different parts of this country and the world because that is essential for our future economic development.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="51206-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to suggest that we should encourage people to use the most environmentally efficient way to travel if we can. Let me give an example that is a bit further away from the city that both of us represent. Now that the west coast main line has been upgraded at a cost of &#163;7.5 billion, the journey time on the train service between Manchester and London is just over two hours, and it is extremely efficient and probably a better way to get to London than going out to the airport and flying down. So that is a very good example.

However, I certainly agree with my hon. Friend that we ought to encourage people to travel in a way that causes the least possible damage to the environment, although I draw his attention to the fact that any form of transport&#151;high-speed rail links included&#151;has an environmental consequence. High-speed railway lines draw a substantial amount of energy when people are travelling on them.

Which of those two chapters did the Secretary of State co-author? Why, for the eighth year running, have the Government refused to make aviation pay its full environmental costs?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="51206-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman perfectly well knows, the taxation of aviation fuel is governed by international treaty and it is not open to any country to take unilateral action in that respect. I am sure that he will have noticed that last week, because of pressure brought to bear by the UK Government, the European Union has now signed up to including aviation in a EU-wide emissions trading scheme, which will go a long way to reduce emission. As I said just a few moments ago, the White Paper on aviation, which we published a couple of years ago, not only sought to strike a balance to ensure that people could fly to different parts of the country and the world, but was very conscious of our environmental obligations. The problem with the Liberal Democrats is that they are in favour of people flying, but they are against the means to enable them to do so.

 (Con): Is the Secretary of State aware that one of the effects of the   Government&#039;s airports policy is to encourage the development of Nottingham East Midlands airport as a national air freight hub? The development clearly brings economic benefits to both the businesses that use air freight services and the people who work in the airport, which is welcome. However, does he acknowledge that one of the effects of growing air freight activity at the airport has been an increase in night-flights activity, which has resulted in environmental burdens for the surrounding community? Would it not be right for a Government who are encouraging the development of air freight activity at Nottingham East Midlands airport for entirely understandable reasons also to accept responsibility for regulating the environmental impact by introducing a designation of the airport? The Government would thus accept responsibility for the environmental impact of the decisions that they are taking.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="51206-03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman puts his case extremely reasonably. He is absolutely right that there is a tension between the development of Nottingham East Midlands airport, which of course brings huge economic benefit to the area as well as benefit to people who want to travel, and the fact that air freight almost necessarily involves night flights, which have noise associated with them. There was quite a discussion about that last Question Time. The Government are conscious of the matter and we will do everything that we can to try to mitigate the situation and put the right controls in place to ensure that noise is kept to a minimum. However, as the right hon. Gentleman recognises, the airport itself brings a lot of benefit to the area. We are trying to tread a fine line between the development of the airport and ensuring that we protect the well-being of people who live nearby.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="51206-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the Department and Network Rail to examine electrifying the line between Leeds and the east coast. There have been improvements at Grantham to cut down the number of delays of trains coming from Skegness and the east coast. King&#039;s Cross station is due to be developed further to allow for greater capacity, and much further north, the Scottish Executive plan to enlarge Edinburgh Waverley station. On top of that, I except that further improvements will be made to ensure that the line, which is one of the main arterial railway routes in the country, can carry more and more passengers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="51206-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool)</b> 
 (Lab): One improvement we could make to increase capacity is to introduce better planning and management of timetables. The present timetabling arrangements act as a block to alternative providers on the east coast such as Grand Central, which wishes to provide a direct rail service from Sunderland through Hartlepool to London. What steps will my right hon. Friend take to scrutinise timetabling arrangements to free up capacity?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="51206-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 First of all, long, bitter experience after privatisation tells us that timetabling must be realistic. There have been far too many cases, especially following privatisation in the mid-1990s, in which too many services were put on to a network that could not sustain them, with the result that there were more delays. We had to take action to try to ensure that timetables are more realistic. Secondly, the Government have to take a view on the effect that new operators on the east coast main line have on the passenger loadings of existing services, and the subsequent effect on any subsidy that is payable or, alternatively, the premium payments to Government. Grand Central railways has submitted an application to the rail regulator, and it is his job to decide whether it can gain that access. I understand that he is likely to make his decision in February next year.

<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="51206-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am very impressed by my colleague&#039;s new-found enthusiasm for competition on the railways, as it has not always been evident. Hull Trains is the only example of an open access operator running services between Hull and King&#039;s Cross. That service is extremely popular, and when we published our White Paper on rail development we said that we hoped that it would continue. However, it should be borne in mind that GNER will pay a great deal of money to the Department, which will thus be available for investment in the railways. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright), we would have to pay regard to the impact of any new operator on the amount of money coming into the railways. The railways need to

 We chose 5 per cent. because at that level the fuel can be supplied to the existing fleet of cars, without any alterations being made.

The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster takes responsibility on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen as patron, either solely or jointly, of 42 Church livings. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also presents suitable candidates to the bishop of the diocese and has power over ancient livings. I have been informed that there are two such livings in Leicestershire&#151;one in Whitwick and one in Thringstone. The living in Thringstone is currently vacant, and I will do all that I can in conjunction with my ministerial colleagues to suggest that a suitable candidate is sitting on the Back Benches.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="51206-05_spnew8"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I am glad that the sole incumbent of the Cabinet Office believes that the ancient livings patronage is in good hands. Does he believe that consideration by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster of matters such as patronage might interfere with other duties, such as control and responsibility for the Civil Contingencies Secretariat? Might not people in this country be rather surprised that nobody has been in charge of emergency planning during what we are told is a war on terrorism for nearly five weeks?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="51206-05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 That point was made recently in another place. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat is closely monitored and works in partnership with Ministers across Government. The Home Secretary is the lead Minister responsible for a lot of the responses to emergency crises and contingencies. I shall take this opportunity to thank those involved in that secretariat for their fantastic work with Ministers across Government.

<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="51206-06_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Cabinet Office  (Mr. Jim Murphy): </b> 
 The Hampton report is a central part of the Government&#039;s better regulation agenda. Good progress has been made on implementation. The timetable for change set out in Philip Hampton&#039;s report will be met.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="51206-06_spnew0"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 I welcome the Government&#039;s commitment to cut the number of inspection agencies from 31 to seven&#151;11 to four in the public sector. However, can the Minister answer this question, which Philip Hampton posed but never got an answer to: how many forms are circulating in public sector agencies which private individuals and companies have to fill in?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="51206-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for asking the most helpful question so far. He is right to talk about the reduction in the number of inspectors and regulators that the Government are determined to achieve. The reason why no answer can be given by Mr. Hampton and others is that no one in Government has known in the past or knows today. That is why we launched the administrative burden inquiry that is continuing to identify the level of bureaucratic burden across Government. Once we have done that, we will set ambitious targets for annual reductions. We will have more to report on that in due course.

 (Lab/Co-op): Later today, we shall discuss the London Olympics Bill. Does my hon. Friend agree that the lessons of Hampton should be extended to the sports world? Will he ensure that when money is paid through Government agencies for, in particular, grass-roots sport, the burden is lifted so that people&#151;especially volunteers&#151;can deliver the services that we want rather than having to spend their time filling up forms and dealing with unnecessary bureaucracy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="51206-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is, of course, right. We were elected on the same day, and in the seven or eight years since then he has continued, in a dogged and determined way, to champion local and national sport. That is, quite properly, recognised in his constituency. He is also on the ball, if I may put it like that, when it comes to the regulation of charities and voluntary and public sector organisations. It is important to lighten the load&#151;the bureaucratic burden&#151;and to reduce duplication, not just in the private sector but in the voluntary and charity sectors, and among those who are working on the 2012 Olympic plan.

Will the Minister promise us that when the Government do get around to implementing the recommendations for a reduction in the number of agencies, they will not just carry out a shuffle and a merger but will cut the costs, cut the regulations and cut the forms?

<a name="time_0">
<a name="51206-06_time0"><h5>3.34 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51206-06_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on benefits uprating in the context of the Government&#039;s continued fight against poverty and our ambitious programme to renew the welfare and pensions systems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_0">I shall place full details of the uprating in the Vote Office and arrange for the figures to be published in the <i>Official Report</i>. I can confirm that most national insurance benefits will rise by the retail prices index, which is 2.7 per cent., and that most income-related benefits will be uprated by Rossi, at 2.2 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_1">From next April, retirement pension will go up by &#163;2.20 a week for single pensioners and by &#163;3.55 a week for couples. When we were elected, the pension was just &#163;62.45 for a single person. From April, it will be &#163;84.25 for a single person and &#163;134.75 for couples. That is a real-terms rise of 8 per cent. since 1997. Next year, the guarantee credit of pension credit will rise in line with earnings, so that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;114.05 a week and no couple on less than &#163;174.05 a week. The threshold for the savings element of pension credit will be uprated so that it remains equal to the basic state pension. That means that a typical single pensioner will now gain from pension credit with an income of up to &#163;158.75 a week, while a typical couple will gain on income of up to &#163;233 a week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_2">Nearly 3.3 million pensioners are now in receipt of pension credit, with an average weekly award of around &#163;43. We are reaching more people and ensuring that they get their entitlements. Following the introduction of pension credit, about 2 million pensioner households now qualify for more help, or qualify for help for the first time, with their council tax or rent. From this week, pensioners can make a single phone call to claim all three: pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. That will be a very welcome simplification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_3">By targeting resources at the least well-off pensioners, we have succeeded in lifting nearly 2 million pensioners out of absolute poverty since 1997. We now spend an extra &#163;11 billion a year on pensioners, with almost half of the extra spending going to the least well-off third. Had we simply increased the basic state pension in line with earnings, only just over a quarter of that extra spending would have gone to the least well-off third, who would have been &#163;30 a week worse off than they are under these measures. On average, pensioner households are now &#163;1,400 a year, or &#163;27 a week, better off in real terms than they would have been under the 1997 system, with the least well-off third of households &#163;1,900 a year, or &#163;37 a week, better off in real terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_4">As well as tackling the dreadful legacy of pensioner poverty that we inherited, we have also helped all pensioners and will continue to do so. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor confirmed yesterday that the winter fuel payment would be &#163;200 for every year of this Parliament. He also announced that he would be setting aside an additional &#163;300 million over the next three years, so that the Government&#039;s warm front programme can offer pensioner households on pension credit free installation of central heating, and all other pensioner households without central heating a contribution of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 742</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;300 towards the cost of installing it. He also announced further help with the cost of insulation. I believe that the whole House will welcome those announcements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_5">We have now reached the unprecedented position in which pensioners are no more likely to be poor than any other group in society. That is a particularly remarkable achievement after a period in which earnings have grown so fast, thanks to the stability and steady growth that we have enjoyed in the economy since 1997. We need now to introduce further reform to ensure that our pensions system continues to deliver for future generations of pensioners, as it is doing for today&#039;s. So we warmly welcome the broad framework of the Pensions Commission&#039;s proposals and options, which were published last week. We believe that they will provide the right basis for building the consensus that we need, but there is still a great deal to be discussed and debated about the detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_6">Yesterday, I issued a challenge to the pensions industry. It believes that it can produce an industry-led model that will meet the Turner objective of enabling everyone to save for a pension at low cost, while outperforming the one proposed in the report. I have therefore asked the industry to work up the details of its alternative approach by early February, ahead of a joint national pensions debate event between industry and Government, when those proposals can be closely examined. In the same way, as we embark on a major new consultation exercise involving every section of our community, we shall scrutinise the commission proposals and options, debating the best ways to achieve the objectives that the commission set out and to deliver a lasting pensions settlement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_7">If we are to meet the challenges of an ageing society and permanently eradicate poverty in retirement, we also need to address the inequalities during people&#039;s working lives. That is why our record in tackling child poverty is so important. It is why we are committed to supporting families in work, why our welfare reforms and our aspiration for an 80 per cent. employment rate are so important, and why we want to see a modern, active and inclusive welfare state. We have lifted more than half a million children out of relative low income since 1997. Twenty million people, including just over 10 million children, are benefiting from tax credits, and the child tax credit, which will also increase by earnings, is benefiting 6 million families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_8">The standard rate of maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay will be increased by the RPI to &#163;108.85 a week. Whereas in 1997 the maximum maternity pay and child benefit payment for mothers at home with their first baby was just &#163;2,610 for the first year, by 2007 it will rise to &#163;8,300&#151;a real-terms increase of more than &#163;5,000. In addition, the Work and Families Bill, which received its Second Reading yesterday, introduces a new entitlement to statutory paternity pay to enable a father to take time off work and to receive statutory pay instead of his partner if she returns to work early. That gives parents greater choice in how they balance their work and caring responsibilities in the first year of their child&#039;s life. For the sixth successive year, we are freezing non-dependent deductions to relieve the pressure on low-income parents who are accommodating their adult children.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 743</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_9">Work is the best route out of poverty. There are now more people in jobs in Britain than ever before&#151;2.3 million more than in 1997. Unemployment is at its lowest for nearly 30 years, with long-term youth unemployment 90 per cent. lower than in 1997. In just 12 months, employment has risen by 330,000 to 28.8 million, and is the highest in the country&#039;s history. It has risen in every region and nation of the UK. The lone parent employment rate has increased by 11 percentage points since 1997, and nearly 1 million lone parents are now in work, while the number on income support has fallen by more than 200,000 since 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_10">As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said yesterday, we are not going to abolish the new deal; we will strengthen it. We will offer learning agreements for teenagers in eight areas of the country, extend the new deal pilots to help lone parents back to work, and pilot personal action plans for those unemployed for six months or more. Our new deal for disabled people has seen nearly 75,000 job entries since its launch in 2001, with 200,000 disabled people helped into work through our total package of new deal programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_11">We are seeing very encouraging early results from the pathways to work pilots. In the first year of those, the number of recorded job entries for people with a health condition or disability almost doubled compared with the same period the year before. Their continued success has driven a significant rise in the proportion of customers leaving incapacity benefit in the first six months of their claim, compared with non-pilot areas. Overall, on a national basis, that early success would be      equivalent to something in the region of 150,000 incapacity benefit claimants being helped into work each year. That success has underpinned our achievements in helping people off incapacity benefit, with new cases now down a third since 1997 and the first falls in the total count, which fell by 41,000 in the year to May 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_12">In March, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 completed the most far-reaching programme of disability rights legislation that any European country has put in place. It fulfilled our manifesto commitment to deliver enforceable and comprehensive civil rights for disabled people, and is a major landmark in enabling disabled people to live independently, fully recognised and respected as equal members of society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para16">
<a name="stpa_13">Last week, on the international day for disabled people, we launched the new Office for Disability Issues. From this week, the Disability Discrimination Act extended protection from discrimination to another 250,000 people. However, we are not stopping there. In January, our Welfare Reform Green Paper will go further in tackling exclusion from economic activity and independence across the working-age population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-06_para17">
<a name="stpa_14">In April, we shall take further steps to break down the barriers that face older workers. The radical tax simplification that comes into play on A-day will do much to help. The Pensions Act 2004 continues to improve the rewards for those who choose to delay taking their state pension&#151;even for only a short period&#151;and, in April, the first people will benefit from the new option of a lump sum for state pension deferral, which could be worth more than &#163;5,000.

<a name="stpa_15">In the spring, our White Paper will seek to lay the basis for a consensus on a lasting pensions settlement. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor also announced yesterday a change to the treatment of charitable, voluntary and personal injury income payments in income-related benefits. They are already disregarded in pension credit and pension-age housing benefit and council tax benefit. To simplify the system further and encourage the work of charities, they will be disregarded from October next year in assessing all eligibility for income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance. There will also be a 52-week grace period for lump sum personal injury payments when assessing entitlement to income support, jobseeker&#039;s allowance and working-age housing benefit and council tax benefit.

By 2050, that proportion will have risen to more than 70 per cent. Yet there are still 1.7 million pensioners entitled to pension credit who are not claiming it.

We know that the take-up for other benefits, such as council tax benefit, is even more lamentable.

Has not that benefit proved itself to be extremely effective in channelling help to our poorest pensioners? Is not the problem one of long-term sustainability rather than non-take-up? One cannot run a free society by budgeting for 75 per cent. of pensioners being on means tests, and one is unlikely to get elected if it costs 13p on the standard rate of tax to deliver that benefit. Does not that make his comment about consulting about the Turner commission report that much more important? While every hon.

Does he agree that, whatever the Chancellor may have said in advance of Lord Turner&#039;s report, it would be unthinkable for a Labour Government to break the link between the pension credit and earnings? Will he confirm that continued uprating of the credit in line with earnings over the long term is shown by the Treasury to be a reasonable assumption in the table on page 39 of the long-term public finance report published yesterday? Does he therefore agree that Lord Turner&#039;s proposals represent an affordable alternative to the progressive expansion of means-testing? As the right hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Obviously, you know that Foreign Affairs questions are due to be answered after the recess, on 10 January. There is a great deal of concern among many people, including hon. Members, about the possibility&#151;indeed, the reports&#151;that the United States is using UK facilities to transport terror suspects around the country. There are also allegations about interrogation centres, or torture centres, in various parts of Europe, although reports do not state that they are located in Britain. It would be useful if, before we break for the Christmas recess, the Foreign Secretary came to the Chamber to make a statement and answer questions.

<a name="51206-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_58">May I make a final point to you, Mr. Speaker? I am not allowed, as you know, to refer to any internal House of Commons matter, but I thought that, when the procedure changed a few years ago, the wish was that it should be possible broadly to raise topical and urgent matters on the Floor of the House pretty promptly. As matters stand, the Foreign Secretary is not due to answer questions until 10 January. Such things are reported widely in newspapers and on television and radio, yet we cannot discuss them in the House of Commons.

 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s experience goes back a long way. In fact, he and I first came into the House on the same day. He will know that private notice questions are now called urgent questions, but the granting of such questions remains at the Speaker&#039;s discretion. Of course, I will not go into why I refused him an urgent question. Given his vast experience as a parliamentarian, he knows that, if he wishes to bring the Foreign Secretary or an Under-Secretary before the House, he can apply for an Adjournment debate. That would be a nice way of doing things. Again, the Speaker has some discretion in those matters, and there is a very fair ballot indeed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_60">When I first sought a date to introduce the Bill, I did not realise that it would follow so quickly after the excellent Pensions Commission report. I was understandably nervous that my fox might be shot before today arrived. In fact, I am confident that the Bill would work effectively to support the Pension Commission&#039;s recommendations. This is not the time to rehearse the detail of Lord Turner&#039;s proposals, but, as everyone now knows, he proposes a sensible balance between tax-funded, state-paid pensions, sufficient to lift most people out of means-testing, and invested pensions.

<a name="stpa_62">through which employers provide more generous contributions than those in the proposed soft compulsion scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_63">The first report of the Pensions Commission showed that good quality employer pension provision is on the decline. It estimated that active membership of defined benefit schemes had fallen by 60 per cent. since 1995. It found that although a quarter of private sector employees were still members of salary-related schemes, only 14 per cent. of new employees were in such schemes. The report concluded:

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_65">Of course, when defined benefit schemes are closed, they are usually replaced by defined contribution schemes of one sort or another. Overall, Turner&#039;s judgment was that membership of employer provision was flat, or perhaps declining. However, it is clear that the average employer contribution to defined schemes is much lower than that to traditional defined benefit or final salary schemes. Employer contributions to defined 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 756</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>benefit schemes were estimated at about 11 to 14 per cent. of salary, whereas such contributions to defined contribution schemes were about 4 to 7 per cent. Despite that downward trend, it is clear that employees with any employer contribution to their scheme are general much better placed than those with none.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_66">We could debate the reasons for the decline in the best quality pensions at some length. There are many factors, and as a former Minister with responsibility for pensions I would have to include among them well-meaning regulation passed by Governments of both parties in response to the fears and concerns of our constituents. However, probably the most important factor is simply the changing nature of the competitive economy. The type of larger company that traditionally provided a good pension scheme is in long-term decline. It might be that the best final salary schemes never made hard, bottom-line economic sense, but such schemes were widely seen as part of companies&#039; corporate social responsibility. By having such schemes, those companies made a significant contribution to not only their own success, but the wider economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_67">Today&#039;s economic environment is much harsher and more globally competitive. Although many employers still understand the mixture of altruistic, paternalistic and self-interested arguments for good pension schemes, they are increasingly likely to be challenged by shareholders and accountants. In a competitive economy, some companies compete for business by cutting pension provision, or not making any provision at all. As always, the worst can drive down the standards of the rest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_68">We will still need good employer provision, even when Turner is implemented. The Pensions Commission report makes it clear that its proposals for state pensions and the soft compulsion of the national pension savings scheme would give average earners pensions of just under half their salary when they retire&#151;and that would be at the older retirement age. If people want to receive traditional benefits such as those from a final salary scheme, or if they want a pension that is big enough to allow them to take early retirement, or a less pressured or part-time job before they get their state pension, they or their employers will need to make additional contributions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_69">If we want to retain the best employer provision that we can, we need to examine new ways to encourage and support good employer provision over and above the minimum that all employers should be required to do. We need to look at ways in which employers can see a clear business case&#151;a clear labour marker advantage&#151;from a good pension scheme. That is precisely what the Bill is intended to do. It aims to make the value of employer pension contributions explicit to potential employees. By doing so, it will give better employers an edge in the labour market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_70">Most people simply do not realise how much a good employer&#039;s pension scheme can add to the value of a job. As a result, the quality of pension provision appears to play little role in determining the attractiveness of an employer to potential employees. However, it should, and this Bill would help to ensure that it did.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 757</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_71">Let us consider a job that would normally be advertised at an average salary of about &#163;24,000 a year. According to Union Pension Services, a good typical final salary scheme is worth an extra &#163;3,400 in employer contributions each year, so the job would be advertised not at &#163;24,000, but at &#163;27,400, which is an increase of 14 per cent. A typical public sector final salary scheme&#151;of course these are now closed to new entrants, but I had to do these calculations on the figures available&#151;is worth about an extra &#163;2,900 in employer contributions, so the job would be advertised at a combined value of &#163;26,900. A typical money purchase scheme is worth an extra &#163;1,200 in employer contributions, so the job would be advertised at a combined value of &#163;25,200. In comparison, a job that paid &#163;24,000 a year where the employee is in the state second pension scheme but receives no additional contribution would be advertised at &#163;24,000. For information purposes, a self-employed person would need to receive about &#163;24,700 a year to gain the same financial benefit as an employee in the state second pension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_72">The Bill is a small practical step that will reward good employers by helping them to recruit and retain staff. It will make sure that the best employers can easily be identified by potential employees. It will also help to guard against the danger of the 3 per cent. employer contribution to the national pension savings scheme proposed by Turner becoming the standard employer contribution, rather than the baseline or a minimum. Any lasting pension reform will require a good deal of consensus across parties and outside the House, so I am pleased that my Bill has cross-party support. I pleased, too, that it has received the support of the National Association of Pension Funds&#151;the leading voice of workplace pension provision in the UK. There are 10 million working people in NAPF member schemes, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">People are becoming more aware of the value of a good pension when it comes to making job decisions. This Bill would help in making those decisions easier.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para15">
<a name="stpa_73">Age Concern, too, has welcomed the Bill and has referred to research from the Labour Research Department showing that more information about company pension schemes was the most common demand from people who have not yet joined a scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-10_para16">
<a name="stpa_74">Of course, the Bill would not place any additional burden on employers. I envisage that a standard actuarial approach would be agreed across the economy and that guidance to employers on the calculation of benefits would be provided each time the scheme is revalued. This is not a revolutionary Bill but it is a small, practical step that would make some improvement to pensions, so I commend it to the House.

 New clause 3 and new schedule 1 are needed to make the transfer of contracts to the Olympic delivery authority a quick and efficient process. In advance of the ODA being set up, the London Development Agency and Transport for London have been driving forward the work to deliver the games. We are grateful for that work, but a complication has developed as those authorities have had to enter into the first major contracts. Once the ODA is set up, those contracts and some of the equipment and people involved will have to be transferred to the ODA&#151;the body that will ultimately deliver the Olympics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_76">Transferring a large number of individual contracts can be a lengthy and costly process. We want to avoid any unnecessary cost or delay. Where the Secretary of State thinks it necessary, the amendments allow for the creation of transfer schemes, which will ensure that contracts are efficiently moved from authorities such as the London Development Agency or Transport for London to the Olympic delivery authority. The Secretary of State may make a scheme if others have not complied with a direction or if their scheme has not been approved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_77">Using transfer schemes means that batches of contracts can be moved, requiring a single negotiation process rather than many individual ones. The Secretary of State will not be able to approve or make a scheme unless she has consulted the person who submitted it, or ought to have submitted it, the ODA and anyone who may be affected by it. She will also have to obtain the consent of the Mayor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_78">Transfer schemes are usual practice when setting up a new public body that takes over specific responsibilities from another public body. For example, the Greater London Authority Act 1999 used a similar process to transfer contracts to the GLA and TFL from predecessor bodies.

I have no doubt that there will be votes on some of the politically contentious issues later this evening, but the Bill&#039;s progress shows how the nation has got behind the Olympic bid.

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_85">Let us be very clear about what is involved here. When a bid was first considered, the Government and the Mayor agreed a funding package of &#163;2.375 billion to help meet the costs of staging the Olympics in London in 2012. That figure was made up of &#163;1.5 billion from the lottery, 50 per cent. of which will come from existing sources and 50 per cent. from the new Olympic lottery games, &#163;250 million from the London Development Agency and &#163;625 million from London council tax payers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51206-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman so early in his speech and thank him for indicating that I support the amendment and the new clause. Will he confirm that in the agreement with the Mayor of London, the &#163;625 million to which the hon. Gentleman has referred was made up of &#163;550 million and a further &#163;75 million, which may be drawn on only if it is necessary do so?
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51206-12_spnew6"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 The Olympic surcharge will start in April 2006, and Londoners will pay between &#163;13.33 for a band A dwelling and &#163;40.00 for band H. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 763</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Some 69 per cent. of Londoners are in bands A to D and they will pay between &#163;13.33 and &#163;20.00, and 31 per cent. will pay between &#163;24.44 and &#163;40.00.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_86">As Conservatives, we entirely support the principle that Londoners should make a contribution to the financing of the games. There are four main reasons for that. London is the host city, so it is likely to benefit most from tourism and promotion; London businesses will undoubtedly benefit enormously; the east end of London will be regenerated; and Londoners will have the world&#039;s greatest sporting event on their doorstep. It is therefore perfectly reasonable that they should make a financial contribution over and above the remainder of the United Kingdom. In short, we accept the figure of &#163;625 million and signed up to it at the time of the bid.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51206-12_spnew7"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is obviously right about his party. He will know that others of us who participated in the same election took the same position. Londoners were very happy to make a contribution over and above that made elsewhere, but they kept asking the question to which the amendment and new clause relate: will it be limited to that amount or open-ended? Unless we made it clear that it should be limited, they were not nearly as enthusiastic.
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51206-12_spnew8"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for those comments. I think that he will reassured by what I am about to say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_87">It is fair to say that although we accepted the &#163;625 million cost right from the outset, we&#151;and, clearly, the Liberal Democrats&#151;have had concerns about the possible effect on London council tax payers. The new tax will simply take the form of a larger levy on council tax bills, so it is not entirely transparent. There is no automatic cut-off after 2012. The extra money is not specifically ring-fenced for the Olympics, in obvious contrast to the congestion charge, where revenue is ring-fenced for value-for-money transport projects. There is no guarantee that the money will not be used to cross-subsidise funding shortfalls elsewhere&#151;for example, if not enough tickets are sold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_88">Those initial concerns have been given further impetus by a number of factors that have become apparent in recent months and that have changed the position substantially since the initial plans for London 2012 were drawn up. First, we now know that previous games have substantially overrun their budgets. Local tax payers in Montreal are still paying off debts incurred at the 1976 Olympics. Sydney&#039;s budget of &#163;l billion eventually came to &#163;2.8 billion. Athens&#039; budget of &#163;l billion eventually became, as far as we know, &#163;5 billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_89">Secondly, security costs are likely to soar post-7 July. There cannot be a single Member of this House here today who genuinely believes that the international security situation will improve in the near future. If anything, it is likely to get worse.
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51206-12_spnew9"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> 
 When the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, on which I served, first considered security, everybody was aware not only of the possible threat in Athens, where British security forces and police played an important role in ensuring 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 764</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the security of the games, but of the fact that there was already a heavy underwriting in terms of security measures. I do not think that, of itself, July this year will have made a significant difference. Does the hon. Gentleman have specific arguments on that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51206-12_spnew10"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 Yes, indeed I do. If one looks around London, it is fairly self-evident that security has been tightened immeasurably since 7 July, and rightly so&#151;every Member would support that. I think that the security allowance in the Bill is &#163;200 million. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.
</p>





<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51206-12_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51206-12_spnew12"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 Given today&#039;s security situation, I cannot see how London can be kept entirely secure within that budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_90">Thirdly, the Mayor has been commendably honest about the fact that his key aim is to regenerate the east end of London. That is not entirely compatible with the Government&#039;s priority of delivering the 2012 Olympics on time and to budget as the best games ever. Those conflicting priorities will inevitably put pressure on the budget. Fourthly, the cost of acquiring land in the lower Lea valley, and therefore of site assembly, has risen substantially since we won the bid on 6 July. Finally, as scrutiny of the financial markets shows, inflation in the construction sector is running at about 7 per cent. as a result of rising energy prices and the increased cost of raw materials. Natural disasters in the USA and Asia, allied to high demand in China, have rendered the original 3 per cent. prediction unworkable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_91">All Members know of the concern already felt by many of their constituents about rising council tax bills. They affect everyone, but particularly the elderly&#151;who have no way of increasing their income to cope&#151;and the vulnerable. We were happy to accept the original &#163;625 million figure, although we had some worries about the lack of accountability. Since the plans were drawn up, however, the five factors that I have listed have led us to believe that Londoners should not be left with an open-ended commitment. Accordingly, I believe that the time has come to introduce a formal mechanism to ensure that Londoners receive a measure of protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_92">Let me end with two pleas. First, I ask all London Members to consider a new clause that simply gives a statutory basis to the Government&#039;s own estimate of the cost of the games to council tax payers, and to support it. If they do not do so, they will risk inflicting a considerable extra bill on their constituents.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51206-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 So far, the hon. Gentleman has told us why London council tax payers should not make a larger contribution. If London council tax payers did not make the contribution, someone else would have to do so. Which of the other funding bodies does the hon. Gentleman think should do it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51206-13_spnew1"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right, but it is difficult for me to give him an answer. Every time we have asked the question, the Minister has said&#151;as I expect him to say in 20 minutes&#039; time; indeed, he told me 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 765</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that he would do so&#151;that the budget for the games was drawn up according to the most advanced formula ever and that there would be no cost overruns. If that is the case, let us flip the argument over&#151;why should there not be a cap?
</p>





<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51206-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Andrew Pelling  (Croydon, Central) (Con):</b> 
 Mary Reilly, chair of the London Development Agency, said in the <i>Financial Times</i> that the estimate of the cost of cleaning the land on which the games would take place had already doubled, which means an increase of hundreds of millions of pounds.
</p>





<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51206-13_spnew3"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 Indeed; Mary Reilly made that point when she appeared before the Select Committee two weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_93">My second plea, on which I have touched already, is to the Minister. Although the new clause has cross-party support, it is perfectly possible that the Bill will be defeated in the other place, which will delay it. We are, after all, simply trying to give the Government&#039;s own calculations a statutory basis. Therefore I do not hesitate to urge the Minister and the House to accept the new clause.
</p>





<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51206-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andy Reed: </b> 
 Having heard what the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) had to say, I have an opportunity to go a little further. I appreciate that many London Members, among others, will have a view on the level of council tax payments to the fund, but, as I said before, if the money does not come from London council tax payers, where is it to come from? The new clause makes no mention of that, which is why I offered the hon. Gentleman a chance to tell us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_94">I am quite confident about the &#163;2.3 billion package, and I am sure that the Minister will confirm it. The figures that make up the package, which had cross-party support when we went to Singapore, represent a built-in flexibility based on the understanding that projects such as this always involve a cost overrun. The package assumes a potentially large overrun and builds in flexibility at a level that I consider acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_95">I hope that the new clause will be rejected on the basis that, as I have said, it does not tell us where the rest of the contribution will come from. The hon. Gentleman knows that I am already anxious about the amount that will have to come from existing lottery funds. I should be more anxious if, as a result of the new clause, more money had to come from funds for grass-roots sport or other lottery contributions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51206-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman, like me, is worried about the amount that we are raising from the national lottery to fund the Olympics. I suggest, however, that instead of focusing on the new clause, he should focus on the Minister&#039;s reassurances that the &#163;625 million is an accurate figure that will not be exceeded.
</p>





<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51206-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Reed: </b> 
 The Opposition have tabled a new clause and it is only right for us to respond. Indeed, I am delighted to do so.

<a name="stpa_96">There are other questions about funding. We know that 50 per cent. of the &#163;1.5 billion from the lottery will come from existing lottery funds, and the other 50 per cent. from the new lottery game. Another &#163;250 million is to come from the London Development Agency. It is bound to be difficult to raise the desired amount. So, if the money is not going to come from the London council tax payer, which other funding body will it come from? It is absolutely necessary that we have that information before we vote on the new clause.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51206-13_spnew7"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor) (Con):</b> 
 The estimate of the cost of the Olympic games seems to have been made by the Treasury. If the new clause were reworded so that any cost overrun would be spread across the whole nation, or was met in some other way, would the hon. Gentleman be more inclined to support it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51206-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Reed: </b>

With &#163;1.5 billion coming out of the lottery in the next 10 years, it will have suffered enough.

 Obviously, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that assurance, but I am sure that the Minister is listening. The hon.

I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has such a pessimistic view of Scotland&#039;s future, although I am not sure whether he meant the football World cup. I am sure that his constituents will be delighted to hear of his pessimism, however. I hope that Scotland does well in future world cup competitions, whatever the sport, but perhaps it will have a rethink in regard to the participation by the Scottish Football Association, which is denying not only its senior men a place in the 2012 competition, but the other teams that would benefit from joining England and possibly Wales as part of a UK team.

We made it clear that we were so confident that we had learned the lessons from previous Olympics that we were certain that an overrun&#151;which others described as probable&#151;was not likely to happen. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Loughborough challenges us to say where the money should come from in the event of an overrun.

Clearly, that is not the case. As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent, London has pledge &#163;550 million, with an extra &#163;75 million to call on if needed. Clearly, it is in the interests of the Mayor of London and all GLA members to ensure that even that &#163;75 million is not called on. Within the deal, there is a mechanism to exert downward pressure on costs. It is perhaps also worth reflecting that the Government are not currently making a direct contribution to the Olympics and Paralympics, but are seeking that money from all sorts of other bodies. At the same time, however, the Government will generate significant revenues as a result of the games coming to this country. Later, we will debate one source of revenue&#151;the VAT on the Olympic lottery game.

 Does not my hon.

The Treasury is a winner, but it ought to be willing to share some of that win and cover London&#039;s costs, too.

<p>
<a name="51206-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_105">One thing is absolutely clear: London council tax payers still have a mechanism to exert that financial pressure and to keep the costs as low as possible. The Government, who are currently not making a contribution, but will gain considerable revenue as a result of the games, also demonstrate that they, too, will exercise pressure to keep the cost down. That is shown by the welcome decision by the Secretary of State, the London organising committee for the Olympic games and others to reject the proposals for the swimming pool complex. Evidence therefore already shows that measures are being taken to keep the price down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_106">It would be wrong, however, to put ourselves in a position whereby London council tax payers are left in uncertainty about their financial responsibilities. They are rightly being asked to contribute to the cost of the games because of the significant benefits that London will gain, but it is equally right, as the new clause proposes, to cap the contribution so that London tax payers know what they are paying for and for how long. That should be the end of the matter.

I therefore hope that the debate will not perpetuate the canard that the games must necessarily overrun.

 I was about to deal with that point.

I hope that Rhys Jones, the grandson of my predecessor but two, Alec Jones, will be an Olympic athlete in the triathlon in the 2012 Olympics. I hope that there will be a proper funding stream for elite athletes, including those in the Rhondda and the rest of Wales, in Scotland and in Bath. That is why I do not support raiding the lottery.

<a name="stpa_110">I do not want a significant extra amount of money to be charged to the taxpayer in the case of an overrun.

Clearly, we hope that there will be great commercial gains, which will ensure that quite a lot of money comes into central coffers, but we should recall that Sydney&#039;s cost overrun increased almost threefold from &#163;1 billion to &#163;2.8 billion.

I am sure that London taxpayers would be happy to pay their share, but the reality is that, with a cost overrun, they will pay 100 per cent. of every pound in excess.

I find absurd the suggestion that Londoners and London MPs should simply walk away if all this goes financially pear-shaped, which a number of us anticipate, and leave the rest of us in the United Kingdom to pick up the pieces. London has secured the most extraordinary and fantastic regeneration programme for the east end. It is about to receive the most generous, extravagant input of public money through the lottery to pay for the bulk of the games and for that regeneration. Therefore, London cannot simply walk away when those financial shortcomings come home to roost and expect the rest of the nation to pick up the pieces. That would not be fair, right or proper.

<a name="51206-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_119">In this debate, I have heard London Members saying that Londoners will continue to pay for the games through the council tax. Londoners are paying for a sizeable proportion of the London Olympic games and that is right and fair because it is London that stands to gain from all the fantastic regeneration. I suggest that &#163;625 million is a snip to pay for what will be the largest regeneration programme in the next 10 years, anywhere in the world. It is cheap at half the price. I will now answer the question from the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway). The total cost of the Scottish Parliament was &#163;450 million, so now we have compared costs.

The rest of the UK continues to pay for that. London is the richest, most prosperous part not just of the UK but of the whole of Europe. I shall spare you from any more of that argument, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I am sure that you have heard it being kicked around before during debates in this House; indeed, it has been discussed for the past 10, 20 or 30 years.

<a name="stpa_121">The benefits for London of this regeneration are fantastic. The regeneration of east London alone will create more than 3,000 jobs, and its local economy will benefit by &#163;70 million. It has been concluded that London could make up to &#163;500 million from the tourism legacy&#151;an extraordinary, incredible figure. Given these fantastic legacies, London should be embarrassed at the suggestion that it should walk away from its responsibilities if things go pear-shaped. If things do go wrong, it will not be the fault of the taxpayer or the lottery player; nor will taxpayers elsewhere in the United Kingdom, or lottery players outwith the metropolitan area, share in this legacy.

 I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson). I wish to add a couple of points that may persuade many hon. Members, and not only those from London, of the merits of the case. The House may be aware that I am a great enthusiast for the Olympic games. I was really keen that we should make a bid and before the mayoral elections, I made it clear that I supported the Government&#151;as did the Conservative candidate. In case the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) has another go at my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) who was my predecessor as candidate&#151;and an excellent candidate she was, too&#151;I should make it clear that she and our party in London also believed that it was right to support the games.

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_126">Concerns were expressed, as might be expected in our capital city, not only in political circles but by ordinary members of the public, that the project might run out of control financially. Therefore, we watched with interest in the last Parliament&#151;before the last mayoral election&#151;as the negotiations went on between the Mayor of London, Ministers and others about the funding package. The negotiations produced a split between a London contribution, a lottery contribution and a London Development Agency contribution. It was also proposed that the games themselves, once everything had been built, would be self-financing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">I wish to give a couple of reasons for supporting the amendment. First, it is of course the case that people in Loughborough and Bath are further away from the games than people in London, and people in Perth and North Perthshire are further away still. However, people in Hillingdon or Uxbridge, or on the edge of north-west London and in Watford, or on the southern edge of Croydon, which is almost into Surrey, will receive no direct benefit from the regeneration of the east end, any more than people in Loughborough or Wales or Scotland. They may be part of Greater London, but in many ways they consider themselves to live in Surrey, Hertfordshire or Middlesex, so they too want to know that they will not be asked to pay an undue amount. It is different for people who live in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 775</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Hackney or Tower Hamlets, because they know that they will benefit directly from projects connected with the Olympics, such as the extension of the East London line, the development of the Lea valley and the legacy of housing and sports facilities. That is not the case for people a long way away on the other side of the largest metropolis in Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_128">Secondly and self-evidently, another of the contributions comes from Londoners&#151;the LDA contribution. The LDA is one of the four children of the Greater London Authority, just like the Metropolitan Police Authority. So although the LDA is regarded as a separate heading in the funding streams, the money will not fall out of a tree and it certainly will not come out of the Mayor&#039;s pocket. It will come from Londoners. It gets money from other places, but it is basically a London kitty to which Londoners make a contribution.
</p>





<p><a name="st_111"><a name="51206-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The budget of the LDA, like any other development agency, comes from the Exchequer.

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="51206-16_spnew2"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 But the reality is that when the Mayor stands for election and determines how much he will charge as a precept across the authority, some of the money that is collected can be spent on the sort of things that are done by the LDA. I accept that some of the LDA&#039;s money comes from the Exchequer, but&#151;I stand to be corrected on this point&#151;not all of it comes from the Government. The authority raises some of the money itself; some of it comes from joint schemes with the London boroughs and some of it indirectly from people who visit London. Certainly, businesses and individuals perceive that they contribute to all the budgets for all the spending streams from the Mayor&#039;s office, of which the Mayor administers one and that is where pressure can be applied.

That is a dangerous road to take. I do not want to be divisive, but I must put the case on the record: London contributes about 15 per cent. net to the UK economy, which is far more than it receives. Under the Barnett formula, Scotland has done very well, far better per capita than the rest of the United Kingdom. That is part of the constitutional development of the UK. London continues to raise, and spend, money and puts it into the UK kitty. As a capital city, it is happy to do so, but the hon.

<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 776</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>around the shores of the UK, including Scotland. Of course we remember yesterday&#039;s announcement, but the capital city of the United Kingdom has contributed for as long as the hon. Gentleman and I can remember to the United Kingdom&#039;s coffers, and that money has been spent throughout the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_130">Furthermore, of the 10 most deprived local authorities in the UK, five are in London, including the east end. If we want to ensure that there is fairness, it is wrong and improper to say that London is a great and affluent place that will benefit hugely. Some areas need to benefit as they have been deprived; inner-city areas, especially in capital cities, are often deprived.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_131">There will be benefits for London and, as people travel in and out of London, those benefits will be shared before, during and after the games with people throughout the UK. I am talking not just about hope, expectation, aspiration, ambition and motivation, but also about opportunities for training and for individuals and teams to visit between 2008 and 2012, and the legacy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_132">There will be other, indirect, effects. A local London paper reported recently that, as a result of the Olympics, the costs of housing in London, both rented and purchased, are likely to be considerably higher than in other parts of the country, much more so in the east end. Many costs will be borne and the new clause proposes a cap on the element of the cost that is part of the deal whereby, as part of the formula, every London household puts more into the kitty.
</p>





<p><a name="st_115"><a name="51206-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend confirm that his understanding of the proposal is the same as mine? We are talking about a cap on the contribution paid by the council tax payers of London, but were there to be an overrun, which we do not believe is likely, it would be funded by all taxpayers throughout the country, including London taxpayers, who, as my hon. Friend has rightly pointed out, make a rather greater contribution in that regard than taxpayers in other parts of the country. We would not be capping the total contribution of Londoners.
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="51206-16_spnew6"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Nobody is saying that Londoners would not have to bear their share of the burden if, despite the undertakings and expectations, there was an additional cost. We would pay our fair share like everybody else, but we are already making a specific extra commitment. We know that we have to do that; it could be for 10 or 12 years, which is not insignificant, especially for people on the lowest incomes, so we think that contribution should be capped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_133">The last point that I want to make is this. As you would imagine, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this proposal has been debated across the political parties in London. As the Minister knows, when it went to the London Assembly, 14 members of the Assembly across all parties, including the Minister&#039;s, supported it; no one opposed it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51206-16_spnew7"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 Funny, that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51206-16_spnew8"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says, &quot;Funny, that&quot;. People are elected, as he was elected for the Rhondda, to represent the people in their communities. What I am trying to say is that this issue is not divisive 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 777</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>politically; there is a unity of view. Just as there is a broad unity of view in London that we should have the games, that we shall make a great success of the games and that we want the games to do well, there is equally a view that there should be a financial responsibility on all of us&#151;a discipline that limits the amount that we expect Londoners to pay. If that can be agreed, it will be an additional reason why Londoners will support the games and the planning for the games in the years ahead with even greater enthusiasm. I hope that, if the Minister does not accept the proposal today, he will at least accept its merit and agree that it may have to be part of the eventual outcome of the deliberations on the Bill.
</p>

<p><a name="st_119"><a name="51206-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Before I address the details of the new clause, I want to make a couple of comments about how we approached the decision to bid for the Olympics. We took the decision only after a lot of discussion with cities that had run the Olympics. We asked what they would do differently if they got to run the games again, and many of them told us, &quot;You must make sure that the budgets that are put in place are robust, and will stand examination over time&quot;. We therefore adopted that approach, and were commended for it by the evaluation team&#151;the IOC. So we believe that the formula, which I shall outline later&#151;the memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor&#151;is the right way to proceed in order to ensure best management practice in running the games, particularly from a financial perspective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_134">It would be unfortunate if the House of Lords decided to delay the Bill on the basis of this issue. I say that for the simple reason that we received another crucial message from cities that had hosted the games: that the quicker we set up the company&#151;the ODA&#151;and lay the contracts, the farther we shall be from the end date and the more we shall be in the driving seat and able to control costs. That is why, as I acknowledged earlier, we are grateful for the support that we have had from all political parties and for the way in which the House has dealt with the Bill. We won the games on 6 July and we could well get legislation on the statute book by the early part of next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_135">Terminal 5 has been mentioned as a major construction project&#151;in fact, the major construction project in Europe at this stage. It will cost just under &#163;5 billion, it will come in on time and it may well come in well under budget. We are working closely with the team guiding that project. It should be recognised that more apprentices have been trained at terminal 5 than in the whole of the construction industry put together, so the hon. Member who was quipping from a sedentary position about Romanian, Polish and other labour should re-examine that comment and go and look at terminal 5, which is a credit to the construction industry and to the British Airports Authority. About 8,000 people are working on the terminal, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said, tens of thousands of people around the country are part of the supply chain, providing high-quality engineering&#151;a supply chain that is probably the envy of the world. If we apply that type of management to the scheme that we are now embarking upon for the Olympics, I am pretty sure that all that we said we would do in our candidate file is deliverable, so we stand by the statements.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 778</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">We have debated proposals of this type before. It would place a cap on the amount of council tax income that might ever be spent on preparing for the games. We cannot agree to such a cap, and I hope that when I have restated the reasons, the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_137">It is true that, as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, the Government and the Mayor have agreed that the GLA will make available &#163;550 million towards the public sector funding package, with a further &#163;75 million if required. That is how the hon. Gentleman gets his total of &#163;625 million. The Mayor&#039;s contribution will be raised through the GLA precept on council tax, starting in the 2006&#150;07 financial year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_138">We have no intention of letting costs run out of control, and the Government and the GLA will make every effort in managing the Olympic project to keep to the original budget. However, if costs exceed the provision allowed for in the public sector funding package, the memorandum of understanding between the Mayor and the Government states that the costs should be met through a
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;sharing arrangement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London and through seeking National Lottery funding in amounts to be agreed at the time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_139">I want to clear up a misunderstanding about land acquisitions by the London Development Agency. Small amounts of money may well have come from elsewhere, but the vast majority of the LDA&#039;s work has been directly funded by council tax. The LDA has been responsible for purchasing the land. Indeed, any overrun on price as the cost of land increases will not directly affect the council tax funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_140">Let us consider the assets on the balance sheet post-2012. It is true that the LDA purchased considerable amounts of land well before 6 July and the price started to escalate, but those assets will stay on the LDA&#039;s books. I do not know what will happen if there is an overrun on the funding arrangements, but the assets acquired by the LDA&#151;they are London&#039;s assets, not central Government&#039;s&#151;could well be deployed. So the memorandum of understanding is an agreement that we would share that responsibility, depending on the prevailing conditions at the time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_120"><a name="51206-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Field: </b> 
 Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman can clarify the situation in the interests of all London council tax payers today and in the future. Is he saying that the LDA will be obliged to liquidate some of its assets and therefore release some of the perhaps substantial property gains made to fund any possible overrun?
</p>





<p><a name="st_121"><a name="51206-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I am not saying that at all. What I am saying is that such things will be reviewed at the time. That is why we are not prepared to accept the new clause. It would be wrong at this stage to include that type of cap on the various funding streams. That could be deployed at a later stage.
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="51206-17_spnew3"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I agree with the Minister when he suggests that, if the land held by the LDA were to increase in value significantly, logically, that increase 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 779</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should be used to reduce the general council tax burden. That is my understanding of one of the reasons why that was put into the original memorandum.
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="51206-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Absolutely. That is why we say that all those factors will be taken into account. The memorandum of understanding states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;amounts to be agreed at the time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_141">That is what the MOU is all about, and the way that it has been interpreted by some hon. Members is fundamentally wrong. We believe that this is the right approach. It would not be prudent at this stage to close off any of those funding options to meet a hypothetical future shortfall by capping the amount of council tax that the Mayor may raise. The GLA takes exactly the same view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_142">In the event of cost overrun, the Government and the Mayor will need to consider all the options available to them. It is right that council tax will fund some of the games, as they will bring a great many benefits to Londoners&#151;again, that has been explained already this evening&#151;but we have no intention of making a dramatic raid on ordinary council tax payers. If cost overruns were to occur, we would want to balance any possible costs sensitively to avoid imposing punitive costs on individual households. Nevertheless, the Olympic project will be overseen jointly by the Government and the GLA. Under the existing funding and governance arrangements, we have shared interests in running things properly and keeping down costs. That is the right way to do things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_143">We must ensure that we retain a shared interest in keeping down costs, but it would be entirely imprudent to cap the liability of one of those parties at this early stage in the process. It is therefore vital that everyone involved should have the maximum incentive to remain hawkish about keeping down the costs. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already called in the aquatic centre proposals because of the possible cost overrun. I send a very clear message to all those who will be involved in contractual agreements that we will expect them to keep to those costs. That can be done&#151;it can be done by the type of management that we have at terminal 5.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_144">The Government feel that it would be irresponsible to place a statutory limit on council tax funding at the outset of the Olympic project. I reassure hon. Members again that in the unlikely and unfortunate scenario in which costs run over budget, we would sit down with the Mayor to work out a sensible solution that would not cripple the average household. The Mayor and the GLA are content with that reassurance, so I hope that hon. Members will also accept it and that the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent will withdraw the new clause.

<br>
<a name="amdt_24">
<br>
&#039;(1)   The Secretary of State shall from time to time pay to the London Organising Committee such sums as are, in his opinion, equivalent to the sums paid into the Consolidated Fund as a result of the operations of any Olympic Lottery.

<p><a name="st_131"><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51206-18_spnew0"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_145">I tabled the new clause with my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) in the light of the omission in yesterday&#039;s pre-Budget report of any extra funding for elite athletes who are training for the Olympic games and of increasing concerns among sports outside the Olympic movement about the amount of funding available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_146">The parliamentary background to the new clause is well documented. The new Olympic lottery games were established under section 3 of the Horserace, Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004. It provided for four things: a regulator, the National Lottery Commission, to license lottery games; the establishment of a fund to hold the proceeds generated by the new games; the establishment of a body to distribute money held in the fund; and the principle that money held in the fund would be distributed to meet the costs of staging the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_147">As the Bill passed through the House, my party raised two concerns&#151;the start time, which we felt should coincide with the Athens Olympics, and the tax take&#151;so the amendment is nothing new. We know that the Government plan to use &#163;1.5 billion from lottery sources to finance the games&#151;&#163;750 million will come from existing sources and &#163;750 million from the new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 784</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Olympic lottery games. As money from the new games will be split in the same way as existing lottery proceeds, we know that 50 per cent. will go to the winners, 28 per cent. will go to good causes&#151;in this case, the Olympic games&#151;12 per cent., and this is the crucial figure, will go to the Government in tax, 5 per cent. in commission to retailers, 4.5 per cent. in operating costs and 0.5 per cent. to Camelot.
<a name="time_9">
<a name="51206-18_time0"><h5>6 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_148">It is therefore relatively easy to calculate that if the 28 per cent. earmarked for good causes&#151;in this case, the Olympic games&#151;has to fund the &#163;750 million that the Government are looking for, total lottery sales from the new games must be about &#163;2.68 billion. The Government&#039;s tax take&#151;12 per cent.&#151;is &#163;320 million, which is how we arrive at that figure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_149">The British Olympic Association has already announced its intention to move Great Britain from 10th to fourth in the medal table. It is a brutal fact of life that the public will judge the success of the 2012 games by the number of medals we win. The BOA has calculated that an extra &#163;25 million is needed each and every year to deliver on that commitment, with an extra &#163;25 million needed for minor sports. The BOA expected that from yesterday&#039;s pre-Budget report and was cruelly disappointed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_150">Furthermore, sports outside the Olympic movement, and particularly the main mass participation sports of football, cricket, tennis and both codes of rugby, supported the London 2012 bid precisely because of its generic benefit to sport. They should receive enormous credit for this, as it enabled British sport to present an unusually united front to the International Olympic Committee. However, now that the games are secured, they are, quite reasonably, asking what this means for them. They have a number of concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_151">First, the new Olympic lottery game could lead to a diversion of funds from existing lottery games, meaning less money in the pot for those sports. Secondly, the diversion of a further &#163;750 million from existing lottery sources will obviously mean that less money is available for non-Olympic sports. As a practical example of the effect that this will have, the Rugby Football League told me that it had planned to bid for the 2012 World cup. It now fears that lottery funds will not be available to finance that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_152">Thirdly, Government reforms to the lottery, by moving away from the four original pillars&#151;sport, the arts, charities and heritage&#151;mean that there is less money available in the first place. Fourthly, all four of the major sport national governing bodies have told me that they worry that UK Sport is becoming Olympics-dominated in its thinking. That is entirely understandable, but it is vital that we do not lose focus on mass participation sports, which, with the best will in the world, is what the vast majority of people will be playing in the seven years up to 2012 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_153">Fifthly, the sponsorship needed for London 2012 to be a commercial success is, I am told, twice that of the current market value. Although London 2012 will undoubtedly attract new sponsors, it is inevitable that some of sport&#039;s existing sponsors will, for obvious reasons, be lured towards the Olympics. As commercial companies do not have unlimited resources, that is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 785</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>bound to impact on the everyday sports. The sponsorship market will fall and that will impact on grass-roots activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_154">Finally, there is the possibility of disruption to the UK&#039;s sporting calendar as a result of the IOC&#039;s prohibition on major sporting events during the period of the games. I know from my discussions with the Rugby Football League that the super league season, which runs from February to October, faces disruption, as does the Challenge cup final at Wembley on the August bank holiday. The England and Wales Cricket Board made clear its concerns at an all-party cricket group dinner the other week that its ICC future tours programme is already projected until 2013. I know and accept that there is scope for negotiation with the IOC but&#151;this is the important point&#151;many sports outside the Olympic movement have made compromises without, as yet, seeing any return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_155">There are two arguments here, one moral and one practical. The moral argument is that given that the Olympics is a one-off, national event, it is utterly iniquitous that the Chancellor should seek to fill his coffers in this fashion. The practical argument is that the concerns of sports inside and outside the Olympic movement could be met by the Government allocating the &#163;320 million that they intend to take in tax from the new Olympic lottery games to the benefit of sport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_156">I can do no better than quote directly from the chief executive of the British Olympic Association who, in the absence from the pre-Budget report yesterday of an increase in Government funding to train our elite athletes, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;This is devastating news for the Olympic Governing Bodies and the aspirations that we all have for delivering successful results at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_157">Even UK Sport, the Government&#039;s own quango, whose chair is a Government special adviser, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;We&#039;re disappointed because we want the best chance of success for our athletes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_158">On the other side of the fence, among the mass participation sports, the chief executive of the Football Association said recently:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;We have some concerns that the Government&#039;s concentration of effort and funding on the Games, whilst understandable&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_159">it is fair to say that everybody accepts that&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;may inadvertently lead to a lack of support for the regular grassroots non-Olympic sports that we all know is vital.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">We will be doing all we can to remind all Governments between now and 2012&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_160">I was encouraged by that&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;that, while medals at the Games are important, the country cannot afford to neglect our collective efforts to increase participation levels in our most popular sports.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para16">
<a name="stpa_161">I could not agree more on both counts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para17">
<a name="stpa_162">Sport, both Olympic, to fund our elite athletes, and non-Olympic, needs extra funding if the aspirations raised by winning the bid are to become reality. The return of the &#163;320 million in tax taken from the new Olympic lottery games is both morally right and a practical way of starting to deliver for sport. I therefore urge all hon. Members to accept the new clause.

<p><a name="st_133"><a name="51206-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andy Reed </b> 
: I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about the new clause and about the comments of the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson). As he knows, I have consistently taken a particular line on the raiding of other parts of the lottery, from the point of view of those of us who are interested in grass-roots sport, especially the ones that are not part of the Olympic games. There are many mass participation sports that are outside the Olympics, such as my own game, rugby union, and rugby league, as the hon. Gentleman noted. It is a great shame that the IOC has not taken the lead and included rugby sevens, which is included in the Commonwealth games. It would have been a fantastic opportunity for that to be part of the 2012 Olympic games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para18">
<a name="stpa_163">I have been quite closely involved in trying to assess what is required, particularly as regards the UK Sport bid for additional funding. Those of us who know the threesome&#151;Bath, Sheffield and Loughborough&#151;know what it will take to get an Olympic gold medallist in 2012. We know that the average age of a gold medallist in 2012 will be 26.2 years. That means that such a person will probably already be in a development squad at one of our leading centres, the English Institute of Sport, and we know from UK Sport&#039;s work the attrition rate&#151;the number of people who will drop out of those training programmes&#151;and the size of the training programme that we need across the Olympic sports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para19">
<a name="stpa_164">I play quite a bit of volleyball, which will be an Olympic sport in 2012 because we are the host nation. We will be looking for a creditable performance, but even with all the lottery funding that we can muster, it is unrealistic to expect the UK team to pick up the gold medal&#151;I sound like the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart), who has downgraded his aspirations for Scottish World cup wins. I do not want to be down on our fantastic volleyball players, who are based in my constituency, but they, too, are realistic about their chances of winning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-18_para20">
<a name="stpa_165">It is too easy to sit on the Opposition Benches and say, &quot;We would like to spend an extra &#163;300 million, and we have got a rough idea where it will come from.&quot; Only yesterday, Opposition Members criticised the so-called difficulties with the Budget, so it is strange that the Opposition parties are introducing a proposal to take another &#163;300 million out of the figures in the pre-Budget report. I can see the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) distancing himself from the official Opposition on that particular matter.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_166">A great deal more work needs to be done on how the bid is submitted to the Government. The BOA needs to do more work on securing additional funding in partnership with others for each year until 2012, so it can reach &#163;40 million to &#163;50 million extra a year for the 28 sports. As the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent has indicated, however, the funding needs to cover many other sports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_167">We are discussing a great deal of investment to get people on to the podium, and a great deal of work needs to be done. We must work with the Treasury to make sure that we secure the required level of funding. We should be much more imaginative and, rather than taking a begging bowl directly to the Treasury, we should find other ways to fund the elite performance to which the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent has referred. I cannot support new clause 2, but in general I would like to see a great deal more work being done to ensure that we secure the necessary level of funding for the governing bodies that will participate in 2012.
</p>





<p><a name="st_138"><a name="51206-19_spnew3"><b> Kate Hoey  (Vauxhall) (Lab):</b> 
 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s logic. Does he agree that the fundamental principle behind our having the Olympic games in London in 2012 involves grass-roots sport? It is not good enough to say that the Olympics will automatically help grass-roots sport&#151;it will not happen unless a decision is taken to make it happen.
</p>





<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51206-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Reed: </b> 
 My hon. Friend knows me well enough to know that I am particularly concerned about that danger. It would be great if we were to find an additional &#163;50 million a year for elite sport in this country and were to finish fourth in the medal table, but what would be the legacy for our sporting future?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_168">A great deal has been done&#151;for example, we have largely achieved our objectives on school sport. On elite sport, those of us who know what is happening in the English Institute of Sport, which will form part of UK Sport, feel that we can deliver a great deal with additional funding. On grass-roots sport, although some good work is going on and a lot of additional funding is coming in, it will take a great deal more work to reach our objectives, and we are not quite there yet. My worry is that taking &#163;750 million away from existing lottery causes would make that job even harder, and we must think more about the money that is currently available.

<a name="51206-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_169">As hon. Members know, I chair the national strategic partnership for volunteering in sport. The problem is that we are making the situation harder and harder for volunteers, which makes it harder and harder for people to participate at a grass-roots level. That is not necessarily the Government&#039;s fault, because a number of agencies are involved. I hope that the lasting legacy of 2012 is not the grand stadiums, which will nevertheless be fantastic, but a genuine passion for sport and the money to deliver it.

<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51206-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 As ever, I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed). On this occasion, I agree with almost everything that he has said and was not offended when he described me as hair-shirted. I also agree with him about the addition of rugby sevens on to the list of sports, although I say that slightly diffidently knowing that my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) will no doubt read my remarks and wonder why darts has not been included on the wish list for additional Olympic sports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_170">As the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) has said, the Chancellor&#039;s statement caused considerable disappointment given what he did not say about funding for sporting endeavour, and particularly sporting endeavour that helps us to achieve an increased medal haul. He was right to say that those of us who share that concern need to get together with the representative bodies to find arguments to put pressure on the Chancellor and to come up with other forms of funding. As the hon. Member for Loughborough has said, a lot is being done, and I praise the Minister and the Government for their work. I also hope that we go on to develop links between community sports clubs and our schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_171">My party simply cannot support the approach proposed by the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent, because we have some difficulty with the Conservative party&#039;s mixed messages about the lottery. Conservative Members tell us that it is wrong for the Government to put their sticky little mitts in lottery funding, but the Conservative party manifesto contains a proposal to raise &#163;250 million a year from the lottery for its club-to-school scheme. The Conservative party is proposing a form of hypothecated tax, which Conservative Members always say is complete anathema to them whenever we make such a proposal&#151;the Conservative proposal is schizophrenic.

<a name="stpa_172">Many hon. Members had grave qualms about using the lottery to make a major contribution towards the cost of running the Olympics. However, Liberal Democrats recognised that the Olympics are so important to the nation, to sport and in many other ways&#151;for example, culturally&#151;that we were prepared to make an exception. That is why we supported the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004, and I believe that we were right to do so. During the passage of the 2004 Act, we were disappointed when we were told that the &#163;410 million from other distributors would only be available if it were needed, although it was not long after the 2004 Act received Royal Assent that the Government said that that sum would be needed. However, we lived with that situation, because we had made a commitment.

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_173">Even were I prepared to support the notion of taking VAT in respect of just one part of the lottery and using it in the broad way that the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent suggests, I am not convinced that the mechanism would work. How would LOCOG, which has very specific responsibilities in respect of the running of the Olympic games, ensure that all aspects of sport will receive some of the money? Let me remind the hon. Gentleman of what would happen were LOCOG to receive that additional, very significant sum of money. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 789</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>As the games should operate successfully within budget as it is, an extra &#163;320 million could lead to a surplus. He will remember that as part of the deal, 20 per cent. of any such surplus will go to the IOC, 20 per cent. to the BOA and 60 per cent. to grass-roots sport. He is suggesting, in effect, that we take money away from the lottery and give it to the IOC. Some of the money would not even end up in sport in this country. I find that aspect of the proposal difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_174">The new clause is somewhat schizophrenic about the lottery and about the approach to VAT receipts and the Chancellor&#039;s responsibility for using them. For those and many other reasons with which I do not wish to detain the House, we will not support the hon. Gentleman, who in many other respects has done a fantastic job.
</p>





<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51206-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I echo some of the arguments made by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). I agree that the approach taken in new clause 2 is schizophrenic. People who criticised the Chancellor for not supporting the move from 10th to fourth position in the medals table in yesterday&#039;s pre-Budget report then argue about investment into grass-roots sport as well. The whole Olympic bid process has been one of properly evaluating the risks and costs so that we can learn lessons from previous mistakes. Simply plucking out of the air the idea that we are going to move from 10th to fourth, and then saying, &quot;Please fund it, Chancellor&quot;, is not the best way of trying to persuade people that we are serious. UK Sport, under the very good leadership of Sue Campbell, together with Peter Keene, who is probably one of the best respected people in sport, and Liz Nicholl, is systematically working through what it will take to move us progressively up the medals table.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_175">I entirely accept that one of the great successes of 2012 will be our young people picking up those medals on the podiums. However, we have to balance the investment in 26 sports against the 130 sports for which I have ministerial responsibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) mentioned the balance between grass-roots and elite sport. We will get that balance right. There is more investment going into sport than there has been for very many years. The investment that is being made in sporting and physical activity through &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; clearly shows that we take it very seriously, from the grassroots to the podium.
</p>

<p><a name="st_142"><a name="51206-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andy Reed: </b> 
 The case that has been put forward by UK Sport is fairly robust and well argued, so I hope that my right hon. Friend will ensure that the support that he gets from the House this evening reaches the Treasury. Does he agree that grandstanding and attacking the Government is not the best way of negotiating the question of funding and is unhelpful to sport in general? Perhaps the chair of the BOA will learn that working in partnership with people is a much better way forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_143"><a name="51206-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 There has not been a Chancellor in the recent past who has been more supportive of sport. The Central Council of Physical Recreation has been asking for mandatory rate relief for clubs for 30 years&#151;now we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 790</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have got it. The talented athlete scholarship scheme, which is investing into grassroots sport, came from the Chancellor. This Government&#039;s investment in sport&#151;through the Chancellor, with support from the Prime Minister&#151;has been second to none. UK Sport is putting a case together, and if it is well argued I believe that there could be a positive response. Trying to bounce the Treasury is not the best way forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_176">Opposition Members have presented the proposal in the new clause to us before in various forms. It would make a special case for the Olympic lottery by providing for a form of tax rebate. There are two reasons why that cannot happen. First, as with all taxes, the Chancellor keeps lottery duty under review and gives due consideration to Budget representations made in the course of the Finance Bill process. As such, any changes in lottery duty should be considered in the context of a future Finance Bill, not this Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_177">Secondly, the Government intend that the same principles that apply to the existing national lottery should apply to any Olympics-themed games. Camelot says that the lottery game has been hugely successful. I put on the record my thanks to all the people who are buying Olympics lottery tickets. That clearly demonstrates the support behind the Olympic bid. People have put their money where their mouths were, and the first &#163;4 million has already been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_178">The principle of taxation in the national lottery was accepted by Parliament when the lottery was introduced&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that it was introduced by the Opposition. I do not intend to make political points about that because the lottery is one of our national institutions and it has all-party support. Nevertheless, we have made it clear that it will be taxed in the normal way. The &#163;500 million that is collected by the Exchequer goes towards essential services such as schools, hospitals and the like, and it would be wrong to remove it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_179">I hope that the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) will reflect on the funding of elite as against grass-roots sport. I hope that he accepts that the right way to approach the Treasury is the way in which UK Sport is doing it, with a systematic analysis of what needs to be done in investing in elite sport to ensure that we move up the medals table. It is a little naive to say at this early stage that we will move from 10th to fourth without putting the funding mechanism in place. That is not the right way to go about it. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.
</p>





<p><a name="st_144"><a name="51206-20_spnew2"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 I listened with interest to what the Minister said. The good news is that Members on both sides of the House agree on the importance of both securing the necessary funding for our elite athletes and increasing grass-roots participation. Where we differ is on the method of achieving that.

<p>
<a name="51206-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_180">I entirely accept that the mechanism that we propose is a blunt tool. What should be set against that is that we all make our contribution to lobbying of the Treasury in our own ways. In view of that, and not least because I want the point to be raised, I wish to press the new clause to a vote.

<br>
<a name="amdt_27">
<br>
&#039;(   )   pay compensation to any owner of a business whose interests are injuriously affected by the development of land, premises or facilities in connection with the London Olympics;&#039;.
<br>



<p><a name="st_150">This is the fourth time that I have raised the issue of compensation for businesses that will have to be relocated from the Olympic site. It is a matter of some sadness that I have had to bring it up four times, but I am afraid that I have still not received the answers that I am seeking.</p>





<p><a name="st_151">No two businesses on the Olympic site are the same. Some are freehold, some are leasehold; some are owned by sole proprietors, and some by publicly quoted companies. I suspect that the vast majority are leasehold, and it would be very easy for their leases to be terminated and for the companies to be relocated. Many of them are in storage, and it would simply be a question of moving the contents of the business from one site to another.</p>





<p><a name="st_152">The Minister is well aware of the particular constituency case that I have raised, so I shall not dwell on it, other than to say that it concerns a proprietor-owned freeholder who is experiencing severe difficulties in relocating. The Minister, to his credit, has said that he takes a keen personal interest in these matters, and has made all the right noises. Both he and the Mayor have said that no business will be disadvantaged. There is a lack of clarity, however, in exactly what is meant by that.</p>





<p><a name="st_153">The briefing that we received from the London Development Agency for the debate in Westminster Hall last week set out exactly what the agency&#039;s statutory responsibilities were in this regard. They include,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;funding for legal and surveying costs, offers of LDA-owned sites for relocation, and development of tailored support packages&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="st_154"></p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para0">
In a separate briefing, the LDA states that it has
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;given a firm assurance that no business will be financially disadvantaged as a result of the compulsory purchase order process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="st_155"></p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para1">
However, that still does not deal with the non-CPO aspects of this issue. The briefing continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;Businesses will be compensated and supported as generously as possible, within the legal framework in which the LDA operates.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 795</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<a name="st_156"></p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para2">
Again, the LDA framework is general in its outlook without being specific as to exactly what kind of compensation might be available. A briefing helpfully provided by the Greater London Authority for today&#039;s debate states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;The Mayor and LDA remain firmly committed to ensuring that the process of land acquisition for the Olympic Park development does not disproportionately disadvantage those with current interests in the land.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="st_157"></p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para3">
What on earth does that mean?
<a name="st_158"></p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para4">
Let us take the example of a business that has to be relocated. It would have to remarket itself, relaunch itself and retrain staff. It would inevitably suffer losses. I have one simple question for the Minister, if I can get his attention. Will the items that I have just set out&#151;he might have missed them, but I am sure he has heard all this before&#151;be covered? In an earlier intervention, he said that the LDA was Exchequer-funded, and that is quite right. So the power flows from the Government to the LDA to the dispossessed business. Does the Minister believe that the LDA has the power and the funds to provide complete compensation to a business in the situation that I have just described? In other words, would it cover the costs not only of relocation but of relaunching and the inevitable loss of profit? These are simple questions, and I would be grateful if the Minister could give me clear yes or no answers.</p>



<a name="time_12">
<a name="51206-21_time0"><h5>6.45 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_159"><a name="51206-21_spnew1"><b> Jo Swinson  (East Dunbartonshire) (LD):</b> 
 I have a great deal of sympathy with the points raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway). In the Westminster Hall debate on this issue last week, he set out very eloquently the concerns of his constituent and the business that he runs. There has been a huge amount of support for the games from the business community and from individuals in London and the rest of the UK, but we need to ensure that the business community will be compensated appropriately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_181">The amendment raises certain questions. How is the compensation to be applied? What levels will be set? Where is the money to come from? Ultimately, who is to be the judge? Businesses have set forth their case for being injured by the games and suggested the amount of compensation that they believe to be appropriate. The <i>Sunday Express</i> on 27 November carried the example of a concrete-crushing business that had claimed that it needed &#163;20 million of compensation. It had been offered &#163;1.5 million, so there was obviously a difference of opinion as to what the business should be entitled to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_182">Certain unscrupulous companies or individuals might seek to benefit unduly from the games by submitting cases that do not have sufficient merit, and we need to find a way of arbitrating all the cases. One sensible suggestion is that we should appoint an independent arbitrator who could address the problem. They would evaluate the loss to the business and examine the case that had been presented. Each business will probably have a unique case. The arbitrator&#039;s judgment could then be presented to the Department or agency that would be required to pay the compensation. That would present an accurate and fair fee for transferring land to the games, and a process in which all those involved could have faith. About 300 businesses might be affected, and such a process could instil faith in them that they would receive the compensation that they were due.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 796</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_183">We spoke earlier about the sound financial management required to ensure that the games come in on budget. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that we must ensure that those businesses that will genuinely be affected can get the support that they need. At the same time, however, we must ensure that the LDA is not held hostage and that we do not leave ourselves vulnerable to ever-escalating costs. I suggest that an independent arbitrator would provide a good answer to this problem.
</p>





<p><a name="st_160"><a name="51206-21_spnew2"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 For reasons that I entirely understand, the Minister missed the Westminster Hall debate last week, in which we touched on a number of these issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_184">I went to visit some of the businesses involved on 17 November. I tried to approach the meeting with an entirely open mind, but I came away feeling considerable sympathy for much of what they said. I shall try to encapsulate for the Minister what appeared to be the three problems involved. First, I do not want to party political, but there were issues surrounding the conduct of the LDA. I suspect that the LDA did not expect us to win the bid in Singapore, and thus might not have done all the necessary work&#151;for reasons that we can all understand&#151;to identify and secure alternative sites. There were countless stories of unreturned phone calls, unanswered letters and messages left hanging in thin air, which clearly did not help one iota.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_185">Secondly, some surveying firms were acting both as compulsory purchase valuers and as agents for prospective new sites, which is a serious issue. The Minister will know perfectly well that that is a straightforward conflict of interest and should never happen. Finally, the very fact that the Olympic site is such a large industrial site has, for obvious reasons, made replacement properties difficult to identify. Furthermore, post the bid, the supply of similar land is considerably scarcer, thus pushing up values. Any settlement must therefore be based on post-bid land values, not on the values existing prior to the Singapore decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_186">It was clear from my meeting that a realistic settlement could be reached on the basis of the cost of the replacement site, plus the necessary construction cost, plus an element of dislocation. We do not intend to press the amendment to a vote tonight, but the Minister should be in no doubt about the scale of the problem. The suggestion of an independent arbitrator is helpful, and some such initiative would prevent positions becoming entrenched. If they do become entrenched, without Government intervention, I fear that a solution will be hard to find.
</p>





<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51206-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Clause 4(5) ensures that everyone whose land is injuriously affected by Olympic construction works will be entitled to a fair amount of compensation. That provision will apply to businesses in the same way as it applies to home owners. Compensation will be calculated on the basis of depreciation in the market value of the land affected. In the event of dispute, there will be a right of appeal to the Lands Tribunal. That puts the Olympic project on exactly the same footing as other major construction projects undertaken by public bodies. The Olympic delivery authority will pay compensation, rather than the London Development 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 797</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Agency, as it will be directing the works on the LDA&#039;s land. The responsibility will go to the ODA when this Bill, I hope, becomes an Act. Under an earlier amendment, all the work and contracts operated by the LDA will go to the ODA&#151;I hope in an efficient and effective way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_187">In adopting that approach, the Bill is entirely consistent with the precedent set in other contexts, including the channel tunnel rail link project. I understand where the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) is coming from. He is concerned to make sure that businesses get a fair deal, and I support that aim. We also want to ensure that people are fairly compensated. We do not want to make the Olympics a special case, however, compared with other large-scale public construction projects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_188">The amendment would create a special case by widening the class of people entitled to compensation to cover all those whose interests are affected, however indirectly and regardless of whether they are land owners or tenants in the land affected. That is too broad an approach. Its effects are uncertain, but it is likely to result in a multiplicity of claims and to prove very expensive. It is much better to rely on several decades of case law in this area to provide what is acknowledged to be a fair and reasonable compensation scheme for those who deserve compensation. We have provided the necessary hook in the Bill to ensure that that is the case.
</p>

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="51206-22_spnew0"><b> Richard Ottaway: </b> 
 I apologise if I am pre-empting the Minister, but does the case law provide compensation for loss of profits in this situation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51206-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Each case is considered on its own merits, but relocation costs, new stock and loss of profits can be included. All that will be determined by the Lands Tribunal&#151;this is where the independent tribunal comes in&#151;under the Land Compensation Act 1961. There is independent arbitration and the facility to take into account losses beyond just the land price. If that is operated correctly, the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman should be answered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_189">In relation to the concern raised by the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson), all agents have guidelines for dealing with conflicts of interest, and all such procedures are fully regulated by the appropriate professional body. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has its code of conduct, and members of the RICS who are in breach of that could face expulsion. In light of the Adjournment debate that took place in Westminster Hall, I am writing to the LDA to draw its attention to that position. If there has been any such occurrence, I do not believe that it has been intentional. I reiterate that the Lands Tribunal is the mechanism for the type of arbitration to which the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) was referring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_190">I genuinely hope that I have been able to answer the questions put on the record. Overall, the LDA has done a reasonable job in difficult circumstances. It had to respond post-6 July, and it has done that very well. We have put tremendous pressure on it, and I think that its approach to underground cabling and other issues will

While, on the one hand, it might not have answered a few telephone calls&#151;I understand the frustration arising from that&#151;on the other, I hope that when we get this Bill on to the statute book and the ODA takes over we can start working in a slightly more effective and efficient manner than has probably been the case previously.

<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51206-22_spnew4"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 I want to speak in support of the amendments in my name and that of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_192">It is well documented that ambush marketing has been an issue at previous Olympic games. At the 1992 Barcelona games, Reebok paid $700 million only to find Nike sponsoring the winning basketball team&#039;s press conference and one of the competitors covering up his Reebok logo. At the 1996 Atlanta games, however, the issue really threatened to overwhelm the Olympics. As a result, subsequent summer and winter games have included provisions to prevent ambush marketing and to protect the rights of official sponsors. That is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 799</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>important as LOCOG, the event manager, needs to raise approximately &#163;1.5 billion, which will come from three main funding streams. Funding of &#163;550 million will come from the IOC, &#163;310 million will come from ticket sales, an extra &#163;100 million will come from other sources, and &#163;510 million will come from sponsorship raised by LOCOG&#151;hence the need for these regulations. Given that, as the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, any revenue surplus is reinvested, with 60 per cent. invested for the general benefit of sport in the UK and 20 per cent. going to the British Olympic Association, we wholeheartedly support that approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_193">I am therefore happy with the concept of anti-ambush marketing provisions and the protection of the London Olympics association. Across many sports, inside and outside the Olympic movement, that is the modern way&#151;notably at recent cricket world cups, which have seen similar provisions. Set against that, however, all Members of the House will want voluntary organisations, community groups and sports clubs to benefit from hosting the 2012 Olympics. The key is to achieve that without compromising the protection put in place to safeguard the official sponsors. Amendment No. 2 seeks to achieve that.
<a name="time_13">
<a name="51206-22_time0"><h5>7 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_194">Voluntary organisations, community groups and sports clubs have several concerns. The London organising committee for the Olympic games, which already has the power to make blanket exemptions for specific groups, has said that it will not do that in the instance that we are considering and I thank the Minister for writing to confirm that after the Committee stage. There is a concern that the sponsorship of teams or individuals could be affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_195">It is also down to the accused to prove their innocence, which is difficult in some cases given the limited resources at their disposal. Fundraising on behalf of individual athletes may be compromised and voluntary or community groups that want to have an Olympics theme day could fall foul of the regulations. For example, I was contacted by Soul in the City, a religious group that engages young people in voluntary work to the benefit of local communities. It is a fantastic organisation, which everybody here would support. It wants to hold an Olympics theme day but is worried that doing so will contravene the regulations. That fear of contravening the regulations will deter smaller organisations from making use of the many opportunities that the games will bring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_196">The commercial marketing elements of the Bill are undoubtedly necessary to prevent ambush marketing and exploitation. Previous Olympics, prior to the introduction of similar measures, have suffered. We also need to maximise the advertising revenue so that, after 2012, the maximum amount of money can be returned to sport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_197">However, the 2012 Olympics have been marketed as an event that will benefit the whole of the UK. Thanks to the hype that surrounds the games, anticipation is understandably high. Every hon. Member will want schools, sports clubs, community groups and voluntary organisations to derive the maximum benefit from hosting the games. All those organisations will want to use the Olympics to bolster fundraising, raise awareness 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 800</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and get more people involved. There is no prospect of those groups making personal gains. I urge the Minister to go into some detail in his response to explain the exact processes and safeguards that will protect those groups. There cannot be a single hon. Member who does not want that to be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_198">In speaking about amendment No. 5, I should like to take over where my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) left off in Committee. In Committee, the hon. Member for Bath tabled an amendment to clause 18(5)&#151;clause 17(5) as it was then. Conservative Members supported it in debate and my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke elicited from the Minister the welcome confirmation that there was no intention to apply the regulations to television.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_199">The hon. Member for Bath had similar success in establishing from the Minister that newspapers and, indeed, the stands from which vendors operate, would also enjoy an exemption from any regulations issued under clause 18. We are grateful for the clarification on that. However, despite the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke to elicit similar assurances about magazines and radio, they were not forthcoming. Given that they are directly comparable to newspapers and television, surely it is right that the exemption from any regulations issued under clause 18 extends to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_200">I understand that those issues were subsequently raised at the meeting between representatives of the advertising industry and Department officials on 10 November. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that. At that meeting, officials also undertook to consider the case for extending the exemption from clause 18 regulations to mobile telephones and other forms of electronic media that might deliver advertisements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_201">The amendment&#039;s object is therefore threefold. First, it would reflect in statute the commitments that the Minister made about newspapers and television in Committee. Secondly, it would extend those commitments to the comparable media of magazines and radio. Thirdly, its purpose is to tease out from the Minister the view at which the Government have arrived on mobile telephones and other electronic media, which should also be exempted from the regulations issued under clause 18.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_202">I know that the Minister is aware of many of those concerns and I thank him publicly for his assistance thus far. We discussed the issues at the helpful meeting at the Department on 21 November. I hope that, as a result of the amendments, he will welcome the opportunity to put the necessary reassurances on the record.

 The group under consideration comprises a string of different amendments and I am the only hon. Member whose name is appended to each. The Minister and the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) can therefore rest assured that I support the amendments that they tabled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_203">Amendment No. 2 is crucial because it was made clear at the outset that one of the central goals that we wanted to achieve in the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics was

<br>&nbsp;<br>games. We know of many examples of organisations that will use the Olympics as a vehicle for promoting voluntary action. They include the Waltham Forest volunteer centre, which plans to use the Olympics as a catalyst for expansion. Many organisations, such as the Stratford athletics and cycling club, will use them for increasing participation in sport. It is therefore crucial to ensure that we have regard to the desirability of promoting the interests of voluntary and community organisations and sports clubs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_205">The Minister will not be surprised that I support Government amendments Nos. 19 and 20 because they are the same as those that I tabled in Committee. By withdrawing them, I gave the Minister the opportunity to bring them back and claim the credit. I welcome the fact that he has stuck to his commitment. They may not appear especially important since they simply change the word &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;, but they are none the less significant because it is clear that, for example, in advertising A-frames, it is important to have regard to amenity and public safety. As I pointed out in Committee, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is especially hot on those matters and insists that amenity and public safety are taken into account when local authorities and others decide whether to accept outdoor advertising and signs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has produced a guidance note on that, so I was anxious to follow that Department&#039;s instructions in the case of the Olympics. The Minister assured us that he would consider that. He has done so and I am delighted that he has agreed that the matter is crucial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_206">Amendment No. 4 is equally critical. As the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent pointed out, clause 18 describes the regulations that govern advertising in the vicinity of the London Olympic events. It gives the Secretary of State power to place restrictions on the physical locations of advertising about the games. However, in its current form, the measure does not provide a definitive start date by which the regulations come into effect. Many people therefore believed that it was important to include a clear date.

<a name="51206-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_209">For some of us, it is rather difficult to check whether what the Minister said was entirely accurate. The technical manuals are somewhat different to get hold of. They seem to be locked away in safes to which only very few people have access. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister says from a sedentary position that we must trust him and that he got that right. When I wrote to the Minister, along with the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent, I pointed out that we had managed to get hold of the code to the safe and that we had examined what the manuals said. The manuals say that the IOC requires host countries to apply restrictions on the physical location of advertising only for a maximum of two weeks before the Olympic games, not four.

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_210">I was grateful that having written to the Minister, he graciously acceded to the slight error that he had made. In the letter that we received of 30 November, he said:

<a name="stpa_212">That was the position earlier, but if it is to be two weeks that will not be gold-plating.

<a name="stpa_213">Given that the Minister has written in a letter precisely what he intends to do, it seems not unreasonable on this occasion for him to accept the amendments. They would simply put into the Bill what the Minister, somewhat belatedly, has accepted would be the right way forward. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s positive response to the amendments. I note that he points to his brief, which seems to indicate that we might be in for some success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_214">I hope that we shall also have some success with the other amendments. Amendment No. 5 represents an attempt to ensure that a range of media should receive appropriate exemption from legislation regarding advertising in the vicinity of the games. The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent has made exactly the right point&#151;there have been one or two exemptions but the scope should be widened. What would it be like for a member of the public to be reading a newspaper while standing in the vicinity of an Olympic event? Someone could be looking over that person&#039;s shoulder or, even worse, given that television cameras would be able to view it, someone could look through a television camera and see an advertisement in that newspaper. We are deeply concerned about this, and scope of the exemptions needs to be extended to include newspapers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_215">What about someone who is holding out his mobile phone and on it, as is sadly the case these days, there are advertising images? That could be in contravention of advertising rules. What about someone who is listening to their portable radio? Let us say that it is on a commercial channel and an advertisement appears on it? Clearly, that could be a breach of the rules unless we have the right exemptions in respect of advertising within the vicinity of an Olympic event. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_216">Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 relate to similar issues but focus on the consultation that will take place. It is surely right and proper that we have guarantees set out in the Bill about who will be consulted about the regulations, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 803</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because a number of bodies must be consulted. A list appears in the Bill, but, sadly, all the people whom we think should appear are not included.. The Minister thought that we were on to quite a jolly good idea. In Committee, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;I am sorry that you were not able to join us in these exciting events&#151;the Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;The hon. Member for Bath made a point about consulting the advertising industry.

<p>
<a name="51206-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_217">We already have a list of bodies that are to be consulted, but the advertising industry is not on that list. The Minister has said that it would be foolish not to include it in the list of consultees, so it would be extremely strange if the Minister did not accept a modest amendment to include that industry in the list in the Bill. That is equally true of those people who have to vet advertisements. In particular, television advertisements must be prepared a long time in advance, so we need to be sure that those who are responsible for vetting such advertisements will be consulted. That is why amendment No. 7 refers to those who have a relevant responsibility for regulating the advertising industry. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to accept the amendment.

<a name="stpa_218">I hope also that the amendment will provide the Minister with an opportunity to say a little more to those who are responsible for preparing advertising and for clearing advertising about what he has in mind with time scales. The Minister has had detailed consultations with representatives of the industry, which I know that they have welcomed. They have reminded him repeatedly of the long time scale that is needed, very often, to prepare advertisements. Some advertisements that the industry might be using in 18 months&#039; time will already be in preparation. The industry needs to know when those advertisements might fall foul of the regulations once they come into force. It is crucial that those concerned are consulted. It is crucial also that they be given an assurance that the regulations will not come into effect in the immediate future. Every one of the amendments in this group is worthy of support by the Minister and by the House, and I hope that they will be given that support.

<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51206-24_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andy Reed: </b> 
 I wish briefly to speak in support of amendment No. 2. Whether it is carried is a different matter, but I hope that it is recognised that for all of us who are interested in community sports and how the Olympics can be used&#151;not by commercial organisations; I fully understand the requirement to prevent ambush marketing&#151;there are some fine lines between what is acceptable and what is not, and what can be regarded as community services. Having met some of those involved in brand protection, I fully understand just what needs to be done and the dangers involved. The wording of the amendment may not be perfect, but I hope that the Minister will take on board some of the comments that have been made in the House.

<a name="stpa_219">Some Members have suggested that our sports colleges be renamed Olympics sports colleges for 2012. Each of us has individuals in our constituencies who are

<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 804</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>interested in promoting sports development by using the 2012 brand. I recognise that it is important that that brand is protected, but there must be some way in which many voluntary organisations and sporting organisations, including small clubs and individuals who come together to promote the Olympics and the build-up of sport development, are at least allowed to take that forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_220">I hope that in his discussions, particularly with the organising committee, the Minister will find a way of ensuring that there is some flexibility so that people are not put off at this early stage. As chair of the county sports partnership in Leicestershire, I have experience of many individuals coming forward with great ideas to brand themselves&#151;for example, a half marathon that is built on 2012 branding, leading up to the Olympics. There are children and teenagers who would love to have been Olympians but, like me, recognise that they stand no chance of achieving that. At the same time, they wish to play some part in the Olympics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_221">I have an interest in developing volunteers. For many people, the concept of the Olympics will be what they can contribute to the event, not what they can get out of it. Many people are asking, &quot;What will my town or my constituency get out of the Olympics?&quot; One of the great things about volunteering is that people will be able to put something in and thereby get something out of the event. At the same time, they will be making a major contribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_222">As for volunteering, most people do not have access to all the information about regulations. They just know that they have a good idea which they would like to see through. I hope that they do not become fearful of even suggesting using the branding for 2012 because of possible difficulties. I have been told about examples of events that are highly dubious&#151;I heard yesterday of a wet T-shirt competition that used the five rings. I shall not go into detail about how they were used, but that is the sort of thing that London 2012 is dealing with regularly. It stretches the definition of &quot;voluntary&quot; and &quot;community&quot;. I do not want such events to be encouraged because there are clearly commercial elements to some of them, but I hope that the Minister and others are cognisant of the difficulties facing genuine sports and voluntary groups that want to make major use of the 2012 Olympics to develop sport. We must ensure that they will not be put off. We may go too far if we do not take on board some of the points that are made in the amendments.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="51206-24_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Maria Miller  (Basingstoke) (Con):</b> 
 I would like briefly to speak in support of amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 7. The Olympics is a unique opportunity in the history of our country to build not only sporting participation at grass-roots level and sporting excellence, but pride in our people, our country, our achievements and indeed our communities. We should all do a lot more of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_223">In Committee, the Minister stated strongly that he felt that the Bill as drafted would not deter communities, sports clubs and voluntary organisations from becoming fully involved in the Olympics in whatever way was felt fit and that the correct balance would be struck. While I of course take him at his word, the Bill does little to back that up and, with the greatest respect to him, it is highly unlikely that he will be in place throughout the life of the Bill. Therefore, I support the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 805</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>amendment to ensure that what is currently, according to the Minister, implicit in the Bill becomes a little more explicit and that LOCOG is required to have regard to the involvement of sports clubs and interest groups in what will be, I am sure, a historic event for our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_224">This is one of the most prestigious sporting events in the world and its value is widely appreciated among those who may be approached to be sponsors. Many worldwide sponsors, including Visa, which is a major employer in my constituency, have been sponsors since 1986, showing that we have quite a lot of repeat purchase in the market. The Government need to ensure that they maximise the benefits for the country in the broadest way, as well as protecting the interests of those sponsors. It is a two-way street. As the Minister agreed in Committee, it is a question of balance. There is an important balance to be struck. That has been reiterated by other third parties, including Arup in the report that it was commissioned to undertake in May 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_225">We raised the issue in Committee. As I said, the Minister stated that sports clubs and other organisations could participate. Indeed, he went a little further and said that they would receive &quot;class exemptions&quot;, but I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) that, as a result of discussions with LOCOG, it has become clear subsequently that the blanket exemptions may not be as forthcoming as the Minister originally anticipated. That has served to underpin the growing concern among differing communities and sports groups that their role may be somewhat squeezed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_226">We have heard from my hon. Friend about community groups such as Soul in the City and the YMCA, which share our concern that the Bill could undermine their good plans to involve youth in our communities, particularly in London, in building sports involvement as part of the Olympics as a whole. I have taken the opportunity to speak to a number of major worldwide sponsors and there is a lot of agreement that the community dimension of the games is vital and something that they will pursue vigorously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_227">The Minister may want to consider the fact that, just as ambush marketing can undermine the value of sponsorship, so our communities and sporting organisations can feel marginalised by their treatment within this historic event. That is something that is well worth considering. He may wish to pursue that matter, as I have, in conversations directly with some of the sponsors, because it was most enlightening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_228">Community groups can benefit from involvement in the Olympics in many ways, including through fund-raising events for teams. We must ensure that we involve every resident of our country, not just those living within the M25 or in the vicinity of the locations for the sporting events, in promoting grass-roots sports. The Bill is not explicit in its commitment to non-commercial, voluntary organisations. The amendment makes the Minister&#039;s verbal reassurances much more tangible and would provide a hook for those organisations to lobby LOCOG to agree a framework within which they can operate in support of the games. That will help many 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 806</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>organisations such as the ones we have spoken about and others to plan their contributions to this historic celebration with a little more certainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_229">On amendment No. 7, the elements of the Bill that relate to advertising and marketing are highly regulated. As my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent and the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, the IOC manuals relating to this aspect of the Bill are not freely available to us. While the Minister was kind enough to enable us to see extracts of those in Committee, they raised as many questions as they answered. He confirmed that the manuals would be subject to change until a date that has not yet been confirmed. Amendment No. 7 would ensure that, if a change is required in the manuals or in any aspect of the Bill that relates to advertising and marketing, the industry will be consulted. Any unforeseen impact on business could undermine not just the role of businesses and marketing in the Olympics, but the economic benefit of the Olympics for our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_230">My objective in speaking today is simple. We need to ensure that the London Olympics benefits as many people as possible and that we strike the right balance, on which we are rather short of the mark at the moment.

<p><a name="st_182"><a name="51206-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 This group of amendments relates to the regulations that will be put in place under clause 18 to control advertising in the vicinity of Olympic venues. The provisions are a direct result of the requirements of the IOC and the promises that we have given in signing the host city contract. They are measures that will make an important contribution to the viability and success of the London games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_231">What I am also clear about, and what I have tried to provide reassurance about in Committee, is that we intend to take a reasonable and proportionate approach to the IOC&#039;s requirements. That means adopting a flexible and balanced approach and ensuring the regulations are appropriate for each and every venue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_232">Amendment No. 2 would require the Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of promoting the interests of voluntary and community organisations and sport clubs when making advertising regulations under clause 18. I understand the sentiments behind the amendment. I share the desire of the hon. Members for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) and for Bath (Mr. Foster) to ensure that the games in 2012 benefit all sections of society and all parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_233">As the IOC made clear in its memorandum to the Bill&#039;s Standing Committee, the rationale behind the requirements to control advertising is to maintain clean venues and to prevent the unauthorised commercial exploitation of the games. The memo states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;all venues must be free of commercial, political or religious advertising&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_234">While that statement does not explicitly refer to advertising by voluntary or community groups, I know that the IOC would not want us to create a situation where its clean venue policy is compromised. However, before I am accused of being unreasonable by inhibiting the good work of voluntary and community groups, I should reassure hon. Members that subsection (7)(b) of clause 18 allows for authorised advertising within the

<br>&nbsp;<br>vicinity of Olympic venues and that we will consider the case for allowing some forms of advertising by voluntary or community groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_235">I can absolutely see the case for allowing some voluntary or sporting organisations to be able to hand out flyers to people leaving Olympic venues in order, for example, to encourage them to become sports volunteers in their community, or to visit their local sports hall to give handball a try for the first time and to gain that experience. However, that sort of activity must be done in a measured and controlled way if we are to maintain the IOC&#039;s clean venue policy and ensure the viability and success of both the London and future games. Clause 18(7) is the best way to make that happen, so I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.

<a name="51206-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_236">Amendment No. 4 would include in the Bill a defined time limit during which the advertising regulations can apply. Clause 18(6) already requires that the regulations establish the period for which they will apply, and that they may apply only for such a period as is necessary to comply with the requirements of the host city contract. As I said earlier, we are determined to ensure that we apply those requirements in a sensible and reasonable way. In Committee, I said that the advertising regulations would not apply for longer than the Olympics period, which the Bill defines as starting four weeks before the opening ceremony.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_237">Having discussed this issue further with the IOC, I can confirm that any advertising restrictions will be in place two weeks before the opening ceremony at the absolute earliest, as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said. In reality, I envisage that the restrictions will apply for a much shorter period, especially for venues that host only one or two days-worth of competition. Given the variety of time periods for which the restrictions will apply, I do not think it sensible to specify in the Bill the maximum period for which the regulations can apply. However, I hope that the Bill&#039;s existing provisions&#151;particularly clause 18(6)&#151;and the clear assurances that I have given will reassure the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent that we intend to take a reasonable approach, and that he will withdraw his amendment.

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_239">Finally, I turn to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, which would require the Secretary of State to consult representatives of the advertising industry before drawing up regulations under clause 18, and before varying the list of words and phrases in schedule 3. The advertising industry will obviously take a keen interest in the new advertising regulations and any changes to the words and phrases listed in schedule 3. I put on the record that we shall consult the advertising industry in drawing up regulations under clause 18&#151;as we have done in drawing up the Bill&#151;and in making any amendments to the lists of words and phrases in schedule 3. I draw hon. Members&#039; attention to clause 22, which, among other things, requires the Olympic delivery authority to liaise with the people likely to be affected by regulations expected to be made under clause 18.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_240">The advertising industry will not be the only stakeholders affected by the advertising regime; local businesses and residents, for example, may also have an interest in it. I am not sure, therefore, that it is helpful to widen the Bill&#039;s existing list of consultees, as it could never be exhaustive. In my view, the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that the interests of the advertising industry and of others are considered, and that their voices are heard. The Government and LOCOG have already established a very good dialogue with the advertising industry, and we shall continue to ensure they are fully engaged in the development of regulations under clause 18, and in any changes made to the list of words and phrases in schedule 3. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_241">I turn to the question of the ambush market and exempting voluntary organisations and sports clubs from restrictions. Amendment No. 2 applies only to clause 18, which deals with advertising in the vicinity of Olympic venues. Under schedule 3, which we shall debate later, we have provided that LOCOG can authorise people to associate themselves with the games. We should not create a loophole that can be exploited, but I do envisage voluntary community groups being given certain authorisation. We considered this very issue in drafting the Bill, but we came to the conclusion that creating such a blanket exemption would provide a very wide defence that could be open to abuse. For example, we might want to allow all local junior athletics clubs to associate themselves with the games; on the other hand, we might not want major football teams such as Manchester United to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_242">We have sought to address this issue by giving LOCOG the ability to grant the authorisations provided for in paragraphs 4 and 5 to schedule 3. The amendments that we made in Committee allow LOCOG to make class exemptions, and require it to maintain a public register of people, and of classes of people, who are authorised to associate themselves with the games. Those amendments were tabled with schools and voluntary organisations specifically in mind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_243">I undertake to consider exempting mobile phones from the advertising restrictions when the regulations are made. We intend to be reasonable in our approach to regulations made under clause 18, but as was made clear in Committee, between now and 2012 there will be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 809</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>considerable advances in technology and in the ways of the ambush market. I have given a commitment in respect of newspapers, magazines, radio and television, but I cannot provide a blanket exemption for mobile telephony at this stage. Although I can reassure the hon. Member for Bath that the mobile services currently available will almost certainly be exempt, we must future-proof this provision by leaving it somewhat open-ended, so that we can deal with any advances in technology between now and 2012.
</p>





<p><a name="st_187"><a name="51206-25_spnew4"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 Before the Minister moves on to the two extremely exciting Government amendments, I should point out that although he talked about his commitment to consulting the industry about the development of regulations under clause 18, he did not deal with the reference in amendment No. 7 to consulting
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_244">Surely the Minister accepts that, for example, the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre needs to be consulted on the regulations, not least because otherwise, it could pre-clear an advertisement that is subsequently seen to fall foul of the new regulations. Presumably, it could even be sued as a result of such pre-clearing. Will the Minister clarify that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_188"><a name="51206-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I would expect the BACC to be consulted, but let me put this issue into context. We are talking about a national organisation, LOCOG, which is responsible to the IOC. Its current chairman&#151;hopefully he will continue as chairman through to 2012&#151;is Lord Coe, who is supported ably by Keith Mills. These people will not go out of their way to take the draconian steps that some Members have suggested this evening. We are giving LOCOG powers which we believe are commensurate with its fulfilling its obligations to the IOC. I am sure that those people will interpret the powers that they have been given and the actions that they can take with common sense. There will be consultation and we shall take a common-sense attitude to it.

The Government and LOCOG have a duty&#151;not just to the IOC but to council tax payers in London and to others who will finance the games&#151;to ensure that we deliver on these issues.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_249">We appear to have done much business in Committee on 18 October, as every reference I have made to Committee has been from that date. It is therefore appropriate to cite the Minister&#039;s comments on this issue:

<a name="stpa_250">We all agree with that. In Loughborough, Bath and Sheffield, we are all looking forward to all the nations and regions benefiting from the games. For those of us who live in England, the regional development agencies will have a crucial role to play in helping to facilitate the participation of the regions and sub-regions. Therefore, nobody would be surprised to see that clause 35 states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;The purposes of a regional development agency (listed in section 4 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 (c. 45)) shall include the purpose of preparing for the London Olympics.&quot;</p>

<a name="51206-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_251">That is right and proper and I am delighted that it is the case. However, hon. Members who have studied the Bill will note that the clause also states:

<a name="51206-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_252">In other words, the RDAs, which should play a key role in helping the regions and sub-regions to prepare for the Olympic games, will be able to do so only if they are authorised by the ODA. The ODA will have an iron grip on RDAs&#039; ability to prepare for the Olympics.

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_253">The RDAs have become increasingly concerned by clause 35, largely because&#151;I confess&#151;I kept drawing it to their attention and asking what they thought about it. They believe that it could limit their scope in preparing for the games. They are concerned about the possible confusion over the relative powers and leverages of the respective parties involved. They are concerned about the perceived leadership role given to the ODA over regional involvement in the games, instead of a co-ordinating role. The RDAs are also concerned about the potential funding consequences if the ODA asks them to do things outside their normal corporate plans or funding limits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_254">I have no doubt that the Minister will assure me that the RDAs need not be concerned, but I hope that he will spell out in some detail how he sees the relationship between the RDAs and the ODA operating. We already know that the RDAs are working actively to promote participation and involvement in the games and I hope that the Minister will reassure me that that work will not be put in jeopardy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_255">If the RDAs are to be in some way limited by a body, should it be the ODA? The ODA is largely responsible for the major infrastructure work and transport plans, and in some parts of the country the RDAs will be involved. The South West of England Regional Development Agency, for example, will be involved in the infrastructure in Weymouth, where the sailing will take place. It may also be involved in work around the beautiful city of Bath, because of our potential involvement. But the RDAs will want to be involved in far more than the necessary structural work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_256">LOCOG is the other body with a crucial role to play and hon. Members who did not have the chance to participate in our deliberations in Committee may not know where it fits in on the wonderful diagrams that we received from the Minister. LOCOG will have a nations and regions sub-committee, led by Charles Allen. We all admire the work that he did in helping us to win the bid and I am sure that we will admire the work that he will do chairing that reinvigorated and reformed nations and regions sub-committee.
</p>

<p>

Although I am deeply concerned about the ODA&#039;s apparent iron grip on the RDAs, if there is to be an iron grip, should not it be the responsibility of LOCOG?

 Strangely, a consensus is building across the Chamber. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). As he knows, in Committee I asked what the structure for the nations and regions would look like. In the east midlands, we had a chart that showed our suggestions for part of that. For the reasons that he outlined, it looked quite complicated because it included the supporting blocks, such as tourism, sport and economic regeneration.

As I have been involved with the Bill and taken some interest in it, people from all over the region have been asking me what they should do and how to get the process started. Over the past few months, part of our remit has been to encourage people to have ideas but to slow down until the organisation is in place, so that we can co-ordinate them, through the RDA and the nations and regions sub-committee, into LOCOG.

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_262">The hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted the slight contradiction in subsection (2)&#151;that the ODA, which, I understand, is really the delivery agency for building the infrastructure, mainly in London but also in Weymouth and other Olympic venues, is a different body. I look forward to an explanation, as I am concerned to ensure that there is a single route and that we do not complicate it so much that none of us knows how to proceed, as happens in other areas of the sporting world. This is a golden opportunity to lay clearly on the line who is responsible and who has the final say, so that all the people who have great enthusiasm for the Olympics know how to co-ordinate all their fantastic ideas&#151;such as those I have heard about from people in Leicestershire&#151;and how to get a yes from the nations and regions group, so that we can deliver between now and 2012.
</p>





<p><a name="st_201"><a name="51206-26_spnew3"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 I have a parochial concern relating to my Kent constituency that is also shared by Essex. Both counties are geographically next to the Olympics in the east end and feel constrained by having to work through a regional sports board, which, in the case of Kent, is diametrically on the opposite side of London. The Minister is aware of those concerns and has kindly agreed to fix a meeting with the chairman of the nations and regions sub-committee, and I thank him for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_263">I shall leave amendment No. 15 entirely to the Minister and comment on Government amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 27. The Minister warned us in Committee of the need for the amendments and included them in his briefing to Opposition parties a fortnight ago. They streamline the process of compulsory purchase for special land for the Olympic park, and clarify the fact that special land can be built on for Olympic purposes. They also allow RDAs to purchase compulsorily Crown land for the 2012 Olympics.

<a name="51206-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_264">Clearly, if we are to meet tight construction deadlines, it is vital to remove possible delays from the process.

<p><a name="st_202"><a name="51206-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Before I move on the detail of the amendment, I want to note that the nations and regions sub-committee under the chairmanship of Charles Allen is performing an extremely worthwhile task of co-ordinating not only RDAs but regional sports boards. All the regions have been asked to prepare a strategy, as we want to maximise across the whole UK the benefits that will flow from 2012. We hope to put a full-time person in each nation and region in the early part of next year to ensure that that co-ordination brings a two-way stream of information. We heard earlier about the supply chains that will be necessary for building the infrastructure in London and we hope that such co-ordination will facilitate that development. There is no difference of opinion about the opportunities, the structure that we are setting up, or the leadership of the sub-committee by Charles Allen. I have ministerial responsibility for that, too.

<a name="51206-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_265">The amendment is similar to one proposed and withdrawn by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) in Committee. I apologise if I did not make it clear at that point why we cannot accept the proposal, and I am sorry if I repeat some of what I said then. RDAs are already able to engage in valuable preparatory work for the London Olympics. Before the ODA exists, the London Development Agency, in particular, has put in much valuable work, to which I have already referred. The LDA is leading on the process of land acquisition in the Lea Valley, and the Government amendments in this group are designed to make sure that the process is successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_266">The RDAs are able to undertake that sort of work under existing regeneration powers and the Bill does nothing to change that. So RDAs will still be able to buy land and built facilities with an Olympic purpose, without having to consult anybody, provided that they are also pursuing one of their existing statutory purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_267">The Bill provides RDAs with a new purpose&#151;to prepare for the London Olympics&#151;which means that if it proves necessary they will be able to buy land and build facilities that have only an Olympic purpose and provide no other lasting benefit. It is clear that that is an additional power; they can add it to their portfolio if they are asked to develop or deliver an Olympic-specific project. It is unlikely that such a power will ever be needed, but we have provided for it on the &quot;just-in-case&quot; principle. We do not want to be left in a situation where the ODA needs an RDA to buy some land in Weymouth, for example, by compulsory purchase, but the RDA is not able to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_268">Subsection (2) states that an RDA may use that new, Olympic-specific power only at the ODA&#039;s request. That is because we do not want RDAs all over the country to be carrying out work for the Olympics where that work is clearly not part of the RDAs&#039; general mission to regenerate their local areas. The Olympics will provide many opportunities for regeneration and we welcome and encourage such activity, but we do not want the games to result in white elephants all over the country.

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="51206-26_spnew5"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 The Minister is repeating much of what he said in Committee, which, frankly, was unacceptable then and is unacceptable now. May I ask him a specific question? In the south-west, our RDA is in the process&#151;properly&#151;of establishing an Olympic delivery structure, which involves Sport England and the Government office for the south-west and will involve Dorset county council. The RDA is considering how to liaise with the seven sub-regions so that they can benefit from and participate in the Olympics in 2012. The Minister is talking about land acquisition, but I am much more interested in all the other activities, such as promoting tourism, attracting visitors and increasing participation in sport. Will he assure me that the 1998 legislation enables those organisations to do that, and that they will not be found to be in breach of the existing legislation?

 Absolutely not. In 1998 I took that Bill through Parliament, setting up the RDAs, and they were founded on exactly those principles. In fact, tourism has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 815</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the recent past been added to their remit, and therefore they have every power. Nothing in the description that the hon. Gentleman has given would require a departure from the powers that were given to RDAs in the 1998 Act, because that will be about sustainable regeneration and development and wealth creation for that region. The power that is given in this Bill relates to projects that are Olympic-specific and do not have after that use a purpose for which the RDAs were set up&#151;regeneration and wealth creation. If, for example, a stadium was built and then knocked down after the Olympics because there was no after-use, that would not be within the remit of the RDA, but it would be given the powers to do that, at the behest of the ODA, so it could build that facility and then knock it down, and that would be the power that was given by this Bill to the RDAs. I hope that that is clear, Madam Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<a name="51206-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_269">Now I have lost my place, but I think that I have adequately explained to the hon. Member for Bath&#151;well, I am not sure about adequately, but I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_270">I shall now discuss amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 27. Amendments Nos. 17 and 27 are proof of the Government&#039;s commitment to ensuring that the RDAs have the powers that they need to help the process of Olympic development. It is vital that the land needed for the Olympics is acquired quickly and without legal doubt attached to its status. The timetable for acquisition, remediation and construction is so tight that even a delay of a couple of months could be disastrous. The amendments that we have tabled address all the problems that could possibly obstruct this process, wherever an RDA is acquiring land, at any site anywhere the United Kingdom. They ensure that the necessary land can be assembled on budget, without delay and that it can be used for Olympic development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_271">We are proposing these amendments at a relatively late stage because the need for them became clear only in the short period after 6 July when the project became a reality and the plans were worked through in detail. As a result of that work, we have tabled amendment No. 17, which would have four crucial effects wherever an RDA purchased land for the purpose of preparing for the Olympics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_272">First, paragraph (a) removes the need for a special parliamentary process to approve the compulsory purchase of &quot;special land&quot; where equivalent land is not being provided in exchange. Special land consists of allotments, open space and commons. The special parliamentary process would take up to six months and simply cannot be accommodated in the timetable for Olympic construction. I am satisfied that no one will suffer unduly as a result of this step. While the LDA is not able to provide &quot;equally advantageous land&quot; in sufficient amounts to replace all the special land that will be used during the games, those who make specific use of the land will, I believe, get a good deal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_273">The LDA is committed by conditions of its planning permission to provide replacement facilities to those affected by the purchase of special land. Footballers, allotment holders and cyclists will all be provided with replacement facilities for the duration of the period. After the games, they will get new facilities&#151;East Marsh will be restored and allotments and a velo park will be provided within the Olympic park itself. And the park 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 816</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will provide more open space to the residents of the lower Lea valley than currently exists today, so no one, we believe, will lose out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_274">Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 17 has the effect of extinguishing all existing rights over land acquisition, while providing for compensation to those who have rights removed. It is essentially the same provision that exists in the Housing Act 1985 to allow local housing authorities to develop land after it has been cleared. The risk that we are addressing through this provision is that there are a large number of restrictive covenants that constitute potential obstacles to development of that park. There are approximately 500 covenants affecting land needed for the Olympics in east London. Most are deemed unenforceable, but there are a number of covenants that case law suggests might be enforced, preventing the development of the land. These include a covenant that prevents the land on which the Olympic stadium will be sited being used for sports halls, and a covenant preventing land needed for the main access ramp to the stadium from being used &quot;for athletic or sporting purposes&quot;. Clearly, we cannot carry such a risk, and therefore this amendment is crucial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_275">Paragraph (c) of the amendment provides absolute clarity that &quot;special land&quot;, once acquired, can be built on. There is some unhelpful case law at present that casts doubt on the meaning of the relevant provision in the 1998 Act, which allows RDAs to use &quot;special land&quot; in accordance with planning permission. We want to ensure that we run no risk of legal challenge or hold-up, and the amendment to achieve that is before the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_276">Finally, paragraph (d) allows the compulsory purchase of Crown land and any interest in Crown land. At present there is some doubt about whether it is legally possible, and while we are not aware of a particular area of land where this is a problem, we would not want to be faced with that problem at a later stage. The one area of Crown land affected by the LDA&#039;s initial CPO, around Stratford City, has been the subject of successful negotiations between the LDA, the Government and London and Continental Railways. We do not expect that the new powers will be needed to acquire that land, but we want to provide a failsafe, to ensure that the RDAs have sufficient powers to take control of Crown land anywhere in London or in the UK if necessary. The provision may never need to be used, but we believe that it is an important safeguard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_277">Amendment No. 18 allows for the provisions relating to compulsory purchase to be commenced immediately on Royal Assent, to ensure that they apply to the LDA&#039;s existing CPO as it goes through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_278">Amendment No. 27 allows for the provisions in amendment No. 17 to be backdated where that is necessary. Provisions amending the law on special land and Crown land must apply to the two major CPOs that the LDA has already launched, on 10 October and 16 November. We have therefore provided that these provisions are, or can be, backdated to 1 October 2005, to ensure that there is no special parliamentary process needed for the &quot;special land&quot; currently being acquired; that such &quot;special land&quot; can be built on for Olympic purposes; and that any Crown land&#151;or interests in Crown land&#151;that falls in the area of the CPO could be compulsorily purchased if need be.

<a name="51206-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_279">The power to override restrictive covenants needs to be broader in its effect, since the LDA has been acquiring land in the Olympic park area for the past two years. It needs to be absolutely sure that it can overcome any problematic covenants that are attached to this land. We have therefore proposed a power to provide in the commencement order for the extinguishing of covenants on land that had been acquired before commencement.

<a name="stpa_280">These are complex amendments, but they are tightly focused to deal with specific problems that we could face, and they are tied to the specific circumstances where an RDA is acquiring land for Olympic purposes. They are essential to the success of the public sector construction project.

 The Minister has convinced us all with the way in which he has spoken to his amendments, and I for one have no problem in supporting them, but, as I said in an intervention, he has not convinced me yet in respect of his objection to amendment No. 15, so just to make my life and the life of the RDAs easier, I am going to ask the Minister to intervene on me when I ask him a simple question. Can he give me and the House an absolute assurance that any RDA that is currently, under its existing abilities under the 1998 legislation, using its money and time to co-ordinate or develop Olympic-related volunteering activities, Olympic-related jobs and contract activities, Olympic-related sporting events, Olympic cultural and artistic events and Olympic educational activities, and is giving advice to bodies about how, for instance, they set up training camps for visiting teams and is conducting, or plans to conduct, an audit of the facilities suitable for use during the Olympics, is acting within existing legislation?

<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51206-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 This group of Government amendments addresses a very constructive point made by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) in Committee and a smaller drafting point that we noticed afterwards. We are very magnanimous this evening, if I may say so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_281">Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are necessary to allow the commencement of clause 37 on Royal Assent. Clause 37 applies the provisions of the Bill as appropriate to Northern Ireland. Thus clause 37 on Northern Ireland will be brought into line with clause 36 on Scotland, which will commence on Royal Assent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_282">Amendment No. 16 follows the suggestion made by the Liberal Democrats in Committee that the short title should include a specific reference to the Paralympic games. I indicated in Committee that I agreed with that principle, as a central part of our bid was that the London Olympics would be an inclusive games. As many hon. Members know, London staged the first Paralympics in 1948, and we want to ensure that the 2012 Paralympics are the best so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_283">I could not accept the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats in Committee because it was important to get the IOC&#039;s view on the exact wording&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear laughter from the hon. Member for Bath. I promised to consider the issue and my officials have been in touch with the IOC. The result is the proposed amendment to make the short title the &quot;London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Bill&quot;.
</p>





<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51206-27_spnew5"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 Government amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are not contentious, and Government amendment No. 16 has the support of hon. Members on both sides of the House. I should like publicly to thank the Minister for fulfilling the promise that he made in Committee to introduce such amendments on Report and, indeed, to join in the general congratulations to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) on proposing them in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_284">As I said in Committee, I should like to add my strong support to the proposals in amendment No. 16. Paralympic sport has been moving up the sporting agenda considerably in recent years. As hon. Members on both sides of the House will be aware, at the 2004 Athens Paralympic games, the Great British team finished second in the medals table, with 94 medals, including a staggering total of 35 golds. The team achieved medals in 11 sports, and in doing so, met the target set by Phil Lane of the British Paralympic Association. It is only right, therefore, that Paralympic sport is recorded as part of the Bill. Once again, I reiterate my full support.

<p><a name="st_222"><a name="51206-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 Earlier, we discussed another amendment, the subject of which had been proposed in Committee by the Liberal Democrats, and the Minister went away to check it and has returned this evening with such an amendment. He was somewhat churlish in his attack on his own civil servants for not returning with a slightly differently worded amendment on that occasion. So I hope that, on this occasion, he will have the good grace to thank his civil servants who have suggested an amendment that is marginally different from the one that I proposed in Committee&#151;the word &quot;games&quot; has been added. I congratulate the Minister and his civil servants on their ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_285">I am genuinely delighted that&#151;having consulted the IOC&#151;as the Minister found it necessary to do and clearly did&#151;he is willing to accept such an amendment and to do what no one disputed from the outset: give equal emphasis to the Olympic and Paralympic games. As I said in Committee, it worth remembering that Seb Coe, who deserves a great deal of praise for his role in achieving our success in getting the games, said on 29 August:
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_287">Accepting such an amendment and placing equal emphasis on the Paralympic and Olympic games emphasises the responsibility on all of us to ensure that the games, London and the UK will be standard bearers for inclusion. We must place huge emphasis on ensuring that both the Olympic and the Paralympic games and all the facilities that relate to their provision are generally accessible to disabled people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_288">We have not had an opportunity on Report to discuss accessibility for disabled people, but the Minister will be well aware that there are continuing concerns about the need for more action in making transport facilities in London, venues and so on more friendly for disabled users. He shares my concern about that and has made assurances about it, but I hope that proposing amendment No. 16 to give equal emphasis to the Paralympic games will also remind him of the promises and commitments that he has made in respect of ensuring appropriate facilities for disabled people throughout the period of the Olympic and Paralympic games.
</p>





<p><a name="st_223"><a name="51206-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I hear what the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) says, and we went over this in Committee. We are very proud that we were the first country to hold the Paralympic games in 1948. Overall, we acknowledge the major contribution made by the Paralympics and disabled sport generally. Broadly speaking, sport across the UK responds to that. I hope that we will be at the forefront in designing stadiums and other facilities for the Olympics with disabled people in mind, and I am sure that we will deliver on that.

<p><a name="st_296"><a name="51206-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Government amendments Nos. 21 and 22 clarify the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can seek to remove words or phrases from the list contained in paragraph 3 of schedule 3 to the Bill. The amendments ensure that the Secretary of State can seek to remove words from the list if she feels that the London Olympic association right is becoming too unwieldy or that it is placing an unacceptable burden on businesses or advertisers. However, the amendments do not change the position that the Secretary of State can only add to, or vary, the lists in schedule 3 where that is necessary to prevent the commercial exploitation of the London Olympics. Any proposed change to the lists must still be debated and agreed to by both Houses of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_290">Amendment No. 23 brings the exemptions in schedule 3 into line with those that we have provided in relation the Olympics association right in schedule 2. The exemption relates to incidental inclusion in artistic, literary or dramatic works.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_291">Amendment No. 24 will simply remove a drafting anomaly that crept into paragraph 9 of schedule 3. It removes the word &quot;controlled&quot; because the concept of a controlled representation is relevant to schedule 2, but not schedule 3.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_292">I come now to the remaining amendments that relate to schedule 3. Amendment No. 8 would delay the commencement of the provisions in schedule 3 until 31 December 2007, although it is intended that the schedule will come into force on Royal Assent. The amendment would also cause schedule 3 to expire at the end of 2012, but clause 39(8) already provides for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_293">I understand that the advertising industry is concerned about the practical application of schedule 3 and the possibility that its members could unwittingly or unknowingly infringe the London Olympics association right in the period immediately after Royal Assent. However, that does not change the principle that we should prevent people from commercially exploiting the London games, whether they do so now or in the weeks immediately before the opening ceremony in 2012.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_294">There is also a practical reason why the provisions should commence on Royal Assent. Over the coming months, LOCOG will be approaching and identifying sponsors for 2012. It needs to be able to do that in a market free from unauthorised or ambush marketing. A 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 824</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>high-profile campaign that ambushed the 2012 games now could harm LOCOG&#039;s ability to attract the sponsorship that it needs, thus, in effect, preventing it from raising the money that is needed to finance the games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_295">Both we and LOCOG realise that there is some uncertainty, especially for advertisers, about what people can and cannot do under the new provisions. LOCOG is already working closely with the advertising industry to provide its members with advice and guidance on interpreting and applying the new provisions. Keith Mills met representatives of the advertising industry on 31 October to discuss their concerns, and last week he wrote to the Advertising Association to establish a process for how LOCOG and the Advertising Association can work together in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_296">In Keith&#039;s latest letter, he says that LOCOG will take a sympathetic view of any infringements that occur immediately after the Bill comes into force on the assumption that they are likely to be inadvertent. However, LOCOG must have the power, and reserve the right, to take action against any persistent and malicious infringements in those early months by people who deliberately exploit the good will of the games. The approach that we have adopted strikes the right balance between the need to protect the Olympic brand and the need to ensure that advertisers are appropriately informed about how the new provisions will work. I thus ask the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) not to press amendment No. 8 to a Division.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_297">Amendment No. 9 would allow people to bring a claim against LOCOG if it unjustifiably threatened to bring proceedings against them for a breach of schedule 3. In essence, the amendment aims to prevent LOCOG from acting in an unjustifiably heavy-handed manner when enforcing the provisions in schedule 3. We agree with hon. Members that that is an important principle, and we have already provided for it in paragraph 10(h) of schedule 3. Paragraph 10(h) will allow people to take action in relation to groundless threats regarding the London Olympics association right in the same way in which they currently can in relation to the Olympics association right under the Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act 1995.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_298">LOCOG has already said that its enforcement of schedule 3 will be proportionate and the steps that it has already taken bear that out. The experience of previous host cities is that a sensible balance is found and the organising committee, businesses and advertisers work closely together. I am sure that that will also be the case in London. The existing provisions in the Bill, the levers that the Government have in place with LOCOG, and LOCOG&#039;s commitment in the area mean that sufficient safeguards are in place to ensure that the powers in schedule 3 are not abused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_299">Amendments Nos. 10 to 14 all relate to the editorial and journalistic exemptions that we have created in paragraph 8 of schedule 3 to ensure that any form of legitimate editorial or journalistic work does not infringe the London Olympics association right. The principle of a journalistic and editorial exemption is obviously crucial. The proper balance must be struck between protecting the commercial viability of the London games on the one hand and preserving 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 825</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>legitimate editorial and journalistic comment on the other. In particular, we must be careful to avoid a situation in which someone is able to exploit the games commercially by hiding behind a journalistic defence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_300">We believe that the careful exemptions that we have crafted in paragraph 8 of the schedule achieve that. They safeguard the London Olympics association right and maintain the essential freedom of the press. The inclusion of the term &quot;necessary incident&quot; in our proposed editorial and journalistic exemption is designed to prevent gratuitous use of the London Olympics. We want to prevent the proliferation of advertorials, the real motive of which is commercial gain, rather than genuine editorial comment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_301">It is also important to remember that for the purposes of schedule 3, people create an association between themselves and the games only if, in the course of trade, they suggest a commercial or contractual relationship, or a corporate or structural connection, with the games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_302">It would be unlikely that most editorial or journalistic works would create such an association. However, we understand the concerns of the print and broadcast media about the issue and we have been discussing the matter with them over the past few months. I can reassure them and hon. Members that only overt and explicit attempts to create an association between a media owner, or other entities, and the Olympics will constitute an infringement under our provisions. All legitimate editorial and journalistic practices will be exempt from the provisions in schedule 3.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_303">Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would ensure that news, current affairs, criticism and review were all covered by our journalistic exemptions. Again, I confirm that the current drafting of the Bill exempts such journalistic practice. We have been very clear when settling the policy that underlies the Bill that all legitimate editorial and journalistic practices will be exempt from infringing the London Olympic association right. We are confident that the Bill, as drafted, addresses the concerns that hon. Members have raised.

<p><a name="st_297"><a name="51206-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s introductory remarks and some of the assurances that he has put on the record, which go a long way towards resolving our concerns. Nevertheless, I hope that he will accept that it is necessary for me to try to tease out a few more assurances from him as I discuss the amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_304">I have no problems whatsoever with Government amendments Nos. 21 and 22. I do not think that I have a problem with Government amendment No. 23, but I might have. I would be grateful for some clarification of that amendment because its effect will depend very much on the way in which its words are interpreted. The phrase

</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_305">could have many different meanings. The amendment makes it clear that the wording comes from the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Section 31 of the Act states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;Copyright in a work is not infringed by its incidental inclusion in an artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_306">However, the phrase &quot;incidental inclusion&quot; is not defined in that Act, and it is not being defined in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_307">No doubt, the Minister has researched the matter thoroughly and will be aware that the leading case on the definition of &quot;incidental inclusion&quot; is the 2003 Court of Appeal judgment in the case of the Football Association Premier League Ltd. <i>v.</i> Panini UK Ltd. The court decided that the test of &quot;incidental inclusion&quot; should consider why a particular reference had been made, and whether that was for commercial or artistic reasons. Panini sold stickers of football players with photos showing them in their premier league kit, including the premier league logo. It was decided that that was not incidental, as the use of the logo was essential to the object for which the images were created. Although intentional and deliberate inclusion of copyright work may still be incidental, if the work in which it is included is intended to serve a commercial purpose it is unlikely to be deemed incidental.
<a name="time_19">
<a name="51206-30_time0"><h5>8.30 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_308">Will the Minister give us a clear indication of the definition that he has in mind for the word &quot;incidental&quot; in the legislation? He may find it helpful to look at that judgment, as it considers the motives for incidental inclusion. As he rightly pointed out, what matters is whether someone is seeking to make an unfair commercial gain for exploitative purposes. He may find that interpretation helpful and he may wish to put it firmly on the record. If that is the case, we would support him as long as we do not implement such an interpretation too harshly, as we could limit many activities if we are not careful. If we go too far down the commercial route we could create difficulties for television broadcasts. For example, a programme may be commercially motivated because it wishes to make money from advertising transmitted during the broadcast. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister provided clarification, either now or later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_309">I wish to focus on the amendments on editorial content. The rules governing editorial content and the London Olympics association right are problematic because they are vague. The Minister provided some clarification today, and he had a second bite at the cherry in Committee, where he amended the wording of the Bill. However, there is still room for improvement. In Committee, the Minister explained that paragraph 8 of schedule 3 is designed to ensure that normal media editorial activities are not curtailed by the London Olympics association right. The provision describes editorial usage that is exempt from the rules governing the London Olympics association right&#151;namely, the publishing or broadcasting of information or reports on the Olympics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_310">The position appears to be clear until one considers the many permutations of editorial usage that are not included in the definition. Bona fide editorial activity could include news columns, features, readers&#039; letters, reviews, comment and analysis in newspapers. In broadcasting, it could include documentaries, drama, children&#039;s programmes, travel programmes, panel discussions and news. To encompass all aspects of legitimate editorial usage, we tabled amendment No. 10, which refers to
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;any editorial usage including without limitation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 827</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_311">Such usage would be exempt from the regulations governing the London Olympics association right. That is a simpler and more effective approach that prevents any form of editorial usage from being inadvertently omitted from the list. Time after time, the Minister has said that he does not like lists because something can always be added or removed from them. I have solved the problem with wording that removes the need for a list. However, the amendment does not risk opening the floodgates for illegitimate association with the Olympics, because it maintains a clear distinction between editorial and advertising usage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_312">Amendment No. 13 follows on from amendment No. 10 as it, too, attempts to ensure that all legitimate editorial association with the Olympics is not regarded as an infringement of the association right. Paragraph 8 of schedule 3 permits representation of the Olympics in information about the London Olympics. However, in the course of their editorial activities, the media may publish information about other events and activities in which the London Olympics are mentioned but are not the subject. For example, a news item about London transport could refer to the Olympic games, although the games are not the subject of that information. Similarly, a feature article about sport in the national curriculum could refer to the Olympics, but such a report is not about the Olympics. Such usage should be covered by paragraph 8 by virtue of its editorial status, not by virtue of its content or the nature of the subject matter. Amendment No. 13 allows this by removing the requirement that information must be about the Olympics and, in order to ensure that all bona fide editorial usage is safeguarded, inserts
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;including news and current affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_313">Amendment No. 14 builds on amendment No. 13 and allows information associated with the Olympics to be used specifically
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;for the purposes of criticism and review&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_314">Adding this category of editorial usage would ensure that further material such as comment pieces, readers&#039; letters and general reviews such as entertainment, leisure or travel are brought under the protective umbrella of paragraph 8.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_315">Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 have been tabled to remove the possibility that a statutory body, LOCOG, could have a say in determining what constitutes legitimate editorial content. The Bill confines exemptions to the London Olympics association right to representation

<a name="stpa_317">It is worrying that any statutory body should play a part in controlling editorial activities. How can such a situation pertain? The Newspaper Society is deeply concerned about it and states:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;For a statutory body to have any role in determining the content of a newspaper&#039;s editorial material would be without precedent and would represent an utterly unacceptable incursion into the freedom of the press, and a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998 as being contrary to Article 10 of the Convention.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="st_298"><a name="51206-31_spnew0"><b> Hugh Robertson: </b> 
 Time is marching on so I shall be brief. I thank the Minister for his comments in connection with amendment No. 9. In the light of his assurances, I am happy to leave the matter there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_322">On amendment No. 8, I wholly accept what the Minister says about LOCOG&#039;s desire to start the process of looking for sponsors early, and the fact that it needs the necessary safeguards if it is to do that. However, there are concerns in the advertising industry about the practical implications for advertising pre-clearance and copy advice. Television advertising, in particular, has long lead times. As we all know, advertisements can be 18 months in the making, and a campaign costs hundreds of thousands of pounds to produce and broadcast. There are serious and costly implications for advertisers and broadcasters if the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre, the BACC, has given clearance to a TV advertisement before it is broadcast, and its decision is subsequently overturned by LOCOG. It could, in theory, insist that the advertisement were withdrawn, but under this legislation it could also sue for damages and take out an injunction against the advertiser.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_323">Secondly, another, even more technical issue must be addressed before the Bill comes into effect. The committee of advertising practice, which is the code-owning body within the Advertising Standards Authority system, offers advertising copy advice on a voluntary basis in the non-broadcast media. I understand that the CAP has said that it is not in a position to give copy advice because the legislation will lie outside its self-regulatory British code of advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing, which the ASA 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_328">On Third Reading, it is worth taking a step back from the detail to remind the House why we have introduced this Bill and why the Bill is so important to the success of the London Olympics. We need the Olympics to be on time and on budget, which is why we must get the ODA up and running quickly as the single body responsible for planning and construction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_329">It is great that we now have a dynamic leadership team in place in Jack Lemley and David Higgins. I wish them both well. They have a proven track record in delivering huge projects, and they can now get on with the preparatory work that needs to be done on the setting up of the ODA. To do the rest of the job, they need the full set of powers and functions that the Bill provides in order to plan and construct venues and facilities, to co-ordinate the transport plan, and to maintain a clean Olympic environment. Through the Bill, we are able to ensure that the ODA is fully accountable to Ministers and to Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_330">The ODA will be at the centre of the Olympic project for the next seven years. After 2012, it will have a key role in helping to reconfigure Olympic venues and the Olympic park to ensure that the games result in real and lasting benefits for east London and for the whole United Kingdom.

: What consideration has been given to the conjunction of the Olympic games in 2012 with, if all goes well, the diamond jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen? Given that a large number of Commonwealth countries will take part in the Olympic games, is there any way in which the two events can be joined together, as it were, better to promote the United Kingdom across the world?
</p>





<p><a name="st_307"><a name="51206-31_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 That has been mentioned in several meetings at which I have been present, although not in any great detail. I take on board what the hon. Gentleman says and will ensure that it is reported to the relevant areas to see whether we can move it forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_331">The ODA, while central, is only one piece in the jigsaw. The Bill also ensures that where other organisations have key responsibilities for delivering the games, they have the legal powers that they need. For instance, the amendments we have discussed will ensure that regional development agencies, including the London Development Agency, have all the powers that they need to acquire the land required for the games, to time and to budget. The Mayor signed the host city contract on London&#039;s behalf, and the Greater London Authority will provide a significant slice of funding. The Bill provides the GLA with an Olympic power to ensure that those obligations are fulfilled and that the GLA is able to help prepare for and to manage the games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_332">Under the host city contract, LOCOG has a wide range of obligations to the IOC about how the games will be managed. Some of those obligations need to be reflected in the Bill, particularly the IOC&#039;s requirements on ticket touting and what it terms brand protection. Those have been among the most keenly debated parts of the Bill, especially where we are creating new intellectual property rights relating to London 2012 for LOCOG to protect. I repeat that the measures that we are taking to protect against ambush marketing are vital not only for the financial security of LOCOG and the

I hope that in the course of debates in Committee and on Report I have provided full reassurance that where new restrictions are being created they will be enforced in a proportionate and targeted fashion in consultation with the advertising industry and others. We must be firm in stopping those who want to rip off the Olympics, but we will not disrupt anyone&#039;s right to make an honest living.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_333">The quick passage of this Bill is the first milestone in the successful delivery of the 2012 games. The IOC has been particularly complimentary about the progress that we have made in getting the legislation this far this quickly. It is pleased that London has been so quick to get itself moving towards 2012. I thank the Opposition for helping us to make that happen. This is a good Bill that is better for the amendments that we have made to it. I commend it to the House.

 It is exactly five months since 6 July, when we won the games bid in Singapore. I want to finish my remarks on the Bill where I started on Second Reading by congratulating all those who worked so hard to bring the Olympic games to London. I say that not because it is a nice thing to say at the end of the passage of a piece of legislation but because I genuinely mean it. I pay tribute to Lord Coe, Keith Mills and everybody involved in the bid at London 2012. I congratulate the other shareholders: the Government, particularly the Prime Minister, who did so much in the days running up to the bid, the Secretary of State and the Minister, who has dealt with the Bill as it has gone through the House; the Mayor of London; and the British Olympic Association, especially the Princess Royal, who did particularly well in Singapore and has not, in some quarters, received the thanks that she deserves.

Although the Bill is not lengthy in parliamentary terms, it is quite complex, setting up a regional development agency in the Olympic Delivery Authority in the first half and establishing the ground rules for the commercial media rights in the second. I am pleased that we have found so much common ground, have been able to improve the Bill, and have been able to maintain cross-party support.

We also need the funds that are necessary to meet the British Olympic Association&#039;s objective of moving us from 10th to fourth in the medal table. There are also implications for non-Olympic sports, particularly mass-participation sports. It is feared that funds will be diverted from them to the Olympics.

<p><a name="st_309"><a name="51206-32_spnew0"><b> Lyn Brown  (West Ham) (Lab):</b> 
 For me, the central issue in the debate is whether the 2012 games are remembered not just for providing a truly world-class event for London, but for giving a lifelong legacy to east London, to London generally and to the United Kingdom. I believe that the Bill augurs well for the delivery of successful games, on time and to budget. Like the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson), however, I have three remaining concerns. First, there is the question of who will be held to account for the delivery of the legacy of the games. Secondly, there is the lack of reference to local government, along with its implications. Thirdly, there are the local difficulties caused to residents and businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_340">The physical legacy to my constituency is not in doubt. West Ham will look very different by 2012. Two thirds of the Olympic park and most of the facilities&#151;including the athletes&#039; village, the main stadium, the swimming pools, the media centre and the warm-up tracks&#151;will be in Newham, and 18 of the 26 events will take place within 20 minutes&#039; walk of Stratford station. We have been promised the creation of the largest capital-city park in Europe for 150 years, a park that will incorporate the venues but will also, symbolically and physically, unify communities. It will be the heart of a prestigious new development, Stratford City. The proposals will deliver more than 9,000 new homes in and around the Olympic park, with schools and health and community facilities to match. That is welcome news for my constituency and the surrounding area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_341">Newham has an exceptionally young population: 41 per cent. of its inhabitants are under 25. It is a poor constituency, bordering to the west and north on areas that are also poor. All its key indicators are in the bottom 10 of the list drawn up by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The promised legacy of the Olympics and the Paralympics would provide a sustainable solution to the poverty and disadvantage

<br>&nbsp;<br>experienced in my constituency and in other communities with similar social and economic indicators, and the Bill goes a long way towards embracing that aspiration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_342">One of the difficulties that I have with the drafting of the Bill is that clause 4(3) states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;the Authority shall, wherever relevant&#151; have regard to the desirability of maximising the benefits to be derived after the London Olympics from things done in preparation for them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_343">Will the Minister emphasise and underline that commitment, so that the words

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;have regard to the desirability&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_344">appear a little less soft and a bit more enthusiastic and emphatic?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_345">We said in the bid that we would radically transform London&#039;s east end and, through this sporting spectacle, regenerate a poor inner-city area. I recognise that that will be a huge challenge, and to achieve it, we must be clear about whose job it is. Who is to be responsible for overseeing the delivery of the legacy? If I understand the situation correctly, neither the London organising committee for the Olympic games&#151;LOCOG&#151;nor the Olympic Delivery Authority owns the responsibility for delivering the legacy for the country. Individual organisations are responsible for the delivery of bits of it&#151;for example, Sport England will be responsible for the sporting legacy, but which body will ensure that it is on track to deliver greater grass-roots participation? Who will be held accountable for the employment legacy, or for realising the health benefits? Who will be responsible for monitoring and scrutinising the different agencies charged with delivery of the various legacy plans?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_346">The reference in clause 4(3) is perhaps not designed to ensure the delivery of the greatest challenge to the games, namely the economic and social legacy. It was the whole package that prompted the huge support for the bid from ordinary Londoners and others, and we must not let them down. I hope that the Minister will consider establishing a formal mechanism and place official ownership of the responsibility for the legacy within the proposed delivery processes. The games are a catalyst to be seized or squandered. We need to plan for the social gains from the games, to set targets for the reduction of poverty, and to realise real social and economic change for the poorest in society from this huge investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_347">I get a sense of the potential of the legacy by considering the impact that the bidding process had on my constituency. As a councillor in the London borough of Newham, I led a two-year programme of sporting, cultural and community activity, using the pull of the Olympics to engage and inspire the community. By the end of the bidding process, there were clear, tangible benefits for the betterment of health, education and antisocial behaviour. For example, 43 per cent. of free swims were taken up by people in social groups D and E, and there were 64,000 attendances at Newham&#039;s Olympic summer of sport. The completion rates for exercise on prescription schemes went up from 34 to 52 per cent., and 40 new after-school clubs were founded around sport and physical activity. The number of sports coaches more than doubled, new disability sports 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 834</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clubs were established, and the West Ham Asians in Football programme was expanded. And 25 per cent. fewer young people were reported to the local magistrates court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_348">There are many more similar examples, and if all that can be achieved by local authority leadership around the bid process alone, the social legacy of the games themselves could be truly life-transforming. Those schemes required funding and were achieved by a combination of mainstream and temporary funding. The gains were achieved by local government working in the community. This was not rocket science, and I am sure that examples such as those have been and will be replicated by other local authorities across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_349">If we are to get real social and economic benefits from the games, local government must be integral to the planning and delivery of the soft outcomes for social and economic regeneration. In October 2000, the Government charged local government with the duty to provide for the economic, social and environmental well-being of its own areas. They did so because local government is best placed to deliver those objectives locally; it is part of its core business. We need to ensure that local government is at our Olympic table, leading on clearly drawn and resourced local renewal and regeneration strategies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_350">The job of realising the legacy is too big for one tier of government, whether national, regional or local. The job can only be done successfully if all tiers of government and the voluntary, community and private sector work together in partnership towards the same objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_351">We must remember that renewal and regeneration will come at a price for some in the area where the games are to be held. Local businesses will be displaced because of the need to create space for the Olympic park stadium. Estimates suggest that more than 300 businesses will be affected by the proposals. Companies are increasingly concerned by the action or, they feel, lack of action by the London Development Agency. Negotiations have been under way for a long time and no conclusions have yet been reached. That is placing reputable and thriving concerns in jeopardy, and it is not on. Surely the LDA must take immediate steps to assure the businesses concerned and to expedite relocation and compensation. If the LDA does not have the resources or capacity to undertake that role, I ask the Minister to act, and either to provide additional capacity or to take the responsibility from the agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_352">The games will also result in the demolition of the housing co-op at Clays lane, which was established in the early 1980s to address the lack of housing for young, single people in the east of London. Approximately, it houses about 450 tenants, who face an uncertain and unsettling future. Communication appears to have been sparse and not very comforting, with assurances made prior to the bid now apparently being watered down by the LDA. I ask the Minister again to hold the agency to account, and to ensure that those tenants are not disadvantaged by their relocation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_353">If the legacy of the games is to be realised, we must plan for it, ensure that we know who is responsible for the delivery of the legacy and hold them to account to deliver on it. The challenges of east London are immense, but the opportunities of those challenges are

Rather than list all the people he listed, let me merely say that all those people deserve our thanks for the huge amount of work that they did to bring the Olympics and Paralympics to London in 2012. It was a fantastic team effort by a large number of dedicated and committed people, and one thing above all set our bid apart from everybody else&#039;s&#151;its underpinning of Olympic and Paralympic ideals in relation to sporting activities, which could liberate and inspire people not only in this country but across the world.

I hope that our deliberations today, on Report and Third Reading, and the work done in Committee and on Second Reading indicate that that cross-party co-operation can continue while allowing the opportunity for constructive criticism when we disagree in certain areas. We have made splendid progress, however, in getting the Bill to this stage. Indeed, given that the Olympics afford a glorious opportunity for Britain, it is right that the Bill has had a smooth passage. It is equally important to recognise that progress has been made on so many other fronts, not only on the measure.

With sport, we often have cross-party consensus on how we want to deliver legislation. That was reflected both in the bid beforehand and in our consideration of the Bill in Committee. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) highlighted the fact that we have managed to maintain that approach so far. There was a slight reluctance on the Government&#039;s part to back the bid right from the start before they had carried out a proper assessment. They were concerned about whether it would be possible to maintain the process until 2012, particularly given the way in which the media like to treat these matters, with the British approach of doom and gloom. So far, we have managed to maintain a spirit of optimism, and I hope that the spirit of co-operation that has been evident today and throughout consideration of the Bill in Committee will continue until 2012.

The warm words that are usually associated with sport have to be turned into action and, harshly, into hard cash. We have warm words for the arts sector, and it receives an enormous amount of Exchequer funding. I wish that we could generate the same level of funding to encourage sporting prowess in this country, especially at grass-roots level, where we still have some work to do.

Although we can be proud of being able to generate the next generation of young people who are interested in sport, who have had the opportunity to participate and who now want to carry that through, there is a pyramid. Our elite facilities in Loughborough, Sheffield and Bath are among the best in the world. I am sure that other hon.

It has been interesting to be involved in consideration of the Bill because we have been trying to build on our legacy. We have not been waiting for 2012. We cannot call on sports volunteers the week before the Olympics start and say, &quot;Right, you will now wear a blazer and be involved.&quot; We must build up the expertise and the volunteer base to ensure that we have people who are fully skilled. We must use the enthusiasm for the Olympics to ensure that that happens.

<br>&nbsp;<br>involved in the London Olympics Bill, but I did not realise that most of it would be about traffic regulation, brand protection and the establishment of a regional development agency. It was an interesting learning curve. It has been fascinating to discover the process, particularly on brand protection, as I had just a little knowledge of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_369">A couple of outstanding issues have been touched on in the debate. We have mentioned betting. I understand that one of the contractual commitments that the Government have given to the IOC is to allow it to control&#151;or even, if it seems appropriate, to prohibit&#151;betting on the Olympics in the UK. I hope that the Minister will write to me on those issues, as although we have touched on them, we have probably not followed them through, and they are clearly important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_370">The issue of betting has the potential to strike at the integrity of sport. For example, a referee in Germany took bribes to throw particular games and there have been other examples at the Olympics. Cricket has had its own problems over the past few years. Sporting integrity and betting now go together. The IOC has managed to stamp down on the drugs problem, and it would be great to ensure in the build-up to 2012 that we are well ahead of the game as sports betting increasingly becomes an issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_371">I am not sure whether we have managed to cover that issue sufficiently during deliberations on the Bill so far, or whether the Minister has plans to introduce any amendments in the Lords to cover the commitment to the IOC and how far that goes. As he knows, there are some problems in the sports betting world over the pools companies no longer entering contractual relationships with the football leagues for the sale of data, particularly match data. That creates another little knock-on problem for grass-roots sport. We talked about that earlier when we discussed the lottery and how the money is distributed. So there are little problems. They may involve only tens of thousands of pounds for some football clubs, but they are important, so I hope that the Minister will examine that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_372">The Minister mentioned ticket touting. The Bill includes some welcome measures to protect the London Olympics from ticket touts. As he knows, ticket touting is a growing problem for sport. It diverts resources from sport and deprives real fans of tickets. When many of us who are passionate about sport and involved at grass-roots level try to get hold of tickets, we find that the corporate packages make it increasingly difficult for genuine fans to do so. That is why I welcome the recent ticket touting summit that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has called with representatives of the major sporting governing bodies. I hope that that is a success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_373">The Minister will know that the International Rugby Board is a strong supporter of legislation to combat ticket touting. I wonder whether we can build into the Bill measures to extend the same protection as we have given the Olympic team to those involved in other sports. That would be most welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_374">This is a reasonable Bill. It has been fantastic just to play a small part in the process of delivering the Olympics. All of us who have been involved in the Bill will enjoy seeing the end of its passage in this place and look forward with great passion and, as the hon.

I hope, too, that people from all over the country, including those who have the potential to play a part in training camps or as volunteers, will enjoy it. We must ensure not only that we enjoy it but that we get up there on the Olympic medal table, and that the lasting legacy is not just those golds but a future for British sport that means that we take it seriously and put our cash where our mouths are.

<p><a name="st_312"><a name="51206-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 As I said earlier, it has been a privilege and pleasure to take the Bill through Parliament. The contributions on Third Reading show what the nation was feeling on 6 July. My hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) encapsulated that. Many people stood in Trafalgar square, and some Members were with me in Singapore. I visited my French counterpart, Jean-Francois Lamour, in the hall in Singapore, and I had to squeeze past some 50 or 60 journalists to get to him. Steve Redgrave and David Beckham were involved on our behalf, but we had only three photographers in front of us. I thought, &quot;The result has been leaked and we obviously haven&#039;t won.&quot; Jacques Rogge kept the world in suspense by delaying opening the envelope containing the result. I point out by way of an aside that as we speak, a silver letter-opener is being made for him, on which is engraved, &quot;Please do not keep the world waiting in anticipation again.&quot; When Jacques Rogge finally opened that envelope, he said, &quot;London.&quot; Until that moment, a lot of people who wanted us to win the bid did not quite believe that we could do so. Such enthusiasm added to the atmosphere in Trafalgar square and definitely to that in Singapore, and it has carried all the way through. When people look back in years to come, they will recognise that through this Bill, we have established a foundation for an Olympic games that has never been established before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_375">The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and I, along with others, travelled the world to speak to representatives of many of the cities that have hosted the Olympics. We asked one simple question: &quot;What would you do differently if you hosted the games again?&quot; They were very generous in giving advice and we have worked on the basis of it. The product is this Bill, which will deliver a structure that will address, for example, the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson) about cost overruns. The framework that we have established will be cost-effective, and it is absolutely crucial that in the next 18 months, we get the company up and running, the various structures in place and the contracts laid. We must not get involved in crisis management; we must control the process from start to finish. If we do that, we

<br>&nbsp;<br>will host a good games. Such an approach will also enable us to tackle seriously the other elements that make an Olympic games highly successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_376">One such element is legacy. Other Olympic games have had to resort to crisis management, and we ourselves have done so with certain big projects. We have learned from that. Avoiding the need for crisis management will give us the space in which to develop the games. Legacy, which the Olympic board controls, is a very important issue to which there are many strands: the built environment, the human environment, the sporting infrastructure, and the cultural infrastructure. I hope that after 2012, we will leave behind one of the best sporting infrastructures in the world. Other strands include participation and talent identification. We want the talented athlete scholarship scheme to find talented young people in our secondary schools not by chance but by design, and to maximise their potential for producing world-class performances. Unlike Steve Redgrave and Kelly Holmes, who were discovered by chance, we want such people to be discovered by design. We are instituting that scheme and the mentoring of young students, arranging the curriculum around such activities and taking them through the scheme as one. The Olympic board deals with many such legacy issues, and in turn it is responsible to this House and its organs, such as Select Committees. I am sure that we will deliver in this area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_377">On betting, the IOC has asked us to look at that issue, but we have made it clear that we have no plans to legislate. We are discussing with the governing bodies how we can assist on the question of ticket-touting, particularly in the light of the electronic means by which touting is now carried out, such as via eBay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_378">The momentum generated by the great euphoria of 6 July is still there throughout the country. If we can maintain it by developing cultural activities and grass-root sports projects throughout the UK&#151;in the regions and through the devolved Administrations&#151;we will have a lasting legacy that will be second to none.

<a name="51206-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_379">Many of us take seriously the narrative on which we won the games&#151;which was reconnecting young people with sport through the five rings and the Olympic movement. While the Bill is about the delivery of the games by the UK, I believe that we have a responsibility to the Olympic movement and the world to use the great influence that we have through the Commonwealth, the European Union and many other institutions to achieve that aim. Seb Coe and those working with him hope that come 2012, we will deliver the narrative on which, according to the International Olympic Committee, we won the bid and bring young people back into sport through the Olympic movement.

<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51206-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam) (LD):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject of medication reviews for older people. I do so because I believe that if good practice in medication review were to be the norm across the NHS, it could transform the lives of millions of people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_380">At the moment, there are more than 3.6 million people over 75 taking at least one medication and 1.6 million taking four or more medications. On the evidence that I have, it is clear that most of them have never benefited from a review of their medication in the way that is envisaged in the national service framework for older people. Getting the dosage right, understanding the complex interplay of different medicines and making sure that medicines are taken at the right time can make a huge difference to people&#039;s health and quality of life. For some, simply getting medication right can be like turning the light back on&#151;it can make a huge difference. For others, getting the medication right can be a matter of life or death.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_381">My purpose in having a debate on this issue is to press the Minister for more concerted action to realise the full potential of medication reviews. What do I mean by medication review? That is a good question, because there is no single agreed definition of what constitutes a medication review. However, there is a proposed definition. It comes from the medicines partnership and has been endorsed by the Department of Health. It says that a medication review is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;A structured, critical examination of a patient&#039;s medicines with the objective of reaching an agreement with the patient about treatment, optimising the impact of medicines, minimising the number of medication related problems and reducing waste.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_382">I have long been concerned about the impact poor medication practice can have on the quality of life of older people. In particular, I still do not believe that enough is being done to stamp out the inappropriate use of medication in care homes. At its worst, the use of medication becomes restraint by chemical means, and that is elder abuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_383">According to the most recent figures from the Commission for Social Care Inspection, more than 5,700 of the 13,000 care homes in England either did not meet or almost met the national minimum standard for medication last year. Let us be clear that we are talking about a minimum standard. I acknowledge that those figures are a modest improvement on the previous year, but try telling that to the residents living in one of the homes who do not meet the minimum standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_384">I was even more worried to note that the National Care Standards Commission&#151;the predecessor of the Commission for Social Care Inspection&#151;pointed out in its report on medication that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;The majority of prescribed medicines will be supplied by a GP on a repeat basis at the request of care staff and not the service user.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_385">That places care staff in a powerful position to influence prescribing for good or for ill. In a briefing for today&#039;s debate, the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society points out the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 842</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>need to review the medicine management standards, especially standard 9.1, which deals with self-medication. It wants to see greater clarity over the issue of timing of medication, and I strongly agree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_386">In 2003, a study in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> concluded that older people in care homes received poorer medical care than those living at home, in terms of over-use of inappropriate or unnecessary drugs, poor monitoring of chronic disease and under-use of beneficial drugs. That is one of the reasons why regular medication review should be part of the process and why I welcomed the national service framework for older people medication standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_387">Although I support the standards, it must be said that international evidence suggests that annual reviews of prescriptions for elderly people, as proposed in the NSF, are inadequate. Harm can be done, and is done, in far less than a year. There is a huge gap between the intention of the Government&#039;s policy, which is to be applauded, and its implementation over the last few years since the NSF was published. That gap has been caused by a lack of clarity and insufficient incentives to deliver what is expected; in particular, the new GP contract does not provide the necessary incentives for more frequent reviews.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_388">Among the indicators in the quality and outcomes framework&#151;QOF&#151;for the contract, two specifically incentivise regular review of medication. The first is:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;A medication review is recorded in the notes in the preceding 15 months for all patients being prescribed four or more repeat medicines.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_389">That is worth seven points. The second is:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;A medication review is recorded in the notes in the preceding 15 months for all patients being prescribed repeat medicines.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_390">That is worth eight points. So the QOF says 15 months, yet the NSF talks about 12 months for people on fewer than four medications and six months for people on more than four medications. Neither actually sets out what qualifies as a medication review. Am I the only one who thinks there is a problem?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_391">Every time I have raised the issue with Ministers through written questions and in debate I have been left with the distinct feeling that the NSF medicine review standard has been quietly dropped. That impression was reinforced in February when the Minister of State, Department for Transport, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), who was then a Minister in the Department of Health told me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;The quality and outcomes framework (QOF) indicator for medication reviews for people prescribed repeat medicines was developed by a group of independent experts who were commissioned by the British Medical Association and the NHS Confederation. The group developed QOF indicators using its own search of the evidence and did not necessarily use existing national service framework (NSF) standards. Although this means that the QOF indicators and NSF standards may not match entirely, meeting the QOF indicator will go a long way to helping practices meet the NSF standard and vice versa.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 1119W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_392">That really beggars belief. It is optimistic, but when the Department was signing off the QOF why did not it ensure that the NSF standard would be achieved? What is the point of producing the NSF standard if it is not being used in that way?

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_396">Where is the evidence to support that contention? Certainly the evaluation of the implementation of the &quot;Room for Review&quot; guidance on medication reviews published by the medicines partnership earlier this year does not point to significant and sustained improvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_397">Part 1 of the evaluation found that only 8 per cent. of primary care trusts had met the NSF standard for annual medication reviews for patients aged over 75. Worse still, just 5 per cent. had met the target for six-monthly reviews for patients over 75 who were on four or more medicines. The NSF milestone for medicine reviews was 2002. That is when this was meant to be in place, albeit with the potential burdens that would arise from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_398">Even in 2004, 47 per cent. of PCTs were reporting that they would not be able to conduct six-monthly medicine reviews for over-75s on four or more medicines. Delve a little deeper into part 1 of the evaluation and one finds that even in those PCTs that said they were doing it, not every GP practice was actually conducting and taking part in medication reviews. More worrying still, the evaluation found that in the PCTs that had implemented medication reviews, only a minority of reviews were conducted face to face. That type of patient-centred review was therefore being considered by PCTs as &quot;aspirational&quot;&#151;as a gold standard&#151;and therefore limited to more complex patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_399">As I am sure the Minister will know, &quot;Room for Review&quot; defined four levels of medication review&#151;levels 0 to 3. Of these, level 3 involved the patients in face-to-face discussion about their medicines and therefore offered the opportunity to explore the patient&#039;s views and experiences of using medicines and allowed them to share in the decision-making process about future prescribing&#151;

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 844</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on this exceptionally important issue. One of my constituents has brought this problem up. One drawback seems to be that a lot of people in care homes have some sort of dementia, and therefore the face-to-face review is more difficult, and I get the feeling that because it is more difficult it is not being done.
</p>





<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51206-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 I fear that that is a problem. All too often, repeat prescriptions are ordered by care staff and inappropriate historic prescriptions continue without being properly checked and vetted. That is why the process really has to engage with the patient and, if necessary, carers and other family members who have authority to take informed decisions and give consent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_400">The lack of a specific requirement for level 3-type reviews in the NSF and the quality and outcomes framework has reinforced the view in PCTs and among practitioners that patient-centred reviews are &quot;nice to have&quot; but not a &quot;must have&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_401">Part 1 of the evaluation was conducted in January 2004 and published in March 2005, which really does prompt the question, why did it take so long to publish the findings? While I am asking about part 1 of the evaluation of &quot;Room for Review&quot;, I hope that the Minister can clear up a mystery surrounding the publication of part 2, on the patient&#039;s view. I was told in July that part 2 would be published over the summer. It was not, so I asked another question about when it would be published and I was told this time that due to ethics clearance requirements it would not be published until the end of 2006. Then I got the news, thanks to Mr. Speaker, that I had secured tonight&#039;s debate, and the following day my office took a call from the Department, telling me that part 2 would be published on 5 December. So Christmas has come early, and that is good news. But what is going on?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_402">Certainly, part 2 paints a mixed picture of patient experience of medication reviews. Part 1 talks about face-to-face reviews being the gold standard, yet the evidence from part 2 suggests that there is quite a long way to go before the potential of that gold standard is realised. Many of the comments from patients suggest that they had been given the impression&#151;I emphasise, given the impression, and that is how they saw it&#151;that the purpose of the review was cost cutting. One woman is quoted in the evaluation as saying that the reason she was given for being called for a medication review was that the PCT wanted to change her tablets
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;not for my benefit, but to bring me into line with the PCT.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_404">The concern that medication reviews are essentially about reducing NHS expenditure and saving money is a strong theme running through the second part of the evaluation from the patient&#039;s perspective, and it clearly is a problem in terms of how we make these reviews something that people feel comfortable with and see the value of from their own point of view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_405">Another concern that emerges concentrates on who conducts these reviews, and it touches on the intervention by the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone). When it came to GP-led reviews, while most people felt comfortable that their concerns 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 845</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>were being addressed, points were made as to whether the GP had sufficient knowledge compared with colleagues in secondary care, which really did fuel a suspicion that the reviews were just being done to save money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_406">Another set of concerns arose about pharmacists who were leading reviews. The main issue was about the fact that pharmacists did not have access to the medical records or knowledge of the individual medical situation, but above all there was a real concern, and a question mark, over whether the pharmacist could get medication changed; if they could not, delays were occurring while people waited for their practice to change their medicines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_407">With the new pharmacist contract opening up the possibility of a greater role for pharmacists in medicine management, there is a need for clarity. As the medicines partnership points out in its report, the medicine reviews used by pharmacists are not the same as medication reviews. In the executive briefing published yesterday, the medicines partnership said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">&quot;As with the NSF milestone, there was no published definition of what sort of medication review would qualify for QOF purposes. There is potential for overlap between the different medicines review services and some confusion as to which sorts of reviews &#039;count&#039; towards which targets. This suggests a need to refocus attention from quantity to quality. PCTs need to consider how the various types of medicines review can help them deliver their objectives and priorities, making sure that reviews deliver maximum benefit to patients and that people with the greatest need and greatest potential to benefit have their medicines reviewed.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">We consider that it is important for PCTs, GPs, nurses and pharmacists to have a clear picture of how the various forms of review fit together and how they can be used to meet local priorities and support care for people with long term conditions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_408">To summarise in two words, confusion reigns. That confusion has caused a failure to join the dots between the rise in the prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs, the rise in adverse drug reaction to anti-psychotic drugs and the worrying 35 per cent. increase in the number of non-fatal ADRs among the over-75s and the alarming 83 per cent. increase in fatal ADRs among the over-75s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_409">A recent report in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> found that significantly older people were admitted most because of ADRs. The cost to admissions authorities is huge, and the consequences for the individual go without saying. The study concluded that the NSF needs to be implemented. Yes, the NSF medicines standards should be implemented. That would be a step in the right direction. Medication reviews would help to safeguard the health and welfare of older people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_410">To conclude, I have some questions. First, will the Minister confirm that the NSF standard for annual and six-monthly reviews is still the standard that the NHS should be measured against? Secondly, when will the NSF standard be achieved, and how will we know? Thirdly, does he agree that we need to look into the national minimum standards for medicines management in care homes for older people to ensure that medication reviews are triggered in accordance with the NSF standards and that the timing of medication is made clear to managers and staff? Fourthly, will he act now to clear up the confusion identified by the

<br>&nbsp;<br>evaluation of the medicines partnership and ensure that clear guidance is issued to the NHS, so that everyone is clear what is expected?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_411">I agree with the medicines partnership that there is a need to focus on quality&#151;that is absolutely right&#151;but that is not sufficient if the NHS is to meet the needs of millions of older people in this country, whose quality of life is impaired because they are not getting the right medication, at the right time and in the right place. I hope that the Minister has something helpful and positive to say.

<p><a name="st_321"><a name="51206-35_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) on securing this debate. He has indeed taken a long interest in the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_412">Medicines are by far the most common form of medical treatment in the UK. People with long-term conditions, many of whom are older, are reliant on those medicines to stay healthy. In fact, 80 per cent. of people over the age of 75 take at least one prescribed medicine and 36 per cent. of them&#151;just over a third&#151;take four or more medicines each day. With that level of medicine prescribing comes the challenge of ensuring that people with long-term conditions, including those who are older, get the maximum possible benefit from that medicine, and the hon. Gentleman made that argument rather eloquently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_413">Half of all people&#151;not just older people&#151;on regular treatment do not take their medicines as intended for a number of reasons. Problems with medicines may be the cause of as many as 10 to 15 per cent. of hospital admissions. So people need simple information and advice if they are going to get the best benefit from their medicines. They need to know what their medicines are for, how they work and how they need to take them. However, people also have their own health beliefs, which can affect the way that they take their medicines. That is why, as the hon. Gentleman said, involving people in decisions about how medication is taken is an   important way in which we can help to ensure that they take medicines effectively. That explains why medication review is important. It is good that the hon. Gentleman has secured such a debate on the Floor of the House because the matter sometimes does not get the airtime that it deserves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_414">A medication review occurs when a health professional reviews a patient&#039;s medicines. The health professional ensures that all medicines that would be of benefit are prescribed and that the various treatments work well together and do not cause problems. That might be done if a GP prescribes someone with repeat medicines, but there is also a place for more in-depth reviews in which a health professional sits down with a patient and discusses his or her medicines in detail. That might occur if someone is on an especially complex regime, or if a patient is experiencing problems. Such reviews are important, not least because they allow patients to ask questions about their medicines and to be more involved in any decisions that are taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_415">Given the importance of medicines to many people and the importance of medicine reviews, when we published the national service framework for older 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 847</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>people in 2000, we produced a booklet that focused on the specific issue of medicines and older people. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that drew together the available evidence and made recommendations on how to improve older people&#039;s medicine taking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_416">Within that, we set a specific milestone on medication reviews. We recognised that the more medicines people take, the more likely they are to experience difficulties, so the scheme had two elements. First, by 2002, all people aged 75 and over were expected to have medicine reviews at least annually, and, secondly, those taking four or more medicines were to be reviewed at least every six months. Although it was largely for the NHS, working with other stakeholders locally, to implement the NSF on older people, we have nationally supported the improvement of medicine-taking in several ways. Before the publication of the NSF, medication reviews were not systematically undertaken or recorded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_417">Let me outline several of the measures that we have taken to support the policy. We have supported several primary care trusts to identify what works best and to share that learning with others through the national medicines management collaborative. About half of PCTs have participated in that programme to implement local medicine management schemes so that people get more help in using their medicines from not only their GPs, but pharmacists and others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_418">One of the measures used for assessing improvement was the proportion of people aged over 65 who were on four or more regular medicines and had received a documented medication review in the past 12 months. There was a significant increase in activity and, in some cases, the reported rate of reviews more than doubled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para19">
<a name="stpa_419">Another measure was the percentage of patients in care homes who had had a documented review of their medicines in the past year. I am aware that some people believe that people in care homes do not have their medicines reviewed regularly, or sufficiently regularly, but the data from the collaborative work showed that the situation was slightly different. The increase in activity for patients in care homes was similar to that for those living at home, although the two groups had slightly different starting positions. The extent of patient involvement in medication reviews was measured for PCTs in wave 4 of the programme. It increased from 22 per cent. to 62 per cent. in a single year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_420">After drawing on this learning, guidance on medication reviews was widely disseminated through &quot;Room for Review: A guide to medication review&quot;, which was published by medicines partnership in conjunction with the national medicines management collaborative in 2002. The document set out a framework on how medication reviews should work, together with supporting tools and advice for managers and health care professionals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para21">
<a name="stpa_421">Two years later, medicines partnership commissioned an evaluation of the impact of &quot;Room for Review&quot;, first to determine the extent to which the guidance had been adopted by PCTs and, secondly, to assess the experience and opinions of a sample of patients who had had a medication review. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the original plan was to publish both parts of the evaluation together. However, there were unexpected delays in publishing the part involving patients because of the two practical issues&#151;the need to obtain ethics committee 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 848</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>approval and the need to identify a suitable sample of patients through GPs. Medicines partnership did not wish to withhold the findings, so it went ahead and disseminated the survey of PCTs in March 2005. Part two was published yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_422">I am glad that I have helped to ensure that Christmas has come early for the hon. Gentleman. From the survey of PCTs undertaken in 2004, we know that the majority of PCTs had a written strategy and that more than 60 per cent. of them had agreed local guidelines. About 45 per cent. of the PCTs that responded to that survey indicated that they were achieving or likely to achieve the older people&#039;s NSF target. Just 30 per cent. of PCTs said they were unlikely to achieve the target. If the survey were carried out now the figures would be very different, and I shall come on to the results of the GP quality and outcomes framework data later. The relationship between the national service framework and the quality and outcomes framework is important. The NSF indicator is still very much in force, but the way in which it has been implemented through the QOF target has become slightly more flexible to make sure that there is local managerial flexibility for doctors who implement it.

<p><a name="st_322"><a name="51206-36_spnew0"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 That is one of my main concerns, and a key issue in the executive summary of both parts of the evaluation. At the heart of the problem is the fact that a clear working definition of a medication review was not in place when the QOF and the NSF were set. Without such a definition, it is difficult to know what one is measuring and thus be confident that progress is under way.
</p>





<p><a name="st_323"><a name="51206-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 May I write to the hon. Gentleman on that point, as it merits more consideration than I can provide this evening?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_423">I have talked about the efforts to support PCTs in establishing medicine reviews. We have also ensured that through the new general medical services contract steps are in place to encourage medication reviews. Across the country, about 90 per cent. of GP practices reported that at least 80 per cent. of their patients who were prescribed four or more repeat medicines had had a medication review in the preceding 15 months recorded in their notes. Over four fifths of GP practices reported that at least 80 per cent. of their patients who were prescribed repeat medicines had had a medication review in the preceding 15 months, which is an achievement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_424">Alongside the role of PCTs and GPs, we should consider the role of local pharmacists. We have gone to some lengths to underpin the important contribution that pharmacists make through the new community pharmacy contract. In the first six months, pharmacy owners have focused on the delivery of essential services. Even so, by the end of October, more than 20,000 people had had the benefit of a face-to-face consultation with their pharmacist to discuss their medicines and resolve problems. It was clear from the national consultation that we undertook as we developed the health White Paper that the role of community pharmacists was considered important by local communities. We will reflect on that in the White Paper to be published at the turn of the year.
</p>





<p><a name="st_324"><a name="51206-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 Will the Minister ensure that further consideration is given to the need to make sure that, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 849</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with patients&#039; permission, pharmacists have access to patient records so that they can take their history into account when they look at medicines that are being prescribed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_325"><a name="51206-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 That may, or may not, appear in the White Paper&#151;time will tell.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_425">From the medicines partnership evaluation that was published yesterday we know that patients welcome medication reviews. To gain the full benefit, they say that they need to be better prepared for the review. We must ensure that there is shared understanding of the purpose of the review to create an environment in which patients are empowered to ask questions about their medicines. We have taken that on board by supporting the medicines partnership in producing a guide to medicine use reviews, which patients can use to prepare and identify the questions that they want to ask before they consult their pharmacist. Copies will be available by the end of the month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_426">We have also commissioned NICE, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to develop a clinical guideline that sets out best practice in involving patients in decisions about prescribed medicines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_427">The hon. Gentleman highlighted the role of the Commission for Social Care Inspection in ensuring that medication reviews were carried out in care homes in accordance with statutory regulations and national minimum standards. Where inspections are uncovering instances of inappropriate or over-prescribing of medicines, enforcement action is being taken. I am aware that in the past the hon. Gentleman raised the specific issue of the inappropriate or over-prescribing of anti-psychotic medicines. These medicines have an important role to play in the management of a range of conditions and they have a good safety record, but it is vital that they are used with care and in appropriate clinical situations. The role of non-pharmacological therapies is considered where that is an appropriate course of action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_428">CSCI inspectors routinely check records to ensure that medicines are properly controlled and correctly administered. Where the CSCI finds evidence of over-prescribing or inappropriate administration of medicines, such evidence is reported to the police and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 850</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the professional bodies of those involved in such activities. The CSCI also employs pharmacist inspectors who can be called on for advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_429">Furthermore, I understand that a report that focuses specifically on the management and administration of medication in care homes and in children&#039;s homes is expected to be published by the CSCI early in the new year. That report will be important because it will help to identify in much greater detail how care homes are performing against medication national minimum standards. It will also incorporate an analysis of complaints about medicines that the commission has received from care homes. I know that that will be of great interest to the hon. Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_430">In summary, the milestone in the national service framework for older people raised the profile of the importance of effective medicine-taking, and in particular the benefit of regular medication review. Significant action has been taken by primary care trusts and others to put in place the infrastructure to deliver those medication reviews. From the first year of the new general medical services contract, we can see and celebrate the progress that has been made, with the vast majority of people taking regular medicines.
</p>





<p><a name="st_326"><a name="51206-36_spnew4"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 The Minister has been generous with his time. Will he undertake to consider the requests that I made at the end of my remarks, particularly the issue of the clarity of medication reviews, which was identified by medicines partnership in the report that has been available only since yesterday?
</p>





<p><a name="st_327"><a name="51206-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I shall look into that. There are different types of medication review, and it is for the clinician to determine which is the most appropriate for an individual patient. Sometimes that will involve a face-to-face consultation, but that will not necessarily be the right solution for many patients. I will happily come back to the hon. Gentleman with more detail on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51206-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_431">We have seen a great deal of progress since of the advent of the older people&#039;s national service framework. It is part of a broad package of improved care for older people that we have seen unfold over the past seven years. That is a reform programme that we intend to continue.
