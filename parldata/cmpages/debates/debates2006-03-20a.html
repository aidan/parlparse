 There are currently 58&nbsp;police cells and detention rooms available in Dorset. The number of police cells is an operational matter for the chief constable and the police authority.Cells in the courts are under the ownership of Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service and are not a police facility.

 May I begin by congratulating the police in Bournemouth on dealing so effectively with people who break the law, by arresting them in greater numbers? I understand that there are quite ambitious plans to improve the number and the quality of police cells in Bournemouth through a scheme that is being worked up. As I understand it, across the whole police force, 83&nbsp;police cells will eventually be available. The police have to make an assessment about the facilities that they can afford and that are needed at any particular time, but with plans for more cells to be available and the kind of activity the hon.

 In the consultation on the proposals, four out of 749&nbsp;responses were in favour of the restructuring proposed. Is it not a fact that most people were in favour of many of the other proposals in that consultation document to do with the need for partnership working, inter-agency working and so on? Would it not be better to concentrate on the aspects that have support than on the issue of contestability, which will end up with staff in the probation service not supporting what we are trying to do?

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60320-01_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right that many of the proposals had widespread support. In particular, the concept of end-to-end offender management is almost universally supported as one of the tools that we need in order more effectively to protect the public. We will shortly publish the full report on the responses and Members will then see how we are taking forward the issues that we have identified. However, I have to say to the hon. Member&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Friend.&quot;] I thank hon. Members for the kind reminder. I have to say to my hon. Friend that we remain of the view that ensuring that the services delivered meet the identified needs, which is one of the key issues in contestability, will more effectively deliver probation services.

 (Con): The Minister knows that hardly a week goes by without another terrible crime being committed by someone released early from prison. Why does not the Minister provide the probation service and the National Offender Management Service with real political leadership and effective and strategic management? We do not need more legislation. We need the Minister to lead that increasingly demoralised service from the front. When will she get on with that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60320-01_spnew5"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The hon. and learned Gentleman is right to point out the shocking cases where we have failed to protect the public properly, and he is right to say that it is necessary for the ministerial team to lead the service from the front. That is why my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary commissioned Her Majesty&#039;s chief inspector of probation to produce a report following the tragic incident in which Messrs. Hanson and White were responsible for the murder of John Monckton. We have committed ourselves to implementing in full all the recommendations of Her Majesty&#039;s chief inspector, and we will make another report to the House about further action that we will take to improve public protection.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60320-01_spnew6"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Is it not the case that the proposals that the Government are considering were taken wholesale out of the Carter report, and that without any consultation, debate or testing, they plan to implement them without reservation? Is that not a fragile base for major restructuring, and does it not sound the death knell of a publicly accountable probation service in its 100th year?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60320-01_spnew7"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 I do not quite understand what my hon. Friend is claiming, because he will have heard his hon.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60320-01_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. Charles Clarke): </b> 
 The Home Office received a business case from Essex police force and police authority in December, as well as a large number of other submissions, including, recently, a letter from a number of Members of Parliament, including the hon. Gentleman, to which I shall reply today. Since then, Home Office officials, together with experts, have been assessing the various options outlined in that business case to determine which are operationally and financially the most viable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">Those assessments are now complete, and based on them, I announced earlier today by way of written ministerial statement that I am minded to merge Essex with Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire to form a strategic force. I am meeting representatives today from those forces and authorities to consider taking forward the option for police that will in my opinion be of greatest benefit to their communities. I will invite the police authorities concerned to respond by 7&nbsp;April and will then make a final decision on how to proceed in these areas. Clearly, we will continue to have discussions with all key stakeholders, including Members of this House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60320-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 There will be both anger and dismay in Essex at today&#039;s announcement, not least as it transpires that both Kent and Hampshire are being allowed to stand alone, but apparently not us. Can the Home Secretary confirm that the police authorities of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex have offered him a voluntary merger on a Beds and Herts and Essex stand-alone basis? Why did he reject that voluntary offer, which was put to him directly by the police authorities themselves?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60320-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 As I said, I will discuss later today with representatives of the police authorities and the forces the options for the region. In particular, the reason why we decided on advice from Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary not to go along the line of the Beds-Herts voluntary merger, along the lines the hon. Gentleman suggests, is that its professional assessment is that such a force would not have the capacity to deal with the protective services level that is necessary to protect their people, and by extension, people of the wider region, including those in Essex.

 (Lab): As the only Labour Back Bencher in Essex, may I say to the Home Secretary that I hope he will think again and acknowledge that there is still an opportunity for me and others to persuade him? The inspectorate would not have taken into account wider Government policy on the Thames Gateway. As a Back Bencher, I am sick and tired of trying to support the ODPM&#039;s policy for a Thames Gateway, only to see other Departments go in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 5</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the opposite direction. I have had enough. I think it is time we had a coherent policy from this Government, so that they sing from the same song sheet as they expect me to do. I think it is time we had one Essex&#151;

<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60320-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall certainly try to keep going, even if I am not ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">The fact is that we made it clear from the outset that our strong preference was to respect Government offices for the regions boundaries in the reorganisation that we did. I say to my hon. Friend that that was one consideration about looking at the Thames Gateway approach, as he advocated. I can give him the confirmation that he wants. We are now in the process of going down a line that could take up to four and bit months for people to make their representations about the proposals that we have. I have no doubt that representations will be made; he has just indicated that he will be among those making representations. Of course, I shall take those representations seriously before coming to the final decision and laying an order before the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60320-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford)</b> 
 (Con): Many people find it difficult to believe that the Home Secretary will take representations fully into account, because they regard his decision today as completely ignoring the numerous representations against the proposals that his Department has already received. Will the Home Secretary give me a categorical answer to this narrow question: if Essex were to have a properly run referendum on whether it should remain as a stand-alone authority or whether it should be merged, and there were an emphatic vote for a stand-alone police force, would the Home Secretary be prepared to accept the verdict of the people of Essex?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60320-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can give the hon. Gentleman a categorical answer, which is no. It is my duty to consider policing protection for the whole of the country&#151;for Bedfordshire and for Hertfordshire as well as for Essex&#151;and that is the basis on which I will examine all the proposals. That is the basis on which I considered the Essex situation, and it is the basis on which I consider all the situations. I assure the hon. Gentleman that whatever views are expressed, I shall take them seriously, but when I consider the policing of the country, I will not be bound by a proposal to hold a referendum in a particular force area that does not look at the wider needs of the whole community.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60320-01_spnew15"><b> Bob Russell  (Colchester)</b> 
 (LD): Will the Home Secretary explain the logic by which Kent on one side of the Thames should remain as a single force while Essex on the other side should be amalgamated with Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, when there is no logical community of interest between, for example, Colchester and Leighton Buzzard? If the case for Essex is as good as that of Kent, why is Kent being left as a stand-alone force while Essex is not?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 6</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60320-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can explain the logic, which I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has not grasped. In the south-eastern region, in which Kent is located, there is one set of relationships between forces and their capacity to deal with protective security, and there is another set of relationships in the eastern region. The decision did not involve a comparison between Essex, Kent, Hampshire or any other force; it involved looking at the overall protective security requirement for policing in each Government office region, which is the appropriate and correct stance for us to take.

By the way, the Prime Minister&#039;s delivery unit would not claim to conduct a rigorous assessment of policing in the same way as Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary. My job&#151;as I have done it&#151;is to ask Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary to make its assertions, which is what it has done and which is where we stand.

 All 43&nbsp;neighbourhood policing basic command unit pathfinders&#151;there is one in every force&#151;are making good progress in developing and implementing locally specific models for neighbourhood policing, and they are supported by an Association of Chief Police Officers-led neighbourhood policing programme team.

 Next Thursday, I shall launch the neighbourhood policing pilot model in Hartlepool. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] Thank you.

 My hon. Friend has a long, consistent and proud record of campaigning on crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in his constituency.

 (Con): The Minister will understand why those of us with a suspicious mind think that this roll-out may have something to do with the elections on 4&nbsp;May. The trial schemes that we have had in Bexley from the Metropolitan police are very welcome, but we need the assurance that these are not notional jobs and that real policemen are to be allocated to these schemes, which are then left in place. In practice, we have seen that they are sometimes taken away and so become somewhat fictitious.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60320-02_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I had the pleasure of visiting Bexley just a week or so ago. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is no coincidence in terms of the local elections. In the past few weeks I have also been to Barnet and to Hackney to see the safer neighbourhood teams. There are now 285&nbsp;safer neighbourhood teams across London, and there will be teams in every ward by the end of April. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that they comprise real, substantial police officers and that they form part of the extra 14,000&nbsp;police officers whom the Government have introduced, together with the extra 6,000&nbsp;community support officers whom we have introduced and funded.

</p>

 I am delighted that so many Members are now experiencing the benefits of neighbourhood policing. The particular issue that my hon.

I am delighted not only that many of our PCSOs are members of a variety of ethnic minority communities, but that a much higher proportion of them are women than is the case among police officers. PCSOs therefore represent a good way in which to get extra diversity into our police service.

However, the introduction in April 2002&nbsp;of the national crime recording standards and of more proactive policing practices has had the effect of increasing recorded violent crime.

The Government got elected on the phrase, &quot;Tough on the causes of crime&quot;. Two of the primary causes of violent crime in this country are drugs and alcohol, but this Government&#039;s policy on drugs and alcohol is out of control, which is why violent crime is spiralling out of control.

I am also afraid to say that both he and his party predicted that we would see mayhem on our streets and an explosion of violent crime as a result of the liberalisation of the licensing laws, but the reverse has been the case. There has been an 11&nbsp;per cent. reduction in violent crime, because thousands of young people are not spilling out on to the streets at the same time. We have well-managed town centres with good, effective policing, and I would like him to acknowledge that.

 The right hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that those cases have caused real concern&#151;rightly so. That highlights the importance of our delivering effectively on our duty to protect the public. We are using three key tools to improve the situation. First, there are the new sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which includes extended public protection sentences and indefinite sentences for public protection. Some 728&nbsp;of the first type of sentence have already been passed since April 2005, and 679&nbsp;of the other type. Secondly, there are improvements in our risk assessment system&#151;the offender assessment system, or OASys, tool&#151;and, thirdly, there is better management of risk by probation officers in the community.

Will Sir Hayden Phillips consider, among other things, imposing a far more drastic cap on what can be spent nationally by political parties, and imposing a very drastic cap on what can be donated by individuals? Could he look at whether small donations should be made tax deductible for the political party of one&#039;s choice, as that is the one form of funding of political parties that the public might support? I appreciate that some of those matters are for my hon. Friend&#039;s many superiors, but will she undertake to pass the word on?

 Is my hon.

They then complain, wherever the money comes from. Can I suggest to my hon. Friend that the last people we want lectures from are the party of Ashcroft, Aitken and the rest? We do not need any lectures about a Swiss rollover by the Liberal Democrat&#151; but if we did go further we could abolish the House of Lords and the honours lists so that there would not be very much left to buy.

 My hon. Friend leads me very temptingly down a path that it is not appropriate for me to take, given the nature of the statement.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that all political parties should declare any loans that they receive and it is right to review party political funding, but I would err on the side of caution in going down the road of state funding for political parties, which would go down like a lead balloon with the public. The way forward has been mentioned already&#151;we should make the cap on spending at elections much lower than at present.

 Of course, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House says, it might depend on whom those DVDs are from. However, I hear what my hon. Friend says about state funding. She reflects a view that, I suspect, is held quite widely. That is part of the reason why the debate about getting the balance right is important.

Was the hon. Lady, in her response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), seriously trying to tell the House that the occasion of her statement today had nothing whatever to do with the scandal and revelations of the past few days? If so, I fear that she may be unnecessarily damaging her own credibility, as well as setting a very poor example of candour in the House.

We must find a way that gets the balance of party political funding right&#151;whether partly through the state or partly through private donations&#151;but whichever way that is done, it must be transparent, and that is what we hope to achieve.

 Has the Minister noticed that Sir Hayden has been honoured?

Will she support an amendment to disqualify from getting a peerage anyone who makes a substantial loan or payment to a political party?

 I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order No. 24, to discuss a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely, the announcement last Thursday of up to 1,200&nbsp;staff reductions at the University hospital of North Staffordshire. I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I am a little out of breath; I thought that the statement would continue rather longer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_20">My local hospital is one of 18&nbsp;NHS trusts in the country earmarked in January by the Secretary of State to receive the attention of turnaround teams. It is the first to announce its financial recovery plan. Locally, of course, the cuts are devastating. They include 573&nbsp;nurses, midwives and auxiliaries, and one in five of all nursing staff. The situation at the hospital, however, illustrates more fundamental issues about governance, management and control across the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_21">This was a hospital that was allowed to drift by its strategic health authority and the NHS Executive, and right up to the desk of the former NHS chief executive, the soon-to-be Lord Crisp. It was allowed the luxury of letting its former chief executive serve one year&#039;s notice before quitting for personal reasons. Even then, last year, it could appoint only an acting chief executive, who was moved on in January. That followed the resignation of the chairman and all the non-executive directors days before Christmas. Throughout this period, it employed accounting staff who evidently found numbers troublesome. That is all the more surprising as the numbers have to add up for a brand-new private finance initiative hospital that has been planned for years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_22">Since Christmas, local MPs have been trying to get to the bottom of the hospital&#039;s projected &#163;18&nbsp;million deficit this year. We have failed to be able to do so. At a meeting in mid-February, we were promised the details by the SHA, but instead, all we had last Thursday, out of the blue, was talk of &#163;43&nbsp;million savings over two years. The document issued to staff giving 90&nbsp;days&#039; notice of redundancy is a disgrace in content and tone. This is a hospital, not a business going bankrupt. This is no way to secure the continued staff good will on whose basis our NHS operates. Despite its consequences, the notice was issued on no higher authorisation than that of the acting chief executive of the hospital. Much of the deficit is down to national policies, the consequences of which are coming home to roost. A great deal of change is taking place, but it is important that the response to the deficits does not veer out of control.

<a name="60320-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_24">The motion before us seeks the House&#039;s approval for the Ministry of Defence&#039;s spring supplementary estimate&#151;a request for an additional &#163;1,890&nbsp;million, of which the largest part is to meet the costs of peacekeeping in Iraq and Afghanistan. I know that in making a speech one is meant to begin at the beginning, but I wish to begin at the end, so I shall go straight to the conclusion of the Defence Committee&#039;s report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;We do not propose that the House should refuse the request for resources set out in the MoD&#039;s Spring Supplementary Estimate. On the contrary, we believe it is essential that peace-keeping operations in Iraq and Afghanistan should be properly funded.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_25">If anything, we are concerned that too little is being spent, not too much. The Defence Committee, of which I have the great honour to be Chairman, hopes that the House will approve this request for resources. We believe that our service personnel should have the equipment that they need. However, we have several concerns about the way in which the Ministry of Defence presents its estimates to Parliament and thought that the House should have an opportunity to consider them before it approves the spring supplementary estimates. We are therefore grateful to the Liaison Committee for agreeing that our report should be debated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_26">First, we are concerned about the inadequacy of the information that the Ministry of Defence provided to Parliament in support of the request for resources&#151;a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 36</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>request for a very large amount of public money. The initial estimates memorandum, which all Departments provide to their Select Committees with the estimates, is printed in the evidence with our report. It does not add very much&#151;only a breakdown between the operations for Iraq and Afghanistan. That is in table 1&nbsp;of our report. We thought that that was not good enough and asked the Ministry of Defence for more information. Its more detailed breakdown is set out in tables 2&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;of our report. We hope that next time the Ministry of Defence will give that level of information in the estimates memorandum when the estimates are first published. That will give us enough time to report to the House, if necessary, in good time for the estimates day debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_27">Secondly, we are concerned about the high level of contingency that is contained in the estimate. Tables 2&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;of our report show that the estimate contains &#163;69&nbsp;million contingency in resources and &#163;77&nbsp;million contingency in capital, so we asked the Ministry of Defence why such a large amount of contingency was necessary, especially at such a late stage in the financial year. The response was that it was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;due to the often rapidly changing operational situation&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_28">and the


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;need to be able to respond to the rapidly evolving threat to our forces&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_29">The Defence Committee fully accepts the need for the Ministry of Defence to have financial flexibility to respond to changing threats, buy new equipment and so on when the operational need arises. There may be different views on whether it is a good thing to deploy in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there can be no such difference about the need for our forces to be properly and fully protected. Force protection, especially against increasingly sophisticated improvised explosive devices, is a matter of life and death for our service personnel as they serve this country in Iraq and Afghanistan. Equipment often needs to be developed at short notice. Urgent operational requirements cost a lot of money and we need to ensure that it is properly managed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_30">In January, the Committee visited the Defence Procurement Agency and were briefed by the special projects integrated project team on the acquisition of urgent operational requirements. We were impressed by the speed and efficiency of the acquisition process. The team&#039;s close connection to operations gave its members a strong motivation and they fed back lessons from the field. We were told that, in one project, the contract was let within three days of notification of the requirement and the equipment was in the field in three weeks. That is an extraordinary achievement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_31">We accept the need for flexibility, but that does not absolve the Ministry of Defence of the requirement to make proper financial forecasts. We shall look closely at the out-turn costs in the annual report and accounts to ensure that the Ministry is not routinely overestimating the costs of operations. Our report recommends that the annual report should contain significantly more detail on the cost of operations than it has done in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_32">Our third concern is about arrangements whereby the Ministry of Defence waits for the spring supplementary estimates before seeking Parliament&#039;s approval of expenditure on operations. I am afraid that we did not understand why the Ministry does that. It may be a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 37</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>surprise to some hon. Members that the Ministry makes no provisions in its main estimates for operations, even if they are well established. In effect, we are being asked to authorise expenditure in arrears.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_33">The Ministry&#039;s explanation for that arrangement is that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;we cannot provide a detailed forecast at the beginning of the financial year that is accurate to the standards which we would normally place before Parliament for figures for that financial year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_34">In our view, the fact that the Ministry cannot provide information that is accurate to a high standard is no reason for not providing Parliament with any information at all. We therefore recommend that, in future, provisions for operations that are well under way should be made in the main estimates in the usual way&#151;if necessary, with a large element for contingency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_35">We also recommend that the Ministry provide to our Committee regular updates of the cost of operations, in the same way as it provides information to the Treasury. That would be a welcome demonstration that the Ministry recognises the need for public accountability. It should give us the clear impression that it regards Treasury approval of its expenditure plans as no more important than parliamentary approval. Parliamentary approval should not be a rubber stamp.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_36">Perhaps the attitude of the Ministry of Defence is influenced by the fact that funding for operations does not come from its allocated defence budget but is new money from the Treasury. However, it is all public money and it should all be subject to the usual process of parliamentary authorisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_37">Our report deals briefly with the costs of operations in the Balkans. We recommend that, in future, provision for such operations should be set out in the Ministry&#039;s main estimates rather than transferred in from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at the spring supplementary estimates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_38">Our report also touches on the future costs of the deployment to Afghanistan. It is not enough for Ministers to tell us that the cost of the deployment will be around &#163;1&nbsp;billion over five years and we will press the Ministry of Defence for more information on costs in our inquiry into the Afghanistan deployment.

 I note that my right hon. Friend&#039;s excellent report calls for more information.

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60320-11_spnew2"><b> Nick Harvey  (North Devon) (LD):</b> 
 I commend the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr.&nbsp;Arbuthnot) and his Committee on their important report. The sums of money in question are certainly large, although that is unsurprising in view of the scale of the operations involved, and of the recent commitments to increase them. I note with regret that some of the points that the Committee has raised were also raised a year ago, but have not elicited a response from the Government. It does not make sense for all this to be approved retrospectively. Of course, it is impossible for the Ministry of Defence to know at the outset of the year exactly what the costs of its activities are going to be over the year, but Parliament should surely be given more information than it has been given in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_41">From time to time, we are inevitably asked what our involvement in Afghanistan and, in particular, in Iraq has cost us in total. The Government have published the figures for expenditure on operations and on capital equipment in each of the past three financial years, and will no doubt do so for the current year. However, a press release from the MOD&#039;s Defence Analytical Services Agency last September made the important point that the costs of peacekeeping in Iraq are just that, and that anyone trying to keep an account of the total expenditure must realise that combat operations have not been included in the figures that have been quoted. Will the Minister therefore confirm whether the published figures include combat costs? He has said in a previous parliamentary answer that it is not possible to identify separately the cost of combat operations. He has also made the point that those costs span two financial years, as the combat activities began in March 2003. Are the Government really telling us that they are unable to make an assessment, or even an estimate, of combat activity costs?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_42">A needs assessment was carried out in October 2003&nbsp;by the World Bank, in which it considered the tasks that lay ahead for the allies. By that stage, the armed combat phase had ended, and it was looking forward to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 39</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the costs of reconstruction. The figures being produced, it noted, worked on the following assessment at the outset:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;a main underlying assumption was that there would be a stable security environment that would allow international and local staff and consultants to move freely around rural and urban areas&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_43">to carry out their work. Given that that is no longer the case, it is understandable that the cost of all that work has gone up and up. Has there been any assessment of the impact of that on the running costs, and on the various other organisations involved?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_44">The Government have pledged a total of &#163;544&nbsp;million for the reconstruction work in Iraq. A lot of that money went through the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq. In total, the World Bank estimated that $55&nbsp;billion would be required. Of the $21&nbsp;billion that America was going to pay, however, only $2&nbsp;billion has been disbursed. I would be intrigued to know what the comparable state of play is with British finance. Three years on, with only two thirds of the American funds and just one sixth of non-American funds pledged having been disbursed, can the Minister tell us exactly how much UK money has been allocated? The latest report of the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said that the UK had pledged &#163;250&nbsp;million, and yet our Government tell us that the figure is &#163;540&nbsp;million. What proportion of the UK funds pledged have been spent so far?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_45">With specific reference to Afghanistan, the Select Committee report asks for a breakdown of costs by financial year, and for more explanation of the &#163;1&nbsp;billion estimated cost over the five years 2005&#150;06&nbsp;to 2009&#150;10. The Ministry has told us that it cannot go into that sort of detail. There was a report in <i>The Sunday Times</i> yesterday, however, about what purported to be a leaked Ministry of Defence document, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;The objectives of the British mission to Afghanistan could take as long as 20&nbsp;years to achieve, according to a confidential Ministry of Defence briefing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_46">That is no particular surprise, because the history of engagement by foreign troops in Afghanistan has never been happy, and no one should underestimate the task of the international forces now there. If the Ministry&#039;s own officials really think that fulfilling the objectives of the mission could, in principle, take as long as 20&nbsp;years, what on earth do they think that it will cost? How can they state with such precision that it will cost &#163;1&nbsp;billion? From where exactly have the Government got the figures on which to base their request for that &#163;1&nbsp;billion?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_47">Has sufficient money been allocated? The Select Committee Chairman said that if anything, the Committee was concerned not about the figures being surprisingly high but, in relation to some aspects, whether they were high enough. I wonder whether asking British and international troops to undertake some of the work envisaged has necessarily been assessed as the most cost-effective method. Has sufficient money been allocated in direct aid to the provinces in Afghanistan for training and capacity building for the Afghan national army and police?

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_49">The Minister said in a written answer that the number of Taliban in southern Afghanistan could amount to over 1,000, but what is his assessment of their military capability? He also said that there were a range of illegally armed groups in the south, which must be the case, but that the number of people involved could not be determined. Has the Ministry really no estimate of the size and strength of those groups? Given that the British forces are expected to have a role in their disarmament and demobilisation, surely there must be some assessment of what those forces are up against.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_50">Does the increase in the role that we will play in Afghanistan, in conjunction with ongoing work in Iraq, mean that United Kingdom forces will continue to work beyond the planned level in the defence planning assumptions? If that is to continue throughout the three years for which the Government expect the operation to last, there must be considerable concern about the effects on retention and recruitment. Is there any new evidence on the numbers resigning? What about the effects on the reserves, who have been over-tasked, and on the availability of specialists such as medical staff? There are also questions to be asked about a shortage of airlift, both fixed-wing and helicopters. A distinction should be drawn between helicopters that can lift troops in safety, and combat or reconnaissance helicopters that do not carry troops.

<a name="stpa_52">As we know, and have seen on our television screens, the Secretary of State has spent the last few days in Iraq visiting the troops there. Although he has said that there is not, as yet, a state of civil war&#151;an assessment with which we would agree&#151;he has nevertheless acknowledged that the situation is very serious, and that there is a danger of its tipping into civil war at very short notice. While many believe that the presence of British and American forces in Iraq is in a sense part of the problem, any suggestion of their rapid removal would only run the risk of tipping what is already a pretty desperate situation into precisely the civil war of which the Minister has warned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_53">The scale of the commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq is immense, and the challenges faced by the British forces in both countries are extremely worrying and difficult to quantify. No one would expect the Government to be able to say precisely what the cost will be, but serious tasks are being undertaken, and there is a risk of serious casualties. I think that what Parliament and the British public want is a sense that there really is a Government strategy. It is clear that the intervention in Iraq has caused many difficulties, but obviously we must deal with the world as it is now.

</p>

<p>

It is also true that Iraq and Iran cannot be compartmentalised or viewed entirely separately, given their geography and their history. Isolating Iran and a long-term occupation in Iraq can only deepen the problems. Difficult as it is, finding a way of re-engaging with Iran is absolutely necessary.
</p>

<a name="stpa_55">I hope that we can learn from the experiences of the past five years. Clearly, we cannot pull out of Iraq in a hurry; our work there is important&#151;and perilous. As we take on a considerable new responsibility in Afghanistan, it will be Parliament&#039;s role to keep a very close eye on the situation. I welcome the Select Committee&#039;s report and the questions that it asks about finance. Parliament will be failing in its duty if we do not continue to hold the Ministry of Defence to account for the important work that it is undertaking.

 I am grateful to the Defence Committee for producing the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report before us, and I am also grateful for the opportunity to speak in today&#039;s debate. As the Chairman of the Committee, the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot), pointed out, the report refers to the public being kept in the dark about how the money has been spent on Iraq&#151;on which I want to concentrate today&#151;and on Afghanistan. That is a very good point, and deserves an answer from the Minister and the Government. How do we know that we are getting value for money for what we have spent? As I say that I am chuckling ironically, because frankly, given the situation in Iraq, we are getting no value for money. One could argue that money is being spent on servicing the troops, and perhaps on reconstruction aid&#151;but how do we know? How, moreover, do we know that we are getting good value for it?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_56">That is a very serious point, given the spectacular corruption cases that we are starting to see in the United States. Custer Battles ripped off tens of millions of pounds-worth of the Iraqi people&#039;s money by supplying the Iraqi forces with broken-down trucks, and Robert Stein has received a prison sentence for rip-offs amounting to millions of pounds. I am pretty sure that the money spent by the Ministry of Defence does not involve such spectacular rip-offs, but how do we know? It is important that such issues be out in the public domain.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_57">The Government maintain that we spent &#163;3.1&nbsp;billion on Iraq to March last year and in excess of &#163;1&nbsp;billion since then, so such spending totals well over &#163;4&nbsp;billion. But as the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) said, that does not include combat costs&#151;the initial costs of the war&#151;which, presumably, are heavy, or other Departments&#039; costs. Where are they listed? As the Select Committee said, we do not have clear-cut accounting. That money is our taxpayers&#039; money, but what about the great deal of Iraqi money that has been squandered? Some &#163;23&nbsp;billion-worth of their money, which was held by the United Nations and handed over to the allied forces, has gone without any result. According to an article in <i>The Independent</i> last November, the Iraqi people could lose &#163;200&nbsp;billion-worth of oil resources under agreements that the allies are forcing through. Lots of money and resources are going down a bottomless drain; some of those are ours, but most belong to the Iraqi people.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;The most thorough survey yet conducted on Iraqi life since the invasion arrived soon after the election. The United Nations Development Programme found that the average income in Iraq dropped by 44&nbsp;per cent. in the year after the invasion&#151;from &#163;137&nbsp;per person under the last year of economic sanctions, to &#163;77&nbsp;under occupation. The percentage of mothers who die in childbirth is now over four times greater in oil-rich Iraq than over the border in resource-free Jordan. Some 63&nbsp;per cent. of Iraqis live in homes unconnected to a sewage system, resulting in a series of chronic diseases afflicting the population, in comparison to only 25&nbsp;per cent. in a similar situation before US-instigated sanctions were imposed in 1990. The survey estimated that 223,000&nbsp;Iraqis had chronic illnesses caused by the war. The number of women of working age who are in employment, a key indicator of female empowerment, is just 13&nbsp;per cent.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="60320-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_59">I saw an article recently that showed that according to official figures, unemployment in Iraq is more than 60&nbsp;per cent. I recall raising that matter soon after the occupation and saying that the situation needed to be dealt with if trouble was to be avoided. Instead, a rip-off was going on at a pace. All the contractors from outside&#151;Halliburton and its cronies&#151;took the jobs instead of the Iraqi people. As I said, recent figures show again that unemployment among Iraqis is well over 60&nbsp;per cent. There has been no change. As we heard, only 13&nbsp;per cent. of women are in employment in Iraq. That remains an appalling scandal. Iraqis are no better off.

<br>&nbsp;<br>fundamental considerations for both this country and the United States. First, if the United States and Britain have the right to take pre-emptive action, so, too, does every other country in the world. Any country throughout the globe that thinks itself threatened can, according to Washington and the present British Government, initiate a war simply in order to prevent one. Secondly, if pre-emptive wars are contemplated, one needs at the very least not just theories, ideas and suspicions, but solid evidence that can be shared with the public&#151;preferably before the war, but at the very least after it&#151;for why the action is appropriate. Those criteria have not been justified. One recalls Bismarck&#039;s remark in similar circumstances when he referred to the pre-emptive approach as being rather like committing suicide because of the fear of death. There are very serious consequences when starting a war in such circumstances, but they do not seem to have been taken into account.

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_75">There is a fundamental flaw in one aspect of the approach by the British and US Governments. The Secretary of State for Defence confirmed recently that the approach was gradually to hand over to the Iraqi national forces, the police and the army, and then withdraw our troops. In that way, it is hoped, everything will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds. In a normal situation in which one is assisting a Government who are fighting an insurgency, that would be a logical approach. The more the national Government increase their authority and the more they train their own army and police, the more they can be expected to deal with the insurgency themselves. But in the case of Iraq at this moment, that argument misses a fundamental consideration. This is not just an insurgency: it is an increasingly sectarian battle. There are three communities&#151;Sunni, Shi&#039;a and Kurd&#151;all of whom have different interests and none of whom is committed to the concept of a single Iraq. The army and the police force in Iraq are also overwhelmingly Shi&#039;a and Kurd. Therefore, the more powerful the police and the army become in Iraq, the less they are seen as safeguards by the Sunni minority and the more they are seen as an increasing threat to their interests. That is the fundamental inconsistency and why people are increasingly saying that there is no military solution to the problem. The solution, if there is one, has to be found in political terms, not in military terms.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_76">I said that the situation in Iraq was the worst disaster for Britain since Suez, but it is the worst geopolitical problem for the US since Vietnam&#151;indeed, including Vietnam, which already had an insurgency. Vietnam was already involved in a civil war before the Americans ever arrived. The Americans were trying to stop that civil war in the interests of the then Government in Saigon. The current crisis is entirely of our own making, and so far we have had five horsemen of the apocalypse. First, more than 35,000&nbsp;people&#151;Iraqis, Americans, British and others&#151;have died. According to Mr. Allawi, some 50 0r 60&nbsp;more are killed every day. Secondly, we have in Baghdad, the most pro-Iranian Government that Iraq has had for 70&nbsp;years, which was not one of the prime objectives of US foreign policy. Thirdly, the situation in Iraq is deeply Islamist rather than secularist. Saddam Hussein was a ghastly, vicious tyrant, but he was a secular tyrant. The current situation was no part of the American strategic objective. Fourthly, on terrorism, we have within Iraq&#151;be it for al-Qaeda or other organisations&#151;the greatest recruiting territory for terrorism since the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Finally, we have the drift into civil war.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_77">I noticed that the Secretary of State for Defence said last week that civil war was not inevitable or imminent&#151;an important choice of words. He did not say that it was unlikely. He said that it was not happening today, and it was not certain that it would happen tomorrow. But he knows as well as I do that the facts increasingly suggest otherwise. Indeed, the former Iraqi Prime Minister has said that the situation has already reached the point of civil war, and it is difficult to disprove that argument.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_78">So where do we go from here? I have said that it looks increasingly as if there is no military solution. British troops are doing a fabulous job, but they will not sort out the insurgency in the foreseeable future, and we all 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 46</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>know that. The problem is that our Prime Minister and the President of the United States are in denial. It is almost impossible to imagine a combination of circumstances that would now persuade either to acknowledge that it was all a terrible mistake. Whatever happens, they say that it is all part of the great plan, that everything is getting better and that we should just trust them. But the world does not trust them and nor should it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_79">A political solution is required with, first, a more convincing form of power-sharing in Iraq, recognising that Sunni fears and concerns cannot be met simply by a 20&nbsp;per cent. formulaic share in the structure of government. We went through that process in Northern Ireland, where eventually, after many painful years, we realised that power-sharing had to mean precisely that in a substantive sense, if it was gradually to resolve the kind of problems that we all want to address. Power-sharing has to have substance, not form.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_80">Secondly, the United States and the United Kingdom have to gradually appreciate that, although their withdrawal from Iraq will cause serious problems for the Iraqi Government, it will also remove one of the recruiting agents for those who are creating the insurgency. Arab Governments in the region must do far more than they have done until now to be part of the process of rebuilding Iraq and assisting the work of the democratic Iraqi Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_81">Finally, although we all want a democratic Iraq, that will work only if a President Putin-type figure is in charge of Iraq. I am no fan of Vladimir Putin; some of the things that he has done in Russia have been very bad, but he took over at a period of great instability and fragmentation in Russia, and one of the reasons why he has become so popular with the Russian people&#151;even if not with the rest of us&#151;is that he created a sense of stability and authority. If Iraq could identify an individual who could be given that sort of presidential power, he would not be a dictator in the Saddam sense, although he might be more authoritarian than we or the United States would like.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_82">That kind of political approach is the last chance for preventing the disintegration of Iraq.

There may be arguments on the margins that the amount should be a little more, but the Defence Committee says that we need to support our people in their job. The money is being spent, and there are important arguments about how it is spent and about accountability, but we must be clear about the fact that we are supporting people on the ground.

Talking to people on the street&#151;if we can actually get on to the street&#151;or talking to a couple of young men on the back of a donkey cart, we hear a different story. Of course, there is ambivalence about our being in Iraq, what we are doing and so on, but when we witness the day-to-day relationship of our forces with people in both Iraq and Afghanistan, it is not as it is often described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_86">Our forces want support at their elbow to do their job properly. Their motivation is clear. They are frustrated about obvious things such as being able to phone home, boots and all the usual stuff, but what they really want are the tools to do the job. Part of their frustration is about being able to engage in the civil-military interface, to provide appropriate support for civilians and the proper agencies of an emerging Government and other agencies. The people I spoke to have their own concerns, which include airlift capacity, armoured vehicles and their own protection and equipment, and they are right to raise those matters. They want a manoeuvre capability: they want to be able to get to where they need to go quickly, to be able to do the job, to be protected and to protect others, and to get away, and they need the equipment to do that.

<a name="stpa_87">I shall concentrate my comments on how we spend our money. A lot of concern has, rightly, been expressed about equipment.

I am worried that, although we have known for some time that there are problems in some of those areas and although we have continuing conflicts in two places, we have not been able to predict requirements. The Minister has had the opportunity to do this, so he knows that ordinary people doing the job on the ground will say that that is the problem: they need more certainty and better planning.

 The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful argument that what matters is not how much money is spent, but when it is spent.

Given that the technology used in improvised explosive devices&#151;shaped charges&#151;has been around since the second world war and was used in Bosnia and Kosovo, why was the money to protect against that threat not spent at the start, when probably half the amount that is having to be spent now would have been required?

That suggestion might be worth considering but no doubt there are others. I am not a management accountant or a policy wonk&#151;I do not understand how some of those processes work and, to be frank, I do not want to, but I am sure that the pointy heads in the Treasury could come up with processes that would do that for us. The political aspect is what is important&#151;if we have visibility and transparency, we might get better-quality decision making because we have a better understanding of the issues.

However, I want to see figures on spending on urgent requirements 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 49</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and on capital depreciation of assets. I want to be confident about how existing assets will be maintained and their life perhaps extended. I want those things to be made clear. It is clear from that decision that we know that we need more armoured vehicles and that we need a better supply. The methods that are currently used are not wrong, but different methods are available. There is a relationship between all those things, and the Select Committee is working on a report on defence industrial strategy. We have a clear defence industrial policy, including a force generation process that assesses the number of people required against a set of defence assumptions. Perhaps we should have better individual debates about each of those matters but, more importantly, they relate to the industrial strategy for delivery which, in turn, is related to the way in which the money flows.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_89">Those interrelationships are not clearly understood or debated properly in the House, so it is important to ventilate them. Partnering arrangements under a defence industrial strategy are probably a good idea for some things, but not for others. There are certain things that one needs to supply at certain times and that, frankly, one does not wish to subject to competition. ABRO has the capability to maintain armoured vehicles&#151;whether that will be true for the new fleet is a different matter. Some estimates and decisions about when money can be spent and acquired are related to those decisions.

<a name="60320-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_90">On the surface, I am asking a simple question about the regular supply of information but, in fact, the Committee and I are asking a very difficult question. Realistically, the answer is to provide a more joined-up process, because planning assumptions and so on depend on how the money is spent. It is not easy for the Ministry of Defence to do so, but it is vital to make those processes visible so that we achieve a better quality of understanding and, consequently, a better quality of debate. Doubtless, my right hon. Friend the Minister will be upset with me, and will have a bit of a row with me later but, although it may not feel like it, I am ally of his in this debate. At the end of the day, it is important that we show and demonstrate our own democracy at work. It is all very well for me to go on to the streets in Afghanistan and talk to ordinary Afghans about building capacity to provide a democratic process, but we must demonstrate such things in our own democratic process. In Iraq and Afghanistan, people said to me, &quot;You come from the mother of Parliaments, so you know it all. Just tell us what to do.&quot; I said, &quot;If I did know it all, I would be a dangerous man, and if I tried to tell you I would be even more dangerous.

 I am grateful to the House for allowing me to participate in this important debate. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) has said, this is one of our first opportunities to assess some of the spending commitments that have taken place not only this year, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 51</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but in the past few years. I take issue with some of the concerns that have been raised by Government Members that, somehow, we are involved in a process of simply ticking off the accounts. We must go further than simply looking at the financial aspects&#151;the numbers&#151;to the decisions that lie behind them. Were those decisions correct? Could the objectives have been achieved quicker or cheaper if other decisions had been made instead?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_97">Today, as I am sure all hon. Members are aware, is the third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. This is an appropriate time to take stock of what has happened in that country&#151;a moment to consider what has been achieved or not achieved&#151;and to measure the social and political progress that has been made. There are more than 200&nbsp;UK dead. More than 2,300&nbsp;American soldiers have been killed. More than 4,000&nbsp;British soldiers have been injured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_98">We now know that there were no weapons of mass destruction, no missiles with 45-minute readiness and certainly no links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. In my view, it was a mistake to ignore the calls for a broader coalition to deal with Saddam Hussein. It was a mistake to disband the Iraqi military. Certainly, it was a mistake to try to link 9/11&nbsp;with what was going on in Iraq. In my view, the invasion of Iraq, with the objective of helping to defeat terrorism, has only encouraged more terrorism and made the world a more unsafe place. Today&#039;s debate is about the sums involved, but those poor decisions have driven up the cost of our operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_99">I do not argue about whether Saddam Hussein had to be dealt with, but as someone who has spent many years in the military&#151;serving not only in Kuwait, but in Bosnia and other places&#151;I have questions about the manner in which we went about getting rid of him. The inadequate assessment of the initial threat, the poor justification for an attack and the appalling management of peacekeeping have all led to the rising costs that we are debating today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_100">We heard only last week that 800&nbsp;troops will be removed from the British forces in Iraq. The suggestion is that we are doing well and achieving our objective, but Iraq is in a very poor condition. Three months after the elections, there is still no proper Government. On average, electricity is available in Baghdad for only four hours every day, and there is no adequate water supply or sewage system&#151;after the Americans have spent about $20&nbsp;billion on the infrastructure.

 I know that the hon. Gentleman was not in the House when the decision was taken to invade Iraq, but as someone who has been to Iraq four times, including a week ago, may I ask him not to take as gospel everything that he reads in the newspapers? Clearly, the situation in the south and the north is very different from that in and around Baghdad. I do not recognise his description as applying to southern Iraq. In the south, effective regional and local government have been working for two or three years.

<a name="60320-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_101">The term &quot;civil war&quot; is being mentioned more and more. We have been encouraged by Ministers not to talk about it, yet that is what we are heading towards. We should debate it in the House. What would be the financial consequences for our involvement in Iraq?The elections there were a positive step forward, but they galvanised the parties and the electorate along religious lines and into their ethnic groups. Consequently, the new National Assembly is unable to agree on a Prime Minister and fill the political vacuum. Granted, in certain areas, initiatives have been taken, but in Basra and other places political power rests not just with the local councils, but with the militias. They have taken advantage of the political vacuum. People seek refuge with the militias in Basra and in many major towns because they are scared and do not feel they are being looked after by the official authorities. The British Government say there is no civil war, yet 1,300&nbsp;civilians were killed last month alone. There are 60&nbsp;attacks a day, on average, and about 30&nbsp;bodies are found on the streets every day in Baghdad. How high must the daily death toll rise before the Minister acknowledges that Iraq is in a state of civil war?

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_102">The Minister spoke about contingency planning. I should like to know what will happen if the current plan is not adhered to. A comparison can be made with Bosnia and what happened in that country&#151;three distinct ethnic groups, opinions and differences suppressed by a dictator whose authority was strengthened by outside threats, and when the dictator was removed, the lid came off, opinions could be expressed and the result was civil war.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_103">I have said previously in the Chamber that there is another possible solution to the situation in Iraq that we have not considered or put to the people of Iraq&#151;that is, the managed partition of Iraq. It already exists. The hon. Member for North Durham says he has visited Iraq. If he has visited the Kurds in the north, he will know that they have their own Prime Minister. They even have their own airline. They are entirely segregated from the rest of Iraq and they have no intention of developing any stronger ties. They are quite happy to run their own affairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_104">The Yugoslav model that we are trying to promote should be abandoned in favour of the Czechoslovakian model. Some form of velvet revolution should be promoted to allow segregation and the development of regional areas, including Basra.
</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60320-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Havard: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument and I do not doubt that his motives are good, but do not the things that he proposes&#151;a velvet revolution and managed partition&#151;pre-suppose a level of control and security that do not exist? How can those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 53</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be brought about without first providing a secure environment in which such a political debate can properly take place?
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60320-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ellwood: </b> 
 It is not for me to decide anything. That is for the Iraqi people to decide. When I put the argument to the Minister before, he found it amusing and suggested that I was some kind of imperialist who wanted to go in and sort out Iraq&#039;s problems. He might remember the debate, and he knew perfectly well that that is not what I was pushing for. It is something that the Iraqis need to decide, but the option that I have mentioned has not been debated to the full. If we speak to the Kurds, Shi&#039;ites and Sunnis, we find that it is an option that has not been pursued. It provides the blueprint for another solution, other than the civil war towards which we are now heading.

</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60320-15_spnew9"><b> Mr. Havard: </b> 
 The Iraqi people voted to maintain their country within its current borders. They did not vote in the last election for the partition that the hon. Gentleman describes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60320-15_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ellwood: </b> 
 First, the Kurds were never asked. If we look at the constitution, we see that the regions are given an awful lot of autonomy. I am suggesting that that needs to be developed even further and that, where there is no segregation, exactly what happened in Bosnia will occur. If we remove the troops or money that are going into Bosnia, I am sorry to say that the area would be likely to return to civil war. I believe that to stick blindly to the initial plans created many years ago, having learned what we now know and when they are obviously failing, is to risk the efforts and, indeed, the funding that we have put in, as other countries have done, including Iraq.

In the space of three months, the Ministry of Defence has gone from proposing large-scale cuts in ABRO to last week&#039;s welcome announcement that the job losses will be fewer than originally proposed. My concern is that some MOD boffins concluded three or four months ago that ABRO should be reduced in size, but on reflection concluded that that was not such a bright idea. It may well be that some of the work that ABRO does could be privatised and put out to privatised contractors, but that would take away the dedication, consistency and continuity of a skilled work force who live and breathe the Army just as much as anybody in uniform. I sincerely hope that the MOD will think again, even on the job losses that it is still going ahead with, and I hope that the Defence Committee will consider the whole scenario.

<br>&nbsp;<br>visit to British troops in heavily restricted conditions in Basra should not take one&#039;s eyes off the wider strategic position of taking in all the information from the whole country of Iraq. He saw what I saw on that visit, as we travelled round Basra in the back of armoured vehicles. That was when the situation in Basra was relatively benign, before the threat of improvised explosive devices had become as bad as it is today. I suggest that my article might bear his re-examination.

Does he agree that the only way forward is the immediate closure of Guantanamo Bay and the immediate acceptance of the role of the International Criminal Court and of international law in general, of which the United States seems to be completely ignorant?

The fact that he has received accounts that people at Permanent Joint Headquarters are now referring to the British forces going to Afghanistan as the &quot;duty targets&quot; gives some indication of the depth of concern and perhaps cynicism about the likely success of that operation.

<a name="stpa_124">The estimates that we are considering today are extremely vague, as the Defence Committee pointed out.

There is broad consensus that we are not sending enough troops to deliver the mission that they have been invited to undertake, but the force is also too large to extract easily. My worry is that, as the Americans downscale their operations in Afghanistan, the United Kingdom could be left holding the Afghan baby. The history of Afghanistan for foreign forces is an extremely unhappy one. The Afghan population will not easily be able to differentiate between the British&#151;with our long history of association with Afghanistan, the rules of engagement that apply to our forces and the restraints that we place on them&#151;and the Russians, the

<a name="stpa_125">The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Havard) spoke of the importance to the soldiers on the ground of civil-military relations, but chose not to dilate on the state of civil-military relations likely to be faced by our troops during their operations in Afghanistan. Our forces are being invited to destroy the method by which most Afghan people earn their money. That method is, admittedly, unacceptable to us, given the huge danger to our constituents and our country, as well as to the whole of Europe, represented by the heroin emanating from Afghanistan. However, if we destroy the Afghan people&#039;s main income earner, they are unlikely to be too pleased with our presence, and we shall not easily be able to establish good civil-military relations there. I am worried that our troops will quickly end up behind armour, having to defend themselves from attacks not only from those who are already hostile to us, but from those whom we are about to make hostile. In that sense, we will never be able to achieve during forthcoming operations in Afghanistan, on any basis, the civil-military relations about which the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil was talking.

 The hon. Member for Rhymney as well as Merthyr Tydfil has taken a quarter of the time remaining for my speech. I am not the only one concerned about the change in nature of the Afghan people&#039;s view of foreign forces. In May 2005, following reports of abuse of Afghan detainees by American forces, the President of Afghanistan said that he feared that popular resentment was building against the international military presence and the Americans in particular. It will be difficult for the Afghan people to differentiate the Americans and us. I saw that the British general in Iraq who was interviewed on &quot;Panorama&quot; the other day was wearing American stars on his uniform. In one sense, I have always been a supporter of inter-operability and operating together, but if our soldiers are putting that on their uniforms so that the Americans know that we are on their side, ordinary Afghan people might be forgiven a greater degree of confusion.

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60320-17_spnew9"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> 
 When I first entered the House in 1997, it was not long before the bright, shiny new Labour Government came out with a bright, shiny new Labour foreign policy. That foreign policy was to be an ethical foreign policy. We do not hear too much about that these days, not because we think that our foreign policy is not ethical, but because the experience of office has shown the Government that foreign policy and, by association, defence policy, is often not a matter of positive ethics but of deciding which is the lesser of two evils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_128">That has been illustrated by a number of speeches today, not least that of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt), comparing the differing objectives between wishing to clean up the trade in opium from Afghanistan, and not wishing to forge an alliance between the local farmers who depend on growing opium and the Taliban and other extremists and insurgents who were not normally in any form of prior alliance, but who could be forced into an alliance if we are heavy-handed about achieving the anti-drugs objective. In other words, one must sometimes choose the least worse policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_129">That was also implicit in the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) when he said that it looked as if Iraq were ending up with a Government far more pro-Iranian, in terms of the alliance of the two adjacent countries&#039; Governments, than one would ever have wanted. He did not say this explicitly, but I detect an underlying belief that the policy that was followed for years, and subsequently denounced on so many occasions&#151;the policy of supporting Saddam Hussein&#151;was completely unethical, which it probably was. It is likely, however, that when discussions were held in the Foreign Office in his day, the argument would have been, &quot;Yes, but what is the alternative&#151;some sort of axis, nexus or alliance between extremist fundamentalist Governments in adjacent countries?&quot; It is not easy to choose between those two evils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_130">The point is that a choice between evils must often be made. There is no morally free &quot;get out of jail&quot; clause that can be invoked by those burdened with the responsibility of deciding on a foreign policy or a defence policy in the modern world, which is peopled&#151;as no doubt were the mediaeval and ancient worlds&#151;by some very nasty regimes.

 I am aware that the Conservatives, with some honourable exceptions, voted for the war in Iraq. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree, however, that that was a war of choice? It was very different from the wars that we had fought previously, especially those that

</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="60320-18_spnew1"><b> Dr. Lewis: </b> 
 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not seem to have understood my point, which was that the choices we make often have deleterious consequences, whichever horn of the dilemma we choose. We have to choose the least worse alternative. In the case of Iraq, I believe that the person who chose the war was the person who, having previously mounted an unprovoked and bloody invasion of another UN member country, proceeded to ignore injunctions from the international community&#151;and that was Saddam Hussein.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_131">Saddam Hussein seems to have behaved in a very strange way. If he knew that he did not have weapons of mass destruction, he was certainly sending very unusual and unwise signals to the world. In obstructing the investigations for so long, he was doing all he could to suggest that he had something to hide. I am not at all ashamed of having made the decision that I made to support the war, given the knowledge that we had then. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#151;who of course did not support the war&#151;does our forces any favours by expecting those of us who did support it to say, &quot;We&#039;re terribly sorry, we were wrong.&quot; Decisions can be made only on the basis of the evidence available at the time, and everything about the way in which Saddam&#039;s regime was conducting itself indicated that there was something to hide&#151;something that we could not take the chance of letting him have.

The question was this: given that we would be debating a report on the estimates, to what extent would we be allowed to wander into substantive issues of foreign and defence policy? I am glad that successive occupants of the Chair have allowed that to happen.

<a name="stpa_133">The Government&#039;s presentation of a skeletal outline amounts to an opportunity lost. The message conveyed by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot) and his Select Committee is that there is no earthly reason why the Government, and the Ministry of Defence in particular, should not be a great deal more forthcoming. It has been suggested that one reason for the sketchiness of the information in the estimates is that the Government&#039;s vagueness about what policy they will adopt prevents them from being more precise in accounting for the large sums whose expenditure they expect us to approve. As the Committee has pointed out, however, that is given the lie somewhat by repeated indications in correspondence from the Ministry of Defence that in its dealings with the Treasury, the MOD adopts a system very different from that which it adopts in its dealings with the House of Commons.

<br>&nbsp;<br>for it to ensure that the House of Commons is similarly updated? Is it because of security considerations? I think that my right hon.

<a name="stpa_135">According to the report, the way in which the MOD has been satisfying the Treasury&#039;s requirements suggests that it regards Parliament, by contrast, as something of a rubber stamp. The Committee demanded that the MOD recognise that the agreement of the Treasury is not a substitute for parliamentary approval, and that giving the Treasury information is not enough. This is not just a question of the quantity or detail of the information; it is also a question of the format. I was relieved to read on page 11&nbsp;of the report, in paragraph 19, the sentence:

Page Ev 7&nbsp;of the report deals with the MOD&#039;s second memorandum. Under the heading &quot;Capital DEL&quot;&#151;departmental expenditure limits&#151;we read:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;The Department&#039;s estimate for Capital Expenditure in Request for Resources 2&nbsp;relates principally to equipment purchased as Urgent Operational Requirements&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and accelerated capital repair costs on equipment in operational use.&quot;</p>

I can only assume that if my right hon. Friend and his Committee had persisted day in day out, and week in week out, in trying to elicit more information, they might have been given a substantive account of what the MOD money would be spent on&#151;more or less in time for the estimates after next.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_139">More needs to be done, and one wonders why the MOD is not doing it.

I was particularly pleased to hear him say robustly that we cannot pull out of these commitments in a hurry, because we do not always hear that in this House. We often hear those who do not like the war, and who wish that we had never gone into these countries, describe the way forward as precipitate withdrawal.

It is one thing rightly to point out how many people have been killed in Iraq, but it is a sad omission not to point out that many of them are killed in bomb explosions for which the people who claim to be fighting for Iraqi freedom are responsible&#151;and that the latter could not care less who the victims are, so long as they create mayhem and frustrate attempts to reconstruct Iraq.

Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway) made a strong point about the apparently conflicting motives of our strategy in Afghanistan, but I have referred to that already. In support of what he said, I draw the House&#039;s attention to an article in today&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i>, &quot;Afghan officials face public fury as farm aid fails to materialise&quot;. It refers to one of the more northerly provinces and quotes the district governor in that impoverished area as saying:

The Government should have the courage of their convictions. There is nothing to be afraid of in airing these matters in the House of Commons. Various Labour Members have debated them time and again when the opportunity has arisen. We debate these matters without rancour.

<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 66</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>no different today. We have covered quite a gamut of subjects, but there has been a core to the debate. I will do my best to reply to all the points that have been raised. It is always useful in a winding-up speech to be able to say, &quot;If time permits,&quot; but I am conscious of the fact that there is quite a lot of time available, which will mean that I may have to expand on some answers because I do not have answers to other points.

<a name="60320-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">Let me just make this point in passing to the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot), who opened the debate. It was not long ago that he was a Minister. I suppose that if he had laid down new reporting procedures for the Department when he was there, this debate would be taking place in a different context. Only he can say why he did not think it necessary at the time to push for that. However, the Committee has raised issues that have provoked debate on matters of interest, which I will seek to address&#151;perhaps not wholly satisfactorily today, but I will indicate the way forward on that. I also thank him for the considered way in which he opened the debate. He could have taken longer, as it turned out, and helped me by leaving a shorter time for my winding-up speech. His favourable comments on the role of the Defence Procurement Agency&#151;there is also the Defence Logistics Organisation, which he did not mention&#151;in the processing of urgent operational requirements were well made. Those organisations work extremely hard. The issue is not just about those who are seeking to purchase; as he knows only too well, it is also about those who are seeking to deliver. Sometimes the industry is in-house, sometimes it is external, but it really delivers for us in these times of urgent need. I will deal with the key elements of the report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_153">I want to deal with two major contributions, although I will try to deal with all the contributions. I welcome the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) to his new role. This is a more substantial debate than he experienced in his early introduction to that role. He should keep a close eye on the Order Paper because he is likely to be busy in the period ahead and he may reflect on why he took on such a task. I do not underestimate the massive learning curve experienced by all of us who become engaged in defence, but if that means that there is an opportunity to score political points off him, I will. I was not clear whether he supports the expenditure that we are now committing to the conflict in Iraq.

Just for the record, it is the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps&#151;that is the first lesson on defence. We all get our words mixed up sometimes, but it is important to get that corrected.

<a name="60320-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_156">There is a growing economy. It is not, in one sense, an economy in free fall. There are indications of growth in the economy, but it should be much more rapid given the oil wealth. Insurgents and those who are trying to destroy what we seek to do attack power lines because that stops the oil industry&#039;s capacity to produce. They attack the oil industry itself for the same reason. There are measurable improvements in water and sanitation systems and schools and hospitals have been constructed. So, there are ways in which we can measure progress.

 No, I am going to deal with this point first. I will come to what my hon. Friend said and perhaps he can intervene then.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_157">The Government have pledged a total of &#163;544&nbsp;million for reconstruction during 2003&nbsp;to 2006. More than &#163;460&nbsp;million has been disbursed to date. That is a considerable effort. In a sense, I do not take the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) that a lot of that money may be misappropriated or deliberately taken away by those intent on malfeasance. There might be examples of that happening, but it is not a feature of our accounting practices and the way in which we try to deliver.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_158">When my hon. Friend raises a question about such activity, he is casting an aspersion not on military people, but, in the main, on civilian people who face daily risks when trying to deliver the reconstruction effort in troubled parts of Iraq. Putting all that in context is worth while. The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) asked my hon. Friend whether he ever made favourable comments about our armed forces. I heard my hon. Friend&#039;s response, but hope that he also realises that many brave civilians are making an amazing effort to deliver such reconstruction.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60320-20_spnew4"><b> Harry Cohen: </b> 
 I am astonished by the Minister&#039;s last comment. He is saying that because people are taking risks as civilian contractors, it is all right for them to do a bit a malfeasance. I do not think that it is, so he should reflect on his comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_159">The Minister makes a point about reconstruction. Let me remind him of the point in the <i>New Statesman</i> about hospital supplies that I cited in my speech. Iraqis do not need to be involved in the production of medical equipment and basic supplies for hospitals. We could have just shipped them in, flight after flight, on our Hercules airplanes. We could have sent mass supplies to equip the hospitals properly. Why have we not done so?

<br>&nbsp;<br>justifying any wrongdoing on the part of people who have their hands on public money in Iraq or anywhere else. I was saying that a balance must be struck when analysing the situation. My hon. Friend made severe criticisms without putting balance to them, so I was merely putting forward such balance. I noted that he still did not congratulate those civilians on all that they are doing to help to reconstruct Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_160">Let me return to the points made by the hon. Member for North Devon. There are infrastructure projects worth &#163;30&nbsp;million in south-east Iraq. There are power infrastructure projects worth &#163;40&nbsp;million and there is &#163;6.5&nbsp;million for employment generation. There is &#163;20.5&nbsp;million for strengthening the operating capacity of the four southern governorates and to encourage private sector growth. Considerable progress is thus being made. However, those significant contributions are part of the contributions made by other Government Departments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_161">The hon. Gentleman asked about the capability of the Taliban and the way in which we measure that in Afghanistan. I said when I gave evidence to the Defence Committee that that capacity is difficult to measure because whoever is paying some of those who are likely to mount attacks on any given day determines the uniform that they will put on and the cause for which they will fight. We are trying to get the best intelligence that we can. Our assessment of the situation is that illegally-armed groups are limited. We do not believe that they pose a strategic threat, although we are not saying that what we are doing in Afghanistan is without risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_162">The fact that the insurgency tactics have changed suggests that the groups are failing to make headway. However, of course, we cannot be complacent. We must take the view that the tempo of attacks might go down, stay the same, or go up, which is why such a powerful and potent international force is going into Helmand. We treat threats seriously and take every step to ensure that British forces deployed in Afghanistan are well prepared. Intelligence on what is happening on the ground is critical to that, so we put a lot of effort into it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_163">On counter-narcotics, we intend to spend more than &#163;270&nbsp;million in the financial years 2005&#150;06, 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&nbsp;in support of what we call the Afghan strategy. That includes &#163;130&nbsp;million of Department for International Development assistance that is aimed at creating alternative livelihoods. Between &#163;20&nbsp;million and &#163;30&nbsp;million will be going to specific projects in Helmand. We have a significant programme of work to address alternative livelihoods, and although others will also put in resources, only time will tell whether that is sufficient.

<a name="60320-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_164">My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead asked whether we were getting good value for our money in Iraq. He should ask the Kurds and Shi&#039;as who were systematically crushed and brutalised by Saddam Hussein and his barbaric regime. Is it worth it to remove tyranny? I think that it is. Is it worth it to give freedom to oppressed people? I think so. There is no question in my mind about what we are doing in Iraq. I think that the continuing price that is being paid for stabilising and bringing freedom to Iraq is worth it, but clearly my hon. Friend has a different view. The way in which he deals with that is a matter for him. I shall address other hon. Members&#039; contributions later, but I

<br>&nbsp;<br>wanted to talk about those made by the hon. Member for North Devon and my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_165">The debate takes place against the background of the continuing activity of our armed forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the courage, commitment and professionalism of our armed forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan in what are often difficult and dangerous circumstances&#151;I know that the whole House will agree. However, as this is an estimates day, I had better make some progress by saying something about finance. The Ministry of Defence is seeking &#163;2&nbsp;billion pounds in additional resources in the spring supplementary estimate. Just under &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion of that is for conflict prevention work, including almost &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion for Iraq and &#163;220&nbsp;million for Afghanistan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_166">Let me turn to the Defence Committee&#039;s report because it forms the basis of the debate and major contributions have been made on it. The report made nine conclusions and recommendations, and I would like to deal with each of them in turn. The Committee questioned the level of contingency built into the estimates in relation to conflict prevention. The contingency is there for a very good reason: prudence. Paragraph 8&nbsp;of the Committee&#039;s report recognises that it is necessary to be prudent when dealing with contingency. My Department has to forecast the costs of a rapidly changing operational situation, so the inclusion of a contingency is wholly justified. To put the contingency in context, since last November, business cases totalling well over &#163;100&nbsp;million have been approved under urgent operational requirement procedures for a range of equipment that is required for both Iraq and Afghanistan, although not all that money will be spent in this year. I know that the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire will understand that although a business case might be made and one might want to proceed, things do not necessarily happen in the financial year that has been suggested. That can lead to spill-over, so a contingency is important.

<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60320-21_spnew0"><b> Mr. Arbuthnot: </b> 
 It was not the inclusion of a contingency that caused us concern, but the inclusion of a contingency without full supporting detail.
</p>








<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60320-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I have explained some of the rationale behind that. The report recognises that some things might not be played out publicly because of such good reasons as operational considerations. It is not wise to state everything that we are doing to improve our equipment and capability in response to a specific threat. The scale of the &#163;146&nbsp;million contingency has been referred to, and I have already given an indication about the &#163;100&nbsp;million aspect of the budget. It would be difficult to give full granularity because although one can put forward a contingency, what is wanted might not materialise. Of course, if the money is not spent, the financial resource is not delivered. Over time, as specific urgent operational requirements have arisen, we have, when there has been no operational sensitivity, indicated what the requirements involve.

<a name="60320-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_167">Recommendation 2&nbsp;claims that the MOD did not take the previous Defence Committee recommendations seriously: I do not accept that. We have produced significantly more information this year than in any

<br>&nbsp;<br>previous year in the estimates memorandum. The new information includes the inclusion of tables of figures that break down the detail of each request for resource; detail of transfers to and from other Departments; a detailed breakdown of provisions and, importantly, a published audit trail of changes since the main estimates. There is much more explanation and clarity than in previous years, but we have to seek to go further still and we will reflect on the points that have been made in the report.

<a name="60320-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_168">We are planning to provide more detailed information on the cost of operations in our annual report and accounts, which is the appropriate place to do so. That information will be comparable to the level of detail we have recently provided to the Committee, and I hope that that finds favour with the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_169">The fourth conclusion and recommendation made by the Committee was that agreement of the Treasury is not a substitute for parliamentary approval. I could not agree more and I am sure that the Treasury would also agree. But we would hardly seek Parliament&#039;s approval to spend money without having closely consulted the Treasury in advance. I have been closely involved in such matters for several years, with the MOD and a previous Department and I know that the Treasury has a very important role to play in the tight scrutiny of departmental requests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_170">The reality is that we have to convince the Treasury before embarking on any significant course of action. That is part of the discipline within government. We have to justify our accounting processes, and ensure that they are sound. They must form part of the Government&#039;s mission and we must ensure that we have sufficient resources to achieve that mission. The process of consultation with the Treasury is a very important element of the work of all Departments. Indeed, I do not think that the Committee is arguing against such scrutiny by the Treasury. We have provided more information to Parliament this year than we have done before, and where we can, we will seek to improve further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_171">The Committee recommends that our practice of waiting for the spring supplementary estimates to request funds for commenced operations should cease and recommends that they are requested in the main estimates. It has been the practice that that request has been made in the supplementary estimates. That has been the traditional approach because costs are difficult to forecast in fast moving operational circumstances. My Department works hard to ensure that the figures presented to Parliament are reliable, and supplementary estimates are the first occasion on which we can reach a reasonably firm conclusion. However, we will look closely at the Committee&#039;s recommendation in consultation with the Treasury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_172">On recommendation 6, the Government have never routinely published operations expenditure data in-year, as the Committee requests. We provide an estimate based on the forecast of the cost of operations in the supplementary estimates. At the end of each year, the actual expenditure is audited by the National Audit Office, and then published in the annual report and accounts. As I have already said, we will be publishing more detail in this year&#039;s accounts. We are trying to obtain the best information and ensure its substance so that we can be properly judged, instead of providing the working figures for the MOD and the Treasury.

<a name="stpa_173">Recommendation 7&nbsp;relates to the provision for operations in the Balkans in the main estimates. That is &#163;64&nbsp;million for the current financial year. Provision for operations in the Balkans comes from what is known as the global conflict prevention pool. Pool funding ensures that no single Department becomes liable for those costs. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has always been the lead Department for administering the funds, and requests funding in its estimates on behalf of all the pool members. We make a contribution to the discussion on the collective amount that should be sought. We will consult the other Departments involved on the impact that making the recommended change would have on the long-established collective conflict prevention management arrangements, but I believe that the system we have works well. I am prepared to consider the point, but the current arrangements are clear. If we could do it another way, and the other Departments agree, we will come back to that issue.

A breakdown of that was provided to the Committee at its request, the major elements of which are &#163;121&nbsp;million on infrastructure, stock equipment and the support items needed by our troops to carry out their daily duties, and &#163;53&nbsp;million on capital equipment relating to force protection. Those are the headline items, but the list also includes &#163;150&nbsp;million for resource expenditure and &#163;70&nbsp;million for capital expenditure.

They were approved by Ministers and the accounting officer before being passed to the Committee. I understand that the document was not signed off, but that does not mean that it was not properly authorised. Paragraph 19&nbsp;of the report makes a number of assertions that I believe are not based on fact.

The balance of risk is always factored in, in terms of force lay down. I appreciate that my hon.

The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that there was no international legitimacy for going to war in Iraq, but he ignores the 17&nbsp;resolutions that sought to bring Saddam Hussein to book. I think that he ignores the fact that every major country was of the view that Saddam Hussein had the capacity and the intention to develop weapons of mass destruction; not one country, or their intelligence services, took a different view.

I think he was arguing that members of the UN should have a veto on the course of action that we and other countries should take, but that is a dangerous approach, which would mean that we were constrained by the geo-political interests of our allies&#151;those interests, rather than those we consider important, would be uppermost.

However, the coalition of the willing was 32&nbsp;countries-strong at the outset and increased shortly thereafter. There was a broad coalition for taking on Saddam Hussein; not every nation allied itself to it, but there was a significant combination of countries. The hon. Gentleman said that it was right to deal with Saddam Hussein, so in that case what more could have been done than our Prime Minister did? He made extreme efforts to try to ensure that there was unanimous support in the Security Council, but it was not forthcoming. As I pointed out to the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea, there were 17&nbsp;UN Security Council resolutions over 12&nbsp;years, and UNSCR 1441&nbsp;was specific in its analysis of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein&#039;s regime.

He recovered himself a bit by saying that it was for the people in those countries to come to that conclusion, but he seemed to be indicating that, in the case of Iraq, we should encourage them to do so. I do not believe that it would be beneficial to fragment Iraq at this juncture, although at some point in the future it may be. As I commented recently when giving evidence to the Select Committee, we are still a United Kingdom, but the people of the country&#039;s constituent parts can determine their future&#151;whether in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland. It is a matter for the people to decide.

 I pose again the question that I put in the debate. At present, between 60&nbsp;and 70&nbsp;people are being killed every day and Iraq is heading towards civil war. How many more people need to die every day before the Minister wakes up and agrees that the country is heading towards civil war?
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60320-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 There has been much analysis of that point and although I recognise the hon. Gentleman&#039;s military background and experience, his view is not the received wisdom and considered opinion of senior military personnel on the ground. I am not saying that there are not serious issues of sectarian violence and divisions in Iraq, but as my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)&#151;who is no longer in the Chamber&#151;commented, what we read in the press is not typical of the whole of Iraq. There are serious hot spots and some big issues to address, but they are not typical of the whole country. The more those situations are talked up, the more we feed the insurgency. I do not believe that the descriptions are valid, but the more we use such language, the more the insurgents will believe that they are winning. They will escalate their efforts because they think that our will is broken. Such talk is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 74</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>dangerous, although people should express their views if they honestly believe them, but they should be balanced against other advice and opinions. If the situation descends to civil war, we shall have to deal with it accordingly, but we are not in that position yet and every effort will be made, with the will of the Iraqi people, to avoid it.

<a name="60320-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_184">The hon. Member for Colchester noted, rightly, that on his recent visit morale was high. To read some newspapers, it would seem that our British Army is a broken force and that our forces are not interested and are leaving in droves. That is simply not the case. As I have said before, at the Dispatch Box and elsewhere, I&nbsp;am privileged because, due to the nature of my job, I probably meet more members of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces than any other Member. Indeed, I probably meet more of our armed forces than some senior officers, given their roles. The morale of our forces is consistently high; they are extremely committed. Yes, they complain about some aspects of their kit, but that is not a fundamental issue. Any member of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces will say that the current operational welfare package is considerably better than its predecessor. We learned lessons. We knew that we had to adapt and we are committing considerable resources to that element.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_185">The hon. Gentleman made a point about air transportation. As he is aware, the fleet employed for that purpose is ageing. We are trying to ensure that alternative aircraft are available, because it is wrong that forces being recovered from theatre for rest and recreation are unduly delayed&#151;they should not be delayed at all. The point is well taken in the Army and in the RAF, which supplies the logistics. Much effort is being put in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_186">The hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) is no longer in the Chamber, but he advised me earlier that he had another commitment. He raised many concerns about the style of US operations. However, the US has taken the full brunt of the insurgency and the foreign elements in Iraq, although that is not to say that we have not tackled major issues head-on. We have and, sadly, we have lost a significant number of people in such actions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that it is accepted that the immediate post-conflict and reconstruction process has not been well handled. Lessons have been learned, although we cannot recover what should have been done in the past. We can only learn the lessons and ensure that we make considerable progress from now on. That is why I gave details about the amounts that we were spending on the reconstruction and renewal of Iraq. The US is also spending considerable sums.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_187">We should pay tribute to the US for all that it does to help to bring freedom, stability and democracy to so many parts of our troubled world. We should not forget the role of the Americans in the Balkans and Kosovo&#151;and in Afghanistan, where they are determined to rip out the vestiges of al-Qaeda. If the Americans were not doing that, who would? Who would take on global terrorism if not the US, with us giving significant support? If that was not done, we can be sure of one thing&#151;global terrorist groupings would grow and threaten our very way of life. They will not go away; it is not domestic terrorism, but a global terrorist threat that has to be tackled at the point of threat. We cannot 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 75</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>wait for the next attack before winning public opinion to our side, although that is required. We have to make sure that we are tackling the threat with vigour.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_188">I think that the hon. Member for Reigate was too quick to condemn the US and I ask him to reflect on his position. He said that the Afghan mission was vague, but the mission of UK forces in Afghanistan is clear: to support the Government of Afghanistan in extending its authority across the country. We are part of an unprecedented international intervention, UN mandated and NATO led, working alongside Canada, the Netherlands, the United States, Denmark, Romania, Australia and Estonia in the south, and many other nations elsewhere in Afghanistan including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Nordic countries. We should also bear in mind the growing capability of the Afghan national army. NATO has a detailed operational plan, which sets out precisely what NATO forces need to achieve in Afghanistan. All of that takes place in the context of the much wider international effort building on the success of the Bonn process and marked out comprehensively in the Afghanistan compact agreed at the London conference in January this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_189">The mission in Afghanistan is demanding a lot of us, but I repeat the question that I asked a few moments ago. Some argue that we should not do it, or that we do not have sufficient resources for the task&#151;I do not agree; it is part of a wider international effort in support of the Afghan national army&#151;but what would it mean if we were not there? What would that mean for this country? I think that it would be extremely serious if Afghanistan descended back into an ungoverned state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_190">I found myself agreeing with much of what the hon. Member for New Forest, East said, although I will not tell him which parts of his speech I agreed with and which I did not. As ever, he made a thoughtful contribution. I share his view that it is Parliament&#039;s role to hold the Government to account. We have had a brief but wide-ranging debate, and I have tried to deal with the key issues on which the debate is based. I hope that the House will agree that I have responded in a reasonable, helpful and constructive way. Only time will tell.

<a name="stpa_192">Today&#039;s is a timely debate, given that a number of trusts face severe financial deficits. The Department of Health spring supplementary estimate includes large sums&#151;more than &#163;500&nbsp;million of public dividend capital, including more than &#163;195&nbsp;million year end flexibility&#151;to increase the loan capital to national health service trusts and primary care trusts. Those sums are in addition to the &#163;200&nbsp;million requested in the winter supplementary estimate for 2005&#150;06. We are therefore discussing a considerable amount of money in addition to the substantial increase in health care expenditure in this country that has been going on for four or five years under the Labour Government.

<a name="stpa_193">The expected NHS deficits are attracting a great deal of press comment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;the reason why there are deficits in a minority of trusts is that, in some cases, there has been overspending, sometimes for several years, or poor financial management, or poor organisation of clinical services.&quot;</p>

</p>








<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60320-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 I have several questions on NHS costs to put to the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy). Some hon. Members may have read my recent comments in the press on the fact that we know what the NHS spends, but not what it costs. I think that, after 58&nbsp;years, we ought to know exactly what it costs. I shall go into detail on that issue later.
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60320-23_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 May I challenge the figure given by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)? I agree that the sum is substantial, but that figure cannot be correct. At least 20&nbsp;per cent. of the increased spending on the NHS is going on new staff and staff in new posts, which is delivering a wider range of services. It cannot possibly be the case that 87&nbsp;per cent. of the increase is somehow being spent on inflation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60320-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is probably right. I have never looked at costs in detail, but we know that NHS inflation is higher than ordinary inflation in our economy. Perhaps the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex will speak during the debate and tell us how he arrived at that figure.

 Does the right hon.

The average children&#039;s hospice gets only 5&nbsp;per cent. of the funding it needs from those sources, and Little Havens in my constituency gets only 1.8&nbsp;per cent. Will he do all he can through his Committee to bring pressure to bear on the Government to tackle the hospice funding formula?
</p>








<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60320-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 I heard the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question during Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time last week and I am with him on that issue. The Bluebell Wood children&#039;s hospice is being built in my constituency, so I shall have an even greater constituency interest in years to come. However, I would be misleading the House if I were to say that my Committee is likely to look into children&#039;s hospice funding in the next few months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_195">It is striking that there was no warning of the deficits. Last year, on a budget of &#163;67&nbsp;billion, there was a deficit of just &#163;250&nbsp;million.

<a name="stpa_198">In 2004&#150;05, the NHS overspent by just &#163;250&nbsp;million&#151;the first time that it had overspent since 1999&#150;2000. That was reported by the NHS director of finance in his January 2006&nbsp;report to the Secretary of State for Health. The director of finance emphasised that the overspend was small in relation to the overall sum managed, but said that it was still a cause for concern. He highlighted three reasons for that concern. First,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;there was a significant deterioration between financial forecasts and&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_203">Those comments were made in the &quot;Financial Turnaround in the NHS&quot; report published in January. That represents an overall increase in the deficit of 150&nbsp;per cent. on the &#163;250&nbsp;million deficit reported in 2004&#150;05. That increased deficit threatens to destabilise the NHS, so we must control it. I am a great believer in the national health service&#151;I always have been, and I always will be&#151;but we will lose out if we do not gain control and find out what it costs to provide services for our constituents. The only way to do that is to ensure that bottom-line balances at the end of each year for all NHS trusts give a true and accurate picture of the level of activity and are not fictitious figures. Sadly, on occasion, people who have overspent have wanted to hide that fact by submitting fictitious figures.

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60320-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. David Burrowes  (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):</b> 
 In his deliberations in Committee, has the right hon. Gentleman encountered a reluctance by the Government to engage with the Audit Commission, which wishes to establish exactly what the costs and out-turn are? Does he surmise that that reluctance is because the Government do not want to expose the fact that the directives, edicts and targets that they have issued have created problems for Chase Farm hospital in my constituency, for example, which has been pressurised to dismantle its accident and emergency facilities?

<br>&nbsp;<br>to disguise or obscure the nature of the deficits, and I entirely agree. Does he therefore agree that it is important to focus on gross deficits? It is not good enough simply to talk about net deficits. Last year, as he said, there were gross deficits of &#163;623&nbsp;million. This year, as of month 6, they were nearly &#163;1&nbsp;billion. It will not do for Ministers to tell the House, as they have in the past, that the net deficits will be the same as they were the previous year when, only three weeks later, they admit that the gross deficits cited in our debate in mid-November of nearly &#163;1&nbsp;billion were accurate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_141"><a name="60320-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 I agree that we need an open and honest debate. The greatest problem for the NHS, certainly since I have been a Member of Parliament, is the fact that it is treated as a political football. It appears in everyone&#039;s manifesto, and it is kicked around almost every day in the House. I am not suggesting that Ministers in the present Government have done this, but Conservative Ministers did not want to advertise certain issues, as they knew that they would be magnified and turned over by the press. As a result, we do not have sensible debates on health care, but it is about time that we did.

<a name="60320-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_204">The report that I cited earlier says that 28&nbsp;PCTs with a combined turnover of &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion were forecasting a deficit of &#163;264&nbsp;million, or just 4&nbsp;per cent. Thirty-four NHS trusts with a combined turnover of &#163;6.5&nbsp;billion were forecasting a deficit of &#163;467&nbsp;million, or 7&nbsp;per cent. That excludes foundation trust hospitals. Analysis by accountants KPMG showed that 18&nbsp;organisations required urgent intervention and that 23&nbsp;needed additional expertise and/or resources. It is not clear from the report whether such interventions and additional resources are helping to turn around trusts&#039; finances.

<a name="60320-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_205">Monitor&#151;the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts&#151;identified the fact that NHS foundation trusts incurred an aggregate deficit of &#163;36.9&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05, which represented 0.9&nbsp;per cent. of their income. This year, one in every 32&nbsp;trusts is forecast to incur a substantial deficit for the first six months of 2005&#150;06, although in aggregate trusts forecast a surplus for 2005&#150;06. However, that forecast carried heavy caveats in Monitor&#039;s report, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. No doubt hon.

<a name="stpa_206">Another serious concern is the number of reports in the public interest issued by the Audit Commission to acute trusts, strategic health authorities and PCTs following significant financial problems. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) raised that earlier, but has now left the Chamber, presumably to issue a press release. Under section 8&nbsp;of the Audit Commission Act 1998, the external auditor must consider whether it is in the public interest to produce a report on any significant matters that come to his attention. If it is, they are set out in a public interest report. Twenty-seven public interest reports have been issued for SHAs, PCTs and NHS trusts since March last year, which reflects the number of NHS bodies with significant and potentially destabilising financial problems. No matter what people say, the Government cannot avoid the Audit Commission which, like some parliamentary Committees, exists to look at public expenditure. I am sure that it will do the competent and professional job that it has done in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_207">A number of reasons have been given for the continuing financial deficits. A review by KPMG in December 2005&nbsp;concluded that management capability was inadequate to deal with the financial position of trusts, that the quality of information was impeding recovery and that, in some cases, SHAs had permitted unproductive behaviour to damage the relationship between PCTs and hospital trusts. The Audit Commission&#039;s managing director of health said that the number of such problems may lead to organisations having to merge to remain viable and he has asked for clarification of matters such as the way in which charges are made for elective and emergency care.

<br>&nbsp;<br>people to come to terms with the actions that the Government are taking in the short term. My primary care trust is in south Yorkshire. I understand that in next year&#039;s budget the Yorkshire strategic health authorities have been asked to place 2.5&nbsp;per cent. of their overall budget in reserve because of the need to balance the books nationally in light of the current overspend. That means that my PCT will not get &#163;7.5&nbsp;million of its growth money. There is still a lot more growth money going in, but it is still a difficult decision for the PCT to accept. There was a board meeting this afternoon at which it was accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_221">The rest of south Yorkshire will also have to put 2.5&nbsp;per cent. of the budget in reserve, because four of the PCTs in south Yorkshire have overspent&#151;the exact figure is not known. Together with other south Yorkshire Members, I had a meeting last week with the SHA, which thought initially that there would be a &#163;20&nbsp;million overspend in those four PCTs. That figure is more likely to be between &#163;14&nbsp;million and &#163;16&nbsp;million. Everything has been honest and open. We are not hiding anything. Does my PCT like the idea of &#163;7.5&nbsp;million of its growth money coming out of next year&#039;s budget? Absolutely not. Nor do I, or anybody who works in local health care.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="60320-25_spnew8"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 As I understand it, the calculation is made on an SHA basis. To achieve national balancing, a sum equivalent to the overspend is being held in reserve. The amount will differ in different regions. In south Yorkshire we are told it will be 2.5&nbsp;per cent. I hope it is no more. When one looks at the communities for which our PCT provides services, and the high levels of health inequality, &#163;7.5&nbsp;million is no mean sum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_222">Given that the sum going into reserve equates to this year&#039;s overspend, even though we do not know what the overspend is and probably will not know until the middle or end of next month, is the same thing likely to happen again in 2006&#150;07? Everyone talks about the fact that PCTs&#151;and presumably hospital trusts&#151;that have run up large overspends, perhaps over years or perhaps over the past 12&nbsp;months, will not be able to pay off their overspends over the next 12&nbsp;months. Even if they incur no more extra spending in the next financial year, we will be debating estimates this time next year and observing that, although the overspend is down, it has not gone away. What worries me, and probably worries my primary care trust, is that, if the same situation occurs next year, it will not be a case of keeping money in reserve to balance the books. It will bite into the growth money that has been so vital to turning health care around in my area.

By itself that is not a bad idea, but the key question is how it is pursued. Global figures on the whole NHS are no good. They are relatively uninformative; they tell us something and they are very useful in Prime Minister&#039;s questions and so on, but they do not provide a fine-grained picture.

It has certainly been disguised by extensive use of brokerage, whereby the SHA would find money for those in deficit and bail them out at the end of the year, and sometimes by plain misdescription of activity, whereby a shortage of secondary care might be dealt with by using some money allocated to primary care, which is then called secondary care.

Things have happened, brokerage has been abolished and there has been a switch to resource-based accounting and so on. Furthermore, the system lacks transparency at present. The world is not as it seems, and the debts of some trusts are currently disguised by brokerage simply because the SHA accepts that some trusts have a Baldrick-like cunning plan to get out of their current situation.

There is a double whammy whereby once a trust runs up a deficit in one year, it starts with a lower budget the following year. That must be the most insane way of dealing with debt since the debtors prison was abolished.

<a name="stpa_234">My great fear is that the drive for financial balance across all cost centres will ride roughshod over patient entitlements and lead to damaging reconfigurations, longer patient journeys, trusts crippled by historic debts and a whole lot of political trouble for the Labour party. A better approach, which we should favour and which is true to the NHS ethos, is not necessarily to begin with the question of how we can get existing cost centres into balance so that they can trade solvently with each other, which seems to be the question preoccupying the health service at the moment. Given the money available, we should be asking what citizens are entitled to and how we can best deliver it. We should start with the people, and local people at that, rather than with institutions. We do not have a false choice between an NHS that satisfies the auditors and an NHS that satisfies the citizen&#151;but in the real world it does not follow that the former guarantees the latter. I urge the Secretary of State to proceed with caution, to avoid simple solutions and to recognise that even with reform, one must learn how to reform.

 In the past week, north Staffordshire communities have been left reeling by the extent of the proposed redundancies at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire Trust, which is one of 18&nbsp;NHS trusts currently receiving extra support from the turnaround team to help recover its financial balance. In order to bridge the &#163;30&nbsp;million gap between income and expenditure and start to repay some of the debt, the trust plans to save around &#163;43&nbsp;million over the next two years. That is a tough task, but the new interim chief executive Anthony Sumara is probably the person to do it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_237">About 70&nbsp;per cent. of the trust&#039;s annual expenditure goes on pay, so it is clear that jobs must go, but the prospect of 1,000&nbsp;jobs going has sent shock waves throughout north Staffordshire.

 I made a noise when the hon. Lady blamed NHS managers, because that is all we hear from Ministers. The problem is systemic, and Ministers&#151;not chief executives or civil servants&#151;must take responsibility for the state of the NHS. The hon. Lady&#039;s constituents and others will see thousands of jobs go, and they will not think it acceptable to blame the situation on poor management when those managers are appointed through the centralised system set up by this Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="60320-27_spnew5"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 I totally disagree with the hon. Gentleman, given my personal experience. While the failed previous chief executive has escaped to a plumb nursing job in the Department of Health, is it right that patients and staff should suffer cuts as a result of poor past management? Valuable and committed staff are being sacrificed to recoup the losses generated by past poor management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_238">There is scope for greater efficiency. For instance, a hip replacement normally means a five-day hospital stay, and if in North Staffordshire that involves an 11-day stay, it does not take rocket science to recognise that the hospital is bound to make a loss. Unless such stays are reduced to the average for other trusts, the hospital is bound to get itself into difficulties. Improvements can and will be made by examining the use of theatres and out-patient services, rationalising the split site arrangements, using new technologies and reviewing back-office functions, but the impression remains that existing staff are paying the price for management failures that were not of their making.

<a name="stpa_239">I have received numerous letters&#151;similar letters have appeared in the press, too&#151;praising the friendliness and professionalism, and the caring and hard-working nature, of the staff, and I want them to be looked after. There is a plan to employ many of the people who currently occupy the 1,000&nbsp;jobs in the community that are due to go, because the trend is towards community care rather than basing care on an acute hospital. I want to see a package on the scale of the Rover package to help those staff either retrain or enter other jobs in the health service. The community in north Staffordshire is very deprived, and we cannot sustain 1,000&nbsp;job losses without extra help.

<p><a name="st_177"><a name="60320-27_spnew9"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 Those are short-term issues. I appreciate that the slide cannot continue in acute hospitals and PCTs, and a line must be drawn to deal with those deficits, which should be dealt with in a relatively short period&#151;obviously, on occasions, with transitional help.

<p>
<a name="60320-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_240">The big issue in north Staffordshire is the rebirth of the University Hospital of North Staffordshire&#151;the fit for the future project. The project faces some paring down, which is in keeping with the move towards community health resources rather than relying on the acute trust. It is nevertheless vital that the project goes ahead, to reduce the glaring health inequalities in north Staffordshire and help to regenerate the local economy. Despite the hospital deficit, that project must go ahead, because any uncertainty will create real problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_241">It is important that the Department should consider transitional funding, if it is necessary to get the hospital off the ground. The locality needs a new hospital, because we have possibly the most dilapidated hospital buildings anywhere in the country, so replacing them is a priority. The lack of investment in hospitals in the past is demonstrated by the fact that we are stuck with such appalling buildings, which should be replaced quickly. I want the hospital to work much more closely with PCTs, the ambulance trust and community staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_242">The Secretary of State has pointed out that deficits generally occur in wealthier areas, which are frequently bailed out by more deprived areas. That is not the case in north Staffordshire, which has significant deficits, which must be sorted out, not only in the hospital but in the PCTs. I welcome the greater transparency that is now involved. In the past, Staffordshire has frequently bailed out Shropshire. It has all been done very much under wraps. The loan has of course eventually been repaid, although no interest has been paid. Now it is clear that my own Staffordshire Moorlands primary care trust will be borrowing money, but will be paying interest that the lender will receive. What is happening is clear for all to see.

 My constituents in Shropshire would be aghast by the hon. Lady&#039;s last comment that Staffordshire has bailed out Shropshire. It is some sort of a bail-out when the Shropshire health economy is facing a &#163;38&nbsp;million deficit, meaning cuts to local hospital services.

<a name="60320-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_244">I very much support the Secretary of State&#039;s statement about reducing unplanned emergency admissions and saving the NHS money. My PCT has embraced that enthusiastically&#151;for instance, through the anti-falls programme, but particularly by using community matrons to intervene in the community to pre-empt unplanned emergency admissions. The PCT has saved about &#163;0.5&nbsp;million by such investment in community provision. However, the avoidance of emergency admissions now attracts half the funding that it did previously, so from a financial point of view there is less incentive to invest in community provision and it is less cost-effective to do so. That will hardly encourage best practice, as the Secretary of State wants to do, and it will undermine future investment made by my PCT in preventive measures such as the anti-falls programme and the employment of health visitors and suchlike.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_245">Similarly, we have an ambulance service in Staffordshire which, through its superior training of paramedics and community first responders, prevents huge numbers of admissions to hospital by treating people at home. That is better for the patient and saves millions of pounds for the NHS, and it does not crowd out elective surgery at the hospital. Yet that ambulance service is threatened with merger, involving a dilution of staff skills and a reduction in their service standards. If we are serious about increasing and improving out-of-hospital care, we have to reward PCTs and ambulance trusts that are excelling in those fields. We should not merge them with other organisations that do not share their focus and delivery.
</p>

<a name="60320-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_246">I hope that when we come to the end of the public consultation on Wednesday 22&nbsp;March, the strategic health authority and the Secretary of State will listen to the overwhelming response of people in north Staffordshire who say that they want to create a local north Staffordshire PCT and do not want a gigantic Staffordshire-wide trust. They also want an independent ambulance service working within the west midlands that would act as an exemplar to other ambulance services and help to create far better ambulance services country-wide.

I do not doubt that its desire is to modernise health care and to improve health services for local people, but its aim is to cut its costs and to balance its books. In fact, it now has an imperative to balance its books because we are living in a very competitive climate. In Surrey, five PCTs are to be reconfigured down to one PCT. Many people are competing for many fewer jobs. There have been articles in the press and the health service journals about that. Senior managers in PCTs that are to be reconfigured tend to get the chief executive job at whatever level&#151;strategic health authority or PCT&#151;if they balance the books. Everybody who works in the health service, particularly in PCTs, understands that. In fairness, one cannot blame the staff for looking at it in that way. They have mortgages and bills to pay and families to look after. It is worth considering whether it is really a good thing for the Government to be reconfiguring PCTs given that that will result in an incredible loss of focus for the staff involved.

The hospital trust was &#163;5&nbsp;million overspent at the beginning of this financial year and heading for a &#163;16&nbsp;million overspend. So it took on Kim Hodgson as its new chief executive. She has applied the pain&#151;even though she is a nurse&#151;and it is now likely that the hospital will finish the year in no worse a position than it was in at the beginning, and that by the end of the calendar year it will be in balance. This shows what can be done without a bail-out from the PCT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_265">My PCTs have important plans for delivering the Government&#039;s agenda for locality health centres. They are working to provide three new centres in the area, and they have relied on the money that they were promised to make that possible. It will not be possible if they do not have the money that they have been promised. What we are seeing in those PCTs and in that hospital trust is gold-standard management. They acknowledge and accept the Government&#039;s belief that if fair funding is provided, as it has been, it is their duty and responsibility to manage. That is why I am so angry about what the strategic health authority is now seeking to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_266">The SHA is saying that, as the Government require it to balance its books, it wants the money back from the PCTs that have underspent this year. It also wants the PCTs to accept a massive 3&nbsp;per cent. reduction in their planned spending for next year and the year after. That would mean putting all their plans on hold. I regard such management on the part of the SHA as deplorable. How can it behave in a manner that is so contrary to the intentions set out in the letter from the Secretary of State that I have just mentioned? How can it take money from the successful to give to the hopeless?

The SHA is proposing to reward the bad and punish the good, but that is precisely the opposite of what Ministers were saying. If trusts believe that they can be bailed out, what message does that send to others? I know what message has been sent to my local PCT, and I certainly know what some of the GPs are saying. They are saying, &quot;Why bother?&quot; What is the point of enduring the pain if they are to be punished in this way?

He had spent his money and that was the end of it. He was looked after and cared for, but he never got his helping of cash twice over. I want to suggest to the Minister that that is the message here. These trusts have had their money, and they have spent it. It is important that they should not gain any benefit from overspending. That sends out the wrong message, and it is unfair to those who work hard and comply with the Government&#039;s entreaties.

The question underlying his speech was, why did the SHA decide to top-slice by 3&nbsp;per cent. his excellent local health care trust, thus calling a halt to any hope of the growth and improvement for his constituents for which he obviously devoutly wishes? The answer is that that order came from the Secretary of State; it was not dreamt up by the SHA. If Ministers have not told Back Benchers that truth, perhaps they ought to.

There is increasing bewilderment not only in the House, but across the country about where the money has gone. The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) asked where it had gone, as does everyone else. In 2004, it was leaked&#151;admittedly&#151;from the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit that there had been a reduction in NHS productivity of up to 20&nbsp;per cent. by 2004, despite Government spending. So Labour Members might sing the praises of the vast sums that have been spent on health care, but the truth is that productivity has fallen. It was surging in the early 1990s.

Members can imagine my shock when, new to this House, I found that my local services were being cut. They can imagine how that was compounded, although I was initially joyous, when the White Paper came out. A new Secretary of State was saying that no community services or facilities must close because of short-term budgetary pressures. She said at the Dispatch Box, where the Minister is currently smiling and laughing, that that should not happen. Across the country, it is happening.

A check was done on Mena Rising, however, to see whether her GP was wrong to say that, as she was terminally ill, she should not be moved. They could not overcome that assessment, so she was allowed to remain alone in that hospital. All the other patients were moved on a Sunday and she died on the following Thursday.

Of course there are teething problems; of course it is taking longer than we thought it would take; of course there are massive difficulties with an IT system that is as enormous as the new NHS IT programme.

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_286">That is not to say that there are no issues of concern. There certainly are such issues, and I should like to raise a couple. My local hospital, which is involved in the private finance initiative, has a turnover of about &#163;100&nbsp;million, with a PFI access charge of about &#163;18.9&nbsp;million this year. Yes, it is in financial difficulties. I met the chief executive last week to discuss how that would be managed, and heard about his robust programme to keep the deficit at least to a reasonable level. It is not a crisis, but it is a matter of concern, and of course it matters to patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_287">The hospital is having to scale down some of the elective operations scheduled for this side of the end of the financial year, because in 10&nbsp;months it has engaged in the amount of activity that would normally have filled 12&nbsp;months. The results have been excellent, with improved efficiency and productivity, but of course budgets are stretched towards the end of the financial year, and some operations will need to be postponed until April. That is worrying for patients, but I have been assured that they will still be treated within the six-month time scale set by the Department. That is much better than anything that happened in earlier times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_288">I believe that there are things that we can do to improve NHS efficiency and reduce some of the worrying overspends. I should like acute trusts and primary care trusts to work far more closely together, with regular updates and meetings to plan expenditure and activity, so that we do not see, year after year, February deficits and end-of-financial-year meltdowns and disasters that are avoidable and foreseeable, and should be a thing of the past. If the PCTs and acute trusts sat down together to plan expenditure over the year, many of those difficulties could be removed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_289">There is also a need for acute trusts to work together. All too often, an acute trust that finds itself in difficulty will ignore what other trusts are doing down the road and will duplicate services, trying to increase income by concentrating on what they see as their strengths, regardless of what else is happening in the local health economy. That is inefficient, and I believe that it destabilises some areas.

<a name="60320-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_290">I feel that payment by results encourages hospitals to generate as much business as they can in order to stay healthy. It has encouraged some hospitals to adopt the approach that the more patients they admit, the more money they can earn. That distorts local priorities. An analysis of the impact of the system, which was introduced in 2004, found that it had led to an increase in the number of short-stay admissions to foundation 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 102</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hospitals&#151;as opposed to non-foundation hospitals, which were still operating under the old block contract payment system. Between April and September 2004, the number of short-term admissions rose by an average of 24&nbsp;per cent. in the 10&nbsp;foundation trusts, and by only 17&nbsp;per cent. in similar non-foundation trusts. Research by the Audit Commission found that overall hospital activity in foundation trusts had increased by 1&nbsp;per cent., and that the number of short-stay admissions had risen by 7&nbsp;per cent. Some of those hospitals are driving up activity in a way that does not necessarily reflect local health need, and could destabilise and undermine PCTs&#039; efforts to keep their budgets under control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_291">The accident and emergency waiting target may also cause problems. Because some hospitals have found it impossible, or very difficult, to discharge patients within four hours, there is an increasing tendency to admit patients. Not only does that avoid the four-hour target, it increases hospitals&#039; income significantly. There is a driver in the system which, in some hospitals, has caused inefficiency to push up the costs to the local health economy. There is also a tendency for some hospital trusts to exaggerate the complexity of patients&#039; illnesses, which again pushes up the tariff for the care that those patients receive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_292">Those are not acute structural problems, but they should cause concern. I should like Ministers&#151;especially when they engage in discussions with trusts and others&#151;to think about how the distortions can be levelled out. Many of the overspends are not all that enormous, but they can build up over a period, and such levels of inefficiency in the system can cause unnecessary destabilisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_293">There are also far too many follow-up out-patient appointments; indeed, my research shows that some two thirds of all NHS out-patient appointments are follow-up appointments. I do not know what research has been done on how unnecessary they are, but my understanding and belief is that many could easily be carried out by the GP or practice nurse, and some of them are probably not even necessary. They give rise to significant cost pressures in an acute hospital setting, where many patients simply do not need to be and, frankly, do not want to be. Many would probably be happier at their GP&#039;s surgery, and if the GP feels that the problem is beyond his or her capability a referral back to the hospital would be a much more efficient use of facilities and finance.

This is not a crisis, a meltdown or a catastrophe, but it is worrying that the health service should end up with yearly deficits, despite the record amounts of money going in. It is very important for Members to reflect on the significant improvements in patient care. Patient satisfaction is rising and all GPs now have to conduct yearly independent patient satisfaction surveys in order to show the PCT that they are doing a good job. The vast majority are indeed doing a good job, and through the new pharmacy contract pharmacists are making significant improvements. Moreover, nurse practitioners and specialist nurses are making incredible improvements in health service care.

<p><a name="st_212"><a name="60320-31_spnew4"><b> Dr. Richard Taylor  (Wyre Forest) (Ind):</b> 
 As you and the House know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have no party political axe to grind; my aim tonight is simply to get at the truth. It is entirely natural that the Government should minimise the scale of the deficits, saying that only a quarter of trusts are in deficit and that the projected &#163;800&nbsp;million deficit is only 1&nbsp;per cent. of the total budget, but I am not at all sure that that is the true figure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_296">This year&#151;2005&#150;06&#151;trusts have been allowed to use brokerage, short-term loans and cost improvement programmes and, at the half-yearly point, the projected deficit was &#163;620&nbsp;million. At that time, one trust in my locality admitted to a deficit of &#163;3.8&nbsp;million; it now has to save &#163;20&nbsp;million to get into balance. Another trust admitted to a &#163;10&nbsp;million deficit; it now has to save &#163;36&nbsp;million to get into balance. The hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) said that her trust has to save &#163;16&nbsp;million, yet according to its six-monthly forecast it was going to be in balance. If those examples mirror the picture across the country, the gross deficit is far greater than the &#163;800&nbsp;million that is being admitted to. We should also consider reports of the scale of redundancies in trusts such as Cornwall and North Staffordshire. Technically, the Queen Elizabeth hospital, Woolwich, is insolvent. Many Members have mentioned top-slicing at 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;per cent., but if that is to be the right answer, the figure would have to be even higher.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_297">What has happened to the extra money that has been invested, rightly, in the health service? The figures given to the Health Committee by the think-tank Reform were passed to the Department of Health and have not been queried. Some &#163;3.7&nbsp;billion of the extra &#163;6.6&nbsp;billion has gone automatically on cost increases. That leaves &#163;2.9&nbsp;billion, which has been spent on meeting underestimates of the cost of the new contracts, of the cost of recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and of the cost of private finance initiatives and pensions. That leaves very little to pay for employing the extra consultants and nurses being trained, or to meet the 18-week target.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_298">If we could get at the truth of the real scale of the deficits, the Government would have to agree to give more time to achieve balance. It is ridiculous to try to achieve balance in precisely 12&nbsp;months. The Royal College of Nursing, in a letter that I suspect that it sent to many hon. Members, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;All Trusts should have the option to defer deficits for an agreed period of one to three years as agreed with the health economy where achieving in year balance will restrict choice and adversely impact service provision.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_299">Apart from the delay, what should we do? It is obvious what we should do. First, we need to examine the equality of funding. Some hon. Members have already mentioned work that suggests that funding is not equitable. We do not just condemn management; we examine the quality of management and see where it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 104</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>good and where it is not. We ask the Department of Health not to make any more mistakes. It was admitted in a letter dated, I think, 22&nbsp;February, that the Department had got the national tariff wrong. How can one calculate how to spend one&#039;s money if the tariff is wrong? We should allow time for payment by results to happen and for practice-based commissioning. We should put an embargo on further use of private independent sector treatment centres until we really know&#151;when they have been evaluated&#151;if they are value for money.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_300">We should put a temporary halt on PFIs. Some 60&nbsp;trusts have PFIs tying up about 11&nbsp;per cent. of their income. That is the first call on the income. We have had 28&nbsp;reorganisations since 1982. As I keep telling the House, for goodness&#039; sake, do not have any more reorganisations for the moment. The Government must avoid knee-jerk reactions. Top-slicing the primary care trusts is not right and neither is shifting the cost of long-term care. As for the suggestion that asthma and heart disease can be treated more in the community, doctors do not send patients to hospital for fun and patients do not go for fun. Virtually every case of asthma or heart disease that can be treated in the community is being treated in the community. When the people concerned go to hospital, they do so because they need a consultant opinion, consultant investigations, consultant treatment or intensive nursing care. I cannot imagine where the suggestion has come from. What medical advice did the Secretary of State take on that? Did she ask the royal colleges, the chief nursing officer or the chief medical officer? That sort of plan is a knee-jerk reaction.

<p>
<a name="60320-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_301">There is a lot that can be done. I held an Adjournment debate just last week on the logical reconfiguration of acute hospitals, because there is scope for that. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not talking about community hospitals, which are a cost-effective way of saving acute hospitals work, but there are logical reconfigurations of acute hospitals. Let us take the example of Hartlepool, Stockton and Middlesbrough, which are within 8&nbsp;miles of each other in an equilateral triangle. One cannot keep three all-singing, all-dancing hospitals with everything there, but services can be shared.

<a name="stpa_302">There should be a logical review of the work force, with joined-up thinking. We should not train 30,000&nbsp;extra consultants unless we can employ them and at the moment, we certainly cannot. The move to care in the community might mean that we do not need them all. Perhaps the most important thing is to have an open debate on health care rationing and on what people would be prepared to pay and what sort of NHS charges are realistic. Not very long ago, <i>BMA News</i> carried out a survey of its readers and 96&nbsp;per cent. of doctors who responded said that health care rationing was one of the most important things that should be discussed.

Sadly, that is not possible, but the market is not working at the moment. We must find out whether, with sensible changes, we can make it work.

 In a debate that concentrates on estimates and figures, it is inevitable that there is an emphasis on difficult funding areas. However, when we rightly examine such areas, it is important that we do not lose sight of the bigger picture: far from being in crisis, for the fifth year running, our health service is treating more people, reducing waiting lists and improving patient care. Funding has increased from &#163;34&nbsp;billion in 1997&nbsp;and it is projected that it will be &#163;92&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08. Yes, there are problems, but when a &#163;70&nbsp;billion budget&#151;the current budget&#151;is delivered by 600&nbsp;separate units, the chances of keeping each unit in financial equilibrium are slim. We must also consider the situation in the context of dramatic changes to the way in which we deliver health care and the implementation of new contracts. Such difficult and perhaps destabilising issues have caused problems, but we have an NHS funding deficit that is a tiny proportion of the whole budget and considerably less than that in 1997, when there was a much smaller NHS budget.
</p>

<a name="60320-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_306">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) threw out statistics on productivity that were laced with individual anecdotes. I, too, would like to compare what the NHS is like for people in my area with how it was a few years ago. My GP surgery, which is just down the road from me, has almost doubled in size. There has been a huge increase in the provision of GPs and support staff, and throughput. The surgery now has a training centre.

When inserting a leaflet through a door, I was met by a quiet, yet vicious dog that not only refused to enjoy the wisdom of my leaflet, but proceeded to try to chew off the ends of my fingers.

<br>&nbsp;<br>which some hospitals were managed. My local PCT has a small deficit and it puts it down almost entirely to the increase in accident and emergency admissions in hospitals, especially a huge increase in short-stay admissions as a result. I cannot believe that so many more people are having accidents or other emergencies that require short-stay admissions. There must be a problem with the management of the health care caseload in the area, which must be examined to ensure that funding meets provision more accurately than it does at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_309">I reinforce the comments made by others about top-slicing. My own local area has a history of underfunding and health problems. On all the indices, such as cancer rates, coronary heart disease, infant mortality and life expectancy, my area performs poorly, which is why it is one of the so-called spearhead PCTs. We were enthusiastic about the extra funding from the Government to address those problems, but the SHA&#039;s top-slicing arrangements mean that all the benefits that could have accrued from that extra money might be lost. I ask the Minister to ensure that the process that will be used to bring overspending trusts back into line does not penalise those PCTs in the most deprived areas. Otherwise, the whole thrust of Government policy will be blunted.
</p>

<a name="60320-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_310">There are problems, but they have been created in the context of an expanding health service, which is driven by people&#039;s higher aspirations.

Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), who will respond to the debate, is enjoying every minute of it so I do not ask her to respond now to the matter that I am about to raise, but perhaps she could write to me. In 2004, Southend Hospital NHS Trust applied for foundation trust status on the basis that it would be able to remain part of the NHS, working under NHS traditions, providing treatment free at the point of delivery, and would also be able to involve more local people, hospital staff and volunteers in service delivery, but with greater freedom in the funding of health care. However, the application was turned down and, as the trust reported on 27&nbsp;February, Southend hospital&#039;s hope of being licensed as an NHS foundation trust on 1&nbsp;April 2006&nbsp;received yet another disappointing setback.

Furthermore, it succeeded in meeting both its financial and waiting time targets, so the Minister will understand my point about the disappointment caused by the statement about the hospital&#039;s foundation trust application. The hospital&#039;s achievements are solely down to the hard-working staff, who have risen to the extra challenges presented by the Government&#039;s target-setting agenda, while managing to balance the books.

<a name="stpa_320">As several Members have said, changing the structure of PCTs has caused some disquiet; it has certainly done so in Essex. Is the reorganisation of PCTs about cost saving or improved service delivery? The Government have identified efficiency savings of 15&nbsp;per cent. Had cost savings not formed part of the criteria, organisations could have had considerable flexibility to tailor reconfigurations closely to local need. Linking the reforms to cost savings at a time when many PCTs are already managing deficits means that many SHAs will have no option but to reduce the number of PCTs. Such a reduction in the number of organisations would release &#163;250&nbsp;million of NHS money, but in some PCTs the push to save costs has overridden other considerations, such as maintaining local engagement. I hope that that is not what the Government intended.

The Secretary of State accepts that there will be more turbulence, more disquiet and more criticism, but believes that measures to improve efficiency could be made without jeopardising patient care.

The Royal College of Nursing has acknowledged that many people with chronic conditions could be treated in the community rather than admitted to emergency units, but points out that that would require extra funding to pay for the nurses, which would still take resources, so it is not necessarily the cheaper alternative that the Government are seeking. The Government should reconsider that idea very carefully.

<a name="stpa_324">It is true that the 18&nbsp;trusts singled out in the NHS hall of shame are a small minority of NHS trusts, and the projected deficit of approximately &#163;800&nbsp;million is only a small percentage of total annual spending, which has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grown enormously for the benefit of patients everywhere in the country, but the problems exemplified by the situation at my local hospital point to an NHS that is creaking at the seams&#151;in some places, but by no means all&#151;because so much change is happening all at the same time.

Either way, the consequences are appalling for staff and for people&#039;s confidence in our local NHS. I am afraid to say that the document issued to staff last Thursday was a disgrace both in content and tone, whatever apologists say about the legal requirement for statutory 90-day notice of redundancy.

However, we are talking about a hospital, not a business going bankrupt, and that is no way to secure the good will of staff, which is the basis on which much of the NHS operates. Staff representatives from Unison, the Royal College of Nursing and other trade unions are rightly up in arms because, in many respects, the hospital was allowed to drift in a relatively short period by its board, by the SHA, whose chief executive was replaced last autumn and, ultimately, by the NHS executive. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), I am certainly not a softy or an apologist for poor management by the hospital itself.

The NHS is not a business, but it needs to be run to the exacting standards demanded elsewhere, and I complained that that symptomatic drift would not be acceptable in other organisations. After 13&nbsp;months, in August last year, the hospital appointed only an acting chief executive, Peter Blythin, who was shifted in January, with the obligatory warm words, to another part of the NHS. In the meantime, the wake-up call came loud and clear last November, when the trust announced a doubling to &#163;18&nbsp;million of its predicted deficit for the current financial year. The bell tolled deafeningly with the resignation of the chairman and all the non-executive directors only three days before Christmas&#151;just the sort of festive present that people do not want.

<a name="stpa_329">The so-called NHS turnaround team consists of one man from Deloitte, who only got his feet under the table last Monday, so he has not had any input. When I asked what was the point of the turnaround man, the reply was, &quot;Good question.&quot; The purpose of my gnashing of teeth is to make the point that the process is hardly well stewarded. At times there is a vacuum of governance, accountability and control. I do not want to bog the House down with too much detail, but some is necessary to illustrate the impact on the deficits in my local area of different policies changing at the same time.

<a name="60320-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_330">On Friday I was finally provided with the first draft of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hospital&#039;s financial recovery plan, dated 18&nbsp;January&#151;two months out of date, but a first faltering step on the road to accountability. It is clear that for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some time the hospital was allowed to employ accounting staff who found it difficult to recognise basic accounting principles. For example, one does not make up for recurring overspends by using the budget for one-off items. It is clear, too, that there is a cosiness among NHS accountants locally. The hospital did not bill PCTs for extra work, as it did not want to embarrass them and force them into deficit, and it knew that they could not pay. Unfortunately, the numbers have to add up for big payments on private finance initiative projects such as our new hospital, so that eventually leads to a brick wall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_331">We need rigorous accounting, not because the NHS is a business, but because we need to know what everything costs so that the taxpayer can obtain value for money. In the hospital&#039;s predicted deficit, some items stand out like a sore thumb. For example, there are &#163;4.2&nbsp;million of unfunded costs for the new consultants&#039; contract, the working time directive and &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;. In addition, &#163;7.2&nbsp;million so far this year and &#163;4.2&nbsp;million next year have been earmarked for the new policy of payment by results. In many respects, those are unknown, unintended or poorly predicted consequences of policy change. The new chief executive has acknowledged that much of the recruitment that has been undertaken is in line with national targets, but we want to know exactly how much.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_332">Clearly, I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley and other hon. Members that we must know not just what we spend in the NHS, but how well we spend it and what everything costs. In North Staffordshire and elsewhere, the financial recovery plan does not seek to restore finances just to an even keel. The requirement is that in the following year, trusts must recover the underlying deficit, plus an element of the deficit carried forward from the previous

<br>&nbsp;<br>year. That is a painful incentive not to get into deficit in the first place and a powerful signal, but where recognisable failures have occurred in the NHS system at a time of great change, it is too brutal in its effects now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_333">In North Staffordshire, some of the vagaries of the modelling, particularly with payment by results, may yet lead us to predict another &#163;20&nbsp;million of deficit. Staff and patients in areas such as north Staffordshire, which are already underprivileged, should not bear the pain of that brutality. The response must be managed and planned; it should not cause chaos, run amok or be out of control.

 A lot of good points have been made today, particularly by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor). He and the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) made the same key point that a lot of trusts bill one another within the health economy, so there is a risk that deficits are concealed for some time. It is very difficult to pin down what the deficits are, and sometimes people do not find out until the end of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_334">A lot of the problems were predicted, which is backed up by the evidence. I shall quote from &quot;Early lessons from payment by results&quot;&#151;a report produced by the Audit Commission in October 2005&nbsp;that one would expect the Minister to have read. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;There are valid concerns that the level of risk inherent in the current policy design, particularly given the pace of implementation and the size of the change is too great.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_336">In the current financial year, about &#163;8&nbsp;billion is dealt with by what is called payment by results, but it is actually a transactional fee, not a market-based system. So Woolwich hospital&#039;s underlying costs are higher, because it cannot pay its tax bill and because its PFI costs are so high, but from the health service&#039;s point of view, the hospital cannot be shut down, because those costs must still be paid&#151;so chaos ensues. We have chaos at the centre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_337">We have had a triple whammy, whereby well-managed Peter is being robbed to pay badly managed Paul. Eastern Birmingham PCT, which covers my constituency, is very well managed&#151;it controls things very effectively&#151;but it has been hit by three things within six weeks of the start of the financial year. First, it has been hit by the phasing out of the purchaser protection adjustment, to which hon. Members alluded earlier. Secondly, it has been hit by top slicing. Although we do not know the final top-slicing figures, they vary nationally between 1.5&nbsp;per cent. and the 3&nbsp;per cent. figure that is often quoted. Some people argue that that at least gives them a bit of money to deal with the chaos created by Government policy. Thirdly, we do not know what the tariff will be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_338">There is an argument that, if anything should be top-sliced, it should be the tariff, because that is where the real danger lies. There is a good argument for a scheme 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 112</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>whereby people aim for a 3.2&nbsp;per cent increase for non-elective surgery, and if people go above that, transactionally, it is only 50&nbsp;per cent. of the cost and if they go below it, transactionally, it is only 50&nbsp;per cent. of the benefit. There is a substantially stronger argument that that figure should be reduced, because it is very clear that the current chaos&#151;as I say, it is not meltdown, but it is likely to turn into meltdown&#151;is caused by too rapid an implementation of the process. If the speed of implementation were reduced, we would have a chance of people managing. The hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) made the point that we want to plan expenditure. With payment by results&#151;or transactional payment&#151;people cannot plan such things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_339">Let us take the situation that we are in. We have deficits all over the place and we are not quite sure what they are. We will go further down a route that will create more and more deficits. Suddenly, we decide that we will take the money off the PCTs. We are top slicing some of their money. We are removing the purchaser protection adjustment from many of them. We are not telling them what they have to spend in the next financial year, which starts in a couple of weeks. They do not know the cost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_340">What do we do if we want to create total chaos? We sack all the senior managers and tell them that they must re-apply for their jobs. That is really clever. For proper financial accounting, the deficit at the end of the financial year must be predicted. If accounting staff are told that they will not have a job if they predict a figure that is in deficit, of course no deficit will be predicted. Suddenly we find that PCTs have been merged and there are massive deficits all over the place, beyond the amount top-sliced by the PCTs. What do we do?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_341">We encounter a further problem, which was raised by the Royal College of Nursing. If someone is made redundant, their redundancy pay must be included in the accounts for that year, which is why there is such a big rush to make people redundant. If cost savings have to be made all in one year, it is difficult to find savings, so more people are made redundant than need to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para19">
<a name="stpa_342">We are caught up in a horrible administrative mess. The Prime Minister said that every time he reformed something, he wished later that he had gone a bit further. When everything in the health service settles down, we will look back and think, &quot;No, we did that a little too fast.&quot; There is far too much change. The well organised managers who can add up are reeling with the pace of change, and we get more and more change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-33_para20">
<a name="stpa_343">We should look for a couple of things from the Government. First, they should stop reorganising the primary care trusts. They will never get anywhere if they tell all the people who are responsible for dealing with the tight management that they are to be sacked and will have to re-apply for their jobs. That will create chaos. Secondly, the Government should review the rise from &#163;8&nbsp;billion to &#163;22&nbsp;billion. I know that they are constrained to do it for the foundation trusts but it is clear that the Audit Commission views that as causing a massive problem. Thirdly, the Government should listen to the points made by the RCN, especially about timing. If everything is done in one year, the result is total misery. We must remember that our concern is with the patients&#151;the people who need that health care.

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="60320-34_spnew0"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York) (Lab):</b> 
 Selby and York faces the most severe primary care trust deficit in the north of England, and it is not a consequence of underfunding. This year the PCT will receive &#163;307&nbsp;million. Three years ago it received &#163;199&nbsp;million. That is an increase of &#163;108&nbsp;million a year, about &#163;2&nbsp;million a week, &#163;300,000&nbsp;a day extra for the NHS or about &#163;470&nbsp;a year extra for each person in the catchment area. The extra spending is being used to buy more treatment for more patients. It is saving lives and reducing waiting times for treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_344">The problem that the PCT faces is not underfunding, but poor management of the fastest growth in NHS spending in the history of the NHS. That view is shared by local clinicians&#151;GPs have made similar comments to me&#151;and by managers in the health service. Nationally, the deficit is projected at &#163;800&nbsp;million or roughly 1&nbsp;per cent. of NHS spending. That, perhaps, is not a huge problem when the NHS budget is due to increase by some 6&nbsp;per cent. above inflation this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_345">But 1&nbsp;per cent. is the average, and averages can be misleading. If my head is in the fire and my feet are in an ice bucket, my average temperature is probably fairly good, but that would not make me comfortable. In Selby and York we will be extremely uncomfortable because of the size of the deficit. The end of year deficit is about &#163;24&nbsp;million or about 8&nbsp;per cent. of expenditure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_346">Despite the growth in this year&#039;s allocation, the PCT will need to cut &#163;21.5&nbsp;million if it is to break even in the forthcoming year. That will be painful. Already the PCT has cut the hours of the NHS walk-in centre in York and reduced the night-time GP cover between the hours of midnight and 8&nbsp;am to just a single doctor for the 270,000&nbsp;in the area. I am afraid that worse is to follow: the hospital will need to cut excess bed days&#151;that is to say, to discharge patients earlier&#151;and it may end up ending or limiting treatment for some non-life-threatening conditions. It could well be forced, as in Staffordshire, to make staff redundant, and GPs will need to change their referral rates if the deficit is to be brought into balance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_347">The real problem that we face in Selby and York is that under the Government&#039;s financial rules, the PCT does not need only to reduce expenditure in the forthcoming year by &#163;21.5&nbsp;million to bring its budget into balance. It will be required to make savings of about &#163;45&nbsp;million, first to break even, and secondly, to repay last year&#039;s &#163;23.5&nbsp;million overspend. If a &#163;45&nbsp;million cut were actually required to be made in Selby and York, the results would be catastrophic, as it would mean a cut of some 15&nbsp;per cent. in expenditure. We could be left with little more than an emergency service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_348">I ask the Government to give Selby and York PCT some additional time to repay the accumulated deficit. I am not asking for a blank cheque. The Government need to know that the bad management that led to the overspend has ended. The Department of Health has put its turnaround manager into the PCT, and the PCT has already clawed back the deficit from a predicted end-

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 114</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of-year shortfall of &#163;32&nbsp;million to &#163;23&nbsp;million. My question to the Minister is: when the Department is satisfied that the PCT budget is back in balance, will it extend the time scale for clearing the accumulated deficit? If &#163;45&nbsp;million had to be saved in the forthcoming year, a postcode lottery would be created in our area compared to neighbouring areas. NHS treatments for patients in Selby and York would be based not on objective need, but on the PCT&#039;s ability to pay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_349">There is relatively little further time for this debate. I challenged the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) to set out ideas for how his party would increase productivity for the national health service. I am afraid to say that he flannelled, but I have some specific proposals to make. First, much of the additional money for the NHS has been spent on increased remuneration for doctors and other health service staff. Much of it has been earned and is deserved, but as other hon. Members have made clear, the increase in pay has not been matched by an increase in activity or the number of treatments for patients. I recommend that the Government publish data drawn from the hospital episode statistics on the activity rates&#151;the number of patients treated&#151;of each consultant. Those rates vary enormously from consultant to consultant. The Government should change the consultant merit award system so that additional awards are tied to improved productivity, ensuring that it is the doctors who treat greater numbers of patients successfully who get the awards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_350">Secondly, spending on drugs has spiralled. Hitherto, under the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, the Government have controlled pharmaceutical company profits, not prices. Given the very high price of some new drugs that are being introduced, however, I believe that the Government now need to control both. Herceptin, for instance, costs &#163;21,500&nbsp;per patient per year, and it is being provided on the NHS even though it is a drug that has not been licensed for general use among cancer patients. That will add &#163;0.5&nbsp;million to Selby and York PCT&#039;s costs in the forthcoming year&#151;&#163;0.5&nbsp;million less for it to spend on other treatments, such as hip replacement, which is a proven treatment. I ask the Government to look at the question of price regulation as well as profit regulation for the pharmaceutical industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_351">Thirdly, I believe that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence should be asked to evaluate existing health technologies and not just new technologies. When it publishes guidelines, those guidelines should be followed. For instance, on hip replacement, it has recommended the general use of the Charnley prosthesis, which would save money and produce better outcomes if it were to become standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_352">I agree with the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) about two matters. First, once PCTs and trusts that are in the same difficult position as Selby and York have stabilised the overspend, they need time to pay back the accumulated deficit. Secondly, he is right to raise the issue of rationing, without which there could be a feast in parts of the NHS and a famine in others. During the second world war, we introduced rationing to ensure that everybody had access to their necessary diet. We must engage with the rationing debate, as people are doing in other countries. If we do not do so,

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_353">Most hon. Members have to spend time considering these issues. That certainly applies to me because the acute trust that covers my constituents, who desperately need care, has the mother and father of a deficit. I have attempted to work with the acute trust for many years to try and ensure that it delivers a good service for my constituents. I understand that we should concentrate on the issue of deficits, but the matter is about getting the best care for our constituents, and I have no doubt that poor financial management often goes hand in hand with poor clinical outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_354">Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust is at the last chance saloon, and we must get things straight so that it delivers health care properly. The turnaround team has been called in, a public interest report has been produced and we are beginning to know exactly where all the money went. Some hon. Members have said that deficits are caused by one or two issues, but that is just not true. In my area, for example, we have examined the use of agency staff. It is difficult for a trust to recruit when it is unattractive to staff, and we need to assist such trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_355">I have noticed what has not been at the top of the agenda in this debate, although hon. Members have rightly raised examples of trusts that have maintained financial order and have delivered an excellent service. In my area, Crawley PCT has provided a fantastic service under budget for the fourth year, and it has picked up all the community services that were so poorly developed in 1997&#151;it has done an excellent job. The Sussex Partnership Trust looks after people with learning disabilities and mental health problems. I know that it is in a challenging financial position, but it is delivering a new hospital in my area. That is not top news in this debate, and all we have heard about are crises and disasters, but that is not the case, and I make that point as an MP who represents one of the areas with the greatest difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_356">My PCT wants to ensure that the acute trust delivers, because it understands that its patients and those of the acute trust are the same people and that it must work with the acute trust to make sure that that happens. Getting that trust into order is our first priority, and I desperately hope that the debate will be very different for me this time next year.

It comes at precisely the right moment. That was reflected not least in the contributions by Government Back Benchers, who displayed an attitude that was not present, by and large, in mid-November, when we initiated a debate in our own time on deficits. We said then that we believed that &#163;1&nbsp;billion of gross deficits and several hundred million pounds of net deficits were in prospect this year. The Secretary of State came to that debate and said, in effect, that recovery plans were in place and that it was going to better this year than last year.

<br>&nbsp;<br>subsequent forecasts by strategic health authorities add up to some &#163;755&nbsp;million.

He has not heard from me, and he will not hear from me, the idea that we should go back to the bad old days of everybody covering everything up. However, he should talk to his Front-Bench colleagues who, far from pursuing a direction of openness and reform, are, through the proposal that primary care trusts should top-slice allocations, moving in precisely the opposite direction. Contrary to shifting the balance of power, they are taking control of the budgets. The Government will renationalise much of the growth money, which will then be spread around the system to try to obscure the financial consequences of necessary reform.

It is necessary not to delay the structure of reform, but to complete it consistently. One of the central problems is not too many changes at once&#151;if they were all mutually reinforcing because a clear strategy existed, managers and others in the NHS would understand and accept them. However, they find constant, mutually inconsistent changes impossible to tackle. For example, how is it possible for the chief executive of the NHS to say one thing about the future structure of PCTs and their functions&#151;that they are commissioning, not provider bodies&#151;at the end of July, yet, two months later, they become provider bodies again? The same is happening to allocations. Contrary actions will not deliver successful reform.

<a name="stpa_362">I have every sympathy for the position of the hon. Member for City of York, which requires reform. I suspect that he believes in the structure of reform and that we need devolved decision making and the provider trusts to be held to account for their productivity. The consultants&#039; contract did not achieve that. Simon Stevens, who was special adviser at No. 10&nbsp;at the time, subsequently admitted that the contracts were negotiated without building in productivity. Provider trusts, like foundation hospitals, should have the freedom to manage their costs more effectively. The Government&#039;s imposing of costs lies at the heart of much of the problem.

<a name="stpa_363">There is a 7&nbsp;per cent. increase in costs on the tariff this year compared with last year. Is it any wonder that the hospitals that receive increases in cash resources find that most of it goes straight out of the door? The tariff takes no account of the impact of the working time directive. The 7&nbsp;per cent. includes nothing for the costs of implementing the NHS programme for IT, as if hospitals paid nothing for that. It also contains nothing directly for implementing waiting time targets.

I shall not comment on that except to say that a central question for the hon. Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) and for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) is how the University hospital of North Staffordshire can possibly afford rebuilding. That can happen through only two means. Either the tariff&#151;the payment by results&#151;adjusts in future to reflect the costs of building new hospitals and providing new services, or hospitals cut back their activities so dramatically that they are deemed affordable by the Government and Monitor. Clearly, the University hospital of North Staffordshire is moving in the latter direction. It must do that because the Government are telling us nothing about the former possibility.

That has not happened, just as we do not know what will happen to the tariff after the end of this year. We discussed the possibility of marginal pricing Upstairs in Committee. Time and again, I said that, if the NHS has capacity and primary care trusts have patients who need treating but constrained budgets, one might at least allow for the possibility that they could reach agreement between themselves about marginal pricing of additional capacity towards the end of the year for treating those patients.

Will she also be clear about how the SHAs can possibly move from their present position to system balance within the next year, in the light of the way in which resource accounting works? The present structure dictates that if an organisation consumes its resources in the first year of a three-year public expenditure round, it has consumed in advance the resources that would otherwise have been available to it for the following year. That is understandable in theory, but it is going to be disastrous in practice.

That is not going to happen this year; the contingent liabilities on that are going up.

This would require genuine freedoms. I suspect that, at the end of the year, we will find that&#151;contrary to the prediction of the Royal College of Nursing&#151;foundation trusts will deliver a far better outcome than other NHS trusts in terms of finances.

A year ago, the staff were the heroes&#151;the Government were cheering as they headed towards their waiting time targets, but now, in too many places, they are going to suffer the consequences of the Government saying, &quot;Balance your books, and don&#039;t worry about the waiting time targets.&quot;

Either that showed a lamentable failure to understand what was going on&#151;which has continued for months&#151;or he was simply focusing on the general election and the waiting time targets, and to hell with the financial consequences after the year end.

At the moment, the tariff for next year promises a 6.5&nbsp;per cent. increase in costs. Hospitals are being told that they will receive a 1.5&nbsp;per cent. increase in tariff.

It is important that the House does not lose sight of that. My hon.

It is true that we have thousands of extra clinicians throughout the country, old buildings are being replaced with new hospitals or surgeries, and new ambulance stations, ambulances and equipment are being provided.

 I believe that it is an appropriate way of proceeding with pay reform. We negotiated the arrangements on the clear understanding that the investment was in return for reform. The new contracts for NHS staff are designed to support service improvement, to deliver real benefits for patients and the service and to improve the working lives of NHS staff. The issue was raised by the hon. Members for Mid-Sussex, for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) and for Southend, West (Mr. Amess). I will look into the matters raised by the hon.

 If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I want to deal with the deficit. While it is small in relation to total expenditure, it is unacceptable and must be eliminated. The majority of the NHS is living within its means and delivering on target, but there is much more that some parts of it can do to eliminate inefficiencies and improve productivity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_386">Let us take the example of University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust. In 1997, the trust had just under 3,900&nbsp;staff. In September 2004, there were slightly more than 5,100. The number increased by 1,232, more than a third. I have observed statements from North Staffordshire with some concern, but let me tell my hon. Friends the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) and for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) what the trust is saying. It has benchmarked its work force costs against those of similar trusts and they were the highest for all staff groups except nursing staff, for whom they were the second highest. It will aim to reduce its work force costs towards the average for similar trusts.

Certainly that is the intention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_388">I am conscious of how quickly time passes. Our aim is to restore financial balance in the NHS by the end of 2006&#150;07, and we have introduced a series of measures to achieve that. Achieving financial balance is not a book-keeping exercise; it is essential to the delivery of sustainable improvement in the future. As well as providing additional investment, we have increased the transparency of financial reporting so that financial problems are exposed and we can deal with them. It is true that we have brought this about by shining a light on deficits. Let me be clear about why we have introduced payment by results. It is a fair and transparent system for paying hospitals for the work that they do. We are putting record funding into the NHS and we want to see results. The experience of other countries that operate systems such as payment by results is that they can help to increase activity.

<br>&nbsp;<br>enough. A lot of what he said I agree with and I welcome his comments; sight of the letter that he mentioned would be useful to us. We are keen to continue to learn lessons and to improve current systems. As they stand, the reference costs provide reasonable data for the purpose for which they were designed&#151;getting average costs&#151;but they are not sensitive enough to derive patient-level data and could be improved in that respect. That is why we have to make adjustments for specialist top-ups, for example.

We have now made the necessary corrections, which have been road-tested by the NHS and other stakeholders. The corrected tariff was published on Friday 17&nbsp;March and is now being used by NHS organisations to refine their plans for 2006&#150;07. A review of the tariff-setting process has been commissioned by Sir Ian Carruthers, so that we can learn lessons for the future. I regret the fact that mistakes were made, but we believe that this was an operational problem and that we have fixed it. The review will tell us more.

<p><a name="st_265"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Dhanda.]</i></p>








<a name="time_32">
<a name="60320-38_time2"><h5>10.4&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_266"><a name="60320-38_spnew2"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss health services in the west midlands and, not least, health services and the health crisis in Shropshire. As the House will know, the Shropshire health economy has been debated many times. Indeed, the Minister herself has replied to questions that have been put before the House on other occasions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_398">It is unfortunate that despite the fact that we have wonderful nurses, doctors and health workers throughout the whole of the Shropshire health economy, we now have a deficit of more than &#163;50&nbsp;million, which is made up of the deficits in Shropshire County primary care trust, Telford and Wrekin primary care trust and the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. The deficit will clearly have an impact on front-line patient care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_399">We were told in the previous debate that such deficits would not have an impact on patient care, but it is inevitable that they will. Indeed, that is not just my opinion but that of professionals. I meet nurses and doctors all the time. We recently had a successful march in Shropshire, which was called the march for life, and tried to draw attention to the funding crisis in Shropshire. Many nursing professionals and doctors on the march told me that it would be impossible to find the money through efficiency savings alone. The Minister is an honourable lady, and we get on extremely well together. I hope that she will go back to the Secretary of State after the debate and tell her that Shropshire faces a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_400">We heard in the previous debate on health that the situation is often the fault of chief executives. We have had our share of problems with chief executives and chairmen of the hospital trust. Ultimately, however, it is the Secretary of State for Health who approves and appoints the chief executives of trusts, and appoints and agrees to the chairmen of hospital trusts, so the buck must stop with the Secretary of State. That is an important point, because if we accept it the principle of not putting urgent cash injections into trusts can be overcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_401">People in Shropshire say to me, &quot;We&#039;ve paid the taxes, so we expect the health services.&quot; The Prime Minister stands at the Dispatch Box week after week and says, &quot;We&#039;ve put billions of pounds more into the health service,&quot; yet people in Shropshire are being asked to have less of a health service for more taxes. Clearly there is a moral point as well as a political one, because the situation is unfair and completely unjustified. An urgent cash injection for the Shropshire health economy is justified if the Secretary of State approved the senior managers whom she then blames for the funding deficit that we face. Additionally, the Government increased national insurance contributions by more than 12&nbsp;per cent. That has clearly had an impact on the payrolls of all the trusts that I have mentioned, which has had a knock-on effect on patient services, too.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Mar 2006 : Column 128</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_402">We heard today that the University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust is laying off 1,000&nbsp;people, many of whom will be nurses and doctors. That will also have an impact on the Shropshire health economy. Many of my constituents journey across the border for treatment. Those who require brain surgery are dealt with in Staffordshire, as are people who require thoracic surgery and complex spinal surgery that cannot be dealt with in Oswestry; there are fine people in that unit. The situation will thus have an impact on my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_403">It is of grave concern when the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) admits to a measure of concern about such issues. There is much concern about those issues and it is deeply concerning that everything I have heard from the Government side of the Chamber today&#151;apart from the speech by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), which was thoughtful and brave&#151;has been marked by denial and complacency. No Government, of whatever political persuasion, or however good they are at communication, public relations and marketing, can spin their way out of people&#039;s own personal experiences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_404">When people come to my surgery, they tell me of the experiences that they have had at the local hospital. Many of them join me in praising the professionalism of the staff, both on the front line and in the back office, the porters and those working on the switchboard. Nobody underestimates the professionalism and commitment of hospital staff, but people are concerned when they are turned away after they have gone in for surgery. We know that the Minister of State said earlier that nobody waits longer than six months for an operation, but the NHS website&#151;a Government website&#151;today states that the figure has doubled. So I am puzzled by her remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_405">It is not only acute services that will be affected. I am very concerned that the accident and emergency unit at the Princess Royal hospital in my constituency will be cut. It is no good just putting an accident and emergency sign over the door and saying that the hospital has an accident and emergency department. It needs to be fully functioning, and my constituents are concerned that we will lose the doctor-led unit and end up with a nurse-led unit. The nurses do a wonderful job, and paramedics are getting more and more training&#151;they too do a marvellous job&#151;but they cannot replace the expertise and experience of surgeons on site to deal with emergency admissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_406">I know that the Minister has visited Shropshire before, and she has kindly accepted a new invitation to come to the hospital in my constituency in the near future. Shropshire is one of the largest inland counties in England, so however quickly and ably ambulance drivers drive, time costs lives, whether from cardiac arrests, aneurysms or severe asthma attacks. I hope that the Minister will give me an assurance this evening that the accident and emergency department at the Princess Royal hospital will remain fully functioning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_407">The accident and emergency unit has important links to the paediatric services at the hospital. East Shropshire, including Telford and the Wrekin area, is the part of Shropshire with a younger population, so I hope that the Minister will give an undertaking that the children&#039;s services will not be affected.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_408">I wish to widen the debate to primary care services, because I am concerned about the knock-on effects on the provision of drugs, especially for the treatment of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. Many constituents tell me that they need my help to obtain Alzheimer&#039;s drugs for their grandparents or parents. It is a growing issue, and PCTs have reduced funding for it as they face other financial pressures. The same issue applies to anti-TNF drugs, and I hope that the Minister will give a commitment this evening to meet women representing Herceptin 4&nbsp;Shropshire Now. She will be aware of the group, which represents women who are desperate to receive the drug to prolong their lives and make them more comfortable as they face breast cancer.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_409">The other primary care issue that I wish to raise is that of mental health services. So often, people suffering from mental health problems are pushed to the back of the queue and the bottom of the pile. My concern is that the pressures on the local primary care trusts in Shropshire mean that many people facing mental health problems are not being treated, and I hope that the Minister will address that issue as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_410">I want to touch on neonatal services too. The Minister is aware that there is a fairly new maternity unit at the Princess Royal hospital&#151;nice clean beds, nice paint on the walls and so on&#151;but there is no expertise for dealing with mothers and babies who have complications. If a mother gives birth at the unit and there is a complication, she and her baby have to go at high speed, with blue lights flashing, to Shrewsbury to save her life or the baby&#039;s life. Given the demographics of Shropshire, unless that issue is addressed, inevitably&#151;but God forbid&#151;a mother and/or child will, unfortunately, lose their lives.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_411">I have raised serious issues, and we are in serious times, so I hope that as the Government appointed the previous chairman and a series of chief executives they will take responsibility, accept that the buck stops with them and reconsider funding in Shropshire. The problem is not just the financial mismanagement of the previous trust; it relates to historical per capita underfunding for Shropshire patients&#151;my constituents&#151;over many years, going back to 1997&#150;98. That is the key issue, and it should be addressed urgently.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) on securing the debate. As he said, it is one of a number of debates, in which he has taken part, reflecting the situation in his constituency. Obviously, I, too, have participated in those debates, answering for the Government. The

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon.&nbsp;Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright) have invited me to visit their area and I understand that arrangements are being made. I am looking forward to the visit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_412">The hon. Member for The Wrekin raised several concerns to which I shall respond, but it is important to remember some of the improvements that have been made to health services in his area. He referred to national insurance contributions, and I remind him that although the Conservatives voted against increased NICs, NICs have actually massively increased investment in the national health service: from &#163;33&nbsp;billion in 1997&nbsp;to about &#163;92&nbsp;billion by 2008. That investment has led to improvements in his area, which I hope that he will recognise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_413">In 1998, 91&nbsp;patients waited more than 12&nbsp;months for in-patient treatment, and 339&nbsp;patients waited between nine and 11&nbsp;months, at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital NHS Trust and the Princess Royal Hospital NHS Trust, which were merged in October 2003. Now, no English patients wait more than six months for treatment at English trusts in Shropshire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_414">Out-patient waiting times have been reduced. Nobody waits more than 13&nbsp;weeks for an out-patient appointment in Telford and Wrekin PCT. A total of 100&nbsp;per cent. of urgent referrals for suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks, and 100&nbsp;per cent. of patients who want to do so can see a general practitioner within two working days, or a primary care professional within one working day. Mortality rates for heart disease and cancer have been cut dramatically in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_415">Like the hon. Gentleman, I pay tribute to local staff for their extremely hard work and commitment in helping to make those improvements, but they would not have happened without the extra investment that has been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_416">That is not to say that there are no challenges in the area. I shall set out the background to the current position. In October 2003, two trusts merged to form the new Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. At that time, their combined deficit was approximately &#163;4&nbsp;million, but by the end of the financial year the deficit had increased to &#163;7&nbsp;million. In 2004&#150;05, Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority agreed to provide the trust with brokerage of &#163;2&nbsp;million, on the condition that the trust broke even in that year. Throughout the year, the trust sent returns to the SHA, which was closely examining how the deficit was being handled, but at the end of the year the trust changed its forecast to a &#163;3&nbsp;million deficit. Then, extremely unfortunately, as the hon. Gentleman said, the external auditors found that, in fact, the trust had run up a &#163;10&nbsp;million deficit, so at that time the trust had a total deficit of &#163;19&nbsp;million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60320-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_417">As the hon. Gentleman knows, there was an independent inquiry into the financial management and governance at the trust, which was extremely critical of the former chair, the chief executive and director of finance, all of whom had resigned in the meantime. A new management team is now in place, and I know that the hon. Gentleman thinks highly of them.

I believe that we are seeing the whole local health community come together to work out, in consultation with the local community&#151;which has an important part to play&#151;how to manage the situation for the best. Decisions have to be made and acted upon, and I believe that the process being undertaken now is leading in that direction.

<a name="stpa_419">The review now being conducted takes in the whole of Shropshire and is considering what can be done to achieve clinical improvements and financially sustainable health services throughout the area. The local NHS commissioned Finnamore Management Consultants to examine a range of options and in November and December last year, a pre-consultation was held involving key stakeholders. The hon. Gentleman pointed out the level of local awareness, which shows that there has been a considerable amount of consultation. What is being considered now is how to assemble a strategic service plan involving all four NHS organisations in the area, with the two PCTs taking the lead on consultation.

<a name="stpa_420">Turning to the future of the accident and emergency service at the Princess Royal hospital, it is difficult to comment on the proposals, because it may fall to the Secretary of State to make decisions on them at a future date. I can only repeat the answer that I have previously given to the hon. Gentleman&#151;the trust&#039;s new chief executive has made it clear that he would like accident and emergency departments to be provided at both hospitals. I can confirm that the &quot;hot and cold&quot; site option, in which one hospital would deal with emergencies and the other with routine scheduled operations, has been dropped following advice from the joint overview and scrutiny committee, and it will not be submitted for consultation.

 Can the Minister rule out the option that the accident and emergency ward at the Princess Royal hospital will change from a doctor-led unit to a nurse-led unit?

 It is not possible to rule in or rule out a proposal that may be made later. However, I can repeat the chief executive&#039;s view for the hon. Gentleman. The &quot;hot and cold&quot; site option was floated, but it has been dropped.

It would not be right to make a decision here and now, because it is for clinicians, managers and local people to look at the available options, but they should always remember that what is important is patient safety. The highest-quality services should be provided on the advice of clinicians and others.

<a name="stpa_422">Surveys show that only 11&nbsp;of a total of 84&nbsp;trusts have considered making small cuts in mental health services. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman&#039;s trust is one of those considering that option, and I am happy to write to him with further details. As I have said, the 11&nbsp;trusts were going to spend &#163;893&nbsp;million, of which &#163;16&nbsp;million has been earmarked for service reductions. It is, however, a small percentage of the overall amount spent on mental health.

<a name="stpa_423">We are still waiting for the strategic health authority to sign off the mental health plan for the whole of Shropshire, so I hope that she will encourage it to do so, as the plan is desperately needed by mental health patients in my constituency.

 We have made it clear that it is important for local trusts and local health economies to deal with the financial problems that have built up. Of course, it is regrettable when any redundancy has to occur, but it is important for staff that their local trusts get back on to a stable footing. What is worse for patients and staff is when deficits are allowed to continue without a proper grip being taken of them.

<a name="stpa_424">Any proposed significant change will be subject to 12&nbsp;weeks&#039; public consultation.

Those detailed plans will be produced shortly.
