Mrs. Marshal&#146;s investigations show that the amount paid in by dad is &#163;22,365.24, yet she has received only &#163;19,809.91, which means that the CSA is sitting on some of her money.

 My hon. Friend is right. The evidence is that for many lone parents, regular contact with the labour market through Jobcentre Plus or a private or voluntary sector provider, getting closer to the labour market and keeping close to it, and going into part-time work that must sometimes be flexible by its nature, are all involved in the journey back to work. The continued investment in getting people back into work to achieve that full employment is a price well worth paying.</p>

 Notwithstanding the figures that the Minister gave as regards the numbers of lone parents now in work, we still fall pitifully far down the league compared with the Scandinavian countries, for example. There are still 1,420 lone parents in the Rhondda who are not in work, and that is one of the major causes of child poverty. Will the Minister consider ways of ensuring that lone parents become part of the solution to this problem, for instance by gathering together lone parents so that they can provide flexible child care to other lone parents who want to get into work, thereby getting two parents into work rather than just one?</p>

 In a devolved sense, some of the detail of that is part of the approach of the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Executive.

My hon. Friend is right about our different profile compared with Scandinavia. Thereare two differences between our country and those countries.

 One of the things that the review needs to look at is whether legislation will be needed, as well as considering any technical, financial and legal issues. That is why we believe that the right way to proceed is to hold the review and to make recommendations in the light of its findings, rather than guaranteeing levels of payments that cannot be guaranteed. It is important that the financial services industry co-operate with the review; we will need its help and support. It is in the interest of everyone involved to come up with as good a settlement as we can, and I would urge my hon. Friend and other hon.

They will do nothing, however, for those at or near retirement who are on low wages, including shop floor workers and trade unionists. Such people are increasingly having to look to the Conservative party to defend their interests and fight their case, because the Labour Members who have taken up their case let them down last week.

The Minister should therefore be a bit careful before he rubbishes it. This is about people. Let me give him two examples: Peter Humphrey, a former Dexion worker, and John Brooks, a former Early&#146;s of Witney worker, are both now seriously ill. The Minister will know about their cases. They are receiving precisely nothing from the financial assistance scheme, and the announcement that he has made will deliver nothing extra to them. Is he not sending a message to them today that people will have to wait still longer, and that, in their cases, they might never receive the benefits for which they have been saving for many years?</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct that for many years the number of women who build up a full state pension has been significantly lower than the number of their male counterparts who do so, which is why in our reforms, including the reform of the second state pension, we seek to equalise the take-up of the basic state pension and the building-up of that entitlement. He is correct, too, that there are other issues to do with the advice given to women workers and whether or not they think it worth their while to join in a private pension scheme. That is something that the Department for Work and Pensions must look at, along with employers and with the sponsorship of other Government Departments, to make sure that the right information is given to women. For too long, women have been second-class citizens with regard to pensions, whether it is the payment of the small stamp or the fact that they have never been given the opportunity to build up an entitlement, and we seek to rectify that.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for those statistics. If he has looked at the general household survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics, he will know that since 1995 the number of men and women in full-time employment who have occupational or private pensions&#151;in the age bracket about which I asked&#151;has fallen. Many of my constituents in Putney see getting a pension as a luxury to come after having paid off student debt and perhaps having bought their own home. Given that we know from Barclays that the average starting salary fell last year to &#163;13,800, does the Minister agree that it was particularly unhelpful and counter-productive for the Chancellor to increase income tax on low earners when his Department seeks to introduce personal accounts in which those people are expected to save money?</p>

 Obviously, taxation policy is a matter for Treasury questions. I believe, however, that the hon. Lady shares in the consensus that personal accounts should be introduced. I have read with interest the helpful and serious report on that by the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, of which she is a member, and we shall examine that in detail. The right response to the issue of pension saving is automatic enrolment and a matching employer contribution&#151;both of which I think that she agrees with&#151;and the introduction of the national pensions saving scheme, which is the right model to deliver low charges and good returns for those saving in it.</p>

He complained to me that when he chided his daughters for not contributing to a pension scheme, they replied that he was a mug for having done so. Until Ministers are prepared to grasp the nettle,which our amendments last week offered them the opportunity to do, there is every likelihood that people who save for a pension will simply be told that it is a mug&#146;s game.</p>

We are not prepared to make empty promises, which have been described by the Association of British Insurers as, robbing Peter to pay Paul, or as yet another raid on pensions, which should not be done. We are saying that we shouldhave a proper review. I would say to his constituent&#146;s daughters that we now have the Pension Protection Fund, which does provide a safety net for people in the future.

 On tax, spending and borrowing, the balance that we strike is of crucial importance. Our commitment, with the golden rule, is to borrow only to invest over the course of the cycle, and the Budget reported an &#163;11 billion surplus on the golden rule over the current cycle. On borrowing, to keep net debt sustainable below 40 per cent. of gross domestic product and consistent with those rules, this Bill sets the right balance and underpins our commitment to maintaining the new stability in the economy that has been so invaluable over the past decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70423-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07042310000190">Crucially, the Bill also provides the resources to equip us to meet future challenges successfully, enabling the new investments for education and skills, science and the other key areas that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out in the Budget to be made. With total spending rising to &#163;674 billion in 2010, we are committed to continuing to invest. In a world economy in which competition is intensifying, technology is changing fast and almost every country faces challenges from global insecurity, investment is vital to enable us successfully to address the long-term challenges ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70423-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07042310000191">Let me turn to the details of the Bill. First, on business and productivity, our starting point is a very strong one indeed. In the past year, total investment is up by 61/2 per cent., business investment is up by 73/4 per cent and inward investment is up by 15 per cent. Business investment is forecast to rise again by more than 7 per cent. this year. Maintaining that success requires a modern, corporate tax system that reflects the intense worldwide competition in the globalised economy, and the Bill introduces the changes that we need. From 2008, there will be a cut in the main rate of corporation tax from 30 per cent. to 28 per cent.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the Chief Secretary&#146;s comments about corporation tax. Small companies in my constituency are concerned about the increase in the small companies rate.

 I shall come to the small companies corporation tax rate in a moment, but let me say a little more about how we are funding the welcome and significant reduction in the main rate. It is being funded by modernising and streamlining the capital allowances system, which has been largely unchanged for the past 20 years and which, in part, still reflects the needs of post-war redevelopment. This is the most extensive reform of investment allowances since the 1980s, better aligning allowances for buildings and plant with economic depreciation, removing tax-driven distortions in business decisions and giving incentives for long-term investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70423-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07042310000198">My right hon. Friend announced just two rates in future for capital allowances&#151;20 per cent. for short life assets and 10 per cent. for long life assets. Clause 35 paves the way for phasing out over four years industrial and agricultural buildings allowances, so removing a selective and outdated subsidy for some buildings, which is not available, for example, for commercial office space or for science parks. It is a strong package, pro-growth and pro-investment, which is expectedto add 0.2 percentage points per annum to investment above the trend rate, strengthening our global competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70423-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07042310000199">The Bill also sets the small companies rate of corporation tax at 20 per cent. for 2007. We have announced that we will raise it further to 22 per cent. from April 2009 as we remove incentives to incorporate solely for tax reasons. As the Red Book shows, setting out the figures for this year and the following two years, all the proceeds from that increase will be recycled to small businesses that invest, through a package that reduces the tax due from them and gives them incentives to invest, with current first year capital allowances for small firms maintained in the Bill at50 per cent. until April 2008, and the Finance Bill next year to introduce a 100 per cent. annual investment allowance of &#163;50,000 for all firms. That shifts the incentives in favour of investment, which will further strengthen small firms.</p>

Whether someone is a genuine freelancer is irrelevant to the operation of schedule 3. It looks as if more or less any involvement with a third-party organisation that provides regular services to contractors and assists them with the operation of their service companies could bring the freelancer and her company within the new managed service companies legislation and completely change her tax status.</p>

They will no longer be able to outsource day-to-day corporate administration to an adviser. On top of an increase in tax rates and an increase in tax complexity, freelancers will have the hassle and bureaucracy of registering and running their own company into the bargain.</p>

Is it better to be a freelance worker who sets up a company to manage the system or to have it managed by someone else? Should those people simply be self-employed? That is a legitimate argument, as is the question about the extent to which interventions or intrusions by the Revenue are proportionate.

They make a difference to people who employ freelance workers and to people involved in a small company but, generally, but there is consensus among those who take an interest in those subjects that they do not make a big difference to Britain in the globalised economy, because they do not relate to the major issue of the level of expenditure and revenue in the economy.

The Conservatives, however, have not conceded the point about Britain competing in the globalised economy, and I want to focus on that in my contribution. I am happy to look at other issues, but I am not prepared to concede that what we do on the tax regime for freelance workers will make a colossal difference to the state of the British economy and our ability to compete in a globalised world, which is the principal point made by the Conservative amendment.</p>

 I come back to the point that I raised with the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. I am not underplaying the importance of taxation regimes for the small business world, although they have to be fair. There must be equity between people who work for themselves and people who work for themselves with perhaps others in a company. That is an important principle of taxation. However, I do not believe that what we do in that regard ultimately affects our international competitiveness very much. What does affect our competitiveness is the ability of the economy to sustain a high level of aggregate demand, along with our ability to invest now to ensure that that continues in the future.</p>

other businesses compete in it, and what those businesses are doing. There is now a recognition inthe British economy, driven to some extent, but not entirely, by the Government, that we operate in a global world. It does not matter whether we are talking about BAE Systems, employing thousands of people, or a small contractor, perhaps a freelancer, doing some computer work for it. That recognition is a major achievement. It may not have been achieved only by the Labour Government, but it has been achieved while there has been a Labour Government. It means that we must have a more flexible economy than we have ever had before, in all sorts of different ways. A flexible economy does not mean throwing away workers&#146; rights, which should be secured, but the workers must be flexible in the way in which they do their jobs.</p>

Will the Government&#146;s policies generally, as reinforced by the Budget, and the specific policies in the Finance Bill help us to invest in a skills base in the future? The evidence suggests that it is possible. I am told that we expect to spend &#163;90 billion on education in 2010. We are now spending 5.6 per cent. of our gross domestic product on education, compared with 4.7 per cent.in 1997. Our expenditure levels have increased dramatically, and we all know what that has enabled us to do in our constituencies. There are new schools in Westerhope and Gosforth and new equipment in virtually all the schools in my constituency, and that is replicated in most constituencies in the country. There has also been more spending per pupil. Earlier Budget decisions gave head teachers more control over the way in which expenditure could be used, and those welcome decisions have been reinforced in this year&#146;s Budget.</p>

We all know that if a child attending a state school&#151;and sometimes even a child at a private school&#151;is suffering, a parent who has a couple of bob in their pocket can buy extra tuition. Many people have done that, but it has not been possible for those whose finances are tight&#151;and they are tight for far more than 50 per cent. of families.

There is a simple explanation for it: where companies have had a demand for labour, they have met that demand by bringing in people from somewhere else&#151;such as Australia or eastern Europe. They have frequently got good skilled labour, but as they have been able to do that, some employers have not worked as hard as they might have done in the past, when it was not possible to do that, to improve the skill levels of our indigenous people&#151;of those who have been in the country a lot longer.

 Of course I accept that there is a disproportionate impact on small businesses. That is bound to be the case as it is in the nature of small businesses. But my general point, which I am not moving from, is that that does not generally affect the prosperity of the small business which is, as I have already said two or three times, based on whether people have the money to buy their products&#151;</p>

 Yes. The service sector is crucially important, but we are now seeing changes in definition. When I used to work at Rolls-Royce, we did everything, but it is all subcontracted now. Some of the subcontractors are classified as service industries, such as the catering, management systems and accountancy, but previously they would have been involved in manufacturing. There are slight changes in definition, but I take the general point that services must be a major part of Britain&#146;s economy&#151;we have to up the value of service industries if we are to compete in the future.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentlemanfor giving way, because I am keen that he does not underestimate the importance of the contributionthat micro-businesses make to the economy. Micro-businesses are the largest employers in the county of Cornwall, which has one of the lowest GDPs in the country, so supporting the smallest enterprises in the small and medium-size range is critical to turning around the county&#146;s economy.</p>

 I understand the predicament in areas such as the one the hon. Lady represents. Helping small businesses is fine and throwing money at them may keep them going for a little while, but if they do not change and find products that people want to buy or if they do not operate in an economy where people have the money to buy their products or services, that help will not solve their problems. That is why the general state of the economy and our ability to compete on skills in the future is what really matters for small employers in her constituency.</p>

 I feel that I should apologise for repeating myself, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although I do not seem to be the only Member in the Chamber who is guilty of doing so. No small business wants regulation. Small businesses just want to get their products or services right, but regulation&#151;whether environmental, labour or tax&#151;is something they just have to put up with. In big companies, experts earning handsome salaries deal with all those things&#151;I have sometimes been a beneficiary of those services in the past. There is a completely different environment for such companies, and that fact will not change. That is not the political argument about whether the Finance Bill is appropriate, because small businesses will always feel the same about regulation. The test is whether the regulations that are being prepared&#151;for example, on freelance workers&#151;are fair. It is legitimate to argue about that, but whether or not such regulations are fair or appropriate will not make much difference to the viability of those workers. A subcontractor in the software industry may have an easy time under a particular regulatory regime, and if it changes they just have to adapt, but keeping their skills up to date will very much determine whether they have a job&#151;self-employed or working for an employer. That is the key issue for freelance workers, just as it is for small businesses.</p>

We need to re-think regional policy, to consider what we need to do to bring about greater opportunity for regions, including mine&#151;the north-east of England&#151;which have not been as successful in the past in purely economic terms. That is not to say that the way of life in those regions is not desirable, which is a separate issue&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>I see that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) is nodding; the situation is the same in parts of Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07042310000334">Regional policy used to be about persuading people with money to invest to go to Scotland, the north-east or Northern Ireland rather than locating in the over-heated areas of the south of England. Then regional policy was about encouraging external investors to invest in the regions rather than in an overcrowded area. Both those policies were right at the time, but that is not what regional policy is now about. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07042310000335">Regional policy is now about getting small companies&#151;on behalf of their industry, their skills and their regions&#151;to upgrade themselves so that they can compete globally. For example, it is important that the management consultancy companies based in the north-east of England upgrade themselves in a way that allows them to compete internationally. The same is true of the finance industry in Edinburgh. Upgrading design, creative and management sciences and engineering and back-up skills is as crucial in regional policy as all the other things, such as making the right infrastructure available. Such upgrading can generate huge incomes that can lift regional economies.</p>

 As my hon. Friend says, part of the answer is skills, but another part is cultural. For example, firms in the software industry locate in the Thames valley because other software firms are there. People in the software industry know each other, they probably play tennis together and their kids go to the same schools. They create a community, so it is difficult for a small business in the software industry to locate anywhere else if it wants to be part of that cluster. That is an important factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07042310000340">The key is to create clusters that are competitivein other parts of the country. Edinburgh is pretty competitive in the financial industry and there is a cluster there, although they all play golf and not tennis. There is a community of people who know each other and who can link up to help their firms to grow. In the north-east, there are cultural links between design companies in the engineering and oil industries. Companies that have been located in the area for many generations have upskilled themselves and exported their services around the world, and that is good forthe area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07042310000341">The trick in regional policy is to create more ofthose clusters.

Dundee is very strong on both of those, particularly the latter, because of private money from the Wellcome Trust and &#163;50 million from Wyeth. With reference to the Bill, does he agree that small companies in those sectors which are trying to grow will be affected by the new SME rules for research and development tax credits? He mentioned science education. Does he agree that the 0.9 per cent. of GDP which is to be maintained, and only maintained, for the next four or five years, and which is going into science education, is not good enough and that there mustbe a real-terms increase? In terms of the competitive advantage for the nations of the regions, why does he not consider full fiscal autonomy for Scotland and perhaps for Wales, so that we can lower corporation tax rates and really compete not just in the UK or in Europe, but in the world?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an awful lot of issues in that intervention. Scottish small companies are in the same position as small companies in other parts of the country. I come back to my point: if the economy is in a good state, they generally prosper. That is the case in Scotland as well. If, in this election period in Scotland, the hon. Gentleman proposes complete fiscal independence, he must accept the consequences of that for the revenue-raising powers and the revenues that would be available for Scottish public expenditure. If the Scottish people look at the figures, they will not be very keen on that. My constituents in Newcastle are not overwhelmed by the present division of the cake. The Scottish cake would be significantly smaller, were it not part of the United Kingdom.</p>

All the detail of the arguments about fiscal regimes for freelancers and for small companies can be explored further in Committee. I do not say that every dot and comma of the Bill should remain unchanged after it has completed its parliamentary stages, but I endorse the general thrust. By opposing the Bill, hon.

about regional policy, which I agree needs to be re-examined. I represent a constituency that belongs to a region extending from the Isles to Scilly to Bristol and Swindon. Clearly, we need to re-assess what the regions, as currently defined, have in common. Thereis a great difference between the local economies of Penzance and of Bristol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07042327000002">The hon. Gentleman also raised some interesting issues about the purpose of the Finance Bill. He posed the question whether it should focus on macro or micro-economic issues. Perhaps the process that we go through each year in dealing with the Bill should be reviewed to try to encourage it to be more strategic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07042327000003">The last few sentences of the Chancellor&#146;s Budget included some pretty explosive fireworks, so initially I expected some pretty explosive stuff in this year&#146;s Finance Bill. However, it turns out that it is a bit more of a damp squib. Much of the Chancellor&#146;s wider legacy will be left to his successor to sort out&#151;we have seen increases in unemployment recently, and we have rising interest rates, rising inflation and rising personal debt&#151;and the same is true of the Finance Bill. The most uncomfortable bits for the Chancellor to justify and explain will be left to someone else to deal with next year. I am sure that the Paymaster General hopes that, after 11 Budgets of leading the Committee on the Finance Bill, it is not going to be her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07042327000004">The clearest example is the changes that were announced to income tax in the Budget. The changes cut the basic rate by 2p and abolish the 10p starting rate, which for 2 million people will in effect mean that the rate of tax that they will pay will increase by 10 per cent. The Chancellor said those last few sentences just before he sat down and in the immediate aftermath the proposals were broadly welcomed, even on the Liberal Democrat Benches. They seemed to mirror proposals made by the Liberal Democrat party to try to make the tax system fairer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) said, initially it gave him a frisson of flattery, but, as ever the devil is in the detail. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70423-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07042327000005">The Chancellor did not make it explicit in his Budget speech that the tax cut that he was trumpeting was going to be funded by raising taxes for those on the lowest incomes&#151;mostly people who are lower paidand childless couples, who will pay more in tax. He is abolishing a rate of tax that he introduced. Perhaps that is why he is keen to leave the detailed debate to his successor. I would like the Minister to confirm that it would have been possible to include the income tax changes for next year in this year&#146;s Finance Bill, even though they may not take effect till next year. If it was decided not to do that, on what basis what that decision made? I hope to return to that when the Bill enters a Committee of the whole House.</p>

As we have already heard in some of the lengthy discussions about taxes on business,on the surface the changes look like simplification measures. They look like they should be welcomed, but once one looks in the Red Book and sees the way in which the revenue is changing, it is clear that there are complicating fingerprints from the Chancellor all over them. The changes were intended only to grab the headlines, not to make the system simpler or fairer.</p>

The increase for some of the most polluting cars in the higher band of VED for new cars that was introduced last year was equivalent to the cost of less than half a tank of petrol. This year, the difference between the bands has increased to about &#163;95. However, last year&#146;s Energy Saving Trust report indicated that the price differential required to have an impact on behaviour would need to be nearer &#163;2,000. If the Government are serious about using such measures to bring about real changes in behaviour, there is still a long way to go.</p>

 Is the hon. Lady saying that it is Liberal Democrat policy to put &#163;2,000 a year in extra tax on certain types of car? Also, is she saying that because she does not want the 10p band abolished, she would not cut income tax by 2p?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07042327000020">The point that I was about to make is that the changes are welcome, but the concern is that the price changes will not have any impact on the behaviour of some people living in rural areas, because there are no public transport alternatives for them. That holds true for the vehicle excise duty rises, as well as for increases in fuel duty. We made proposals last year to try to flag up that issue, and considered a discount for the first vehicle registered by a household in isolated rural areas. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to other options that the Treasury might consider that have been used in other areas where the issue has been recognised, and where people have sought to ameliorate it so that people for whom price will not make a difference do not suffer disproportionately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07042327000021">There is an EU derogation, which I understand is used in France, that assists isolated rural areas, and I understand that in Australia there are reliefs, as regards rural fuel stations, for drivers who are registered inan isolated rural area. That deals with the issue thatmy hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) raised last year; he said that in remote areas such as the highlands, fuel prices are much higher, just because of transport costs. There are alternatives elsewhere in the world that I hope the Minister will consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07042327000022">The environmental proposals in the Budget get one cheer, rather than three, not least because, to turn to the issue of stamp duty land tax for zero-carbon homes, which has already been raised, there are many other things that could be done to help to try to improve the efficiency of the many thousands of houses that will be built in forthcoming years. That issue was raised in debate on the Local Planning Authorities (Energy and Energy Efficiency) Bill, a private Member&#146;s Bill introduced by a Labour Back Bencher, the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton). The Bill sought to give more flexibility to local authorities to allow them to set higher environmental standards for new properties, but it was talked out by the Government, so there is an issue about the amount of cross-departmental co-operation that takes place to allow improvement to important environmental measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07042327000023">Obviously, one of the key environmental measuresin this year&#146;s Budget and this year&#146;s Finance Bill arethe changes to air passenger duty. The changes were introduced without the House having the opportunity to debate or vote on them. We should combine that with the fact that many thousands of passengers had bought their tickets before the changes were introduced on 1 February; there are a lot of disgruntled people out there who see that kind of tax change as a means of raising money. It has done nothing but make people more cynical about any other tax proposals that the Government make to reduce emissions.</p>

That is important, because we are talking about credibility, public confidence about whether such measures are being taken for the right reasons, and ensuring an opportunity for debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07042327000027">One of the other frustrations about the increases in air passenger duty is that they bear no relation to how busy the flight is, to the aeroplane&#146;s emissions or to its fuel-efficient. We must therefore question what impact they can have on changing behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07042327000028">As an alternative, the Conservatives have suggested giving everybody an allowance for one long-distance flight a year, and possibly a limited number of short-haul flights, but that would create another database of everyone&#146;s movements and be impossible to monitor. Nevertheless, there are alternatives that the Government could and should investigate. Although they can be set out in more detail in Committee, it would be interesting to know at this stage whetherthe Government have considered applying to aviation similar principles to those that apply to vehicle excise duty, taking account of different sizes of planes, their differing emissions and their destinations. Such an approach would be useful in preparing for permit trading for aviation emissions&#151;assuming that the Government are committed to that principle in the long term&#151;because it would have to relate to howfull flights are, the efficiency of aeroplanes, and the distances they are travelling.</p>

 The system that the hon. Lady proposes sounds awfully complicated. Referring to her earlier remarks, would she, in true Liberal Democrat style, further complicate it by having a lower aircraft movement excise duty for aeroplanes flying into rural areas such as Truro or the Outer Hebrides?</p>

<p><a name="st_o217"><a name="07042327000030"><a name="70423-0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="07042327000173"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 I was not going to raise that, but there is an issue about the accessibility of rural areas. Of course, there has to be that balance. Given that vehicle excise duty takes account of the emissions of different vehicles, why is it more complicated to extend that principle to aviation? That is a common-sense approach. If we are serious about tackling emissions in one of the areas where they are growing fastest, we must think about taking painful decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07042327000031">The general theme of this year&#146;s Finance Bill is that there is not much of a strategic approach. The primary motivation for the issues we have discussed so far has been to grab headlines, which leads to unintended consequences. There is more than meets the eye to the so-called simplification measures. Once again, we are seeing an incremental build-up on previous legislation, changing it slightly and then changing it slightly again, often with little consultation with industry&#151;or if there is consultation, actively ignoring the comments that come back from it. The Government can be seen to be building up trouble for themselves on a whole series of issues. Thankfully for my biceps, this year&#146;s Finance Bill is considerably shorter than last year&#146;s and I have  <br>

fewer volumes to try to carry around with me. Perhaps that is a recognition that last year&#146;s Bill went too far. However, there are still plenty of clauses that build on previous legislation&#151;although I accept that that may be necessary in some cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07042327000032">To echo the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North, what is the Finance Bill actually for? Should it deal with our tax and spending policy in strategically changing the balance of taxation, or is it an annual opportunity to include any tinkering by the Treasury and representations that might have been made to it? Unfortunately, it is sometimes the latter, and provisions are included whereby if the Treasury had taken a step or two back, and a more strategic approach, there would not be these endless changes. A classic example has been that of anti-avoidance legislation, which in this Bill comprises 10 clauses and four schedules.</p>

<p><a name="st_o218"><a name="07042327000033"><a name="70423-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="07042327000174"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 The hon. Lady gets my brass neck of the day award. Three minutes ago, she suggested avery complicated vehicle excise duty scheme with exemptions for registered users in rural areas. She moved on, barely pausing for breath, to suggest a very complicated parallel aircraft vehicle excise duty, but possibly with exceptions for rural flights to the Islesof Scilly and so on. Now she has moved on to claim that the Government are responsible for all kinds of complicated tax measures that she decries the complications thereof. I congratulate her.</p>

No sooner does one loophole close than another opens and the process starts again. It is endless. That adds weight to the argument that we should get rid of swathes of legislation and provide for a general anti-avoidance rule. Such a rule has already been successfully rolled out in Australia.</p>

I was interested in the reasons for their objection and I asked them to explain why they would be unhappy about such a rule. They said that they had no confidence that a general anti-avoidance rule would not be introduced on topof all the current anti-avoidance legislation. If the Government made a clear commitment to get rid of swathes of legislation and introduce a system that has been effective elsewhere, it would remove a few pages from &#147;Tolley&#146;s Tax Guide&#148; and help restore confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07042327000039">Clause 25, which deals with managed service companies, is a case in point. It attempts to deal with a genuine problem. The Government believe that many people avoid paying the right amount of income tax and national insurance by providing their services through a managed service company and being paid through dividends rather than a salary. As a result of the changes for which the Bill provides, managed service companies will, among other things, have to operate PAYE, deducting income tax and national insurance contributions on all payments, regardless of whether the individual receives a salary or dividend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07042327000040">We accept that abuse is occurring and needs to be tackled, but I should like to flag up some of the implications of clause 25. First, do the changes deal with the underlying problem of why people choose to operate through managed service companies? There is no balance between the taxation systems for the employed and the self-employed. Instead of directly dealing with that, the Government are basically saying that anyone who operates through a managed service company will continue to bear the risk of being self-employed but enjoy none of the benefits. That problem has not been resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07042327000041">The other problem is that even flagging up issues and stating an intention to legislate has again encouraged behavioural changes with which HMRC will struggle. In response to consultation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants said that it had seen correspondence from managed service companies to their customers that already offers an alternative service. It involves setting up each individual in a personal service company, of which the individual is the sole shareholder or director. Customers are then asked to self-certify whether they are within the rules of IR35. Many of those individuals cannot realistically know that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07042327000042">The Institute of Chartered Accountants continues:</p>
<a name="70423-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="07042327000161"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have had confirmation from Companies House that there were 56,218 new companies registered in February 2007, while a more usual monthly figure would be approximately 28,000.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07042327000043">The figure has therefore nearly doubled. The institute goes on:</p>
<a name="70423-0009.htm_brev3"><a name="07042327000162"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In one week alone, there were 20,000 new companies registered. Our initial conclusion is that the proposed new rules may not work and may cause more problems than they solve.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07042327000044">That will ultimately cause more problems for HMRC, which is cutting front-line staff at a point when there could be a massive explosion in the number of individuals who register themselves as personal service companies and therefore need closer attention from local HMRC officers. How will HMRC manage the additional burden of ensuring that all the PSCsare compliant? We are seeing more legislation with unintended consequences, which could ultimately occupy all HMRC resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07042327000045">Equally frustrating is the way in which the consultation was undertaken. In many cases, as confirmed by my experience of last year&#146;s Finance Bill, proposals are rushed through in order to fit in withthe annual Finance Bill timetable without due consideration being given to professional opinions and concerns. The classic example last year was the inheritance tax treatment of trusts, which was launched on an unsuspecting industry and public without any consultation and then went through several iterations in Committee with significant changes being made to  <br>

My point also applies to clauses intended to expand the powers of HMRC in clauses 81 to 86. Even though there was a consultation process in January, in which concerns were raised about taking on arrest powers, the Treasury response was to concede that there was a need for guidance, but to state:</p>

Will we see it before next week when these issues are debated on the Floor of the House? It would certainly help to inform our debate. If it is not going to be available, I find it very worrying. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that the guidance will be available before next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07042327000048">Concerns have also been raised about clarity and about how widely drafted the provisions are. Once again, the issue has been dismissed and we are told that the clarification will come through guidance. It is a cavalier approach. Ultimately, any legal action taken in future will be based on the law as it stands, not on the guidance, which can be subject to change without consultation or even without any reference to Parliament. Those concerns are depressingly familiar, as we have seen them in relation to previous Finance Bills. Key questions about process are raised. Surely the position could be improved by better pre-legislative consultation and scrutiny, so that we could have an open and public debate with professional bodies about the strategic approach of our tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07042327000049">It might also help if we had a full Finance Bill only once every two years, perhaps with a beefed-up Budget resolution in between.

included in an approach to legislation for whichthere is already a precedent. I sat on the Committee considering the Statistics and Registration Service Bill earlier this year. It was one of the first Bills in respect of which we had the option of taking evidence in public before the Committee stage. I understand that the enabling primary legislation specifically excluded the Finance Bill, but in my opinion the Finance Bill would be one of the best possible candidates for inclusion in the process. There are some very technical issues, but the experts dealing with them end up being mediated through hon. Members on both sides of the House. If we had the opportunity for proper pre-legislative scrutiny and for expert bodies to be able to provide evidence on the record, I believe that it would significantly facilitate the process.

In none of those areas do we sense an appetite for consistent strategic action through the Bill. On a superficial level, some things are simpler, in that the Bill removes income tax bands, aligns income tax with national insurance and cuts corporation tax, but there is also plenty of complication, despite opportunities for simplification such as those relating to the general anti-avoidance rule. Even when the Bill gains in simplicity, it loses out in fairness. Individuals on low earnings will now be hit with a tax increase, small businesses will feel the impact of some of the proposed changes, and nothing has been done to address the wealth inequalities that have grown under the Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70423-0009.htm_para25"><a name="07042327000057">In green terms, we have seen welcome but limited changes to vehicle excise duty, and arbitrary and very limited changes to air passenger duty. I suppose that the Bill is slightly green around the edges, but there is no clear indication that it will have a significant impact on behaviour, or that those revenues will be spent on cutting taxes elsewhere to make the system fairer. Again, that leaves the public feeling cynical. It is because the Bill is inadequate in all those important areas, and because of the technical concerns that we have raised earlier, that we are so desperately disappointed with this year&#146;s Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70423-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07042327000061">I congratulate the hon. Lady on extending her brass neck further by apparently making Liberal Democrat policy on the hoof, in proposing biennial Finance Bills. I have not heard a whiff of that before. It was clear, following some penetrating questions from my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, that that policy was being made on the hoof. The hon. Lady did not seem to understand the difference between a Finance Bill and Budget resolutions, and she really floundered when asked what she would do about the haemorrhage that might occur if an avoidance loophole were suddenly discovered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70423-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07042327000062">I have a further reason to question the hon. Lady&#146;s memory. I, too, was on the Public Bill Committee considering the Statistics and Registration Service Bill. She referred to pre-legislative scrutiny, but my recollection is that no outside body availed itself of the new opportunities under the procedure of this House to put forward evidence on that Bill. She was suggesting that such evidence might be taken on a Finance Bill. I understand her point of view, although I am not sure that I agree with it, but to pray in aid a Bill on which no outside body put forward evidence seems to provide rather weak support for her case.</p>

 I would be interested to hear from the Minister why the Finance Bill was specifically excluded from those provisions. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Statistics and Registration Service Bill was the first for which these scrutiny and evidence-taking sessions were available. As he proposed the introduction of a new vehicle excise duty band, I would also be interested to know why he feels that the system is so complicated that there could be no read-across to the aviation industry.</p>

<p><a name="st_o232"><a name="07042327000064"><a name="70423-0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="07042327000188"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 On the hon. Lady&#146;s first point, I cannot answer for the Minister. The Minister is answerable for the policy of the Government. On vehicle excise duty, the hon. Lady was not listening to me, as is sadly all too often the case. Perhaps it is my own fault for not being clear enough. I merely made some points and asked her a question in an intervention. In my opening remarks, I responded to the points that she had raised, as she would not let me intervene further on her. I have not decried complications in the Finance Bill, although she seems to assume that I have, and that there is therefore a contradiction in my position. Such a contradiction exists in her position, however, given that she decries complications and then suggests that we should introduce them. I entirely agree with her that it would involve complication to introduce a band of &#163;2,000 for the most polluting new vehicles&#151;I stress that it would apply only to new vehicles; there would be no retrospection&#151;nine out of 10 of which are not 4x4s, by the way. But, unlike the hon. Lady, I have not, sofar as I can recall, stood before the House, beforeany Finance Bill Committee or before any other body decrying complications in the Finance Bill. So although there is a contradiction in her position, I see no such contradiction in mine.</p>

I wish to address two aspects of the amendment; the first relates to the so-called pensions crisis, and the second to tackling climate change. On the first point, we need to put the situation in three contexts: the experience of current pensioners; the experience of prospective pensioners; and, given the recent history of this country, the experience of those two groups combined. That covers, for example, someone who was a prospective pensioner in 1997, has since reached retirement age and is now drawing their pension.

That is often overlooked by Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition, for understandable reasons, because they had a terrible record in that regard. In 1997, when the Government came to office, a single pensioner was expected by the state to live on &#163;69 a week. There has been some inflation in the intervening 10 years, but that figure is now roughly &#163;120 a week. To make the comparison clear to the House, a pensioner then could have received council tax and housing benefit on top of the &#163;69&#151;but that is also true for the sum of about &#163;120 a week.</p>

11 years of the Labour Government&#151;we know the figures for the coming year&#151;NHS spending has increased from about &#163;30 billion to &#163;90 billion a year.

I am not very good at doing mental arithmetic on statistics, but that comes to about &#163;3,500 per pensioner per year.

 Most pensioners do not think thata load more administrators and a very expensive computerisation programme represents an increasein their welfare. To return to the comparison, the Conservative Government did not expect pensioners to live on the sums to which the hon. Gentleman referred. We assumed that they would either have a good private pension top-up, because we did not tax it and wreck it, or that they would receive means-tested benefits, as is the case under this Government. The big change that we made was to link the standard pension to prices,not earnings, which obviously made an impact.

 I would not want the hon. Gentleman, or the House, to think that I am suggesting that everything is rosy for pensioners. I am trying to draw a contrast between the situation for pensioners today and that in 1997. Pensioner inflation has been higher, and one hopes that that will lessen markedly, with gas prices coming down by 16 per cent. Sadly, the energy companies are occasionally a little slow to feed those decreases through to domestic customers. I am not saying that all problems are solved for pensioners, or that pensioners are living in a land of milk and honey. Many pensioners in my constituency, however, have said to me that life now for pensioners is not nearly as bad, bleak and grim as it was when they had to sit at home in one room, in a woolly hat, with a one-bar half-kilowatt electric fire on for half the day. Far too many pensioners found themselves in that situation in 1997. The situation for pensioners has improved. In that context it is not right to talk about a pensions crisis&#151;and it is bit rich coming from the official Opposition.</p>

Some of them had been hiding the situation for years. It was like pyramid sales: they had been taking contribution holidays, building up deficits in the scheme and not telling anyone about them.

 As a non-practising solicitor, I can tell my hon. Friend that it does work with lawyers, because I get contacted by the Law Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07042327000106">Last Tuesday I again made the remarks, which I shall repeat, about my views about the responsibility ofthe actuarial profession&#151;not every actuary&#151;for the difficulties in which some private sector pension schemes have found themselves. I made those remarks on two occasions many months ago, and I have never been contacted by even one actuary suggesting that I was wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07042327000107">As many right hon. and hon. Members will know, I was on the panel of the Law Society of England and Wales as a personal injury specialist from its inception in, I think, 1991. That is roughly equivalent of beinga hospital consultant. It is a recognition of one&#146;s professional expertise in a particular area of legal endeavour and practice. As a personal injury lawyer, I would calculate lifetime losses. If someone has a fairly catastrophic injury and suffers a loss that will continue for the rest of their natural life, one cannot calculatein most cases&#151;although sadly, in some cases one can&#151;what their individual life expectancy will be. For the purposes of the calculation, one notes their age and gender and takes it from there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07042327000108">I used to get new life tables every year or two and would adjust my calculations. Rising life expectancy meant that in calculating a lifetime loss for any client, it would have been negligent of me, as a solicitor, notto take into account the fact that statistically, that individual was now expected to live longer than had been the statistical expectation perhaps two years previously for someone of the same gender and age. I would adjust the calculations that I would otherwise have made under old life tables and make them under the new life tables to reflect the longer life expectancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07042327000109">I was not the only solicitor doing that, I hasten to add. It was standard throughout the profession. We were taking into account rising life expectancies in our professional practice. It appears that far too many actuaries were ignoring rising life expectancy when doing their calculations and advising pension schemes on how much funding a scheme should have&#151;for example, how much the employer should contribute or whether that employer should continue their pension contribution holiday. Although that was not the only driver, it was one of the major drivers, and probably the biggest single driver, of the pensions difficulties that have been disclosed in the past 10 years. They have been disclosed because of FSR 17 and pension organisations having to come clean about how much, or how little, they have in the kitty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07042327000110">The reasoned amendment refers to a pensions crisis. There is a crisis for many people, and that is appalling, but another driver, which will feed through to those who have not yet started to receive their pension, is the change from final salary schemes to money purchase  <br>

schemes&#151;from what are sometimes called defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes. I am not a defender of final salary schemes in the private sector. They are a historic dead end. They cannotbe underwritten by, say, a trading company, becausewe all know that companies that trade, such asH. H. Robertson or Chart Heat Exchangers, go bust and cannot top up the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07042327000111">Our constituents are understandably saying, &#147;I&#146;m going to get a worse pension than I thought I would because the company&#146;s changed the scheme,&#148; and in almost every case of which I am aware&#151;I am aware of quite a lot, because I was on the Select Committee on Work and Pensions throughout the last Parliament&#151;employers who are changing from a final salaryscheme to a money purchase scheme are cutting their contributions as a percentage of payroll. It is not simply a technical move, with them deciding to restructure the scheme in a different way to give greater security&#151;although that is how they may try to sell the change to their employees. They are markedly cutting contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07042327000112">Quite a big private sector employer in my constituency commendably puts in to a final salary scheme that is now closed about 26 per cent. of payroll every year&#151;I think my figures are right; I am doing them from memory, but they are something of that order. The employee contributions are 7 or 8 per cent. for those who are in the scheme, which closed to new entrants about five years ago. Under the new scheme, the employer&#146;s contributions are markedly lower. I cannot remember them precisely, but I think that they are in the order of 7 or 8 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07042327000113">I understand why the company has made that change. It is trying to remain competitive with other companies, and some bright spark came up with that idea in some part of the country, and it snowballed from there. However, the demise of final salary schemes, which continue to exist in as much as they are not insolvent, has been driven not by changes made by the Government, but by employers trying to lowerthe pension contributions that they make on behalfof staff&#151;effectively, to cut their wage bills. Thereare many things for which one can try to blame a Government, but one cannot blame any Government, of whatever political party, for employers effectively cutting the wages of their employees. I do not think that they should do that, but that is what has been happening.</p>

I disagree. I have made it clear to the Government many times that they have a responsibility&#151;as did the previous Conservative Government&#151;for allowing misleading leaflets to be put out to prospective members of schemes and members of private company occupational pension schemes on how secure those might be.</p>

somewhat cavalier attitude across the board, with individuals who were involved in giving advice to employees not stopping and thinking enough about how secure&#151;or, as it sadly turns out in all too many cases&#151;insecure private occupational pension schemes were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07042327000116">The Government, reacting to pressure from Ministers as constituency MPs and Members on both sides of the House, have done a pretty good job with an 80 per cent. guarantee and a commitment last week from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to see whether that could be higher, although we do not have the costs of that. Through the budgetary mechanisms of the Treasury, the Government are putting forward &#163;8 billion in future value, not in net current value, for the financial assistance scheme. They are also acting to try to stop the shenanigans of companies playing fast and loose with their pension schemes. We all know that that was going on in the 1990s: we know that the amount of money in a pension scheme fund predicated whether there would be a takeover. The Pension Protection Fund, which I believe came into force in April 2005, was introduced by this Government to prevent a repetition of the scandalous behaviour that had been so devastating for pension scheme members.</p>

My hon. Friend referred to FRS 17, which opened a Pandora&#146;s box, but any Government must give advice on the basis that people will be honest and obey the law. Surely the system has collapsed not because of bad advice, but simply because some employers have been blatantly dishonest in the management of pension funds.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend and neighbour. To put it succinctly, there were some rip-off merchants around. This Government introduced schemes such as the financial assistance scheme to help those who suffered as a result of past rip-offs, the aim being to clamp down on past rip-offs and any prospective future rip-offs; and if any more rip-offs do occur, the Pension Protection Fund is there to prevent more people from suffering. There were bad people around, and, as my hon. Friend says, there is only so much that a Government can do to deal with that.

The Opposition may speak of a pensions crisis, but although there are problems with pensions and people&#146;s lives have been devastated&#151;I do not want my position to be misunderstood in that regard&#151;it does not strike me as very illuminating to use the term &#147;pensions  <br>

I repeat that I do not underestimate the devastation of people&#146;s lives, but I would not describe it as a general crisis, as the amendment seems to. Of course it is a crisis for some individuals&#151;about 125,000&#151;and it must be absolutely awful for them.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raised the question of pensions on the basis of the Conservatives&#146; amendment, which refers to a pensions crisis. He mentioned the FAS and the &#163;8 billion, which of course is welcome, but does he understand the frustration felt by people who, although their schemes are eligible, are still not receiving money because the full schemes have not been wound up? That may happen even in the case of even a small scheme if a single ex-member cannot be identified. Does he share our frustration? We may welcome the extra money for the FAS, but it is not yet quite delivering for all the people for whom it should be delivering.</p>

 I think that there is frustration throughout the House about the fact that, although the Government have committed a considerable amountto assist the 125,000 pensioners, only about 1,500have received any money. Surprise, surprise, some accountants who are acting as receivers for insolvent schemes appear not to have been exactly speedy in dealing with the paperwork to enable members of those schemes to obtain money from the FAS.

 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. The Bill is concerned with revenue-raising measures, and investment is one of the key ways of mitigating climate change. I note that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is cutting the flood defence budget by &#163;200 million. Will he ensure that there is cross-departmental co-operation to ensure that the critical issue he has raised is not ignored or understated?</p>

 I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point and will come on to how what I am talking about intersects with the Budget. I am mentioning it because it is raised in the amendment of the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). On flood defence budgets,the hon. Lady really must do her homework. The Government cut flood defences by about &#163;15 million in the last financial year, but they have increasedthat budget this year. The cut was not of a sum such as &#163;200 million; the hon. Lady has a rural constituency,so she ought to know that. In my constituency in Wolverhampton, flood defences are not a big issue. They are a big national issue, and I agree that they are important but, as the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) is aware as he knows the area well, flood defences are not a big issue there. The flooding of Smestow brook in my constituency is not a big deal. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne might know that Wolverhampton does not have any coastline, so there is no coastal defences issue. We are quite high up: about 120 m above sea level. It is said that our arch rivals at football, West Bromwich Albion, have the highest league football ground in England, which is about 135 m above sea level and we are about the same height above sea level.

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07042327000138">There should be tax reliefs for adaptation measures.I broadly agree with a point made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham, when he told me to look at what his Conservative Government did when they were faced with a campaign for lead-free air. A tax regime was introduced whereby there was a tax discount&#151;not a tax relief&#151;for unleaded petrol. When it was introduced, some people found that their car neededno adaptation whatsoever. I was putting in unleaded petrol before there was a tax break and, at one point in 1985, there were only two petrol stations in the entire city of Wolverhampton that offered unleaded petrol. I was driving a Volkswagen, which did not need any adaptation at all. However, other cars, on slightly different technology, needed adaptation, which at that time cost about &#163;30, if I remember correctly. A tax differential of lower excise duty for unleaded petrol than for leaded petrol massively boosted what had been a tiny market almost overnight. It happened very quickly&#151;within a year, I estimate. There was at that point no legislation banning leaded petrol; perhaps there should have been, but there was not. The shift was driven by the market, which was driven by fiscal changes. In the Finance Bill, there should have been more such general measures to do with adaptation for dealing with the effects of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07042327000139">I would like boosted research and development tax credits.

I understand that what I say on this is open to a charge of complexity, but we will need boosted R and D for endeavours such as research into the medicines that we will need to deal with the new diseases that we will get in this country, such as malaria. It will not just be cases of malaria in people who have been on holiday: we will also have malaria in southern England because of climate change as rising temperatures mean that malarial mosquitoes will come into our country. Research must be done on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70423-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07042327000140">We also need research on the kind of crops that we will be able to grow in this country. We will not simply be able to transplant a crop that has grown in amore southerly latitude, because the configuration of daylight hours is different the further north we go. In some places, there are longer summers and shorter winters, so we cannot always simply transplant a crop from Algeria or Malaga, for instance, up to Margate or Manchester to replace those that might no longer be viable because of shortages of water and higher temperatures. There must be a research and development push on that. Steps are being taken, but we need to encourage that further with fiscal measures that I would have liked to have been included in the Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07042327000144">There is a fiscal measure in the Finance Bill to do with tackling climate change, which the reasoned amendment decries the Government for not doing. It is a measure to make a market and drive a market. In and of itself, it will not make or drive a market, and it is not equivalent to the situation with regard to unleaded petrol, but it is similar: it is a fiscal measure to try to kick-start a market.</p>

 Under this part of the amendment, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the two most important steps that we must take to adapt&#151;I agree with him that that is what we must do&#151;are to collect more of the water that falls when it rains to use during the dry periods, and to have better coastal defences, especially to protect the 7 million people in the London area, because we are told that the Thames barrier will soon no longer be fit for purpose?</p>

 I entirely agree. The right hon. Gentleman foreshadows remarks that I was about to make on building adapted homes&#151;zero-carbon homes, for which there are fiscal incentives in the Finance Bill. However, I am not aware that there are any fiscal incentives&#151;in this Bill, or previously&#151;to deal with matters such as those that he refers to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07042327000147">The drainpipes on older homes will need to be changed. In many parts of the country, people will need bigger drainpipes because of the increased incidence of sudden deluges. All Members will remember what happened in Boscastle in 2004, when8 in of rain fell in a very short period. Lest any Member wishes to treat this matter with levity, let me say that I am not saying that bigger drainpipes would have prevented the disaster in Boscastle, but it is a graphic example of why we need adaptation to deal with heavy torrential downpours the like of which we have not hitherto experienced in the United Kingdom on a frequent basis. On present indications, they will become more frequent in winter. I am not aware of there being any fiscal incentives in this Finance Bill to address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07042327000148">I am not aware of any incentives for adapting the heating and ventilation of homes that already exist, in contradistinction to the low-carbon tax break for new homes. That is a health issue as well as a comfort issue, because a lot of people will die. It is estimated that 20,000 older people died across Europe in 2003, including in the United Kingdom but principally in France, as there was very hot weather in July and August. Homes will need to be adapted. There will need to be fiscal incentives, particularly through VAT&#151;by lowering the VAT rate and, perhaps, going to the European Commission and saying, &#147;All 27 countries face this, and we need to have powers to derogate in lowering the VAT rate for building adaptations to existing buildings.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07042327000149">Similar points apply to land drainage and other issues. We need tax breaks with very strict compliance mechanisms for the water companies to get them to  <br>

On all current projections, there will be an increase in drought in the UK, particularly in southern England but also in East Anglia, which most of us wouldnot consider part of southern England, and further north&#151;&#151;even, on current indications, in parts of lowland Scotland.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that weneed a fundamental review of our infrastructure in many areas? For example, a heavy downpour is lost immediately through the storm drains.</p>

 That is certainly the case. I heard a claim the other day&#151;I do not know whether it is true, but it is the typical sort of figure that one hears in the House&#151;that we have less rain per capita than Sudan. We do not have much rain in this country, especiallyin England and, in particular, in East Anglia. Geographers count large parts of East Anglia as a desert, in terms of annual rainfall. We have to use that rain carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07042327000152">We already do a good job in recycling water. People were shocked in Australia recently by a proposal to use grey water, but we found it extraordinary that that should be so new to them. To make the best use ofsuch approaches, we need not only the regulatory and planning regimes, but some fiscal incentives. The Government are actively pursuing a policy of adaptation to climate change, but they should do more, including fiscal incentives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07042327000153">If I may be allowed a personal advertisement, I proposed a private Member&#146;s Bill on climate change adaptation, which was the first climate changeBill in this Parliament. It would have required the Government to report annually to Parliament on what had been done to adapt for climate change. I am pleased to say that, broadly, that has been incorporated in clause 37 of the Climate Change (Effects) Bill. However, annual reporting of adaptation is not by itself enough. It is part of greater transparency, but we need to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07042327000154">Some great work is being done by the Oxford-based UK Climate Impacts Programme, which gets a paltry &#163;800,000 a year from the Government. I have visited the programme, been to its conference and talked to the staff, and it does great work, but we need to produce the big changes in behaviour and adaptation before it is too late. As the right hon. Member for Wokingham said, 7 million people will be at risk of flooding in London, although those who built the Thames barrier were far-sighted and it is being used much more frequently now. As I understand it, a new Thames barrier will be needed, although I am not an experton London and the south-east, because I am a west midlands MP. I pick up such information because it is the capital of our country and we cannot let it drown, even though&#151;or perhaps because&#151;that would make Birmingham the capital of England. Seriously speaking, we cannot let London drown, so we need to push forward adaptation measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07042327000155">As we saw with the change to unleaded petrol, measures in the Finance Bill have a big role to play in change. They could have a big role to play in emissions and their causes, and mention has been made of vehicle excise duty, although the Bill does not go far enough. Such measures as are included are very welcome, but we need more to encourage adaptation to climate  <br>

 It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), who made a wide-ranging contribution. I intend to confine my comments to a narrower issue: the treatment of small businesses and, in particular, the introduction of the provisions to increase the corporation taxation rates for small businesses to22 per cent. from 19 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07042334000002">We have heard much debate in the House, today and previously, about the fact that that increase in taxation on small businesses is intended to be neutral. The argument is made that the annual investment allowance of &#163;50,000, intended for businesses to invest to grow, will counteract the increase in the headline rate. That certainly has not been the impression gained by small businesses. The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said:</p>
<a name="70423-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="07042334000022"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is the Chancellor&#146;s eleventh Budget and this year&#146;s offering is no different to the others&#151;he gives with one hand and takes with the other. However, this year, after some welcome initiatives for our members he throws it all away with a tax hike aimed at small businesses. Corporation tax was cut for large firms but increased for smaller ones. Small businesses employ fifty eight per cent. of the private sector workforce&#151;over twelve million people&#151;and the increase in their tax rate fails to acknowledge their contribution.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07042334000003">That comment reveals the concerns felt by small businesses across the country about what the changes will mean. The British Chambers of Commerce has talked of</p>
<a name="70423-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="07042334000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the damaging increase in the Small Companies&#146; Rate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07042334000004">The head of taxation for the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants said:</p>
<a name="70423-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="07042334000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This decision flies in the face of the Chancellor&#146;s previous aim to encourage more businesses to incorporate and shows an irrational hostility to micro enterprises.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07042334000005">The CBI, which does not necessarily focus on smaller businesses, has suggested that the changes will lead to &#147;some significant losers&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07042334000006">The changes certainly give the impression thatrather than its being simplified for smaller businesses, the tax system is being made more complex. It also comes against a background of change in the way in which tax is levied on smaller businesses. In 1997,the Chancellor cut the rate of taxation for smaller businesses from 23 per cent. to 21 per cent. He cut itto 20 per cent. in 1998. In 1999, he introduced the new 10 per cent. rate and in 2002 he cut the 10 per cent. rate to zero and the small companies rate to 19 per cent.In 2004, he reversed the zero percentage rate on distributed profits and in 2005 he abolished the zero rate altogether. In this Bill, the tax rate has gone up again, this time to 22 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07042334000007">Such fluidity&#151;so much change in a comparatively short period&#151;makes it very difficult for small businesses to plan and work out a strategy. It is therefore interesting to consider the rationale advanced for the changes in the Bill. Paragraph 1.18 of the Red Book says that the change has been introduced</p>
<a name="70423-0012.htm_brev4"><a name="07042334000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to tackle individuals incorporating to minimise tax and national insurance liabilities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07042334000008">In other words, it is an anti-avoidance measure, although we have not had the precise rationale explained at any point. I hope that when the Minister winds up the debate we will get some clarity about why such a draconian measure was felt necessary to combat that pattern of behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07042334000009">The issue was recognised and debated when the zero rate band was introduced in the first place. Many businesses were actively encouraged to incorporateas a consequence of the prevailing tax regime. It is interesting to look back at the consideration of the Finance Bill in 2002, when that point was raised. It was argued that the zero rate would force companiesinto incorporation. The Paymaster General said in response:</p>
<a name="70423-0012.htm_brev5"><a name="07042334000026"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We seek to strike a balance as best we can in not driving businesses into a particular structure. The balance is not perfect. The decisions that businesses take, the access they have to different relief and their structure are very much choices for them.&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, </i><i> Standing </i><i> Committee</i><i>  F</i><i> , </i>16 May 2002; c. 104.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07042334000010">That may be true, but the Paymaster General seemed to recognise that the possibility of small businesses taking advantage of the incorporation measures had been actively considered. It was understood that the changes in the tax regime might have that implication. I hope that the Financial Secretary may be able to comment on what went wrong and whether it was contemplated that companies that incorporated as a result of those changes might be in an uncomfortable position if the measure were reversed. Companies incorporate for legitimate reasons. The action is not necessarily driven by taxation reasons, and that factor should be understood in the context of such a big change to tax rates for smaller businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07042334000011">My fear is that some small businesses that incorporated under the earlier regime&#151;in many ways, the Government encouraged them to do so&#151;willbe trapped now that the tax regime is changing completely, with the implication that tax rates will be higher. As a former corporate lawyer&#151;no longer practising&#151;I know that changing from incorporated to unincorporated status is not without cost. Lawyers and accountants are required so that the company can break out of the incorporated mechanism. Many small companies that have legitimately incorporated, for whatever reason, will be in the difficult situation of having to decide whether to accept higher taxes or higher professional costs to change from an incorporated to an unincorporated structure&#151;possibly their former status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07042334000012">Reference has already been made to small service companies. It will obviously be difficult for them to take advantage of the new tax breaks proposed by the Government as an offset mechanism. There is a strange irony in the fact that the Government are saying, &#147;We shall increase your tax but you can take it back from us&#148;. The proposals underline the complexity of the Government&#146;s mindset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07042334000013">We need to address the valid concerns about companies that may be in financial difficulty.

able to take advantage of the new mechanisms and benefits for companies that can invest. Evidently, they cannot invest because they are already in a difficult financial position. Given the problems that may arise, the neutrality of the measure is not as straightforward as has been suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07042334000014">The provisions on corporate taxation are complex&#151;like the Budget itself. I was struck by a comment made by Andrew Tenon, a tax director at Tenon advisers, in an edition of <i> Taxation</i>. He said:</p>
<a name="70423-0012.htm_brev6"><a name="07042334000027"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We spent several hours on Budget day running numbers through spreadsheets trying to make sense of the various hints that we could pick up in the small print about what precisely the figures would be. It is a sign of just how complex this all is that, between us, with at least 100 years of combined tax experience, we could not agree on what the impact of the changes will actually be.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07042334000015">If even learned tax advisers find it difficult to assess the effect on smaller companies of the changes in the Bill, it will be tricky, to say the least, for the companies themselves to work out what the impact will be and how to take advantage of the investment regime to ensure that the benefits are effectively applied. That comment and others clearly show the problems that arise from the complexity of the provisions and their application to small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70423-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07042334000016">There seems to have been a complete reversal of the Government&#146;s approach to the treatment of small businesses over the 10-year period. We have almost come full circle in the latest Finance Bill. There is real concern that the Government are turning their face against small businesses, notwithstanding the fact that 99 per cent. of all enterprises are small. A huge number of small companies contribute a large amount to our economy, ensuring that it is vibrant and strong and continues to employ people and generate wealth in this country.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point, but what does he think is in the best interests of small businesses? Is it the environment now or the environment when we had two major recessions, interest rates at 15 per cent., inflation in double figures and unemployment at 3 million? Perhaps he thinksthat unemployment at 3 million will be beneficial to small businesses. Was the environment better when his Administration were in control or is it better now?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is drawing false parallels&#151;perhaps understandably, to assert his case&#151;but I certainly do not understand his comment that I support high unemployment. Obviously we want to generate employment and get people into work. One of the problems at present is the structure of the system, which means that labour is immobile. Too many people are trapped by social immobility, without the skills or opportunity to realise their potential to change their lives and make the most of their assets.I am passionately against that and it is highly unfortunate in many ways that growth in our economy has had to be driven by the importation of labour and that people do not have the opportunity to obtain skills, as Lord Leitch found in his report. There is a structural problem in our economy and it is not inthe hon. Gentleman&#146;s interest to suggest otherwise. We need urgently to deal with those skills issues to ensure that people can realise their potential and get into the employment that is denied them at present.</p>

 Indeed, closed by the Tories. Those countries also had an impact on the Shelton Bar steelworks, which were just outside my constituency before they were closed under the previous Administration, and on the Michelin factory, which employs many thousands fewer workers than it did20 or so years ago and has changed the emphasis ofits work. However, it is still a very valued employer in the constituency. Furthermore, the pottery industry employs a fraction of the people it once did.

The US tax code is horrendously complicated. Indeed, one could almost say that ours is an open, brief and simple tax code by comparison. However, has the US suffered for years from a crippled economy that is unable to compete on a global stage? Are its businesses unable to do well? The facts on that speak for themselves.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that a table is produced by, I think, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development setting out the number of person hours or even days that an average business needs to expend to deal with the tax regime in a given set of countries? Some 190 countries are listed and the United Kingdom is very near the top of the list, the top being countries where people spend the least time dealing with such matters.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. The code and the tax legislation are there for a purpose.

We need to ensure that my constituents and those in the wider UK have the skills needed to ensure that a manufactured product or service can compete in the global market. Given our labour costs, it is impossible to compete on price with some of the growing economies and, indeed, some of the extremely well developed economies around the world. We need to compete on skills.</p>

If a country is able to do such work at a cheaper rate, the only way we can compete is to ensure that the level of knowledge in the UK is much greater. We need to make sure&#151;the Bill and previous Finance Acts have endeavoured to do this&#151;that young people and all workers across the UK are able to acquire the skills they need.</p>

Therefore, that has to be done by the state, and the state needs tax revenue to pay for it. That tax revenue has to come from somewhere, and one place from which it will come will be small businesses.</p>

 I am grateful once more for the wise words from my hon. Friend. In the extremely inspired piece of insightful thinking that produced the five tests, the Chancellor was absolutely right to make sure that we would consider such a move only if it were right and in the interests of Britain.

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention. In answer to his first question, I recommend to him the Library services across the corridor. On personal debt, the level is high in most of the advanced economies, like our own. However, I agree that there is cause for concern where people are taking on debt that they are unable to sustain. My views on that are on record.</p>

It does not make sense. As soon as one starts reality- checking, the wording falls away. I looked at the employment figures provided by the Library, which I again recommend to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). The reduction in the number of people unemployed in my constituency, Stoke-on-Trent, South, is approaching 20 per cent. There is a huge amount of work still to do because I do not want any of my constituents to be without work, but the improvement has been incredible. That was made possible by provisions such as those in the Bill.</p>

It is right and proper that Back Benchers of the governing party put pressure on Ministers whenever possible, and I take the opportunity to do so now. We need to ensure that every single one of the pensioners who were adversely affected gets whatever help we can give them. I shall not adopt the Opposition attitude and suggest that we can wave a magic wand and put everybody in the position that they wish they were in and that they were promised by the trustees of their schemes, but equally we are not seeking a proceeds of growth rule that would mean that the money was not available to back up the promises being made.</p>

Although the increase from &#163;2billion to &#163;8 billion projected costs, the 80 per cent. payout and the increase in the cap are all good moves, we should do what is morally right and push for as much help as possible to be given to those 125,000 people.</p>

On the main rates of tax for financial year 2008 and the changes to the small companies rate, on which several hon. Members have commented, yes, there are concerns. There are small businesses in my constituency that will understandably be worried about the impact of future changes to those rates. However, the fall in the basic rate of tax to 20 per cent. must be welcomed. A large number of my constituents who receive tax credits will welcome both the drop in the basic rate and the increase in tax credits.</p>

The point was made earlier that when there was a reduction in the rates of duty on unleaded petrol to persuade people to go down that route, we heard comments that only a handful of garages in particular areas sold unleaded petrol. But as a result of measures in the then Finance Bill, people were persuaded to change their habits. They moved to driving vehicles with unleaded fuel.

That was a terrible loss for an area such as Stoke-on-Trent, which has fantastic people who are able to learn specialist, complicated and creative skills. The lack of office space meant that we did not get those jobs. However, the regional development agency had been in place for some time and did not hesitate to ensure that distribution sheds were built. It pushed that aspect. It is just a pity that the opportunity was not taken some years back to make sure that some large office space was built quickly. I make a plea to the Minister to turn his eye in that direction.</p>

That is not only ancient history, it is agreed ground across the Floor of the House. It ill behoves those on the Liberal Democrat Benches to join in. They should understand that they strongly recommended that this country join the exchange rate mechanism and link its currency tothe Deutschmark. It is even worse for those on the Government Benches constantly to throw this back at us, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a keen advocate of linking our currency to the Deutschmark and has never yet apologised for the mistake that he made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70423-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07042335000043">Of course, it was the Conservatives who made the mistake in office. The Conservatives have long apologised for it, moved on and learned from the mistake. I hope that the Government have learned from the mistake as well. There are some indications that they might have learned from it, because at the moment they do not wish to take us into the euro currency. The ERM was a stepping stone towards the euro, and had we gone the full way we might have had boom and bust&#151;high interest rates and then low interest rates or inappropriate interest rates&#151;because we would have been committed to the euro.</p>

All three parties wanted it. Some of us disagreed. It failed. Now it must be no to the euro, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) quite rightly said.

Things could be done to make it easier for manufacturing businesses to survive and flourish in the United Kingdom and to make it less likely that those businesses would go bankrupt, have to sell up, or have to sell some of their prime assets or capital equipment to companies in China and Asia that would use that plant and equipment to compete againstus and undermine other countries in the United Kingdom.</p>

The great increase of the number of pages in Tolley&#146;s tax manual is one indication of how the complications have increased. However, while the clauses before us make up a Finance Bill that is relatively slender by the Government&#146;s standards, that is because in most areas the Bill just says that something will be done to a tax measure, and more of the detail is in the many pages of schedules. In due course, the Treasury will probably produce lots of secondary regulations that will have a direct bearing on business and lots of interpretative documents that tax lawyers, company directors and others will have to master to determine their legal due to the Government, and so that they can find out whether the regime is still sufficiently attractive to allow them to carry on their business here.</p>

Many businesses have become concerned in recent months because they feel that the reasonably fair-minded Revenue now goes on fishing expeditions and tries to reopen old years that the businesses thought had been honestly and honourably settled. There is a worry that too many people who have been successful and made money individually or through their companies are being challenged unreasonably.</p>

 On the contrary. Of course people have to pay the taxes that are due. However, wenow have the combination of thousands of pages of extremely complicated tax law and a fear that those who interpret the law&#151;the tax inspectors&#151;can change their minds. For example, a company could have honestly settled its tax affairs for a particular year with a tax interpretation that has been signed off by not only their tax advisers and accountants but by the Revenue&#151;and then the Revenue can come along and say, &#147;Actually, we&#146;ve changed our mind.

If the Revenue were to think that a company&#146;s original filing misunderstood the tax law, it would be its duty to say, &#147;We think you&#146;ve misunderstood this point.

After five years, if all went well, we could be spending more on public services than if we had not cut tax rates, because we would be generating more through the economy as a whole; that is the wonder of tax reduction.</p>

 If we had a faster growth rate, I would expect the amount spent on public services to go up faster than if we had a lower growth rate and operated under the Economic Secretary&#146;s kind of model, so public services would not be short-changed. But yes, of course the proportion spent on public services would fall; his arithmetic is clearly as good&#151;or as bad&#151;as mine. The proportion would fall, but that would be in the context of a rising total of public spending. Ironically, the faster the economy grows, the more quickly the proportion spent on the public sector falls, but the better the increases in public spending. That, to me, is success.</p>

If he had reinforced that with more competitive tax rates, we would now face a very different position. We would be able to afford the public spending level to which the Chancellor has moved, but it would be lower as a proportion, because the economy would be bigger.

We could have used that as a launch pad for faster growth. The second phase was a pity; he overdid public spending and did not get value for a lot of the extra money that he injected into public services. The third phase will be the least pleasant, because all sorts of clamps will have to be placed on public spending, including the control on nurses&#146; pay. Obviously, that is not popular with nurses, and it will cause tensions within the labour movement.</p>

with which I will leave him. I can tell him that I do not envisage a Conservative Government cutting the share of public spending in national income as quickly as the Chancellor did at the beginning of his period in office&#151;but who knows? If growth were really fast, it would be possible to do that safely, and to give people back some of the proceeds of that faster growth; that would reinforce the growth rate. However, as the Economic Secretary well knows, one can play all sorts of tricks with compound arithmetic and percentages. If he now rushes out a press release saying that I have signed up to massive cuts, it will be another typical piece of misinformation, and will bear no relation to what I have just said to the House.</p>

There are lots of other areas in which we will not need to spend so much. When we come into office, we will be able to cancel the identity card scheme and the wasteful centralised computer schemes, if they are still running. We will be able to get rid of a lot of regional government; I recommend that to the Economic Secretary as a good cut to make.</p>

 I do not remember ever being so incautious as to name a figure as a proportion of GDP. The amount of spending depends entirely on the state of the cycle, the growth rates, the public spending needs and so forth, and those judgments have to be made from year to year, much as the Government are trying to make them this year, for the economy in its current state of play. I have no idea what judgment it wouldbe appropriate to make for 2011, which may bethe first Budget year for an incoming Conservative Government. It would be wise for my right hon. and hon.

Our leading competitor nations are cutting tax rates to send exactly that kind of signal on incentives to enterprising companies and individuals.

 Perhaps I could help the right hon. Gentleman. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), the level of net debt when this Government came into office was 43.6 per cent. of GDP; last year, it was a little over37 per cent.</p>

 The Minister is wrong to provoke me on this issue, because, in citing those figures, he does not tell the House that this Government have been masters of off-balance-sheet financing. They have allowed the most colossal pension fund liabilities to build up and have not put them on to the Government balance sheet. The Government and their friends around the world have legislated to make every company put its pension deficit on to its balance sheet, on the ground that in due course that deficit will have to be paid for&#151;partly out of company contributions and partly, we hope, out of asset gains&#151;so it is necessary in order to understand the trading position of every company in the country. However, the Government do not do that for their own balance sheet. They produce a balance sheet with just the Government debt on it, very narrowly defined, and do what the Minister just did by saying, &#147;Aren&#146;t we wonderful? The debt burden seems to be quite low by international standards.&#148; However, the debt burden would be a minor part of the problem if they had to account in the same way as plcs. The Government would have to put &#163;700 billion on to the balance sheet for the accumulated pension deficit in the public sector.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman would agree that the way in which we treat public sector pensions in the national accounts is exactly the same as the position that the previous Government took in 1997 and fully in line with the European accounts standards of 1995. Does he think that the proportion of private finance initiative liabilities that are recorded on the Government balance sheet is higher or lower than the proportion of PFI liabilities recorded in 1997?</p>

 Again, the world has moved on. In 1997, companies did not have to put pension deficitson to their balance sheets, and neither did the Government, so there was symmetry. Now, companies have to put pension deficits on their balance sheets, whereas the Government do not. The other big difference is that, in 1997, most pension funds were in surplus, as there were not these huge liability problems; now, they are in massive deficit. I have been persuaded that it is right to recognise those deficits and to require that they are properly reported. The Government should have to produce an accurate and honest figure with their actuaries for the pension liability deficit in the public sector. Any sensible analyst would then add that to the borrowings through the gilt market that the Minister reported to the House.</p>

It is a question of the quality of the schemes and the likelihood of their going wrong, and the Government needing to spend a lot of money to reinstate the public services that were covered by them. There has been a massive build-up in PFI activity&#151;the Minister will be proud of that&#151;and it is now so important to the public accounts that it is misleading not to put on a much bigger figure for PFI liabilities on a contingent basis.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman knows that nowadays the majority of PFI liabilities are being recorded on the public balance sheet&#151;indeed, over time, they all will be&#151;whereas in 1997, a minority were recorded. His charge that it is this Government who have been concealing these things is not true. In the same way, if, in retrospect, public sector pensions should have been recorded on the public balance sheet in 1997, the position as regards national debt that we inherited in 1997 should have been much higher as a percentage of GDP than the 43.6 per cent. that my hon.

 Of course, if one changes the accounting rules and puts on extra deficits, the deficit will be bigger. In 1997, the Conservative deficit would have been a bit bigger than the one that the Minister quoted, but this Government&#146;s deficit would be massively bigger because, over the following 10 years, there has been a huge surge in pension and PFI liabilities. One reason why it now matters much more that PFI liabilities are not properly accounted for is that their quality has deteriorated. Under the Conservative Administration, when there were not many PFIs, there was a much greater attempt to ensure that there was a genuine transfer of risk to the private sector so that, if the scheme went wrong, the private sector, not the public sector, had to pick up the bill.I do not believe that that is true of the London underground public-private partnership, which constitutes a massively expensive and risky set of arrangements stretching over 30 years. I am not sure that the Government accounts reflect the full consequences of the cost of that scheme.</p>

 The fact that people make a profit out of something does not mean that they are not absorbing risk. It means that they have successfully managed it and moved it on. The point is whether, if something goes wrong, the risk resides with the public sector. In many PFIs in the health service and in education, the risk clearly rests with the public sector because it cannot turn around if the PFI goes wrong and say, &#147;That&#146;s all right, we&#146;ll just close the hospital&#148; or, &#147;We&#146;ll close the school.&#148; Those public facilities are important and would have to be kept going.

 Does the right hon.

 That is not a difficult question. Of course successful investment is welcome in an economy. Any measures that we can include in the Bill to raise the rate of successful investment are welcome. I am not sure that cutting the corporation tax rate and taking away many of the allowances is the way in which to achieve the goal, but I would rather do that than nothing because the headline rate has a psychological effect. It is the first thing that any company considers when deciding where to locate its investment. However, we need genuine tax cuts&#151;the Exchequer taking less money so that more money is left in company coffers to spend on investment.</p>

The first is the tax system, which we are discussing, and reducing the rate from 30 to 28 per cent. is only a small help when allowances are also being removed. The second is the need to invest far bigger contributions in pension funds because of the disastrous tumble into deficit, which we have examined at some length today and previously. If the Government could find a way to solve the pension problem and if they could get their corporation tax rate down a little more, there would be more free cash flow for British businesses to invest.</p>

However, people trying to run process industry in this country would say that it was not true for them and that the Budget does nothing to sort out their problems. A glass maker, a brick maker, a cement maker or a paper manufacturer has considerable problems, mainly from the gas price and energy prices but also from the regulatory backdrop. There is a dreadful exodus from this country of much process industry. The most visible example was the decision of British Steel&#151;&#151;then Corus, now Tata Steel&#151;&#151;to go to the Netherlands rather than Britain for its new big investment. It did not go to the Netherlands because labour is cheaper there&#151;it is not&#151;but because the Netherlands combines a better tax regime and a lower gas price. The Budget does not tackle that to try to claw back some territory so that we can reinforce those businesses that remain in Britain in process industries with big energy bills and encourage new investment and new companies to come here.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier his personal views on certain taxation measures such as capital gains tax. He openly and commendably said that he thought that the policy review paper for which he was responsible may not embrace that in the short term. In respect of the Finance Bill, does he personally agree with fiscal incentives for the building of new nuclear power stations in the UK?</p>

 No, I do not think that it could be done in this Bill because the homework on whether it would be wise and how much it would cost has not been done. The Government may need to organise a competition to find out what the effective subsidy is going to be. I am not persuaded that nuclear power can be done on an unsubsidised basis. The industry may tell me that it can be, but then state that the price of carbon needs to be reflected. I tend to look on that as a way of developing a so-called market-oriented subsidy. We need to tease out from the industry very quickly exactly how much it is talking about to establish whether it would be a good thing to spend that amount of money on this particular means of carbon saving or whether it is too expensive, so that the money could be better spent in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07042335000133">For the purposes of this debate, I am still an agnostic because I do not have all the information that I need. The Government have much better access to that kind of information, and they could trigger that information quickly if they were to license certain technologies as being acceptable from a safety and technical point of view, and if they would say that, in principle, they were prepared to give planning permission for the nuclear power stations. They could then ask the industry what it would need, and we could find out whether this was a wonderful deal that we should all accept or a lousy deal for the taxpayer that we would not want to accept. We could also tease out more information about the other risks that some of our constituents are worried about, such as how safe the technology is and how good the waste treatment systems now are. One cost that has to be wrapped up in the whole envelope is the long-term cost of closure and of handling the necessary waste. That could best be teased out by market competition, and I recommend that course of action to the Government to provide a basis of fact for determining these issues.</p>

I presume that it is being done because this is the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s testimonial Finance Bill, and because he wishes to tie the hands of his successor in a number of ways and not expose himself to flak in others. For example, we are invited to settle income tax rates only for 2007-08. We know that the Chancellor is a very fair-minded man who likes to work closely with his colleagues, and we have been told what he would like the rates to be in 2008-09. Should the new Chancellor decide that he did not like the rates recommended by the outgoing Chancellor, he would presumably be free to change them. I would be happy to give way to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury if he knows something different, but I assume that that is why we are not legislating for those further rates. There is a degree of doubt; the new Chancellor might take a different view and decide that such rates were inappropriate.</p>

We may legislate on small companies&#146; rates and fractions for 2007, but when it comes to inheritance tax, we can apparently legislate for the new Conservative Government, because we are invited to legislate for rates and rate bands for 2010-11. I do not know whether Ministers negotiated these proposals with my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, but perhaps they should have done so as a matter of courtesy, as it is quite a novelty to legislate so far ahead, long beyond the time when this Government could avoid a general election. While I am happy that we are being asked to legislate with a view to raising the threshold for inheritance tax, it would be more sensible to leave open until 2009-10 how high we should go. Perhaps &#163;350,000 will not be enough by then. Perhaps we shall be able to afford a little more. That amount would not buy a one-bedroom flat in the centre of London today.</p>

 It is quite possible that house prices will be higher in 2010 than they are today, but I would not call the present economic conditions a boom. That illustrates the fantasy world in which some Labour Members live. They really must accept that an inflation rate of 4.8 per cent. is a disgrace. It is far higher than that of all our leading competitor nations. We must compare ourselves with the world as it is, not with the world as it was 15 years ago when everyone was performing rather less well than they are today. That inflation rate is too high. Our interest rates have been consistently higher than those of Japan, the United States of America and euroland throughout this Chancellor&#146;s watch, and they are still at the high end worldwide. When companies think about where to borrow, Britain is not the best place to go, by quite a long way.</p>

 It is true that, at the beginning of the period when Japanese rates were zero, Japan had no growth and that, once or twice, it was even going backwards, but that is not true today. Japanese interest rates are still only a fraction above zero, yet Japan is growing quite quickly by the standards of the advanced countries. The hon. Gentleman should not be so complacent. We have heard much complacency from Labour Members in this debate. They have consistently made two claims. The first is that everything is now wonderful, thanks to this Government, yet they have refused to look how we are doing against the international background. The second is that the Conservatives are not allowed to say anything, because things went wrong in 1992. I have gone over that subject endlessly: yes, we know that, we have said sorry, and Labour Members should learn from those mistakes as well.

 That would be a very enticing prospect, but I do not think that it is about to happen any time soon under this Government. There is a serious problem for the incoming Chancellor of the Exchequer. If he or she meekly accepts everything that has been laid out for next year&#146;s Budget in this year&#146;s Budget, people will say that this man or woman is not a serious Chancellor of the Exchequer, that they have no independent judgment and that they are just a lackey of the Prime Minister. If, however, the new Chancellor were to go next door and say, &#147;I&#146;ve been thinking hard about this. Too many Labour Members don&#146;t want the 10p band abolished.

things.&#148; It is unusual in a system based on annual judgments about the state of the economy and taxation, to make judgments a year ahead&#151;or several years ahead, in the case of the judgment on inheritance tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07042335000148">I have been clear in saying that we need to set a course and stick to it without chopping and changing.

But I have also said that I do not want our Front Bench to set out detailed tax proposals for three or four years hence. That would be too difficult to gauge because the world is too uncertain. It is surprising that, in the case of at least one tax in this Budget, we are being asked to legislate for the next decade.

 It is a great pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who gave a splendid speech. He tried valiantly to remain in order and discuss the subject matter of the Finance Bill, despite frequent interventions tempting him in other directions. Indeed, it was a pity that his speech came to an end just when he was getting into his stride.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07042335000151">This has been a curious debate because, in my limited experience in the House, debates on Finance Bills are often closely related to the Budget debate. Finance Bills usually implement the key measures in the Budget but, on this occasion, that is not quite how it has worked, because many of the controversial headline measures in the Budget will be implemented not in this Finance Bill but in future ones. Although the Chancellor joked in his Budget statement that he did not have any intention of performing the roles of Chancellor and Prime Minister simultaneously as Mr. Gladstone did, it appears that to some extent he has done his successor&#146;s job in advance, as he has already written large chunks of the next two Finance Bills. It is clear&#151;and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham alluded to this point&#151;that he will take the role of First Lord of the Treasury extremely seriously. Indeed, I wonder whether the term, &#147;Chancellor of the Exchequer&#148;, will fall into disuse and, for the next two or three years, the occupant of No. 11 Downing street will be known as the &#147;Second Lord of the Treasury&#148;.</p>

the only member of the Treasury Committee to attend today&#146;s debate, I believe that it is worth drawingthe attention of the House to that report, as thehon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) did. There is one part of the report to which I should like to refer&#151;the Chief Secretary referred to it, as did the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;as it deals with the evidence that the changes announced in the Budget will result in 5.3 million households being worse off, principally because of what is often referred to as the abolition of the 10 per cent. band but which, perhaps, we should refer to as the doubling of that band to 20 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07042335000153">In evidence to the Committee on the Wednesday, the figure of 5.3 million was more or less confirmed by a Treasury official, who said that it was in the right region. I suspect that the Chancellor did not appreciate that answer a great deal, because the next day that official, Mr. Mark Neale, was due to join him in giving evidence to the Committee but, at very late notice, he was withdrawn. It would appear that that answer, along with one or two others which, at the time, the Committee thought were helpful, were rather too open and transparent. I hope that Mr. Neale is well and has not damaged his career prospects in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07042335000154">The Chancellor made two arguments against the5.3 million figure used by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the first of which concerned the impact of increases in the minimum wage. Having looked at the figures, I understand that the number of people earning the minimum wage who are likely to be losers under the Budget is, on the basis of a parliamentary answer that I received earlier this week, 171,000 at the absolute maximum. Clearly, that is not a substantial number, given that 5.3 million households will be worse off. The Chancellor&#146;s second argument was that there would be an increase in the take-up of working tax credit. No particular evidence was provided as to why that should be the case, and we will obviously watch that figure very closely to see whether there is evidence of increased take-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07042335000155">I want to concentrate on the issue at the heartof the Finance Bill: corporate taxation, which hasbeen touched on by right hon. and hon. Members. Government policy in that area is, to some degree, inconsistent and incoherent. First, there is inconsistency in the Government&#146;s approach between mainstream corporation tax and small business corporation tax. There will be a cut in the rate of mainstream corporation tax not this year, but next year, as well as the abolition of certain allowances. It would be churlish to be entirely critical of that, as there are arguments for doing so. Greater simplification is an important objective in our tax system, and I think that I have heard Government spokesmen say that they were doing so partly for simplification reasons. I donot know whether the Government consider that simplification is an important matter in taxation policy. If they do, they have not been successful in achieving it in the past 10 years. None the less, I welcome that change.</p>

Before turning to that in greater detail, and although, as I said, I welcome the proposal on mainstream companies in principle, I should like to ask the Financial Secretary a couple of probing questions. Some of the evidence that the Treasury Committee received suggested that some companies will clearly benefit&#151;services will generally benefit&#151;whereas other companies that rely on capital allowances willnot be favoured and will in fact suffer, including manufacturers, farmers to some extent and, as was particularly highlighted, property infrastructure providers, who will lose out. It is worth asking one or two questions in that context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07042335000157">First, if we are looking at major infrastructure projects, the Olympics immediately spring to mind. Will companies that have been contracted to develop infrastructure projects in the next few years for the 2012 Olympics lose out as a consequence of the changes to capital allowances? If so, is that something that they must bear or is it possible that contracts will be renegotiated? Indeed, could the financial stability of those companies be put at risk? Certainly, part of the evidence that the Select Committee received suggested that there was a potential problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07042335000158">Secondly, there are concerns about private finance initiative projects. Lawyers have put it to me that some of the contracts&#151;by no means all of them&#151;entered into for PFI projects contain terms whereby, if capital allowances are changed, the consequence would be borne not by the contractors but by the Government, which may have an impact on the public finances.</p>

 I shall turn to the position of small businesses in a moment, but my hon. Friend raises a legitimate concern: where allowances exist for 25 years or so, long-term decisions are made; any change causes a certain amount of disruption and uncertainty, and there will be losers who may not have anticipated such change. I was raising the issue of changes in allowances that may have been anticipated, which may impose an additional contractual obligation on the Government.

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70423-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07042335000168">The issue of small businesses is more controversial, and there is an incoherence in the Government&#146;s approach to distinguishing between incorporated and unincorporated businesses. Admittedly, the Government face a difficult problem: incorporated businesses can distribute profits either through dividends or salaries. If they do so through dividends, the taxation system for companies will apply; if they do so through salaries, income tax will apply. That issue has become more substantial and difficult for the Government in recent years, as corporate taxes have fallen relative to personal taxes. That is partly because of cuts in rates. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham said how the international climate has changed substantially for corporation tax rates. We have also seen increases in national insurance contributions. However, the differential between the two systems has increased substantially in recent years.</p>

There are various rates. The history of the zero percentage rate, an issue arsing from last year&#146;s Finance Bill, is instructive. The 10 per cent. band was introduced in 1999. By 2002, it had become a zero per cent. band, introduced for the purpose of encouraging growth and entrepreneurial spirit. Inevitably, as predicted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and  <br>

accepted by the Government, sole traders incorporated. It was an entirely rational thing for them to do. The consequence was that the Government perceived that they were losing too much revenue&#151;hence the introduction in 2004 of complex anti-avoidance measures and the abolition in 2006 of the zero per cent. band.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07042335000170">During the entire period, enormous time, effortand cost were incurred by various individuals incorporating. Indeed, the Government appeared to be encouraging them to do that and benefit from a lower tax regime. The consequence was that they were castigated and treated as tax avoiders. They were practically treated as cheats. That did nothing forthe relationship between small businesses and the Government, and it increased the difficulties of the two systems running in parallel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07042335000171">Even following the abolition of the zero per cent. band, it is still advantageous to be incorporated in most cases. In that context, the Government have changed the system once again by raising rates, as announced in the Budget, beginning with the increase from 19 to 20 per cent. in the Bill. I do not know whether the Government&#146;s intention ultimately is for the two systems to be tax neutral. We are some way from that. In most cases, it is still better to be incorporated because there is just corporation tax, whereas with employment there are income tax and national insurance contributions. However, if the intention is to be tax neutral, will the Government do anything to encourage those companies that have moved into the incorporated sector to move out again? If so, many small businesses will be concerned thata decision to disincorporate will be treated as adeemed transfer of goodwill, and they will want disincorporation relief to secure their financial position. Again, it is not entirely clear what the Government want to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07042335000172">I said that the approach is incoherent. In an attempt to solve the perceived problem with incorporation, the Government have increased the rate of corporation tax, but they have also raised the application of national insurance contributions, as announced in the Budget, while also increasing the threshold for higher rate income tax, which means that it would be possible to receive a higher amount of dividends without paying any tax. The two approaches do not entirely fit together. Again, it demonstrates an incoherence. On the one hand, one part of the Treasury is attempting to address the difference between the two structures, while on the other it is raising the higher rate threshold, which I support, and encouraging more sole traders to incorporate. The problem remains much the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07042335000173">I am also unclear on the Government&#146;s defence of the changes when they state that they are tax neutral. They say that the increase in rates will always be put into increased allowances for small businesses. Of course it will apply only to small businesses thatinvest, but that does not mean that it will target entrepreneurial companies with the potential for growth. A consultancy may well not be the type of business that can invest heavily, yet may be exactlythe sort of potentially high-growth entrepreneurial business that the Government should try to encourage, and profess to want to encourage.</p>

If that is the case, I can see where Ministers are coming from, but it still means &#163;1 billion of extra taxes that would not otherwise have been imposed on small businesses.</p>

One of the reasons why they have suffered in recent years is ever-increasing tax complexity. If we are to have a Budget and a Finance Bill for small businesses, we must tackle that complexity and reduce the compliance burden, whether in tax or elsewhere. That is how we can best preserve and nurture our small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07042335000176">If the Government are not prepared to reduce the tax burden on small businesses as a whole, which is what will happen if they do not address the issue of incorporation, a more fundamental and careful review of our taxation system will be necessary. In a piecemeal manner, by adjusting rates here or there, the Government are trying to address the conundrum of corporation tax. However, there may come a time when we shall need to examine the issue more fundamentally, and perhaps consider altering the schedular way in which tax is calculated so that distinctions between taxation of companies and taxation of individuals diminish. A competitive and friendly tax environment is vital for small businesses. The Budget and the Finance Bill have failed to provide that environment.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon.

I want to focus on specific measures that stem from a belief expressed earlier today in the Chief Secretary&#146;s remarkable claim that the Bill &#147;strengthens investment incentives for small companies&#148;. I think that that is what he said, but, as I shall explain, it is fundamentally not what the Bill achieves. It may be the intent, and the intent is very noble, but it will not be the outcome.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07042335000182">That is the fundamental problem. Three measures lie at the heart of the problem, and I shall focus on two. The first is the abolition of industrial buildings allowances and agricultural buildings allowances as the quid pro quo for the changes to the smaller companies&#146; corporation tax rate. What will be the consequenceof that? Those allowances respond to investment decisions for substantial capital spend that are not made overnight. It can take several years in some cases, and certainly many months, for a business to commit to a substantial investment of that kind, and to remove the allowances overnight without any interim arrangements is misguided and will introduce uncertainty into investment decision making. Business investment in this country will suffer, particularly in respect of small businesses.</p>

They have made a reasonable stab at supporting it, but judging by the number of VAT registrations they are not doing as well as they did when they inherited the economy that we left themin 1997. I will not make any further historical references&#151;other Members have done that&#151;but let me point out that there were some 15,000 fewer new VAT registrations in 2005, the most recent year for which figures are available, than there were in 1997, and that there are some 7,000 more deregistrations per year than there were in 1997. That suggests that entrepreneurial activity is in decline, rather than growing. However, I accept that not all VAT registrations are for business; they are for charities and other non-business purposes as well.</p>

According to Department of Trade and Industry statistics, some 12 per cent. of businesses are in the form of partnerships. Unincorporated businesses comprising more than one principal are partnerships, of which there are more than 500,000, and there were 515,000-plus in 2005, out of 4.3 million businesses in total. Therefore, there is a significant amount of such businesses, and they range in size.</p>

However, there are 13 per cent. fewer partnerships than there were in 1997. I suspect that, in part, that reflects the point of my hon.

It is curious that they are seeking to introduce rules that will drive legitimate business offshore. I am aware of examples of substantial investments by individuals that will now be taken offshore because they do not trust the tax regime enough to make the investments onshore, as they have done previously&#151;or these measures might stop them getting off the drawing board in the first place. My hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary cited one or two examples in her remarks, which illustrated that point. I fear&#151;it gives me no pleasure to say this&#151;that these Treasury Ministers have such little experience of the real world of business that they cannot rein back the zealots in HMRC from whom, I assume, these anti-avoidance measures originate. I do not imagine that Ministers think them all up themselves. The Revenue identifies an abuse and comes up with a solution, but there is a lack of practical business experience among the Front Bench team, who are not prepared to stand up to the Revenue and say that it is overstepping the mark and that its proposals will have unintended consequences. I do not believe that such thought processes go on, although I would be delighted to be corrected by the Paymaster General when she winds up.</p>

 From my own practical business experience, I know that the one thing that infuriates honest business people, such as me and&#151;I am sure&#151;other hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is right that it is appropriate to clamp down on specific schemes that are set up to avoid the rules. I have no argument with that, but it is not the point that I am trying to make. The point that I am seeking to demonstrate&#151;I shall give one or two examples&#151;is that many bona fide commercial activities between partners will be constrained and, frankly speaking, stopped by these measures. Those activities should not be stoppedand the solution should be to introduce alternative measures, such as perhaps a clearance or other mechanism, which may already exist in other areas of the tax code, to allow them to take place.</p>

Many farms are run as partnerships between members of the same family and the partnership structure is used to allow interests to change over time as the younger generations come in and the older generations retire. The interests of the partnership can be altered through the life of the partnership, andthat is an attractive way of managing affairs. New partnerships are often set up when a new member of the family begins to participate. Unfortunately, farming follows the biblical pattern&#151;I know that, as a farmer myself&#151;and some years one makes a loss. One can often have losses in the early years of a new  <br>

partnership. It would be wrong for such activity to be made non-deductible when one would have to pay tax if one were lucky enough to be making profits in the early years of a new farming partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07042335000191">Another example is the biotech industry, a high risk industry in which some individuals may be prepared to take significant risks with large amounts of money. That risk should be reflected and, if it goes wrong, individuals should have the chance to offset the losses on those substantial risks against their other income. Another example would be the hotel industry. When one sets up a new hotel, one generates losses in the early years while one builds up the room rate. I am aware of examples in which individuals have decided to go into business together as one of them alone cannot raise sufficient money to launch a hotel. People therefore group together in partnerships because it is a good structure.</p>

 Perhaps the hon.

 It is possible to have a test of why an individual is making an investment. If they are making the investment only because they have a loss they wish to offset, they would fail the test. That is what the legislation should be designed to correct, not to attack legitimate and genuine investment for bona fide commercial purposes. I very much hope that in Committee we shall be able to propose amendments that allow the Paymaster General to recognise that fact, as the Bill&#146;s existing measures will lead to the end of many bona fide commercial transactions.</p>

 The right hon. Lady shakes her head, but that is the case. Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton has indicated that about &#163;300 million of investment in carbon trading schemes and wind farms will be put at risk by the Chancellor&#146;s decision.

The first is the 10-hour limit for an active partner in an investment scheme&#151;10 hours&#146; work per week is required to demonstrate that a person is a bona fide investor. That limit will exclude inactive partners from investing in a business. Many entrepreneurial individuals, such as those featured in the television programme, &#147;Dragons&#146; Den&#148;, might invest in the form of a partnership structure and provide entrepreneurial flair and drive, as well as access to their time, but not 10 hours a week to oversee the business. I use that example because it will resonate around the House. A large number of business angels, operating in large and small groups, provide money and specialist advice to small businesses setting up on their own. Those individuals are increasingly tending to use the partnership structure, but they will be unable to do so in future because they will not be able to provide the 10 hours required to qualify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07042335000197">The second arbitrary aspect is the limit of &#163;25,000 for eligibility for relief, even though many projects involve individual investments of substantially more than &#163;25,000. I cannot imagine where that sum came from&#151;it seems to have been magicked from thin air&#151;but it will mean that such investments will be made only in tiny projects. The amount is unrealistic in terms of help for small businesses getting off the ground, and if the Government insist on retaining the regime the limit should be raised to a much more meaningful amount. I propose &#163;1 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07042335000198">Another aspect of the relief that will have a substantial impact on reducing business investment relates to the proposals for the venture capital trust industry. I understand from the Red Book that the provisions were imposed on the Government by the EU, but that it was done in a mealy-mouthed way. The Government have not stood up to the EU and have chosen to define the state aid rules inappropriately. There are 110 venture capital trusts in Britain. In 2005-06, they raised &#163;750 million; in 2006-07, the tax year that has just ended, they raised only &#163;110 million. The reason is that the measure was introduced in the last few weeks before the end of the tax year when most of the money comes in, so we can already see the impact of the proposal. Raising funds in that industry has ended because the amounts that can be invested in an individual company are too low. A substantial equity gap will be created between those who can invest &#163;25,000 under the sideways loss relief limit and up to &#163;2 million through a venture capital trust and the commercial, private equity development capital finance provided at the higher end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07042335000199">In conclusion, it is particularly damaging for venture capital trusts that the Government chose to interpret the EU state aid rules with a limit of 50 employees to define a small company, even though it was open to them to have chosen a limit of 250 employees as the medium company size. Why on earth did not they choose the larger number? It would have allowed far more companies to participate in venture capitaltrust investment in future and allowed the prospectof continuing a viable industry, which I fear the Government will shut down.</p>

Unfortunately, the following years will also see rather brutal changes to the general plant and machinery capital allowances, and those allowances must be taken alongside the welcome reduction of the 30 per cent. rate. Between 2008-09 and 2009-10, at &#163;3.76 billion, the changes to plant and machinery allowances alone will bring in more revenue than the &#163;3.6 billion in corporation tax reductions. Furthermore, the increase in clause 3 in the small companies rate to 22 per cent. will generate &#163;1.2 billion over the next three years. Therefore, this Bill, which paves the way for the entire Budget, will see a massive hike in business taxes.</p>

We have had a 25-year growth gap. Since 1980, growth in Scotland has been 1.8 per cent. on average as against 2.3 per cent. in the UK. Since Labour came to power, the situation has got worse with 2 per cent. average growth in Scotland compared with 2.8 per cent. for the UK as a whole. That means a 30 per cent. growth gap over time. The additional business tax burdens in the Budget and paved for by this Bill will simply make matters worse. Tellingly, the new annual investment allowance, the research and development tax credit increase and the small and medium-sized enterprise tax credit increase will not kick in until the following year. As ever, with this Government, it is jam tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07042335000204">Clause 49 on the definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise will allow only a few hundred companies in Scotland with between 250 and 500 employees to benefit. There are 265,000 businesses in Scotland, and the vast majority of them are very small, but they create 51 per cent. of all of the jobs and they generate 41 per cent. of all revenue in the country. However, 98 per cent. of those businesses have up to49 employees; 1.3 per cent. have between 50 and249 employees; and 0.85 per cent., which comes to about 2,000 businesses, have more than 250 employees. We know that 1,500-odd companies have more than 500 employers, so barely a few hundred of the 265,000 companies will benefit from the allowances announced with such a flourish in the Budget speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70423-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07042335000205">Clause 12 deals with the air passenger duty. It is expected to raise an extraordinary &#163;3.3 billion over the next three years yet it is likely to deliver little of the stated benefit of a significant reduction in airborne carbon emissions, not least because it applies only to flights originating and ending in the UK. Of course something must be done, but I am not sure that it is this. Moreover, the measure takes no account of the lifeline services to remote rural and in particular island communities, whose businesses are almost wholly dependent on vital lifeline air services.</p>

Included in this is an additional tax yield of &#163;350 million this year and almost &#163;1 billion over the next three years, and there is a very real suspicion that this is simply a tax raising measure, rather than an anti-avoidance measure.</p>

I have been proud of my Government&#146;s efforts in this area, and of the Chancellor&#146;s role in supporting and sharing the prosperity of this nation with those who too often have been left behind. When I meet people in my constituency&#151;a typical Welsh working-class community&#151;I often hear about how well they are doing.

Look at all the ways in which our lives are getting better. We&#146;re afraid that if we go back to what was there before, we&#146;ll suffer.&#148; I have often heard the simile that life is like trying to drive a car without a rear-view mirror&#151;one does not need a rear-view mirror, but it is very useful.

confident they are for the future. Yes, we have had teething problems and complaints, but every time when people think about being without those tax credits, they are afraid. In the past there were fears, doubts and worries about jobs, mortgages and savings. I do not see that any longer. I see confidence, hope and proposals for the future.</p>

They recognise that the Chancellor has invested in families and communities. Under the stewardship of the most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer this country has ever seen, they have seen those differences. The Finance Bill will play a key role in ensuring the continued prosperity of this country and will help even more working families and children to achieve the best standards of living possible.</p>

If somebody had told us 10 or 15 years ago that we would achieve those low levels, we would all have said, &#147;You&#146;re dreaming.&#148; But we are there, and we have achieved that dream. The employers in my community and my constituency are different employers. The workplaces are different. I visited Admiral insurance, which is a major employer in my constituency. It operates four of its services&#151;its various companies&#151;out of the SA1 development in my constituency. That is a prestigious development that has happened under this Government and with the foresight of the last Labour administration in Swansea. When I visited, I saw hope.

The child element of the tax credit, which will be increased by &#163;150, will help even more children. Already that has made a difference to more than 10,000 children in my constituency. There are challenges, but the benefits are visible to everyone.</p>

I will not pursue that further; I will leave him to discuss that with her outside the Chamber&#151;but she did appear to make up Liberal Democrat policy on the hoof when she said that the Liberal Democrats did not want a Finance Bill each year. I did not know that that was their policy, but we are now informed of it. She also described this year&#146;s Finance Bill as a bit of a damp squib.

He has become a stalwart of the Finance Bill process, so we look forward to seeing him upstairs in Committee with his well-thumbed copy of the explanatory notes, and we look forward to him joining in our debates as we go through the Bill clause by clause.</p>

To start with, the Bill does comparatively little to assist small businesses. Although the Chancellor has followed our suggestion of reducing the headline rate of corporation tax totry to maintain our international competitiveness, in contrast he has begun progressively to increase the small companies rate from 19 per cent. to 22 per cent., forcing entrepreneurs to pay more tax, not less, asthey attempt to grow their businesses for the future. Small businesses, which the Department of Trade and Industry defines as enterprises employing 50 peopleor fewer, are very much the motor of growth inour economy. According to the Federation of Small Businesses, they now employ more than 50 per cent. of the entire private sector work force, and it is apparent that these changes will hit them hard. In fact, as the Federation of Small Businesses said of the Budget in a press release entitled, &#147;Budget speech dismays small business&#148;, this is a</p>

which the powers, if the House grants them, operate in the real world, including their effect on the relationship between HMRC and the Serious Organised Crime Agency in combating organised fraud. We will shortly table amendments on the subject for consideration by the Committee of the whole House next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07042340000035">Like most of the Chancellor&#146;s finance measures, the Bill contains considerable anti-avoidance provisions, which are included in parts 3 and 5. It is part of a trend under the Chancellor to see a tax avoider around every corner and to devise an increasingly complex tax code to try to prevent that. &#147;Tolley&#146;s Tax Guide&#148;, which is often called the accountant&#146;s Bible, has expanded correspondingly to try to keep up with the raft of additional tax legislation. The Chancellor&#146;s inherent love of complexity means that it has doubled inlength since 1997 and now stretches to four rather than two volumes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07042340000036">I can confirm to the House that, under the present Chancellor, we have finally become a world beater: thanks to his love of complexity, we have thelongest national tax code in the world. In 1996, PricewaterhouseCoopers, in conjunction with the World Bank, published an analysis of national tax codes around the world. It showed that the UK&#146;s code stretched to 8,300 pages, surpassed only by India, with a notoriously complex tax code, at 9,000 pages. Japan was third with 7,200 pages, while Switzerland barely got on to the pitch with a mere 300 pages of code. <i> The Economist </i>highlighted all that when its 11 November 2006 edition pointed out:</p>
<a name="70423-0019.htm_brev5"><a name="07042340000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Of the world&#146;s 20 biggest economies, Britain is second only to India in the number of pages taken up by its primary legislation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07042340000037">Since then, the Indian Finance Act 2006 and the 2007 Finance Bill have added a little under 300 pagesto the Indian national tax code. However, back ingood old Blighty, the Chancellor&#146;s Finance Act 2006 contained 180 clauses and 26 schedules, which stretched to 517 pages. The tax law rewrite project prepared the Income Tax Act 2007, which helped to clarify some of the Chancellor&#146;s complex tax law in simple English and even repealed some 250 pages of it. However, to do that it added a further 1,100 pages of clauses, schedules and tables to the tax code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07042340000038">The Bill piles on another 113 clauses and 27 schedules, which represent another 305 pages. In comparison with India&#146;s nearly 9,300 pages of national tax code, the United Kingdom&#146;s stands just short of 10,000 pages. The Chancellor, who always says that he wants to reduce red tape, has burdened the British people with the longest national tax code in the world. When the Financial Secretary responds to the debate, perhaps he will confirm that under his boss we have become a world leader&#151;but as champions of complexity rather than clarity.</p>

The Chancellor rushed it through on Budget day in the hope that no one could follow him while he did it. How many of those Labour Members who cheered so loudly on Budget day and waved their Order Papers so enthusiastically realised that they were supportinga tax increase for those on low incomes? How many had worked out what the Institute for Fiscal Studies subsequently told us: that more than 5 million households&#151;predominantly those on lower incomes&#151;  <br>

would be worse off as a result of the Chancellor&#146;s Budget and the Bill? How many are happy to go back to their constituency Labour party executives and champion that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07042341000012">The net effect of those measures is actually to increase taxation on lower-paid families and that must drive ever more of them into the Chancellor&#146;s highly complicated tax credit system, in which we now know that more than half of all the payments are wrong. More than 333,000 people appealed last year against the attempted recovery of an over-payment and fewer than one in 20 are likely, on the latest figures, to succeed. The tax credit system devised by the Chancellor is crying out for reform&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The Economic Secretary shouts out &#147;abolition&#148; from a sedentary position. No, it needs to be reformed, and90 Labour Back Benchers signed early-day motion 545, calling for reform of the tax credit system, particularly for the reform of the handling of overpayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07042341000013">One of the signatories of that early-day motion is the right hon. Member for Birkenhead. In an article entitled, &#147;I won&#146;t make life easy for Gordon by defecting&#148;, in <i> The Spectator </i>of 24 February, he said:</p>
<a name="70423-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="07042341000573"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Gordon has been wrong on Pensions, we&#146;ve run our course on Tax Credits, there&#146;s no more money and we&#146;ve enveloped huge sections of the population in means tested benefits; there ain&#146;t any future in this. There is a need for a mega rethink, and there is a need for a leadership contest.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07042341000014">Indeed. In the same article, when the right hon. Gentleman was asked whether he had considered defecting, he replied:</p>
<a name="70423-0019.htm_brev7"><a name="07042341000574"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am not moving. That is not to say that I am happy in the Labour Party. Who is?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07042341000015">In fairness, he then flatly rejected the idea of leaving Labour entirely, but mainly on the ground that he did not want to give the Chancellor the pleasure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07042341000016">We then come to the vexed topic of pensions. The Finance Bill contains some measures that relate to pensions&#151;for instance, three clauses in part 4, including those relating to changes in alternatively secured pensions or ASPs, as they are generally known. However, the Bill does little or nothing to address the massive damage done to the UK&#146;s pension system by the Chancellor&#146;s &#163;5 billion a year smash and grab raid on our country&#146;s pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07042341000019">When we debated the topic last week, the extraordinary thing about the Chancellor&#146;s performance was his absolute and total refusal to say sorry. Despite the misery thathe has caused pensioners up and down this country, there was not a hint of contrition or regret. If he is confident about what he has done on pensions, why has he had to spend two years and a considerable amount of taxpayers&#146; money fighting the release of papers under freedom of information legislation? When challenged and put on the spot, all the Chancellor could manage was to blurt out that Labour had introduced the Freedom of Information Act in the first place.</p>

been done at the behest of the CBI. Subsequently, that was flatly denied by the CBI&#146;s then director general, Adair Turner, who, on &#147;The World at One&#148; on 2 April said:</p>
<a name="70423-0019.htm_brev9"><a name="07042341000576"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Let&#146;s be absolutely clear, the CBI never lobbied for an end to tax relief at any time whatsoever in 1996 or 1997&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07042341000022">I remind the House that, whenever we debate pension changes in the Finance Bill or elsewhere, we have to be conscious that the general public are well aware that, as Members of Parliament, we have relatively generous pension arrangements of our own. For instance, as the Economic Secretary will know well, the hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen)&#151;or the future Lord Challen of Normanton, as we must probably learn to call him, can now look forward to a comfortable retirement, but what about the millions of pensioners who cannot? It is no wonder that the Prime Minister&#146;s previous pensions adviser, Ros Altmann, said tellingly:</p>

It comes from a man who flatly refuses to apologise for any of this, because he seems to think that humility is a human weakness and not actually a strength. That kind of thinking has led to a poor Finance Bill that does little for pensioners against a background of rising inflation, which has helped to give us the longest tax code in the world but done little for small businesses, and which gives HMRC powers that need to be reined in. In short, it is a Finance Bill from a tired Chancellor, not afuture Prime Minister. In view of the Bill&#146;s inherent weaknesses, I urge the House to vote for our reasoned amendment tonight.</p>

Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) professed to be concerned about what she described as the erosion of competitiveness in the UK over the past 10 years. We are unique in all the major economies in avoiding a downturn in the past 10 years. We grew faster last year than all the other major economies. We have taken the national income per head up from seventh to second place in the G7 economies over the past 10 years, and the World Bank now rates our economy sixth in the world for ease of doing business. Those factors are hardly a basis for the concern that she professes to have about a loss of competitiveness over the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07042341000031">The hon. Lady went on to make three points. The first was on zero-carbon homes and was echoed by the hon.

Her third point related to concerns about the provisions on managed service companies and it was echoed by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). I shall try to deal with each of those points in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para28"><a name="07042341000032">On incentives for zero-carbon homes, the hon. Lady&#146;s criticism that the provision is flawed because there is not a large number of such homes is evidently a flawed argument. We would not want to use public taxpayers&#146; money to incentivise things that are already being done. The new provision is designed precisely to change behaviour and to encourage the widespread building of zero-carbon homes, which is not happening at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70423-0019.htm_para31"><a name="07042341000041">The hon. Lady was particularly concerned about freelancers. It is only freelancers operating through MSCs who are affected by the changes. Freelancers who are engaged directly by an agency, who are in business on their own account and run their own personal service company, or who are in other business structures such as umbrella companies, are not affected. That is because, in the vast majority of cases, MSCs are used to disguise employment, and the existing rules that ensure employed levels of tax and national insurance contributions are not applied. The measure in the Bill therefore ensures that workers in MSCs pay the same tax and national insurance as other employees, thus providing a more level playing field for businesses and workers who comply with the rules. Freelance workers can still work flexibly. In fact, many employment agencies and their representative body&#151;the Recruitment and Employment Confederation &#151;support the measures in the Bill.</p>

Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North treated the House to an insight into his experiences as a trade union negotiator and cited some of the deals that he used to negotiate, including 27 per cent. wage increases. All I can say is that I am glad that he is a Member of Parliament, rather than operating in the workplace, otherwise I suspect that he would come to the attention of the Governor of the Bank of England. The conclusion that he drew from his experience, both before and since coming to the House was very important: overriding everything else, there is significant value in stability, which the monetary and fiscal framework introduced since 1997 has helped to bring to the UK, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development described as &#147;a paragon of stability&#148;. He was right that the major result that matters to most people and certainly to Government Members is jobs, and there are 2.6 million more jobs in the British economy than there were10 years ago. He is right that the challenge for the next decade lies in increasing skills and learning throughout the system to allow those in work to continue in work and those not yet in work and seeking work to gain opportunities for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70423-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07042341000049">It is true that the annual investment allowancemakes tax simpler for small businesses. Clearly, it is a simplification, effectively giving small businesses, incorporated and unincorporated, a cash flow tax, which has been welcomed by many, including the Federation of Small Businesses, the chairman of whose tax committee said:</p>

He was particularly concerned about the Olympics and the impact of capital allowances. We do not expect the reforms to business tax to have the negative impact that he and some other members of the Committee might fear. As he will be aware, the changes to capital allowances have a largely temporary timing effect. Those will be more than outweighed by the dominant effect of the cut in the main rate that the Bill and Budget introduce. Overall, we expect the Budget changes to have a positive impact on investment levels, including in relation to the Olympics.</p>

She was so clear and so right when she argued that tax credits are an important part of many families&#146; monthly income. Take-up is now 90 per cent. for those on incomes lower than &#163;10,000. More than6 million families and 10 million children are benefiting. She said that they are afraid of having to do without their tax credits. Those fears would certainly be realised if the Opposition ever got their way.</p>

It will be paid by every firm in the country.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, </i>28 March 2007; Vol. 458, c. 1492.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70423-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07042341000058">Somebody needs to tell the Leader of the Opposition that the UK has 4.3 million small businesses. Of those, more than three quarters are self-employed. They do not pay corporation tax and are not affected by the changes in the Budget. Of those that remain, around a quarter do not pay any corporation tax because they do not declare profits. Of those that remain, we estimate that the majority have incorporated with the purpose of reducing their tax and national insurance liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70423-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07042341000059">In all the changes that we have made to small business tax rates and policy, we have done so with a view to having a tax system that ensures that we get greater levels of investment and innovation and a fairness in the system. That was the purpose also of our consultation in 2004. However, the lower rates of tax have resulted in a significant number of people incorporating to take advantage of them, not to invest in business, but simply to extract the company profits in a way that reduces their personal tax and national insurance liabilities. They are doing that while still carrying out the same economic activity that they carried out before they incorporated. The tax break is clearly being subsidised by those companies that are following the rules and by ordinary taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70423-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07042341000060">We are therefore refocusing the provision of investment incentives on small businesses. The increase in the small companies rate will reduce the differential in tax paid between the incorporated and the self-employed. The annual investment allowance will target assistance directly on those firms, incorporated and unincorporated, that invested their profits. The Budget is good for business, with the lowest corporation tax rate in the major economies, a small companies rate that will still be lower than the rate when we came to office in 1997, tax incentives focused on businesses that invest and innovate, and a fair deal for the self-employed.</p>

In the last 10 years, we have seen the United Kingdom lead on international arguments and action to tackle climate change.

 I am delighted to have the opportunity of raising the subject of balanced and sustainable communities on the day on which we celebrate our patron saint, St. George. For so long, Ireland, Scotland and Wales have celebrated their national day. I am delighted that the House of Commons is leading the way in celebrating St. George. I am particularly delighted that this debate coincides with the celebration of our national day, because I represent a constituency that is very patriotic and is celebrating St. George&#146;s day. During my brief speech, I want to talk about Southend in particular with regard to a balanced and sustainable community. If the Minister does not have the time to respond to all the points that I intend to raise, I am sure that he will write to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07042341000535">I started preparing for this debate by finding a definition of a sustainable community. I found eight key characteristics. It should be active, inclusive and safe; well run; environmentally sensitive; well designed and well built; well connected; thriving; well served; and fair for everyone. That sounds a pretty good range of things for a balanced community to have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07042341000536">A sustainable community is really the antithesis of ghost-town Britain, which has seen the decline of community. That has been well documented of late. It has been highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) in his Sustainable Communities Bill and also by the Communities and Local Government Select Committee in its report on coastal towns. Ten years of top-down centralisation from Labour have frankly added to the cycle of decline in local communities. If people were able to restore their feeling of pride in, and responsibility for, the individual communities in which they live, the quality of those environments and the quality of life of their inhabitants would improve. There can be no better way to build sustainable communities than to involve the people who live in them, so I call on the Government to give a much higher priority to the promotion of sustainable communities than they appear to give at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07042341000537">I find Labour&#146;s approach to the Sustainable Communities Bill somewhat puzzling. It reminds me of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill, which became an Act of Parliament and which I was privileged to pilot through the House in 2000. There are a number of programmes that touch on the notion of sustainable communities, but there is no focused strategy to deal with the problem. I understand thatat least 50 per cent. of Labour MPs support the Sustainable Communities Bill and that, resistingthe &#147;not invented here&#148; syndrome, the Labour Government have finally decided to back it. I am delighted about that, but I fear that the Government do not have a joined-up strategy on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07042341000538">If the Minister wants firm evidence about how serious the situation is, I can tell him that over the past few years 8,600 independent grocery stores have closed, 4,000 bank branches have closed, 200 police stations  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Apr 2007">

<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>23 Apr 2007 : Column 766</b><br>
have closed, 13,000 independent newsagents have closed, 700 doctors surgeries have closed, 162 green-belt developments were approved by the Government, and 20 independent pubs closed every month. In 2005, 70 per cent. of rural parishes had no general store,75 per cent. had no daily bus service, 83 per cent. had no GP, and 43 per cent. had no post office. All that has happened under a Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07042341000539">The post office closures in Southend have had a serious effect because we have the highest number of senior citizens in the country. Throughout the country 3,700 post offices have closed. The Government gave all sorts of reassurances that that would not impact on local communities, but it certainly has done so in the area that I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07042341000540">Although I welcome the fact that there are now20 PayPoint outlets in Southend, West, where payments can be made in cash or by debit card for television licenses and in cash for most utilities and mobile phone top-ups, I am concerned that those services will not be accessible to the elderly in my constituency, who are not familiar with the new facility. How on earth the Government expect senior citizens to cope with new technology I do not know. As a result of what has happened with post offices in urban areas, only 42 per cent. of people now walk to their post office, down from 70 per cent. before the recent spate of closures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07042341000541">The Minister knows more than most, because we had a number of meetings with him about the Southend census. Nothing was done to help my constituents after the 2001 census left 20,000 people off. The subject has not gone away, because it is such a serious matter when funding is provided for 20,000 people fewer than in fact live in the constituency. I do not know how the mistake was made or why I was not alerted to it earlier. It is no good the Government suggesting that the local authority can raise more money. It cannot, because the Government wouldcap it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07042341000542">The biggest effect, as the Minister knows, is on buses. Southend residents value their buses, which were being run by First and Arriva. The local authority had to withdraw the subsidy, because it has no money, so services were stopped on the 23 route connecting Belfairs to Tesco and Leigh Broadway, and Arriva stopped an evening and Sunday service along the route from Belfairs to Southend hospital and to the town centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07042341000543">The main candidate for providing the necessary funds had until very recently been Tesco. The Minister will no doubt be intrigued by that. The initial encouragement that I received from Tesco led me to question the assumption that national supermarkets, which are blamed for the identikit high street, are not conducive to sustainable communities. For some time I had been in discussion with Tesco, which had informed me that as a firm it often subsidises local bus services for the benefit of the local community. Unfortunately, after a meeting earlier this year with representatives from Tesco who were sent down t the area by the chief executive, I was given the somewhat contradictory information that Tesco did not subsidise local bus services and would not be making any exception. Dealing with Tesco in that respect over 18 months has been a complete and absolute waste of time. I am very dissatisfied with what has happened. I have a letter  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Apr 2007">

<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>23 Apr 2007 : Column 767</b><br>
from one of the directors of Tesco, reiterating its negative response. In the light of record profits of&#163;2.6 billion, I am less than happy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07042341000544">On the subject of identikit high streets&#151;I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) in his place, because I was going to refer to his high street&#151;between 1997 and 2005, 50 specialist stores such as butchers, bakers and fishmongers closed a week. That has all taken place while we have had a Labour Government. I am not enamoured of identikit high streets and I am fortunate that Southend is not overly afflicted by the phenomenon, but there are certainly many challenges in Southend high street. Independent retailers, starved of business by the big supermarkets, have less money to spend locally and make less demand for local products. That in turn impoverishes local producers. Although I welcome Tesco&#146;s surprise announcement on 3 April about increasing the producer price of milk by 4p to about 22p per litre, that is a frightening indicator of the power that supermarkets now have to dictate prices to producers. All of that has happened while we have had a Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07042341000545">Between 1997 and 2002, the number of UK farm workers fell by 100,000, leading to many rural homes being taken over by city commuters, who have much weaker links to the local community and are less likely to spend their money locally. As the country&#146;s food infrastructure has contracted, it has become increasingly difficult for small shops to source their goods from nearby wholesalers&#151;dairy or abattoir. It therefore comes as no surprise that the distance that the average tonne of UK food is transported has increased from 82 km in 1978 to 128 km in 1999.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07042341000546">The other point that the Government wax lyrical about is democracy. They have a great deal to say about democracy, but in practice they will go down in history as the most undemocratic Government of the last two centuries. In the run-up to the local elections on Thursday week, we are again exposed to the apathy, I dare say, of the general public. I believe in restoring powers to local councils. The Government have taken all the powers away from local authorities. They are now told what to spend money on and how much money to raise. All their power has been lost under this Government. Restoring powers to local councils and involving the public in consultations, as the Sustainable Communities Bill proposes, would encourage people to take part in the democratic process. The key to building a sustainable community is requiring the active participation of communities and residents, mainly through local authorities&#151;let us set the people free.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07042341000547">I am vehemently opposed to the unaccountable power wielded by today&#146;s quangos, as are my hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and for Rochford and Southend, East. The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) also has some reservations about the number of quangos in Essex. I welcome the proposals in the Sustainable Communities Bill to make the action of those organisations more transparent. It is not surprising  <br>

that taxpayers are disheartened by ever-increasing tax rises when they have little control over how money is spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07042341000548">I will end with two points. Southend faces a tough employment situation. I will not go into huge detail about it tonight. The Minister has the evidence inthe latest report from the Communities and Local Government Committee, which shows how seaside resorts have suffered. The fishing industry, which was traditionally an alternative source of employment for residents in Southend, has been badly hit in our area. Quotas introduced this year introduced by-catch limits of 25 per cent. on skates and rays. That threatens to cripple fishermen up and down the East Anglia coast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07042341000549">I am informed that, although stocks of skates and rays might be threatened off parts of Britain&#146;s coastline, they are in plentiful supply in the waters off my constituency, but they cannot be caught. In 1983, the UK extended its fishery limits to 12 miles. That now clearly needs to be seen to be working. Some24 years later, fishermen in my constituency are seriously suffering. One of the Minister&#146;s colleagues recently met a delegation to discuss the situation. The Minister knows from the Select Committee report that a high proportion of people living in coastal towns are claiming benefits, especially incapacity benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07042341000550">On Friday, I visited Westborough school, which is just about the largest primary school in Essex. The foundation school has been nominated for the sustainable school of the year award. It is an excellent example of how a primary school can make a valuable contribution to the sustainability of a community. It provides support to both pupils and parents in a variety of ways and tries to meet the challenges presented by the diverse urban population from which it draws it intake.</p>

The school has a long-term vision for the development of its land-locked site and Edwardian building. It has a recycled playground and an environmentally friendly cardboard classroom. It is committed to inclusion and its intake fully reflectsthe diverse, socially mixed community. Every child participates in an inclusive production each year and no ethnic group is marginalised. The school operates an open-access policy for parents, and problems are dealt with on a same-day basis. The school works with local social services and other providers to facilitate the return to education of disaffected secondary school pupils.</p>

 I give my genuine congratulations to the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on securing the debate, especially because it is being held on St. George&#146;s day, our national day. I share his view that it is right to celebrate St. George&#146;s day. On Sunday in my constituency, 1,250 of our Brownies, Cubs, Beavers and Scouts celebrated the 100th anniversary of scouting, as did the rest of the country. Such celebrations takeplace on the nearest Sunday to St. George&#146;s day, and Sunday was one of the proudest days that I have had representing my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07042341000555">I want to give the hon. Gentleman some encouragement. The direction of travel that he is imploring the Government to follow on devolution&#151;or double devolution, as it has been called&#151;is at the heart of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which is being considered by the House. The Bill builds on the local government White Paper that was published in October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para23"><a name="07042341000556">The hon. Gentleman referred to the Sustainable Communities Bill. The Government did not vote against that private Member&#146;s Bill. We are discussing with its promoter and sponsors how we can meet the Bill&#146;s objectives of helping to sustain communities in a way that is workable and beneficial. Much merit is claimed for the Bill, ranging from the assertion that it will save local pubs to the suggestion that it will save high streets from voracious supermarkets. Having read the Bill, I am puzzled about how that would be translated into reality. However, its core philosophy is one that we support, and we are considering how to improve the Bill. A number of measures are already in place, or are being put in place, that achieve the goals of the Sustainable Communities Bill. Indeed, debate on the Bill gives me the opportunity to explain to the House in greater detail what those measures are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para24"><a name="07042341000557">The hon. Member for Southend, West, paints a bleak picture of Britain, and I understand why, but I have to say that if he travelled with me to most towns and even villages on a Saturday night, the phrase &#147;ghost town&#148; is not what would come to mind. One wag in my constituency said that it was more like the wild west than a ghost town. I share with the hon. Gentleman the concern about the decline of independent shops, and the work of the all-party group on small shops should be commended, but it would be misleading if the Government gave the impression that those problems would be solved simply by passinga private Member&#146;s Bill. We have to ensure fair competition, but the supermarkets are successful because they provide consumers with what they want. Some of the supporters of the Sustainable Communities Bill have to marry that support with the idea of a free market economy, but I am certainly not here to bash successful businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para25"><a name="07042341000558">The Government have made significant changes to planning policy, and we believe that they help the situation, particularly with out-of-town shopping centres. I know that that is a big issue in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s part of the world; I also know how popular such shopping centres can be, but it is right that planning policy should ensure that town centres and retail centres benefit.

I have learned in my time in ministerial office to be wary of figures that move in that way. Indeed, in a previous incarnation, I used to produce regular figures on the loss of manufacturing jobs&#151;it was when the Conservatives were in government&#151;and I confess that they were gross figures, not net figures. The same survey carries on today, much to my discomfort, so I cannot really complain. In any case, the hon. Gentleman raises a serious point. Two specific issues to do with the census figures were raised by him and by the hon. Member for Rochford.</p>

 I apologise. The constituency was changed after the Boundary Commission report, was it not? The hon. Member for Southend, West, and the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East, raised the issue of the census. Of course, we have to rely on the best figures that are available to us, and the Office for National Statistics is the source of the figures. On the distribution of the money, we simply distribute a cake, as it were, and local authorities and Members have reasonably put their arguments about theirarea&#146;s individual circumstances. I have been lobbied by 18 Members of Parliament who have put a &#147;unique&#148; case, but if there are even just two cases on the same basis, neither can be unique, can it? That is a serious point. The ONS has reported on the work of its working party; it has provided an interim report and is considering how we can deal with the matter.</p>

The Government changed the formula in the current round to ensure that there is a greater forward look, and to ensure that we do not just rely on historic trends, so I assure the hon. Member for Southend, West that his lobbying has not been wholly without benefit for his area. Later this year, we intend to announce a three-year settlement for 2008-11, and it is important that the discussions on the population figures continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70423-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07042341000563">I recognise the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about seaside towns. Over the decades, we have seen a general shift because of changes in tourism, changes in fishing industries and other factors. That has been highlighted by all-party groups, by the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government and by academic studies such as those from Sheffield. There are often different reasons in different parts of the country, sometimes to do with port trading, fishing or tourism. I suspect that in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency it is a mixture of all three. He nods in assent, which confirms my briefing and my personal knowledge of Southend. There are strong arguments and the issue is being addressed, albeit, I recognise, not entirely to his satisfaction.</p>

provide non-ring-fenced budgets and devolve power, we are often told that the money is not enough, which is the argument on the concessionary bus fares scheme. When the money was provided on a non-ring-fenced basis through the local authority revenue support grant settlement, some councils said that it was not enough. One cannot have one&#146;s cake and eat it. If it is such a priority for the local authority, it has to take some tough decisions, just as Governments do. There is further good news, however, because the Chancellor has announced not only a nationwide concessionary fare scheme for buses for the elderly and disabled but a national scheme. Discussions are taking place in Government on how the funding mechanism for that should be handled. Representations made by the hon. Gentleman and others are of course being considered as we work out how the scheme can best come about.</p>

[<i> Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman says, &#147;For two decades.&#148; That gives me a get-out, because I think that I would come out on top were he to make claims about the previous Conservative Government, particularly as regards the abolition of councils and interference in local authorities in that period. Indeed, I could refer to the memoirs of Kenneth Baker, who described how he had to tackle, as he saw it, the views of local authorities in the 1980s&#151;not a lot of devolution around then.</p>

Every local authority in England now has such an agreement. Approximately &#163;500 million is channelled into local area agreements, and that frees up local agencies, especially local councils.</p>
