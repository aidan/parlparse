<p><a name="qn_0">1. <a name="51010-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Mark Lancaster  (North-East Milton Keynes)</b> 
 (Con): What assessment he has made of the effectiveness of (a) electronic and (b) manned borders; and if he will make a statement.  [16777]
</p>



<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51010-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality  (Mr. Tony McNulty): </b> 
 We are constantly reviewing the efficacy of staffed borders on a regular, intelligence-led basis. There are currently 41&nbsp;staffed ports, of which 16&nbsp;are staffed 24&nbsp;hours a day. We are developing an e-borders programme and a borders management programme, and will deliver a more integrated secure border based on both electronic and staffed components.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51010-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lancaster: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his answer. I think that he said that only 16&nbsp;of the official ports were manned 24&nbsp;hours a day. Why are the other 13&nbsp;not manned as well?
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51010-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should, if he is serious, ask why the 350&nbsp;ports up and down the country, including regularised and unregularised airfields, are not staffed&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I should be very keen to hear the shadow Chancellor&#039;s comments on the Conservatives&#039; manifesto commitments. It is clear that we must improve our borders, and we are using technology to do so. Some of that is being implemented already. Hon. Members will be aware that embarkation 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 3</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>controls were first lifted in 1994, and quite rightly. We need to adopt an intelligence-led approach, and that is what we are doing. In answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question, some ports are staffed, and some utilise electronics. Over the course of time, we shall get to a stage where we have the secure borders that we deserve.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51010-01_spnew3"><b> Andrew Mackinlay  (Thurrock)</b> 
 (Lab): Why are the 350&nbsp;ports not covered by a dedicated police force? Since long before it was fashionable for Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition to do so, I have been telling Labour and Tory Ministers that we need a dedicated police force, particularly at our sea ports, to combat organised crime, to wage war against people trafficking and to complement our efforts to wage war against terrorism. It really is time for this Government to appoint a proper dedicated police force&#151;along the lines of the British Transport police or the Ministry of Defence police&#151;so that our sea ports can be secure. A highly mobile force could ensure good coverage of the 350&nbsp;ports to complement the work of our immigration and customs services.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51010-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 My answer was a direct response to a question about ports that are staffed 24&nbsp;hours a day. We do not believe that it is appropriate to staff 350-plus ports on a 24-hour basis, come what may, and I believe that others who investigate these matters would agree with that. The present arrangements have the potential for mobility, and I believe that the job is being done well by the UK immigration service, the police and Customs and Excise. I would ask my hon. Friend not to go down the path taken by the Conservatives of maligning public servants who are dedicated to their jobs.

All that he gives us is the usual old story that we have come to expect from this Government and from his Department: endless reviews and endless excuses. When will the people of this country be reassured that they can be safe from intrusion by people whom we do not want here and who should not be here?
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51010-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 They will not be reassured by repeating what the Conservative Government did in replacing embarkation controls with nothing in 1994. E-borders and our border management programme are a reality that is being implemented as we speak. We have in place an airline liaison network that is second to none, which is starting to address the problem, long before there is any incursion, on an international basis&#151;something that is being repeated in other countries throughout the world. What is being done is being done now. I shall leave waffle and inaction to the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51010-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 We have made extensive progress in terms of trafficking; in only the last couple of weeks there have been significant high-profile cases, not least the arrest in Birmingham last week, about which I can say no more. We have made human trafficking a cornerstone of all that we are doing in the Justice and Home Affairs Council during our presidency and we want to ensure that work persists. Those matters are best dealt with at European and wider international levels and the Government have an excellent record in that regard.

<a name="stpa_0">Whether e-borders or physical borders, neither work if they are not properly policed. Can the Minister confirm the number of special branch officers who are established in our ports and airports and can he confirm that the number is actually less than two thirds of the proper establishment? Does that not reveal to the world that the Government have simply lost control of our borders?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51010-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 That was certainly better than last week, but the right hon. Gentleman can probably do better none the less.

<a name="stpa_1">The number of special branch people at our ports, as the right hon. Gentleman should be more than aware, is an operational matter that I shall not discuss across the Dispatch Box, but I can tell him that we are in the middle of recruiting some additional 600-plus immigration officials, many of whom will be deployed at our sea ports and airports.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51010-01_spnew13"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 Let me help the Minister with the facts. There are supposed to be 1,400&nbsp;special branch officers protecting our borders; in fact, there are only 900. That is two years after a report from Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate that described the arrangement as wholly inadequate&#151;a point demonstrated when Hussein Osman, a terror suspect from 21&nbsp;July, blithely left the country via Waterloo station without being checked at all. Why is it that two years after being warned the Government took no effective action to stop suspected terrorists moving in and out of our country whenever they like?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51010-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 That is simply not the case. Nor is it the case that only special branch can control our borders; the right hon. Gentleman knows that. A mixture of our customs and immigration people, our police special branch and others deal with the matter and they do so with real operational success. I shall not go into the details of an individual case although I am happy to share the details I have with the right hon. Gentleman should he so choose. Do not malign our public servants, they are doing an excellent job in the most extreme circumstances and I have looked long and hard to find in any shadow Budget mention of the 600-plus immigration officers we are recruiting as we speak.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51010-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Denis MacShane  (Rotherham)</b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51010-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend. As I said before, we are doing much in terms of human trafficking both in itself and as part of our wider policy, including in many of the eastern European states most directly concerned in providing those women, but rape it is and it is as rape that it should be recorded.

<p><a name="qn_1">2. <a name="51010-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk)</b> 
 (Con): What estimate he has made of the quantities of drugs taken into prisons by (a) prisoners, (b) visitors, (c) prison officers and (d) other means in the last period for which figures are available.  [16778]
</p>



<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51010-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 We do not collect information on estimates of quantities centrally. The mandatory drug testing programme, which is the principal means of measuring drug misuse in prisons, shows that the percentage of positive results has halved since 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">Recently, the Home Office commissioned qualitative research that identifies supply routes. These were, in order: social visits; mail; newly arrived prisoners; staff; over the perimeter; and after-court appearances. Measures are already in place to target those routes and the report will inform the further development of strategies to reduce the supply of drugs in prisons.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51010-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister and look forward to that report. May I refer her to a written question that I tabled in July? In her reply, she pointed out that a member of staff at Wandsworth was investigated for drug possession in July&#151;not just a normal member of staff, but a junior governor who was found in possession of drugs. As I understand it he did not even face disciplinary proceedings, which seems strange. Does the Minister agree that the drugs problem in prisons is reaching crisis levels and that there should be a zero-tolerance policy towards members of staff who deal in drugs? Will the Government get a grip on the situation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51010-02_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Any member of prison staff who is found dealing in drugs will be referred to the police for criminal prosecution. That is our policy, and that is how we will always proceed where there is evidence to do so. It is much more important to ensure that people face the full process of the criminal law, rather than other action in relation to their employment, and we do that. I agree that we need to have zero tolerance, and that is why I am pleased that we are in the process of reducing the extent of drug misuse in prison.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51010-02_spnew2"><b> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West)</b> 
 (Lab): Is not it true that, although there has been a reduction, the position remains as it has been for many years now under two Governments? The Minister recently told me that, in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 6</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>past five years, not a single prison in Britain has been free from illegal drug use. Given the consequences of that in terms of the spread of disease in Britain, particularly AIDS and hepatitis, would it not be better if we concentrated our resources on harm reduction, especially on allowing needle exchanges?
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51010-02_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 I visited a prison the other day where mandatory drug testing has produced zero positive test results for a number of months in succession. I am anxious about the fact that that was outcome for just a number of months, but it is possible, as that prison has showed, to seek to achieve drug-free prisons. We should continue to aim for that goal, but we also need to help the very large proportion of people who come into prison with existing drug misuse problems and to reduce the harm that they face, including when they are released. That is part of the work done in prison by the CARATS&#151;counselling, assessment, referral, advice and throughcare&#151;workers.

 An individual prisoner might say that, and indeed that might be his experience. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for expressing his constituent&#039;s concerns, but we are working hard and effectively to win the struggle. Any prisoner can go on to a voluntary drug-testing regime, where they are tested at least 18&nbsp;times a year, and there are drug-free wings in many prisons, so we already put in place the means to support those prisoners who are determined to end their drug abuse.
</p>

 (Lab): Will the Minister join me in congratulating the staff and governors at Wakefield prison, where there is a 1&nbsp;per cent. drug incidence, as revealed by the mandatory testing regime? Will she make time in her ministerial schedule to come to Wakefield to see the very strict checks that are put in place for every visitor to the prison, whether the chief of police, the Member of Parliament or the Minister? It is a really impressive sight.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51010-02_spnew7"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 It is indeed, and our prisons put in a lot of effort. We should not forget that they largely deal with a group of people who have massive drug problems&#151;about 80&nbsp;per cent. of people coming into prisons have used drugs, and 55&nbsp;per cent. of them say that they have been addicted. That represents a big struggle, and it is right that we should be determined to overcome it. I am always keen to visit prisons to see their hard work to tackle the menace of drug use in prison.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 7</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>most commonly, heroin and cannabis&#151; and more than half of all our prisoners admit that their offences are related to drug taking. Why then do only half the prisoners who start drug treatment courses complete them in prison and why do only a third of our young offender institutions provide intensive drug treatment programmes? Is that not a disgraceful record for a Government who said that they would be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime?
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51010-02_spnew9"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 It is not. Every prison, of course, has a struggle to deal with drugs. I think I was quite clear about that in what I said earlier. When a prison deals with a population the vast majority of whose offending is drug related, it is inevitable that it will focus on the issue of drugs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_4">If the hon. Lady stops trying to interrupt me, I will deal with the issue of intensive treatment that she raised. One of the things that we rightly do in prisons is develop particular expertise in particular centres of, for example, intensive treatment programmes or particular education programmes to rehabilitate prisoners. We do not carry out such programmes everywhere, but we offer treatment of some kind in every single prison in the country.

 There is 24-hour cover at the UK&#039;s main 16&nbsp;ports of entry and a further 25&nbsp;are regularly staffed. Officers are deployed to unmanned ports to meet specific arrivals when necessary. There are no plans to have personnel manning the 350&nbsp;ports for 24&nbsp;hours a day.

 The Minister is a fine public servant and I have no wish to malign him in any way, so I simply note with regret that the Government have scrapped embarkation controls and reduced the number of immigration officials, that there are just 10&nbsp;permanent staff in one in five of our ports and, as the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality admitted earlier, that a plethora of organisations are responsible for our borders. As an exponent of the new politics, may I reach across the Chamber and agree with the hon.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. I hope she agrees that it is important to give confidence to victims.

</p>








<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51010-03_spnew11"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his question. Whether those assets are funding terrorist activity or other criminal activity, the message from this Parliament and this Government is that they can no longer be relied on because we want not only to prosecute and convict people for the offences that they commit but to strip them of their assets and make sure that the proceeds go back into funding front-line services.

The work of the Assets Recovery Agency has particular significance in Northern Ireland, given the problems of prosecuting former paramilitaries there. Will the Minister assure me that the agency will pursue those former paramilitaries who have made money illegally in Northern Ireland and invested it in legal businesses in the rest of the UK, that they will be prosecuted and that their assets will be recovered to the communities, as should be the case?
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51010-03_spnew15"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I can confirm that. As my hon. Friend probably knows, the Assets Recovery Agency has a dedicated office in Belfast. I am very encouraged by the fact that last year the agency raised &#163;4.7&nbsp;million and restrained &#163;17&nbsp;million of assets. The message is clear: whether people are from Northern Ireland or the mainland, if they have assets built on criminality&#151;if they have houses, yachts and a lifestyle based on criminality&#151;we are after them, and we will reclaim those assets and put them to good public use.

</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be encouraged to learn that only a few weeks ago I was able to send back &#163;13&nbsp;million of recovered assets directly to front-line policing. We estimate that in the coming year some &#163;30&nbsp;million will be recycled to police front-line services. Indeed, in 2007&#150;08, half of all money gained by front-line agencies will be returned to them.

 I thank the Home Secretary for that clarification. Given that Somalia is the ultimate failed state, I am slightly disturbed that we are returning people there.

As for his point on section 8, yes, of course it has not been terribly successful, in part because of the cumbersome nature in legal terms of the criminal dimension.

 The cost thrown away on the Bicester site, according to the Minister&#039;s own parliamentary answers, is some &#163;18.5&nbsp;million. The House of Commons Library has calculated that, in Oxfordshire, &#163;18.5&nbsp;million would have bought us 3,000&nbsp;trainee teachers, 600&nbsp;probationary police officers and some 900&nbsp;trainee nurses. Does the Minister now concede that that was a scandalous waste of money that would have been much better spent on nurses, teachers and police officers rather than being wasted on the scheme that the Government pursued for so many years?

 As at 30&nbsp;June 2005, 13&nbsp;per cent. of remand prisoners and 39&nbsp;per cent. of convicted prisoners held in prisons in England were over 50&nbsp;miles from their home address. Supportive relationships can have a positive effect on reducing reoffending and the National Offender Management Service assists prisoners to maintain their social and family ties through the assisted visit scheme and extended family visits.
</p>








<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51010-05_spnew2"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I am sure that the Minister accepts that having families nearby is very important, especially when prisoners are on remand. She will also know that prisoners whose homes are in the south of England are much more likely to be further away from home because of the nature of the prison estate. Can she make it clear that it is Government policy to ensure that the figure for those who live within 50&nbsp;miles of where they are in prison increases significantly in the near future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51010-05_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 In our expansion of the prison estate since 1997, we have focused additional prison capacity in areas such as the south-east where there was a shortage, for exactly the reasons that the hon. Gentleman identified. He is aware that the Home Secretary made a speech on 19&nbsp;September to the Prison Reform Trust, in which he highlighted the importance of community and family ties, and that he intends to develop a strategy for community prisons that will connect in the way that the hon. Gentleman described. At present, our prisons are very full, particularly in the south-east of England. That has consequences for prisoners&#039; proximity to their families. We are doing our best to mitigate those consequences.

He also knows that the increase in the number of women in prison, which just a year ago seemed to be continuing apace, has stabilised over the past year. Although we have record numbers of men in prison, we have fewer women in prison than at this time last year. It is right to seek to reduce the use of imprisonment for women offenders where that is not necessary&#151;where they do not represent a threat to the public&#151;and we will continue to do so.

 (Lab): If he will make a statement on the code of practice on information sharing issued in response to the Bichard report.  [16790]

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51010-05_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety  (Hazel Blears): </b> 
 In response to recommendations 8&nbsp;and 9&nbsp;of the Bichard inquiry report, a new code of practice on police information management was laid before Parliament on 19&nbsp;July this year. The code was developed for the Home Office by the National Centre for Policing Excellence, with input from the police service and others. It provides for far greater consistency in the management and sharing of information by the police service and will be underpinned by detailed operational guidance, which is currently being developed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51010-05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Illsley: </b> 
 As I understand it, the initial code of practice drawn up under the acquisition and disclosure of communication regulations included the clearing house model.

Friend say whether the clearing house model will be retained in the final code of practice?
</p>








<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51010-05_spnew7"><b> Hazel Blears: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 20</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>operational guidance that we are working on will contain more of that detailed tactical advice and will be issued fairly shortly. What was important about the Bichard report, which will be groundbreaking in the extent to which it changes the way the police service shares and manages information, was that it required not only changes to the way we use information, but changes to the technology that underpins information sharing across the police service to make sure that nobody ever falls through the net again, as happened in those terrible cases that led to the Bichard report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">My hon. Friend raised a technical issue from the point of view of suppliers and I will be more than happy to look into that if he writes or speaks to me about it. I can assure him that the code of practice underpinned by the operational guidance will revolutionise the way the police service shares its information and make it much more fit for purpose.

 (Con): The Minister will be aware that better information sharing is being used as an excuse for the unpopular merging of small police forces.

</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51010-05_spnew9"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The current review resulting from Denis O&#039;Connor&#039;s report concerns whether we can make our police forces fit for the 21st century, providing protective services to the community that we all serve. In taking forward the consultation, it is vital that forces consider how their services can be provided more efficiently and how they can provide a proper level of protection against whatever crimes we face. This is not about cost-cutting. This is about making sure that our police service is fit to do the job that we all want it to do. I look forward to receiving proposals from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s force on how it can improve its organisation to provide a better service.

I remember arriving as a young, new Member five years ago when Robin Cook was one of the towering giants on the Government Benches. He was a distinguished holder of the office of Leader of the House. I think that even the present Leader of the House would admit that he would be a hard act for any future one to follow. He will be much missed in the House. Mo Mowlam, a distinguished figure for many years who made a major contribution to the Government, will also be missed by people on both sides of the House.

<a name="stpa_6">On returning to the House, may I first express my sincere condolences&#151;and, I am sure, those of the whole House&#151;to the families of those UK forces personnel who were most recently killed in Iraq: on 5&nbsp;September, Fusilier Donal Anthony Mead and Fusilier Stephen Robert Manning, both from C company, 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers; and on 11&nbsp;September, Major Matthew Bacon of the intelligence corps, who was serving as a staff officer with the headquarters of the Multi-National Division (South East). We express our gratitude to those who gave their lives in the service of their country, and we express our condolences to their families and to their loved ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_7">Let us remind ourselves of our objective in Iraq. It is to work, along with the rest of the international community, and now the United Nations under United Nations Security Council resolution 1546, to assist the Iraqi people and their elected representatives: first, to establish their own democratic Government and institutions; secondly, to build their own security forces to safeguard that democracy; and thirdly, to develop their economy and civil society. We are helping the Iraqis to build all three of them; the terrorists want to impede and destroy all three of them. That is the battleground. I can put it no better than President Talibani did in <i>The Times</i> this morning:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The battle of Iraq cannot be won by retreat or compromise, but by the vision and determination for which Britain is renowned.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_8">And that means, as Prime Minister Jafaari said when I met him recently:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The presence of multinational forces in Iraq for us is based on need, security need for those forces to support our forces.&quot;</p>

<a name="51010-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_9">The United Kingdom is in Iraq for as long as we are needed, and as long as we need to be there, and no longer than either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_10">The political process, despite the worst intentions of the terrorists, continues to be on track. Following the elections in January of this year and the establishment of the constitutional commission, the Iraqis have now produced a draft constitution that will be the subject of an historic national referendum later this week. Few people thought that we would get to this point. Preparations are also under way for full, democratic, national elections in December. These are, in any context, enormous strides forward, and, in the context of the continual terrorist activity, hugely significant strides forward which have been made in spite of the terrorist attempts to derail Iraq&#039;s progress towards a peaceful and democratic future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_11">Against this political backdrop, the coalition&#039;s top priority is working with the Iraqis to improve the security environment and to build the capability of the Iraqi security forces so that they themselves are increasingly able to take responsibility for delivering law and order. In this we are working not alone, but with 27&nbsp;other nations under the United Nations Security Council resolution. Despite, again, all the efforts of the terrorists, I can report to the House that we are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 25</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>beginning to see real progress in building up the Iraqi security forces. There are now more than 190,000 Iraqi security force personnel who have been trained and are capable thus far, and the number of Iraqi units capable of conducting effective counter-insurgency operations is increasing steadily. That means that there are now, for the first time, more trained and capable Iraqi security forces than there are multinational forces in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_12">But as everyone involved in this process recognises, there are no quick fixes, and building the Iraqi leadership, command and control, logistics and support structures will take more time. We have always said that our handover to the Iraqis themselves will be conditional upon their developing their own security capabilities, and that we will see the job through until those conditions have been met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_13">The House may wish to be reminded of the criteria and the terms on which those conditions might be fulfilled, since there has been some demand outside this House for clarification on what is sometimes called the exit strategy. The conditions that will permit the transfer of security responsibility to the Iraqi security forces have been defined by the joint committee to transfer security responsibility, which, as the House may recall, was formed by the Iraqi Prime Minister over the summer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_14">The basic principles for transfer of security to the Iraqi authorities are based on four broad categories: an assessment of the insurgents&#039; threat level; Iraqi security forces&#039; ability to take on the security task themselves; the capacity of provincial bodies to cope with the changed security environment; and the posture and support available from coalition forces. Those are the criteria; we expect the Committee&#039;s criteria to be confirmed soon. Thereafter, assessments will be made by the Iraqis to determine which areas of Iraq are ready to transfer to Iraqi control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_15">I emphasise that we therefore stand by the strategy that we have maintained up to now, which sets out the conditions under which we will hand security to the Iraqis themselves and begin to draw down our forces. I want to emphasise again that we will stay in Iraq until the job is done and that we will not make significant changes to the United Kingdom&#039;s force posture in Iraq until we, the coalition partners and, in particular, the Iraqis themselves, are confident that the conditions are right. That was, is and remains our position and any speculation to the contrary is simply wrong. Indeed, I would go further and say that the biggest obstacle now to our leaving Iraq in view of the build-up of the Iraqi forces&#039; capability is the actions of the terrorists themselves. Terrorist activity only delays our leaving Iraq; it does not hasten it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_16">Turning specifically to the security situation in Multinational Division (South East), hon. Members will have seen the graphic television pictures of events in Basra on 19&nbsp;September. Two soldiers in MND(SE) were arrested by the Iraqi police service and held at an Iraqi police station in Basra. We agreed with the Governor of Basra and the chief of police to collect the personnel from the police station but, as we prepared to do so, it became clear that the two soldiers had been handed to local militia. The decision to mount an operation to enter the police station was then taken&#151;a decision that I fully supported at the time and still fully support.

In addition to 7&nbsp;Armoured Brigade&#039;s Headquarters and Signals Squadron, the following major units will be deployed to replace those currently in Iraq: 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment; 1st Battalion the Highlanders; 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers; 9th/12th Royal Lancers; 1st Battalion the King&#039;s Own Royal Border Regiment; the Scots Dragoon Guards; 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery; 32nd Engineer Regiment; and 2&nbsp;Logistics Support Regiment.

<a name="51010-06_para20">
<a name="stpa_23">The Territorial Army units involved in this roulement are a single company from the 4th Battalion the Parachute Regiment and a composite company from the West Midlands Regiment and the Royal Welsh Regiment. During what will be a very busy period of troop movements, I have also decided to deploy one company from the Cyprus-based theatre reserve force to relieve the rotating troops of some routine security tasks, such as static security or guard duty. A company of 1st Battalion the Royal Highland Fusiliers will deploy for a few weeks while that rotation lasts.

<a name="51010-06_para21">
<a name="stpa_24">The total numbers of troops in Iraq following the deployment of 7&nbsp;Armoured Brigade will be around 8,000. That is about 500&nbsp;fewer than at present, reflecting the closure of two small bases in Basra, the transfer of some training tasks to the Iraqi security forces and

The Iraqi security forces themselves will lead on security in the referendum, with our support.

The production of an Iraqi constitution, written by democratically elected Iraqi politicians on behalf of their own people, is a huge step forward. We have no intention of undermining this historic achievement by abandoning Iraq before it is ready to stand on its own two feet, or before its democratically elected politicians feel that to be the case. Of course, we will encounter more obstacles. There will be more major hurdles to overcome, particularly in the run-up to the elections in December, when a minority of the Iraqis and some from outside&#151;the terrorists&#151;will almost certainly seek to disrupt Iraq&#039;s progress towards security, democracy and self-determination.

<a name="stpa_27">The recent discovery and recovery of more than 160&nbsp;more bodies from a mass grave in the al-Muthanna province in MND(SE), is a sober reminder of the horrors that the Iraqi people have had to face in the past, and of the reasons why we must continue our efforts to support them in building a better future, embracing democracy and free from tyranny. So, while we do not want to be in Iraq any longer than is absolutely necessary, we will not be deflected from our task. We have made a commitment to the Iraqi people; it is important that we honour that commitment and see our task through, and that is what we will do.

 I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and for giving me advance sight of it. On behalf of my colleagues, I join him in sending condolences to the families of those who have so bravely but tragically lost their lives. I also join him in paying tribute to our armed forces serving in Iraq. In the face of severe dangers, their courage, commitment, professionalism and loyalty are a matter of great pride and an example to us all.
</p>

<a name="51010-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_28">For all the Secretary of State&#039;s brave words, however, the situation in Iraq today is grim. There are now about 500&nbsp;insurgent attacks each week, fuelled by growing outside interference, not least in MND(SE). The price is indeed being paid for the crass decision to disband the Iraqi security forces after the war&#151;a decision that gave the insurgents their opening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">Today, the Secretary of State has again reiterated that we should stay in Iraq, in his words, until our job is done. I agree, but the critical question is how he defines the job and who makes that crucial assessment. According to the Secretary of State it is the Iraqi Government. Of course, they have an absolute right to ask us to go if they wish us to do so, but surely their right 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to ask us to stay cannot be open-ended. Ultimately, is not it for us and no one else to decide on the deployment of our armed forces and when they should begin to draw down?
</p>

<a name="51010-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_30">I have noted what the Secretary of State said about troop rotations. I listened with surprise at the pride with which he mentioned the names of some of those regiments&#151;ironic in light of the fact that at the same time he is trying to abolish so many of those same regiments. The 1st Battalion the Royal Highland Fusiliers is to be deployed for the third time. I might ask him has its rifle company, which was stranded in Jordan for lack of air transport, been recovered? He has confirmed that a date has been set for the withdrawal of 12&nbsp;Mechanised Brigade, but for how long will there be an overlap between the reserve battalion coming in and the brigade before that withdrawal takes place?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">The House also noted what the Secretary of State had to say about the developing capability of the Iraqi security forces. I must press him a little on that. He tells us that 190,000&nbsp;personnel have been trained so far and that the number of capable units is increasing steadily. However, is not it the case that, as the top United States commander in Iraq, General Casey, told the Senate last week, only one Iraqi army battalion seems fully capable of fighting independently and is not that two fewer than was the case only two months ago?

Indeed, what estimate has he made of such infiltration? Does he now accept, for instance, that many of the latest roadside bombs are of Iranian design and manufacture? I understand that, as a result of the increased attrition from roadside bombing, our forces in MND(SE) are relying heavily on the use of helicopters. Are there enough helicopters to meet those new requirements and how many of them are having to be commercially contracted?

<a name="stpa_34">The whole House and the nation are proud of our armed forces.

<a name="stpa_35">As to the when, will that be an event? No, it will be a process. Will that process achieve the necessary conditions in every part of the country at the same time? No, so geographically, and in time lines, it will be a continuing process. Who will decide that? Obviously, at the end of the day every sovereign nation, including ourselves, has the right, if it so wishes, to make any decision that it wishes. The right hon. and learned Gentleman, or any other hon. Member, would not want us to take a decision that dishonoured a pledge that we made to the Iraqi people and to their democratically elected representatives. Of course, the decision will be made in consultation with the Iraqis. At the end of the day, the truth is that we do not want to be there any longer than necessary. Quite frankly, the Iraqi politicians, who are democratically elected and accountable to their people, do not want us there any longer than we are needed and necessary either. That is precisely what Prime Minister Jafaari and I said at the press conference some two weeks ago. However, if we read what he and President Talibani said this morning, it is obvious that the minority of terrorists who are attempting to claim that we are not there with the support of Iraqi people are being absolutely misleading. We are there, with the support of the Iraqi people, for as long as it is necessary to secure their own developing democracy.

<a name="stpa_36">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asks about air transport, and he has written to me on that point. I can tell him that we have done everything that we can to overcome those difficulties, and they have been overcome. Without going into details, the problem is very often not the aircraft, but having suitable aircraft with defensive suites. The safety of our troops travelling in and out of Iraq is paramount, and we have now managed to overcome that the difficulties. The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the transitional period during which it is envisaged that the company from the reserve theatre in Cyprus might be deployed in Iraq. That is of the order of six weeks in operational terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_37">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the police in Basra and infiltration. In any theatre of combat in the world where competing factions have been at war with each other, there is always a problem of split loyalties when rehabilitating and restructuring the police force afterwards. The question is not whether those split loyalties exist, but whether we can diminish them by human rights training and training the police to be as objective as possible. Wherever we look in the world, we find that policing is very often the last nut to be cracked. Incidentally, that applies in our own country, as well as in Bosnia or anywhere else. However, although there are certain elements in the police service in Iraq about whom we ought to be worried, I would not want him to believe that that is the majority or anything like it. Let us remember that every time Iraqi policemen put on their uniforms in the morning, they go out to face the threat of death. Many of them have died leading

<a name="stpa_43">The hon. Gentleman says that the situation in Iraq is getting worse, but that is not a true picture. The situation is getting better in terms of the development of democratic agreement and institutions. The Iraqis have achieved in 14&nbsp;months what it has taken this country several centuries to do, namely, to reach a general agreement on the disposition of devolved powers versus central powers and the coming together of the ethnic groups. That has taken something like several hundred years in this country, so let us give them credit for that. Previous combatants have come together to forget all their previous difficulties and to try to reach a conclusion.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_44">The Iraqis have also made great progress&#151;it is not getting worse&#151;in their own security, which is the second objective. Despite everything that the terrorists are doing, the Iraqi security forces are becoming better trained, are more capable and are getting better and greater numbers than ever before.
</p>

<a name="51010-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_45">The Iraqis are making some social and economic advances. They are not as fast as I would like&#151;I fully admit that&#151;because of terrorist activity, but there is a little more electricity than there was, a little more opportunity than there was and something like 240&nbsp;hospitals are now operating that previously were not. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of kids are being vaccinated and a large number of schools are being rehabilitated, so there is some advance.

<a name="stpa_47">I think that we should paint a balanced picture, giving credit to the democrats and the vast majority in Iraq rather than concentrating on the evil successes of those who are trying to destroy things.

In all honesty, I have tried to do that today, and that is what we have done all along and will stick to. When the Iraqis have the capability and desire for us to go, we will go, but what we will not do is cut and run from the terrorists

I hope that all hon. Members agree with that. The right hon.

We have welcomed Iran&#039;s public line of supporting the Iraqi elections and the efforts to support and build a constructive relationship with the new Iraqi Administration.

 We must not forget the important role being carried out in the area by the Royal Navy. I pay tribute to the ship&#039;s company of HMS Campbeltown, who I visited on station recently. They are protecting important oil installations. One observation that I made during the visit was that if we are to help develop the economy of Iraq, it is important that we re-establish some of the other routes that existed for exporting oil from that country. Is my right hon. Friend satisfied that sufficient engineering skill is being put in place by the oil industry in this difficult time to ensure that that happens?

 My hon. Friend is always a great defender of the senior service, and on this occasion he is absolutely right: maritime security is very important in the situation in which we find ourselves. I know that there are difficulties in acquiring sufficient skills and personnel in zones that are regarded as hazardous or threatening and in war zones. Part of our challenge is to make sure that despite all the terrorists&#039; efforts the social and economic framework is sufficiently secure to attract engineers and others with the skills that my hon.

 Yes, on both counts. There is no doubt in my mind that what is going on Iraq is not just a local tactical battle, important though it is to win that battle for the Iraqi people. It is probably, at the moment, the most important battlefield of a strategic nature between those who wish to impose a religious dictatorship not only on large sections of the middle east but further afield and those who believe that Arab peoples and Muslims are as entitled to democratic self-determination as anyone else. If the Iraqi people build, in an Arab Muslim state in the middle east, their own form of democracy and safeguard it, it will be a major strategic blow to the terrorists. If, on the other hand, the terrorists succeed in stopping that happening, it will be a major success for the terrorists. The terrorists understand the strategic nature of this battle. The hon.

I believe, the Government believe, and I hope that the House believes that those who happen to be Arabs or Muslims have no less right than people in this country to democratic self-determination of their future. As they grasp that right to self-determination, to build democratic institutions in their own shape, as well as the security forces to protect them, and to achieve greater prosperity for their people, we should stand beside them. There will be difficulties, perhaps even greater than those we face now if the terrorists have their way, but we will see our way through those difficulties and stand by the Iraqi people.

Violence is increasing and my worry is that we will end up with Iraq moving towards civil war or, alternatively, British forces and others will be in Iraq for an awfully long time unless more autonomy is given, not only geographically but politically, to the three distinct grouping to which I have referred.

Does he think that it was merely an aberration that on 19&nbsp;September our soldiers were handed over to private militias?

I had the privilege of spending some time with them as a younger MP under the armed forces parliamentary scheme, so I suppose that in some terrible way, they are responsible for my being at the Dispatch Box. I cannot think of better people to send into dangerous situations. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s third question was about the percentage of British troops who have been in Iraq. The number of British troops who have been there is about 90,000. We are now on the seventh roulement. With all taken into account, a large number of people have gone through it. When we see the headlines about this or that case of alleged brutality or alleged misdemeanour, let us remember that against some 90,000&nbsp;troops who have served in Iraq there have been about 160&nbsp;allegations, of which substance has been found to about 15&nbsp;or 20. That puts the matter into perspective. Given the number of troops, it is right and to be expected that we would come back to the Parachute Regiment again, but of course many others are being deployed as well.

As the position gets better in terms of democracy, security forces and economic development, we can expect the terrorists to get more frenetic and more frantic.

<a name="stpa_66">On Saturday 8&nbsp;October, just before nine o&#039;clock in the morning Pakistan time, an earthquake struck measuring 7.6&nbsp;on the Richter scale. Its epicentre was in the area of Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, about 95&nbsp;kilometres north-east of Islamabad. It caused widespread damage and a significant number of deaths and injuries.

The latest official figures indicate that 20,000&nbsp;people have lost their lives and 44,000&nbsp;have been injured. However, given the scale of the destruction and the fact that some areas have not yet been reached, the number of deaths is expected to rise further. There have also been a small number of deaths reported in Afghanistan, and 750&nbsp;people now confirmed dead in north India, although unconfirmed reports indicate a significantly higher loss of life there, with 80&nbsp;per cent. of houses in Uri and the surrounding district severely damaged. India has not sought international assistance. The greatest loss of life, however, has been caused by the devastation in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province. Conditions there are difficult for relief workers, with bad weather and problems with access and communications due to landslides. Fifty per cent. of the buildings in Muzaffarabad and 60&nbsp;per cent. in Balakot appear to have been destroyed.

The first RAPID search and rescue team was deployed to a collapsed tower block in Islamabad to help look for survivors. The second RAPID team and CANIS, with dog support, later joined it.

<a name="stpa_89">I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern for the children of the affected region. One thing that is happening immediately is that the search and rescue teams in Muzaffarabad are trying to find the children in the schools. They were first directed to those schools when they arrived, because parents in the local community are desperately worried about those who may still be trapped and can be rescued. I undertake to consider that in the decisions that we reach about funding the UN flash appeal, which, as I say, we expect later today or early tomorrow. Let me tell the House that we will make a significant contribution. I will consider what particularly we can do for children, but their needs for blankets, tents, water and medical supplies are the same as those of their parents and families.

I spoke to the team just before coming to the House. The reports show that the co-ordination is not working badly, bearing in mind the fact that this is a major emergency that is putting great stress and strain on the Government of Pakistan in particular. I am anxious, as ever, that we learn the lessons. There is a premium on good information, because it ensures that the help that is being offered can be sent to the right places as quickly as possible.

Gentleman makes a very good suggestion about leaders of the Muslim and Kashmiri community. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will shortly organise a meeting to talk to them. One of the ways in which we will provide support is through our offer to the Disasters Emergency Committee relief agencies to fund the flight. If any smaller community organisations have things that they wish to get there, they can link up with one of the DEC bodies to get them on to the flight, and the Government will pick up the transportation costs.

Just under half of that will come from the United Kingdom. Several other countries that attended expressed support for the principle and are waiting to see what the arrangements will be. I am hopeful that by the middle of next year we will have a fund up and running, which I called for last December. That will mean that in such circumstances the UN has the money to get on with the job while the rest of us pitch in and help.

</p>

<a name="51010-12_para21">
<a name="stpa_99">The Secretary of State did not answer the question that the hon.

<a name="stpa_101">May I probe the Secretary of State a little more about the co-ordination of assistance? The hon.

In answer, the Secretary of State referred to the co-ordination of assistance in the emergency that we are considering. However, he will know that the Red Cross reported last week that rivalries between hundreds of groups and perceptions of corruption and the politicisation of aid has led to the duplication of effort in some areas and a failure to get the aid to those most in need when responding to such emergencies. Does the Secretary of State agree that the United Nations&#039; capacity must be built up so that it is better able to respond to the support and co-ordination of emergency relief through the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and its agents?

<a name="stpa_104">I am of course aware of the security concerns. The incident to which the hon. Gentleman referred was on the Indian side of the line of control. So far, there is no indication that the fact that this is a sensitive and difficult region has got in the way of the relief effort. Indeed, our experience in Aceh in Indonesia, which was similarly plagued by conflict, showed that when a disaster of this magnitude strikes, people tend to put all that on one side and get on with the task in hand, which is to help people who are in need.

<a name="51010-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_105">I have not spoken to the Kashmir International Relief Fund, but I will find out whether my officials have done so and let the hon. Gentleman know. The Red Cross report, to which the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) alluded, is an important piece of work. There was particular concern about the number of small relief organisations coming in, but I would just say that the United Nations disaster team has deployed eight people. They have established on-site operations co-ordination centres in both Islamabad and Muzaffarabad, and we are working closely with them and with the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs to ensure that there is effective co-ordination on the ground.

<a name="51010-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_106">I completely agree with the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) about the capacity of the United Nations system. Indeed, the proposals that I and others have made are precisely to strengthen that capacity, not only through a fund&#151;which will mean that it does not have to wait for the hat to be passed round in order to respond immediately&#151;but through strengthening the quality and capacity of humanitarian co-ordinators, because dealing with this kind of an emergency is a very different task from being the resident co-ordinator. I have also proposed that we introduce benchmarks by which we can measure our progress in responding to emergency needs. There will no doubt be lessons from this disaster that we can put into the work that we and others are undertaking.

 I am also grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement and to the Government for their prompt response in a variety of practical ways, which is what people need. In particular, I notice that President Musharraf asked for helicopters, and that helicopters have been provided. Speed of response to these disasters is crucial, and one of the most anguishing aspects of this one was hearing tales of children crying in the ruins and people not being able to get to them in time. Is there anything that we can do to achieve an even more rapid response in future? Does the Secretary of State also recognise that, after the initial response, the economy of Pakistan will face a major rebuilding challenge? Will that lead to a review of DFID policies and DFID aid programmes in Pakistan and Kashmir?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions. We always need to ensure that we get search and rescue teams to a disaster as quickly as possible. As I have said, the first international team to arrive was from the UK, and it was one of the biggest teams. It went out there within a very short period of time, and many other search and rescue teams are now arriving from around the world. They are being deployed to the areas in need. I pay tribute to the speed with which our teams got themselves to East Midlands airport and on to those planes. Of course, we shall review our programme. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have a substantial programme in Pakistan: &#163;74&nbsp;million this year. As well as committing resources to the relief effort we shall of course do the same for reconstruction, but that is a little way off. For now, we shall concentrate on immediate assistance.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51010-13_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 What we have funded at the moment are the emergency health and trauma kits to which I referred earlier. On Saturday, the World Health Organisation put out an appeal for $500,000-worth of assistance and the UK picked up half the cost of that. We did that straight away on the first day. I have no doubt that when the UN flash appeal comes out shortly there will be a request for support to provide that kind of assistance. It may be helpful if I tell the House that there were two hospitals in Muzaffarabad. One was destroyed; the other is functioning but is severely overstretched and I understand that a French field hospital is on its way to provide help to the people there.

 The argument for a substantially enlarged UN disaster emergency fund is

Which G8&nbsp;member states have yet to sign up to the Secretary of State&#039;s excellent idea? It must now be unassailable and there can be no excuse, certainly for G8&nbsp;countries not to dig deep into their pockets to support that initiative.

 I will send the hon. Gentleman a list of the countries. To be fair, some G8&nbsp;countries present at the meeting support the idea but are waiting to see exactly what the management arrangements will be. He and I, and many others, think this a good idea; it is timely and if it was in place we could move even faster. We have learned the lessons and the fact that there is now support for the fund means, I hope, that in the future the UN will be able to respond even quicker. It would certainly have helped in Niger.

 The devastating earthquake in south Asia has wiped out whole communities in many places. Tens of thousands of people have lost their lives. Millions of people have been made homeless.

Where can we obtain the blankets, the tents, the medical supplies, the food, the water, the shelter, the heavy digging equipment and the helicopters? That is the issue. We are responding to the requests that have come to us. As I said, we shall fund significantly the UN appeal when it comes out. It is important for the House to recognise that the issue is the practical help that we give, not the sums pledged at the beginning. Britain has an honourable tradition, but some countries pledge large sums yet six months later we find that not all of that money was spent. I am much more interested in concentrating on the practical work in hand, which is turning the passion, commitment and desire of the British people to help into practical assistance on the ground. That is what we did in the first 48&nbsp;hours and that is exactly what we shall carry on doing.

 Many of us have Pakistani constituents who come from Kashmir, particularly Mirpur. As yet, I have not been able to find out what impact the earthquake has had on Mirpur. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend could inform me of that. My other concern is that, long before the earthquake, there were many homeless people in the area around Muzaffarabad owing to its proximity to the line of control. They were in displaced persons camps or in refugee camps. I wonder what their position is now.
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51010-14_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The worst of the damage has clearly been around Muzaffarabad, Balakot and those parts around the epicentre. I think that the damage in Mirpur has been less extensive. I will find out whether we have further details that I can give to my hon. Friend. I am not aware of the position of those who were living in the refugee camps around the town, but from the pictures that I have seen and the reports that we have, I am sure that the damage is pretty extensive and that they have been badly affected, along with all the other residents of the town.

 Clearly, the initial search and rescue operation and the speed of our response have been excellent, but does the Secretary of State recall the correspondence that we had quite a few months ago about constituents of mine who went as volunteers into areas that had been devastated by the tsunami only to find that no aid whatsoever for reconstruction had got through months after those vast sums had been raised? Therefore, the report should not have come as a surprise to any of us. Can he suggest measures that will address that concern, which has been expressed from every corner of the House?
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51010-14_spnew9"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. The issue is partly about ensuring that the right relief supplies come, and I made that point earlier. If things are sent that are not immediately needed, they may rest on one side while more important things pass on their way through. There may be bureaucratic obstacles, but the UN team and, I am sure, the co-ordinating office of the Prime Minister of Pakistan will be working very hard to ensure that they do not happen. A practical example of that here in the United Kingdom is that the Pakistan high commission has set up emergency arrangements for issuing visas for people from Britain who want to travel to Pakistan and Kashmir quickly. I applaud it for what it has done. We will keep the situation under very close review. If difficulties arise, we will do our best to have them sorted out. It is important that we learn the lessons.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51010-14_spnew11"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 We have not had any requests as far as I am aware, but I am told that one of the consequences of the construction of the buildings is that the walls tend to fall outwards when an earthquake strikes and the roofs come in. People will understandably be reluctant to go back into buildings that have been damaged even though they may appear to be standing. We will consider all such requests, but I think that they will come in time. The immediate priority is to get shelter to people who need it and who are out in the cold.

 Many Members on both sides of the House will have constituents who are waiting to hear accurate information about what has happened to their friends and loved ones.

 Many people, and not just those with Indian and Pakistani family backgrounds, will be grateful to my right hon. Friend for his words and the speed of his action. We know that many of the rural communities affected are extremely distant and that access to them is extremely difficult even under normal circumstances. Although it is early days, can a long-term plan be developed to make sure that the helicopters and air transport remain? With winter approaching and what we believe to be the destruction of residences, it will be a long time before people can be guaranteed to be adequately and properly secured from the effects of the winter elements.
</p>








<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51010-14_spnew15"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The main helicopter capacity, of course, comes from the Pakistan military, but the Americans have offered five Chinooks and three Black Hawks that will arrive today. The five Chinooks offer significant heavy-lift capability, and we saw in Indonesia that they will remain for as long as necessary to make sure that relief supplies are moved. At the same time, work continues to get the roads clear, but I know that access is difficult to the most remote communities. Together with the UN, we will continue to look at whether further helicopter support is required to ensure that relief supplies and other things that are needed for reconstruction can get to the most remote communities as they are accessed. However, we must recognise that some parts have not yet been reached by rescuers.

</p>








<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51010-15_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind words. The support that we are providing and that we will continue to provide, including through our response to the UN appeal when it is issued, is designed to try to ensure that we get support to all the areas affected. Clearly some of the towns are easier to reach in the first instance, but it is very important that the relief effort then spreads out into the countryside. Like many other Members, the hon. Gentleman knows that the geography is very difficult, but we just have to keep up the effort to make sure that help reaches all the people who need it.

 May I also commend my right hon. Friend on the efforts that he has made? He was right to praise the Pakistan high commission for setting up the emergency visa facility. Our entry clearance operation in Islamabad is hardly the best in the world at the moment. Will he consider speaking to the Foreign Secretary about deploying to Islamabad some of the entry clearance officers who are currently in the Gulf, who are not overburdened by the number of applications being made there, to help the processing of not only ongoing legitimate immigration cases, but, as the hon.

<a name="stpa_109">We have been talking about helicopters, but I have to tell the Secretary of State that based on information that I have picked up, there is still a desperate need for more helicopters. Aid can reach areas such as Islamabad, but places such as Muzaffarabad, Bagh and Rawala Kot are accessible only by helicopter. Unless we have more helicopters, the aid effort simply will not happen. Will the Secretary of State reassure me that the request for more helicopters will be considered? I believe that we are talking about a 10&nbsp;to 15-year reconstruction programme and that we are in there for the long haul. What is his view about that?

 My hon. Friend has experienced the terror of the earthquake at first hand and I join him in paying tribute to the work of the RAPID team, which is doing an extremely professional job. As I indicated earlier, in addition to the American helicopters that have been provided today, NATO is considering that very point. We are examining what more we might be able to do and an appeal has gone out through the European Union&#151;we have done that as its presidency. I am conscious of the need for such further support and agree that a long-term commitment to reconstruction will be required. We have a programme in Pakistan that has been rapidly increasing in size in recent years. I assure my hon.

From speaking to those involved in the charitable effort this morning, I know that they will be grateful for the Secretary of State&#039;s offer to fund flights for the relief operation. However, to echo the comments made by the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik), people stress that their relatives tell them that access to remote areas is still the priority, as the Secretary of State mentioned, and that there is a desperate need for air transport. Will he please consider making further air transport mechanisms available?

 I certainly will. We will continue, along with others in the international community, to ensure that we provide the resources that are needed.

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51010-15_spnew11"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 On the one hand, the advice is that the relief effort is the priority, as my hon. Friend outlines. On the other hand, I think about my family being in that situation and understand why people would want to go. We must respect the decisions that individuals make. As I said, the Red Cross is trying to establish a tracing service. If people do go, perhaps they could bear in mind the need to give priority to the relief effort, given that transport is scarce. However, I understand why people are doing everything that they can to discover what has happened to their loved ones.

<a name="stpa_113">The group of amendments tabled in my name and by others addresses the heart of the Bill. Everyone, including the Secretary of State, accepts that this is to some extent a hotchpotch of a Bill. It has no great coherent form; it contains a group of half-concocted measures that do not quite come together into a serious regime. Following the deliberations in Committee, which were so ably conducted by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), the amendments are an attempt to introduce more cogency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_114">The amendments largely define the way in which the Bill will work in practice in terms of noise and emissions, turning it from a simple enabling Bill into something more focused. The amendments also cover the growing problem of consumer concern about the monitoring of flights at night and the wall of silence faced by many people on the ground when investigating the problem of noise above them, particularly at night.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_115">Amendment No. 1&nbsp;is a rather sly wolf in sheep&#039;s clothing. It would remove clause 2(2), which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;In subsection (3) for &#039;limit the number of occasions on which they make take off or land,&#039; substitute &#039;impose limits or other restrictions relating to aircraft taking off or landing,&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_116">That specifically removes from the Secretary of State&#039;s duties the stipulation to determine the number of flights at designated airports that may or may not take place at night, and replaces the number of flights with various other stipulations, particularly concerning noise and emissions. At first sight that seems logical, and the argument will be that as noise and emissions improve, the number of flights will become less relevant. However, beneath that seeming logic lies a severe danger that those who live under the flight path of an airport will experience many more flights at night, which despite the noise and emissions stipulations will be no less disturbing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_117">Such an argument contains a fallacy of methodology. Decibels alone are not a measure of nuisance. Occasions of noise&#151;undercarriages going down and the roar of engines that do not necessarily break the decibel barrier&#151;wake people up. We are facing, especially for designated airports and given the underlying concept perhaps for many other airports that are expanding at the moment, a depressing and unpoliced regime for the growth of flights at night.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;as aircraft become less noisy this would be likely to lead to more flights within the same noise quota limit and there would be no real benefit to the local community; particularly, in rural areas&quot;.</p>

The noise is felt strongly because in an area where there is less ambient noise, the noise of an aircraft, however quiet, is more noticeable than it would be in an urban area. The argument against noise quotas continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;a movements limit can be easily understood by most people and is far more transparent and open to validation as compared to a noise quota limit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a movements limit provides particular protection for people who live very close to the airport&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and who are especially troubled by ground noise at night.&quot;</p>

The Civil Aviation Authority says that it is duty bound to implement policy, not to answer specific questions and noise complaints. What we have is an extremely fragmented system in which public agencies with a public duty are failing to respond to the legitimate concerns of people who are disturbed by night flights. Even I, a Member of Parliament, get the runaround.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_124">To be fair, within such an unproductive and fragmented regime it is not easy for an airport to determine to its own satisfaction whether it is responsible. Nottingham East Midlands airport, which I visited at night only three weeks ago, has within its remit and control a fairly narrow air traffic control area, but it receives into that area flights that may be deviating slightly from the recommended flight path. What the airport calls its presentation profile of aircraft therefore lands it with a problem for which it is not necessarily to blame.

<a name="stpa_125">In the context of massive environmental concern, there is no confidence that individuals can have their complaints dealt with properly and honestly. It may be that all are being dealt with honestly, but that is not how it seems. No records are properly kept for long enough; it is quite difficult to backtrace an individual aircraft and work out whose it was, at what height it was flying and at what speed it was going. In my view, a better regime, which I have mentioned to the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), on many occasions, must be established if there is to be any confidence in the new regime that is being created.

To persuade the Minister, I hope, that I am being absolutely reasonable in tabling the new clause, I thought that a good model for setting up a monitoring system was that of the ombudsman, where we go through the filter of a Member of Parliament. In many instances, the process is automatically ticking the box and sending on the complaint.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I have omitted to say that one can have an imbalanced regime of charges that can deliberately skew the economic benefits or appeal of Stansted compared with Heathrow and Gatwick. There is deep concern in the aviation world that within the Bill are provisions from which will emerge decisions and a regime that will create an artificial case for the expansion of Stansted.

 I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 19&nbsp;and 21, which were tabled in my name. Amendment No. 19&nbsp;relates to the fixing of charges imposed on aircraft operators who breach noise and emission requirements. It seeks to ensure that the local authority in whose area the airport is situated is in agreement with the scheme that has been designed. Amendment No. 21, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) said, seeks to delete clause 2, which attempts to substitute quota counts for the existing numerical limits on air traffic movements at designated airports. Without my amendment No. 19, the Bill could be a polluters&#039; charter, because airport managers can write their own rules and set their own noise levels, as was debated as some length on Second Reading. I will not repeat the thrust of that debate, but no other industry has been handed such a licence. It is like asking the breweries to tackle alcoholism, or the fast food industry to tackle obesity. No other industry has been handed a charter to set its own pollution levels and no other industry is allowed by law&#151;as would be the case if the Bill were enacted&#151;to ignore the local authority and the local community. No other industry is given such immunity from the law.

Unfortunately, the Minister, or perhaps her predecessor, did not give sufficient weight to independent reports that say that night-time noise and the penalty regimes associated with it are intolerable and unacceptable. Nottingham East Midlands airport, which is owned by the Manchester Airports Group, has already drafted a noise control scheme in the form of a 10-point plan, and it intends to double night-time noise. Its version of a noise control scheme is designed to increase the number of aircraft movements without having any regard to noise and without any care for the community. I would be concerned if my amendment No. 19&nbsp;were not incorporated in the Bill.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman both for his contributions to these debates in the Chamber and outside and for allowing me to intervene. I agree with his hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) that if we limit the controlling authority to the local district council, we will run into exactly the same problems that we have experienced with the planning of ground developments at the airport. Surely, if we are to deal with Nottingham East Midlands airport, which has considerable financial weight, we need an organisation as big as the county council, which is equally equipped. At a later date, would he consider moving local control from the district council to the county council, as we will achieve a better result that way?

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="51010-19_spnew4"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 As I suggested in my response to my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), that is probably a worthwhile improvement. Indeed, the amendment refers to &quot;the local authority&quot; without specifying which local authority, so the county council may be the appropriate body in certain circumstances. I fear that Manchester Airports Group or other organisations that own regional airports could use the powers in the Bill in an unacceptable way. The residents of Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are distant from the shareholders and council tax payers in Manchester so, in this case, the pollution starts far from home. We need a locally accountable and responsible group to intervene on communities&#039; behalf. All the residents&#039; groups with which I have had contact about Nottingham East Midlands airport are alarmed about the lack of external accountability and are disappointed that it is not yet part of the Bill, as my amendment proposes.

<a name="stpa_147">The Government have repeatedly refused to designate Nottingham East Midlands airport, and my amendment compensates for that failure to act. The mantra of local solutions for local problems suggests that there should be a local agreement between the various parties&#151;the airport, the communities, local authorities and airport users&#151;but, in practice, that does not occur. The Bill does not create the environment for a local agreement. It provides the power for the airport to impose its will in certain circumstances. It disfranchises the residents and disempowers the local authority. That is what I am trying to tackle in the amendment.

I do not think that it will, particularly if the airport designs and imposes an unacceptable regime.

Imposition by the airport, as anticipated in the amendment, without the involvement of a local authority, perhaps the county council, will not be a solution.

<a name="stpa_151">Amendment No. 21, the second of the amendments that I tabled, deals with the quota count system. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton made a fair summary of the weaknesses of that approach. It professes to be a regime that will encourage the uptake of quieter aircraft, but its numerous shortcomings allow far more planes to fly at night while maintaining the same so-called noise climate. Although the planes may indeed be marginally quieter, it is the number of noise events, rather than a few decibels more or less, that causes the misery of sleep deprivation to residents living under flight paths. No matter what regime is designed and developed, it is essential that the cap on numbers of movements which exists in designated airports is retained. The Bill as currently worded merely enables the Secretary of State to set a limit based on noise rather than movements.

If they are not, and as the Bill seeks to set aside any responsibility to reveal night flight numbers, clearly the suspicion arises that someone is or could be trying to hide something.

<a name="51010-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_192">There is another way forward and I shall sum it up briefly. It is to maintain and extend the use of air movements as the basic tool for controlling airport development and noise and emissions impact and to require the Secretary of State to limit air movements from individual airports. Below those limits, we can encourage quieter aircraft by additional noise controls on individual planes and also by awarding incentives through the allocation of landing slots to types of plane and companies that perform well in reducing noise and emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_193">The Government&#039;s proposals will result in the creeping up of the number of flights at Heathrow and elsewhere. There will be no improvement in noise or emission controls and there will, yet again, be a betrayal of the communities surrounding Heathrow.

<a name="51010-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_194">New clause 6&nbsp;would place a duty on the Secretary of State to act in providing insulation protection to constituents on whom aircraft noise had an impact. The Secretary of State already has power under the Land Compensation Act 1973&nbsp;to introduce legislation on noise insulation, yet no regulations have been enacted. We are asking for a limit, so that a year after the Bill is enacted the Secretary of State would act on that important matter. It is another way of reassuring people that the Government are on their side and are trying to protect their interests rather than merely driving through a growth in aviation no matter what the environmental and social impact may be.

There should be consideration of the environmental impact of moving towards quieter aircraft at the expense of increased emissions. Many Members have referred to the fact that using Leq as a measurement of sound is not responsive to changes in the number of flights, so communities have serious doubts about its appropriateness.

Quite clearly, there has not been a predict-and-provide policy in aviation. Had there been such a policy, there would be much more capacity in both the south-east and the rest of the country. Part of the aviation industry has been restrained in its growth, and the Government have made it clear in the White Paper that such things are down to commercial decisions, not to any predict-and-provide approach by them.

That has been a real mistake. Sometimes the promises have been made the wrong way and been kept, and that must be recognised. The whole country would have benefited if there had been no agreement, whenever it was made, to stop a second runway being built at Gatwick until 2017. So some damaging agreements have been made and kept. I recognise that, at each phase in the development of Heathrow, people have said, &quot;No more&quot;, but they were mistaken in doing so, partly because the real economic balance, not just for the people who live around the airport but for the whole United Kingdom, is to maintain Heathrow as one of the premier airports in the world.

At the other end of the runway lies Styal, which is a much more affluent village in Cheshire where virtually every window displayed a &quot;Stop the second runway&quot; sticker. However, when we interviewed people individually, we found that a small majority was in favour of the runway because they could see the economic benefits.

 I shall be brief. I could have made my remarks by intervening during the speech of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), but he had to cope with a large number of interventions and I did not want to disrupt his speech any more than was necessary. None the less, I was astonished when he said that noise was lessening. Biggin Hill airport, the famous airfield from which many of the few flew in the second world war, is in my constituency. It now deals largely not with scheduled flights, but executive flights and so forth. Although I accept that many individual aeroplanes are much quieter than they were, we must consider the sheer multiplicity and expansion of ordinary flights to small airports such as Biggin Hill.

<a name="51010-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_220">Many flights are taking place on the shoulder of the times at which they are allowed to take place. Many flights requiring special permission are undertaken by the Ministry of Defence. More flights take place at a lower level than they used to, with flights over Biggin Hill being affected by the change to the pattern of flights over Heathrow. All those factors mean that my constituents have experienced a considerable increase in the noise around such a typical small airfield.

That forward planning was intended, in part, to give people living near to airports some clarity about how their local circumstances might change in future and to enable planning to deal with the environmental impacts of air transport. We do not deny that such impacts exist, although advances in technology have delivered quieter aircraft and noise abatement operational processes, such as continuous descent approach, have been developed. Both those points came out strongly from the characteristically excellent speeches made by my hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) and for Crawley (Laura Moffatt). Night noise and daytime contours have been maintained, or even reduced, at some major airports, despite the growth in movement numbers. I hope that we all realise that such growth is not just about an abstract of economic benefit, but about real jobs and wealth and maintaining the UK&#039;s competitiveness.

<br>&nbsp;<br>little about Nottingham East Midlands airport because the concerns of hon. Members from in and around the area served by it have been at the forefront of our debates on Second Reading, in Committee and today. NEMA has been held up as an example of why the Government should not trust airport operators to deal with noise complaints themselves. However, I shall first discuss the general principles of new clause 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_225">I have some sympathy with the aim of identifying aircraft for the purpose of responding to noise complaints. I understand the frustration that people may feel when it is not possible to identify a plane that has disturbed them, although that is generally unlikely to be due to a lack of will on an airport&#039;s part. It might be helpful if I recap for hon. Members who were not Committee members the availability of flight data and where the data are held. There is no single comprehensive source of information and no complete record of all flights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_226">Most large airports, such as the London airports and NEMA, operate a noise and track-keeping system. That is specific to the airport&#039;s movements and is usually limited to a range of approximately 25&nbsp;miles. Complainants can call or write to an airport with details of the date and time when they were disturbed. The airport can then provide details, such as the height of the aircraft, its operator and its destination. As most commercial aircraft fly at their lowest, and are thus at their loudest, on approach and departure, most complaints relate to aircraft within an airport&#039;s noise and track-keeping system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_227">There is a competitive market for air traffic control service provision at airports. National Air Traffic Services is responsible for providing en-route air traffic control for flights in corridors from 5,000&nbsp;ft up to 24,500&nbsp;ft, 20&nbsp;miles from their arrival and departure airports. All air traffic control providers are responsible for providing that service for those flights that operate only in controlled airspace, which is made up of terminal control areas surrounding the major airports and airways that link the control areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_228">Air traffic control providers may retain radar records for 30&nbsp;days to facilitate the investigation of incidents. It would take them some time to do individual checks if asked to do so, and they could only provide height information. If available, they might be able to say what the destination and point of departure had been, but they would not be able to identify the operator or aircraft type. It would be up to the person complaining to have sufficient information on the incident in question and to ask for the information promptly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_229">However, flights in uncontrolled airspace are not compelled to receive an air traffic control service. Nor are they required to notify the flight for the purpose of receiving permission to fly in such airspace. Consequently, flight data are often not available for such flights. Nor is it easy to estimate aircraft heights accurately, even for trained observers. An aircraft that might be assumed to have come from a particular airport may have come from elsewhere and be flying much higher than the observer believes. It may seem to complainants that an airport does not try hard enough to identify the aircraft that disturbs them or is too quick to say that it is not one of theirs, but there is no

The airport is now fully committed to responding effectively. It knows that it needs to be a considerate neighbour to local residents. It is to undertake a comprehensive review of its complaints procedures; it is recruiting staff for a new customer relations department to improve the speed and quality of its handling of complaints; and it plans a new noise compensation scheme.

 The Minister is right to note that there have been attempts at improvement, and noise preferential routes have had an effect. However, is she aware that her predecessor, together with the airport, imposed the 10-point plan that is the framework within which the airport operates? The relevant local authorities and community groups in the area were not in favour and thought it a weak and relatively toothless document.
</p>








<p><a name="st_237"><a name="51010-28_spnew1"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I am aware of the 10-point plan and that not everyone is satisfied with it. I am extremely conscious that even now not everyone is happy with NEMA&#039;s performance, despite the improvements. We need to continue to bear down on it, to work with it and to ensure that the improvements continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_232">The continuous descent approach, which seeks to minimise the noise of arriving flights, is achieved by 70&nbsp;per cent. of aircraft. However, NEMA is not complacent. It is aware that it has to keep driving for even better performance. It has indicated that it wishes to take advantage of the noise control powers proposed in clause 4&nbsp;to take tougher local action to protect the noise environment. I do not doubt that it will.

The results of a recently announced MORI poll, described by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, clearly show majority support for the airport in its locality and that concern about its impact on noise centred on those areas affected by recent routing changes. It is true that the airspace change at NEMA means that some people are overflown more frequently than before, and those people will, of course, be dissatisfied with that state of affairs, but I ask hon. Members to remember that overall the route changes have significantly reduced the number of people overflown at a height that is likely to cause disturbance.

<p><a name="st_238"><a name="51010-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 As a frequent visitor to the airport, I meet the authorities regularly. The Bill gives them powers to fine operators and to establish their own noise control environment without a process for auditing whether that is an appropriate scheme for noise control or for penalties. Why did the Government decide to evade any independent process and leave it entirely to any airport, not just NEMA, that is not designated?
</p>








<p><a name="st_239"><a name="51010-28_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 We reserved the right to designate airports and to intervene if they fail in their duty to bear down on noise and to act as good neighbours. However, as a starting point&#151;this is not a new position, but a longstanding policy of Governments of both political colours&#151;it is for the local airport to work with its local partners to ensure that there is a local solution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_235">In our White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, the Government signalled their support for growth of NEMA strategic night freight business, but that was not unconditional. We said that it would need to be accompanied by stringent controls on night noise, in particular, and increasingly generous noise insulation and other mitigation measures. That remains our position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_236">There have been calls to designate NEMA, as demonstrated in the last two interventions, by highlighting the number of night flights compared to those at the designated London airports, but it cannot be compared on an equal basis with the designated London airports. It serves a different market and the nature of operations is not the same. Nor should it be assumed that should the airport be designated there would be more stringent controls on noise or night flying than those already in place or planned by the airport operator itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_237">The provisions in clause 4, which, as I said, NEMA intends to make use of, will place beyond all doubt the power of airport operators to establish and enforce both noise abatement operational procedures and operating restrictions for their airports. Putting responsibility for those aspects of the balanced approach to addressing aircraft noise in the hands of airports rightly gives them the incentive to manage and respond to local pressures. It must be right that individual airports should lead in deciding what elements of the balanced approach best provide the right solution in the light of local circumstances.
</p>








<p><a name="st_240"><a name="51010-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 I want to get absolute clarity. My hon.

Is that correct?

 There is a range of different measures&#151;the relationship that the airport will have with its operators and local community through its consultative committee, and the powers of the Secretary of State to intervene&#151;but the default position is that it is better for those airports to work out local solutions to local problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_238">Airports already take action to encourage and drive airlines to improve their operational noise performance. That has been working well. For example, more than 95&nbsp;per cent. of flights at Manchester stick to noise preferential routes, and the percentage is even higher at Heathrow. Clearly, that has not happened by accident, but reflects the fact that airports are willing and able to work with airlines to improve their performance. Achieving adherence to noise preferential routes requires investment in procedures and training, which have a cost and time commitment associated with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_239">Monitoring and managing noise is a crucial part of the day-to-day operational business of airports. We expect them to pay careful attention to that and to manage their responsibility with suitable professionalism and integrity. They know that it is important to retain the faith and good will of local communities.

 No. I have taken several interventions and have a number of points to work through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_240">Under section 76&nbsp;of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, an aircraft flying at a reasonable height and in accordance with the provisions of the air navigation order or the rules of the air cannot be subject to legal action for trespass or causing a nuisance. That important principle has been part of UK civil aviation law since the earliest days of commercial aviation, and it has been upheld by successive Governments. Even if a commercial flights officer were able to identify flights from the often limited information that members of the public could provide, further action against the operator of that flight could be taken only if it had not been following air traffic control instructions&#151;assuming, of course, that it was in controlled airspace at the time. It therefore seems to me that the additional regulatory burden that the creation of a commercial flights officer would impose on air traffic control providers in particular would far outweigh whatever limited additional benefit would result from his office, given that this would not involve any powers of enforcement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_241">I realise that that may sound unsympathetic. I understand the annoyance felt by members of the public when they are disturbed by aircraft noise, and their wish to know who has caused that disturbance, but I remain of the view that the right way to seek to achieve that is through the local airport, and that the industry should focus on keeping aircraft noise to a minimum and mitigating its effects.

However, in reality it seems unlikely to me that an airport would choose to alienate its customers by introducing new measures without reasonable notice, although clearly it has to balance this with the legitimate expectations of those living around the airport that measures will be introduced without undue delay. Any period of notice would inevitably need to reflect the complexity of the arrangements being introduced. If an airline felt that it was disadvantaged by the introduction of a charging regime at unreasonably short notice, the remedy of legal challenge would be open to it. I am sure that airports will have regard to International Civil Aviation Organisation guidance that noise-related charges should be non-discriminatory between users and should not be established at such levels as to be prohibitively high for the operation of certain aircraft.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is technical stuff.

I do not believe that that would be an appropriate requirement. The levels of noise and emission at an aerodrome may vary for reasons other than the imposition of charges; for example, because of changes in the type of aircraft using the airport due to changes in the local economy, or improvements in operational practice driven by an airline operator&#039;s wish to improve fuel efficiency.

One of these involved giving local authorities a role in non-designated airports&#039; noise amelioration measures. Amendment No. 19&nbsp;has a similar intent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="51010-29_spnew9"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_255"><a name="51010-29_spnew10"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 No, I have nearly finished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_252">Our conclusion, following consultation, was that such involvement of local authorities in non-designated airports&#039; noise control measures would be too bureaucratic, given the existence of the power to designate an airport should its voluntary amelioration measures be inadequate. The Government remain of that view; local authorities have a statutory right to be included in the consultative arrangements made by airports designated under section 35&nbsp;of the 1982&nbsp;Act.
</p>








<p><a name="st_256"><a name="51010-29_spnew11"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_257"><a name="51010-29_spnew12"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I am very conscious of the fact that I have already gone on too long and that people are anxious to move on, but I was keen to reply in detail. We have been in debate for some time and I am trying to conclude my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_253">On amendments Nos. 21&nbsp;and 1, the amendment in clause 2&nbsp;to section 78(3) of the 1982&nbsp;Act has clearly excited a great deal of concern among hon. Members whose constituencies are affected by night flying at the designated airports. On Second Reading and in Standing Committee, the Government sought to explain their position on the current night flying restrictions regime and on the proposals for a revised regime to run from October 2006&nbsp;to October 2012. As hon. Members 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 99</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have mentioned, permission is currently being sought by a number of claimants for a judicial review of the consultation proposals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_258"><a name="51010-29_spnew13"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 Why does the Minister bother to come to the House when she does not listen to anything that people say and has not made a single concession on the Bill, despite a lot of good advice from Members of all parties? What is the point? Is it not a travesty of democracy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_259"><a name="51010-29_spnew14"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I think that that was a rhetorical question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_254">I am anxious that the Government should not intrude on the role of the courts by commenting on a particular dispute concerning the application of the existing legislation on restrictions on night flights&#151;including the way that aircraft are classified for such purposes&#151;at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Consultation on the Government&#039;s proposed night flying restrictions closed on 16&nbsp;September and we are giving careful consideration to the large number of responses received. I am grateful to all those who responded, including hon. Members. I will not be able to announce the outcome of the consultation in advance of completing the full consideration of responses, but I state again that the proposed change to the legislation will not impact on the current process to determine night flying restrictions at the designated airports from October 2006&nbsp;to October 2012, regardless of whether the Bill completes its passage before that announcement is made, and that the restrictions will involve a limit on aircraft movements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_255">On the question of Heathrow, and in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, the limit of 480,000&nbsp;movements imposed by the planning inspector would also not be overturned by way of a future decision to set night flying restrictions without a movements limit. There would still be a total movements limit, and were there to be an increase in night flights, for example, that would be within the cap.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_256">I think that it is the mood of the House that I should draw my comments to a conclusion. [Hon. Members: &quot;Yes.&quot;] I have read the mood of the House correctly. Although I realise that I have not satisfied the concerns of all Opposition Members, I have commented in detail on a number of those issues, as I did in Committee. I believe that the Bill strikes a proper balance between the environmental sustainability issues that cause concern to Members of Parliament and the need to maintain a healthy aviation industry.

<a name="stpa_258">Hon. Members might be wondering why the new clause has been proposed now and why the subject has not come up in previous debates. A series of crashes made August 2005&nbsp;one of the worst months in recent years for aviation accidents: on 14&nbsp;August a Helios Airways flight crashed, killing 121&nbsp;people; on 16&nbsp;August a Colombian plane operated by West Caribbean Airways crashed, killing 160&nbsp;people; and on 23&nbsp;August, a Boeing 737&nbsp;crashed on an internal flight in Peru, reportedly killing 40&nbsp;people. That is why we are moving the new clause today.

<a name="stpa_259">I have pulled some information off websites to illustrate the present position on airlines that are banned in the UK and countries whose aircraft are banned from flying to the UK. The countries include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland and Tajikistan; the airlines include Air Mauritanie, Phoenix Aviation and Thailand&#039;s Phuket Airlines. One can discover the state of play in other countries, too. The Swiss have simplified their policy by stating that they will ban from their air space any airline that has already been banned by the European Union or by a European Free Trade Association state. However, they then add a couple of other airlines&#151;Flash Airlines from Egypt and Air Van Airlines from Armenia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_260">There is quite a long list of airlines banned from flying in Belgian air space. There are some airlines that are common with the Swiss list, including Air Van Airlines, for instance. There are other airlines that are not included, and certainly on the UK list. The list of airlines banned from French air space is not consistent with the list of those airlines that are banned from the UK&#039;s air space.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_261">The purpose of the new clause is to introduce some consistency so that those who are wanting to make judgments about which airlines to fly with can do so in the full knowledge of whether those airlines are banned in the UK and whether they are banned in other

<br>&nbsp;<br>countries. If they are banned from flying to other countries, we should know why the Secretary of State has chosen not to ban them from UK air space.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_262">It may be that the Minister will say that none of the airlines that are on the French list or on the Belgian list fly to the UK. That would be welcome. The Minister will also need to say whether there are any discussions already with those countries to ensure that there is consistency. I am aware that at a European Union level there are plans to introduce a common list, but we need measures to be taken much sooner. There are no guarantees that the EU will come to a swift and satisfactory conclusion on this very important issue.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_263">When the Minister responds, I hope that he will be able to clarify exactly what the relationship is between the Department of Trade and Industry and its counterparts in relation to banning airlines and whether there is, when the French ban an airline, for example, immediate discussion with the UK about whether it would be appropriate for that airline to be banned in the UK. I hope also that the Minister will be able to set out the time scales for coming to a conclusion at an EU level. If the time scales mean that we will have to wait for months or years before some sort of decision is implemented at an EU level, it would be entirely appropriate for the UK Government to publicise, albeit in a rather discreet way, the airlines that are banned. That information does not hit us when we go to the Department&#039;s website to try to find it. It would be entirely appropriate also for our Government to take action now to make it clear why, if other countries are banning airlines from flying into their air space, we have not chosen to do the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_264">I hope that the Minister will be able to give some reassurances on these matters. If not, I will be seeking to push the new clause to a vote.

<p><a name="st_269"><a name="51010-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brazier: </b> 
 My party has some sympathy with the thinking behind the new clause but it is not able to support it. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) has set out concerns about a number of airlines that have poor safety records. He has said that a number of them are banned from visiting the UK. He started to lose me when he suggested that his clause could be a half-way step towards ultimately the issuing of EU-wide guidance, if I understood him correctly. He may wish to correct me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_265">It seems to the Opposition that the issue should be decided by national authorities&#151;the Civil Aviation Authority in our case. We may have a particular reason why we do not think that a particular airline is safe and may disagree with other countries on that. Conversely there are circumstances where a European-wide body might come under pressure to ban a particular airline for a reason that had nothing to do with its safety record.
</p>








<p><a name="st_270"><a name="51010-31_spnew2"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has understood our position correctly. If the time scales for introducing something at an EU level&#151;I think that that is the appropriate way to proceed&#151;are such that we are talking of the long-term future, it would be appropriate for the UK Government to introduce the clause as a half-way house.

<p><a name="st_271"><a name="51010-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brazier: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for confirming his position. We are firmly opposed to giving up sovereignty in this area. That is not a matter of ideology but it is the straightforward fact that we or the CAA may take a view that a particular airline is dangerous when other equivalents abroad do not. There could be circumstances in which the International Air Transport Association might come under pressure for commercial or political reasons, or whatever, to ban an airline that did not have a poor safety record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_266">What is the provision which has been described as a halfway house trying to achieve? The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has made it clear that the list is already available. It may not be as prominent on the website as he would like, but we do not need primary legislation to rectify that. If a particular airline has been banned by another EU country but not by the UK, we can ask the CAA why it has taken that view. We can see no reason for adopting the new clause.
</p>








<p><a name="st_272"><a name="51010-31_spnew4"><b> Dr. John Pugh  (Southport) (LD):</b> 
 I accept the argument that in the European Union undue pressure may be applied to organisations to ban a particular airline for commercial reasons, but why does the hon. Gentleman think that that will not happen at a national level? Precisely such a danger could be present. France, for example, might choose to ban an airline if it found it commercially convenient to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_273"><a name="51010-31_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brazier: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has just made my point for me. It is most unlikely that the Civil Aviation Authority would want to ban an airline for commercial reasons. It has a long history of focusing on aviation safety and its other duties. Its French equivalent is extremely competent and has a comparable level of technical expertise, but it is much more subject to Government pressures than the CAA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_267">Finally, without wishing to try your patience, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we cannot discuss the real danger to aviation safety because the amendment dealing with the transfer of powers from the CAA to European Aviation Safety Agency on certificates of airworthiness&#151;the cornerstone of air safety&#151;was not selected. The fact that the individuals concerned here and in France do not want to transfer along with those powers opens up a frightening gap in the medium term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_268">To conclude, while we have the greatest sympathy with Liberal Democrat concerns for aviation safety, we do not think that their proposal would improve it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_274"><a name="51010-31_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 It does not happen very often, but when it does, we should acknowledge it&#151;I agreed almost entirely with the contribution of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who marshalled his thoughts on the new clause very well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_269">I understand why the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) has raised these concerns, and I would have been surprised if someone had not done so. However, the efforts of the Department and the CAA, which we are pursuing through the European Union, are adequate to deal with the matter. Briefly, any airline from outside the EU, Iceland, Norway or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 106</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Switzerland which wishes to pick up or put down passengers or cargo in the UK requires a permit from the Secretary of State for Transport. It is a condition of the permit that the airline should be operated in accordance with international safety standards established by International Civil Aviation Organisation. If we have doubts about whether an aircraft or airline complies with international safety standards, we will arrange for the aircraft to be inspected by the Civil Aviation Authority. Permits may be refused, and existing permits suspended or revoked by the Secretary of State. That can occur where there is a breach of a permit condition, including non-compliance with international safety standards. Permit decisions are reviewed in the light of new information or changed circumstances. While a restriction placed on a foreign airline by another EU member state will be taken into account when considering the issue of a permit, the final decision rests with the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_270">A list of foreign airlines to which the Secretary of State has refused permission to operate commercial services to the UK is published on the Department&#039;s website, as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said. I noted his comment that it is not prominent on the website, and I shall make sure that that is reviewed. I have no reason to believe, however, that it is difficult to find that list if one knows what one is looking for. The list is amended promptly, as and when necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_271">As to airlines refused operating permission by other member states, we currently have access to this information only through the safety assessment of foreign aircraft programme established by the European civil aviation conference. This information is shared in confidence and on the understanding that only the state making the decision should make it public. It would therefore not be appropriate for us to make public reports listing airlines banned by other member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_272">I recognise however the need for greater transparency and consistency in dealing with the safety of foreign aircraft within Europe. Hon. Members may be reassured to know that a European directive on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports was adopted on 21&nbsp;April 2004&nbsp;and will be implemented by 30&nbsp;April next year. The directive establishes a harmonised procedure for safety inspections of third-country aircraft and for the sharing of information derived from such inspections. In addition, it provides a mechanism for a restriction imposed by one member state to be extended to the whole Community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_273">In addition, a regulation is being developed by the European Union which would require the European Commission to publish a list of airlines that have been refused permission to operate commercial services to any member states. Latest discussions of the proposal suggest that it may be amended to establish common criteria for the refusal of operating permission to third-country airlines and the establishment of a list of airlines refused permission to operate to any Community airport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_274">I took the UK chair at Transport Council in Luxembourg last week, where the matter was discussed with a view to progressing it. The French Government 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 107</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are particularly anxious for progress to be made, because a number of French citizens lost their lives in accidents over the summer. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the matter is being treated urgently by the Commission and by the Council. In the light of the action already being taken in respect of the safety of foreign airlines, the amendment is unnecessary and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
</p>

<p><a name="st_275"><a name="51010-32_spnew0"><b> Dr. Pugh: I </b> 
 f the European Community draws up its own list and it does not exactly coincide with the British list, will the British list still be paramount for the UK Government, or will European law in this case have primacy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_276"><a name="51010-32_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 That is the area where the debate is taking place&#151;how we resolve the differences between states. I may be doing the French an injustice in paraphrasing their position, but as I understand it, they believe that the list adopted should be a superset of all the lists of all the member states, so that no airline that is banned in one country can fly in another. However, there is some disagreement in Council about whether that is the correct approach. Other member states take the position that if a member state wishes to include on its list an airline that is not included on the lists of other member states, it should be for that state to do so in respect of its own nation, and for it to try and convince the other member states that we should all upgrade our lists to its standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">The position of the UK Government is clear. We expect to see a standard that meets the UK criteria&#151;in other words, we reserve the right to see that any airline that we want banned is banned from the UK. But how we ultimately resolve the issue and get agreement across all the partners is a matter for continuing discussion in Council. I expect to see further progress by the next Transport Council, which is in early December. With that, I hope I have convinced hon. Gentlemen that we are working urgently to resolve the matter not only through the actions that we have already taken in the UK, but among the partners of the EU, where it is being given the appropriate level of priority.
</p>








<p><a name="st_277"><a name="51010-32_spnew2"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for setting out the progress that is being made, which is welcome. I was aware of some of the matters that he mentioned, but not of others. He has highlighted the fact that confusion will persist among air travellers about why certain airlines can operate in UK air space, whereas they cannot in other countries, particularly when the information about the banned airlines in other EU countries is available to those who have the nous to find it on those countries&#039; websites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">I am afraid that the Minister, while setting out the progress that has been made, has not addressed the central issue, which is the confusion that will exist among air travellers as to why different standards apply.

<br>&nbsp;<br>discuss. On Second Reading, we promised to return with a statement on our attitude to the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s proposal for a &#163;1&nbsp;levy on all air passengers departing from the UK to help us deal with tour operator and airline insolvency. Those amendments were not selected so I placed a written statement before the House setting out our response to the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_283">We decided on balance that regulation on that scale would not be proportionate given that the risk to passengers can be reduced in other ways and that the risk of airline failure is small.

<p><a name="st_301"><a name="51010-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Donohoe: </b> 
 Has the Minister considered the number of airlines in the United States that are under chapter 11&nbsp;and on the edge of bankruptcy? Swissair has already gone belly up and other European airlines are in the same position. In such cases, what will happen to UK passengers if they are not covered by insurance, which is the present state of play?
</p>








<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51010-34_spnew2"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I will try to cover some of those remarks but I do not want to detain the House too much.

<p><a name="st_303"><a name="51010-34_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Dunwoody: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware that there was a failure during the summer. Although it received astonishingly little publicity, there is no doubt that a lot of people were stranded. It happened to be convenient that many people got on other planes. She should seriously consider the fact that airlines can go belly up.
</p>








<p><a name="st_304"><a name="51010-34_spnew4"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I will address my hon. Friend&#039;s remarks. As I have said, the CAA&#039;s advice states that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;the chance of failing is roughly between 2&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;per cent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_284">We believe on balance that insurance should only be compulsory in exceptional circumstances. We do not require travellers to take out medical insurance or an E111. Even with car insurance, the legal requirement is limited to third-party liabilities. The Government have already been working with the airline industry to improve consumer information about insurance cover when booking flights. UK airlines have helped us to develop a basic message for passengers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_305"><a name="51010-34_spnew5"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 Is not this also effectively a third-party liability, which is roughly equivalent to the other scale of risk where compulsory insurance ingredients are required?
</p>








<p><a name="st_306"><a name="51010-34_spnew6"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means. I cannot see that there is third-party liability; this is a form of compulsory insurance. We weighed up a number of pros and cons&#151;the argument was finely balanced&#151;and we found no other area of public policy where we would expect people to be insured compulsorily.
</p>








<p><a name="st_307"><a name="51010-34_spnew7"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 On weighing up the pros and cons, how did the Minister weigh up the &#163;100&nbsp;million of regulatory costs that the CAA&#039;s proposal would have saved versus, as far as I can tell, no saving in regulatory costs for the policy of doing nothing that she has adopted?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_308"><a name="51010-34_spnew8"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The costs effectively fall on different parts of the industry. In considering the issue, we bore in mind not only the points about consumer protection and insurance, but the fact that the different parts of the industry had very different interests. The tour operators were generally in favour of one approach, and the airlines were generally, with some exceptions, in favour of another. So it is a question of considering all the different players and then making a decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_285">My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) referred to the Irish airline, EUjet, which failed this summer. Other low-cost airlines stepped in to help passengers get home. Similarly, when Swissair and Sabena failed, other full-service airlines honoured the homeward tickets of passengers abroad. The Government have been encouraged by the willingness expressed by airlines to ensure that travellers have better information about insurance and by airlines&#039; assurances that they would continue to take voluntary action on repatriation. I will talk further to airlines in the coming weeks to ensure that effective voluntary measures are in place as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_286">The Government are also asking the CAA to review whether the system of ATOL&#151;air travel organisers&#039; licensing&#151;bonds could be replaced with a less burdensome means of meeting tour operators&#039; obligations to package holiday-makers under the package travel directive, while replenishing the air travel trust fund following the passage of the Bill. I am also aware that the Transport Committee, which is chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich, will consider the issue and invite evidence on it during the next few weeks. I am sure that that will give us an opportunity to discuss this in detail.
</p>








<p><a name="st_309"><a name="51010-34_spnew9"><b> Rob Marris  (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend share my bemusement that the proponents of the scheme seem to suggest that someone who takes a Ryanair flight to Dublin for a stag weekend at a cost of &#163;30&nbsp;should pay &#163;1&nbsp;in insurance&#151;the same as someone who is quite rich who goes to the Bahamas first class?
</p>








<p><a name="st_310"><a name="51010-34_spnew10"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 That was certainly very much one of the considerations that was weighed up. Some advocates of the proposal claimed that it would end a two-tier system; but, on closer examination, it would merely replace one form of two-tier system with another. As I say, the proposal will be considered by the Select Committee, and no doubt, it will be considered further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_287">We do not deny the environmental impacts of aviation, which have been at the core of the debates on Second Reading and in Committee. We seek to reduce and mitigate those impacts wherever possible, but the Government remain of the view that, wherever possible, local solutions are best for local problems. We believe that airport operators will make appropriate use of the powers the Bill will make available to them to tackle environmental issues at local level. The Government have statutory powers that we can use where the voluntary approach does not suffice, and those powers will be deployed if necessary.

<br>&nbsp;<br>frequently, but I am not sure that they know what &quot;local&quot; means. Does &quot;local&quot; mean close to the airport, or does it cover people, such as my constituents, who live 20&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;miles from the airport and who are adversely affected by it? At the minute, it does not look as though it means that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_314"><a name="51010-34_spnew14"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 If my memory serves me, the default position is about 40&nbsp;km from the central airport, and it can be extended further to 60&nbsp;km. I believe that &quot;local&quot; is reasonably widely defined, and I hope that that is enough to satisfy the hon. and learned Gentleman that his concerns are covered by the powers in the Bill.

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_288">I appreciate hon. Members&#039; concerns regarding the powers by which we control noise at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. That was also the subject of a considerable amount of discussion in Committee. Any future proposals for changes to the noise control regime at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would be subject to public consultation. The next night restrictions regime until 2012&nbsp;will be based on current legislation and will continue to incorporate a movements limit. Airports&#039; ability to set up noise control measures and impose penalties on aircraft operators will be enshrined in statute, but airports should follow a &quot;balanced approach&quot; when introducing new measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_289">The Bill will also transfer the costs of the CAA&#039;s aviation health unit from the taxpayer to the aviation industry; a much fairer arrangement because those that benefit from this service will pay for it.

 I do not want to detain the House long except to review our attitude to the Bill, which we have expressed from the very beginning. Where a lot of thought could have been put into devising a coherent policy enshrined in legislation for us to consider, we really have a complete hotchpotch. We have a random and arbitrary piece of legislation that lays down no coherent policy for the future benefit of the world. The Bill gives us no opportunity to distinguish properly between the poacher and the gamekeeper, and no coherent and consistent regime for either emissions or noise. It is apparent from the mood of the House that the Minister has very little enthusiastic support for the Bill from Labour Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_318"><a name="51010-35_spnew1"><b> John Smith: </b> 
 I am sure that, had we had the opportunity on Report to reach clause 7, hon. Members on both sides would have warmly welcomed the groundbreaking proposal to place a statutory duty on the Secretary of State for Transport to safeguard the

<p><a name="st_319"><a name="51010-35_spnew2"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 Most of the health issues in the Bill, as well as in the amendments that we might have discussed today, are about the health of people on the ground, not in the air. If the hon. Gentleman has any objection to not being able to reach those clauses, he should take it up with his party, his Chief Whip and his Prime Minister for programming legislation and denying the House on every occasion that we consider a Bill the opportunity properly to scrutinise it. If the hon. Gentleman stands up and complains in the way that he has done, he has only himself to blame.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_292">It is apparent from what we have seen in the House tonight that there is very little support for the Bill on the Labour Benches. We have had a couple of speeches from Members with specific interests in airports in their constituencies, and it is distressing that we have heard no clear arguments for the environmental benefits of the Bill&#151;be they about noise or emissions. The Bill is arbitrary and incoherent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_293">Perhaps the most dismaying comment was made just a second ago when the Minister said that she thought that local problems were best dealt with at local level. Emissions are not a local problem; they are a global problem. She should perhaps have come up with better solutions to that problem than she has tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_294">We are perhaps able on Third Reading to concentrate, as the Minister did, on the travel trust, the insurance against companies going bankrupt. I said on Second Reading that there was a clear argument for saying that the state should not insure anybody at all and that, in the modern world of travel, everyone should insure themselves as they do their house, their life or anything else. We are, of course, compelled to insure our motor cars, largely, as the Minister rightly said, because of the damage that they might do to other people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_295">We have pointed out that it is the inconsistency and inequity of the current regime of travel insurance that has become a complete and utter nonsense. We have inherited a model that was designed in the 1970s, when most people went abroad on package holidays. If a package tour company went bankrupt, the system potentially covered well over 90&nbsp;per cent. of people travelling in such a way. The rise of low-cost airlines and increased international travel has shifted the balance dramatically away from such models, so far fewer people are now covered by the insurance that currently exists. We also have an insurance arrangement that leaves the supposedly effective model in deep deficit, so the Government are required to top it up. Many travellers think that they are covered when they are not. The perpetuation of the flawed model is thus the one option that is nonsensical.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_296">There are two options. One is to say, &quot;You all cover yourselves&quot;, and the other is to put a quid on everyone&#039;s ticket for perhaps four years so that we can get a kitty to cover people. The Government have shied away from 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 119</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that option by arguing that the modern world says that people can travel on a low-cost airline, insure themselves and somehow get home if they need to. However, an absurd piece of EU legislation called the package travel directive remains in place and that perpetuates the absurdly limited and fragmented model of cover. I have not heard from the Government about how they will introduce consistency after rejecting the model offered by the Civil Aviation Authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_297">I think that I am right in saying that in the entire history of the European Union, no directive has been repealed by this House. We thus have a constitutional structure that is forcing on us a fossilised picture of cover, and this House, in debating this Bill, has neither the power, nor even the will, to overturn a directive that puts in place something that is now clearly nonsensical and absurd. I ask the Minister to her face whether it is now Government policy to persuade the European Union&#151;perhaps we will have more influence now that we have the presidency&#151;to repeal the package travel directive.
</p>








<p><a name="st_322"><a name="51010-35_spnew5"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we intend to enter into discussions with the CAA to examine a reform of the bonding system to ensure that companies that are currently covered by the package travel directive will be able to determine whether the burden on them, which they believe to be disproportionate, can be covered in an alternative way. We intend to do that because we realise that there is an issue for consumers and a possible inequity for different kinds of holiday providers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_323"><a name="51010-35_spnew6"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 Quite clearly the answer is no. The Minister has no intention whatever of trying to repeal the package travel directive. Although we get 150&nbsp;or so directives and 1,000&nbsp;or more regulations a year, I believe it is true&#151;I am happy to be disproved&#151;that none has ever been revised or repealed. We are thus in a constitutional and legislative ratchet. The situation is a perfect example of the Government believing that they are empowered to decide how companies and passengers should be affected, yet declining to make even an effort to address the problem and thus revise the situation. In other words, they accept whatever comes from the European Union and somehow work around it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_298">We shall be stuck with the ridiculous picture of an insurance that covers an old-fashioned part of the travel market. However, in the Government&#039;s own words, as they argue explicitly in a written statement published today&#151;they at least deserve credit for putting out something detailed in a written statement&#151;they do not accept the arguments for extending cover. They intend to perpetuate an unacceptable position and I am sorry that the Bill does not deal with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_299">The Bill has good intentions. We all want to control noise and emissions, but it is a great pity that the opportunity to introduce a sensible and modern regime to control noise and emissions in a crowded and busy world has been lamentably missed.

: This is an extraordinarily incompetent piece of legislation. It misses most of the things that are important. I am concerned in particular about financial protection for air travellers. That should have been debated at great length. The original scheme, which was tailored for a particular set of circumstances, has been overcome by changes in the way in which people travel. It is also nonsense to suggest that people who buy furniture are the same as those who take a holiday abroad on a low-cost airline. By definition, people who use low-cost airlines with their families are not able to buy alternative tickets. If we seriously think that there will always be other seats available and that other airlines, including the two or three very good ones that are opposed to the measure, will always find places for people, we will get a bad shock.

Nothing will be done to simplify the system so that consumers can understand it. Nothing will be done to combat the increased risk of airline failures. That is a real risk. It is a pretend industry that hardly owns any assets and is sailing, in literal terms, very close to the wind.

 Clearly, the Bill is beneficial in parts. Clarifying the law on what airport operators can charge for noise and emissions, giving commercial freedom to public airport operators and making the CAA responsible for the health of people on board aircraft are positive developments. There are great concerns, however. The clearest of those is in relation to noise and breaking the link with the number of flights. The Bill does not reflect the House&#039;s concern about that.
</p>

The Minister was decent enough to recognise that by devoting a large part of her speech to the air travel trust fund and the &#163;1&nbsp;levy. I do not understand why the Government are failing to make moves on that simple issue, especially when the CAA has provided them with a simple solution that has the backing of the Federation of Tour Operators. The introduction of the &#163;1&nbsp;levy

<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 121</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would have made things clear to passengers who are confused about where they stand in relation to cover should the airline they are flying with fail.

Has the Minister seen the economic analysis by Ernst and Young, commissioned on a brief agreed by the Department for Transport and the CAA, which looked at various options and concluded that a &#163;1&nbsp;levy on all flights is the most economically rational solution to the issue of providing passenger protection? What does the hon. Lady think of that analysis, and why has it been so readily dismissed by the Government? The Minister of State said on Second Reading that he would listen to Members&#039; views and take them into account. I am sure that he listened, but there is little evidence that he took into account the views on the air travel trust fund&#151;quite the contrary.

It is clear to me, at any rate, that there is an anomaly, and some discrimination, in the situation of the no-frills airlines and that of the chartered airlines. I do not know how the Government can say that, on balance, they have come to these conclusions. I want to know from the Minister what that balance was&#151;was it 60&#150;40, 70&#150;30&nbsp;or, as I suspect, something like 90&#150;10?

<p><a name="st_327"><a name="51010-36_spnew2"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I declare an interest as one of three members of the flying community in this House, together with the hon. Members for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) and for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths). I reassure hon. Members that I am not a commercial pilot, so I speak in a private capacity. I shall make two points about the Bill and one observation about general aviation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_309">Some aspects of the Bill need to be considered a little more, as we have heard. As a pilot, I have been flabbergasted at the increase in costs at many of the large airports, particularly for general aviation pilots. The fact that the authorities have total jurisdiction over what they charge has resulted in a sky-rocketing of some of the costs. As has been made clear on Report, there is considerable concern over the proposed financial penalties, which the authorities will also be able to set at any level without recourse to appeal. That could be damaging to aviation as a whole, because there will be an enormous temptation to use such penalties as a revenue-making scheme. I know that the legislation states that all the money should be passed to those who are perceived to be suffering ill effects, but it is not as simple as that. I hope that if the scheme shows itself to be flawed the Government will be willing to reconsider it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_310">My second point relates to the explanatory notes. Any pilot would be concerned about paragraph 20&nbsp;on page 5, which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;Requiring aircraft to take off or land in a given direction at a given time could also reduce the numbers of people subjected to the most severe aircraft noise.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_311">On the face of it, that sounds perfectly reasonable&#151;until one realises that pilots always have to land into wind. It is the most basic requirement. So it is disturbing, to say the least, to see in the explanatory notes the implication that the direction of landing may be altered in order to reduce the discomfort of noise for local people. As far as I can see, the Government could achieve that only by introducing a scheme to alter wind direction. Unless the Prime Minister can control the weather, which even he does not pretend, the explanatory note should be modified. If it is used as an opportunity to interpret the legislation, it will make things more rather than less dangerous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_312">Thirdly and finally, commercial aviation in this country is underpinned by general aviation, which is a multi-billion pound industry that does much to feed commercial aviation with pilots and to transport all manner of people around the country from small aerodromes. In interventions on Report, I sought reassurance&#151;I think that I received it&#151;that the intention of the Bill is not to influence general aviation. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 123</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>However, I hope that the Government will return to a couple of things that are very important to the general aviation sector. One is the question of N-registered aircraft&#151;those registered in the United States but used in the UK for general aviation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_313">The Minister will be aware that general aviation is very concerned about the potential for banning N-registered aircraft from the British register. There have been signs of a change of heart, suggesting that that will not happen in the short term, but I hope that the Minister will be willing to meet representatives of the general aviation sector&#151;I see her nodding, so I will take that as a yes&#151;in order to discuss their concerns and the rationale behind allowing N-registered aircraft to continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_314">Connected to that there is a concern that, as we consider safety issues, Britain should learn from the experience of the United States, which provides pilots, particularly private pilots, with the opportunity to gain a less stringent instrument-rating qualification. In the United States, 50&nbsp;per cent. of private pilots have that instrument rating, but in the United Kingdom, where instrument rating is far more complicated and difficult to secure, the qualification is possessed by less than 2&nbsp;per cent. of the private pilot population. That has a bearing on safety for all carriers, including civil aviation and the commercial sector, because we all share the same airspace. Again, perhaps we can raise that subject in a meeting outside the Chamber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_315">My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) has highlighted our concerns. I hope that the explanatory note will be clarified and that the Government will keep a close eye on changes to costs and charges after the Bill is implemented.

<p><a name="st_340"><a name="51010-37_spnew8"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to have the opportunity to initiate the first Adjournment debate after the summer recess. The main issue that I want to raise is the change that was made during the recess to granting indefinite leave to people who were given refugee status, a change that was mentioned in the five-year plan that the Home Office produced earlier this year, but a change that had never been debated or discussed in the House before it was brought into force at the end of August. When it became evident shortly before the summer recess that the change was likely to take place, several Members expressed concern. In the last few days before the summer recess more than 40&nbsp;Members added their names to an early-day motion on the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_322">I really do not understand the reasoning behind the change. It reverses a policy that the Labour Government introduced in 1998. It was announced in the White Paper of July 1998. Before 1998, anyone who was given refugee status was given only temporary permission to stay and had to wait four years before they could apply for indefinite leave. In the 1998&nbsp;White Paper, we said that the immediate granting of indefinite leave would help refugees to integrate more easily and quickly into society, to the benefit of the entire community into which they had been accepted. It then went on to say that this policy was wholly consistent with the Government commitment to a more humanitarian approach to the UK&#039;s obligations under the 1951&nbsp;refugee convention and to faster identification of those in genuine need of protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_323">Those arguments were absolutely right in 1998. I do not understand why the same arguments are not regarded as valid now. I know from correspondence that I have had with the Minister over the summer that he may say that things have changed since 1998, that we are now in a different situation and that the number of asylum applications has changed considerably. Indeed, it has dropped a lot in the past year or two. The Minister may well say that the time scale for decision-making has changed. It is welcome that the time scale now for initial decisions is so much shorter than it used to be. The arguments that we made in 1998&nbsp;for indefinite leave were not about numbers or time scales for decision making. They were about principles&#151;what was the best way to help people whom we recognised as refugees to integrate into society, and how could we best to operate our commitments under the 1951&nbsp;convention? The convention does not explicitly demand that we immediately give indefinite leave to someone to whom we grant refugee status, and until 1998&nbsp;we did not grant leave in such circumstances. However, doing so is in the spirit of the convention, and that is the argument that we made in the 1998&nbsp;White Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_324">European countries do not all grant indefinite leave. In the five-year plan published earlier this year it was argued that a number of European countries granted refugees temporary leave initially rather than immediate settlement. That was true before 1998, however, and we did not regard it as a valid argument. If we are going to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 127</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reverse the policy of granting indefinite leave&#151;a policy that is only seven years old&#151;it should be possible to point to problems that have arisen from its operation, but I am not aware of any argument that such problems have been created. I am convinced, however, that problems will be created by the reversal of the policy. It is disingenuous to say, as the Home Office has said in correspondence, that the change is not intended to prolong the uncertainty and instability faced by refugees, because that is exactly what it is guaranteed to do.

<p><a name="st_342"><a name="51010-38_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_325">Leaving someone uncertain about how long they will remain here or what their future is militates against their being able to integrate and make a contribution. It cuts across the good things that have been done in the past five years. This Government were the first to produce a strategy for integration with the publication of &quot;Full and Equal Citizens&quot; in 2000. That document is still extremely valid, but things have progressed. Integration loans have been introduced, and there have been projects to help refugees integrate into society, many of which have been funded by the Home Office and have produced encouraging results. I do not see how our good work on integration accords with a step that will introduce greater uncertainty to people&#039;s lives.

<a name="stpa_326">May I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to a letter to the Home Secretary from a group of psychologists who work with refugees and asylum seekers?

 The psychologists stated that they had grave concerns about the effect of the change on people with serious mental health problems that result from the circumstances of those who have become refugees. The psychologists viewed the granting of refugee status as signalling a phase of safety that allows them to begin work in earnest on tackling some of the symptoms that people are suffering. They went on to say that the prolonged uncertainties that people face when they are seeking asylum can have a serious detrimental effect on existing mental health problems, and that making 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 128</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>refugee status conditional and temporary will make it much more difficult to work psychologically to improve the mental health of many of their clients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_327">The psychologists cite guidelines produced last year by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on post-traumatic stress disorder, which specifically referred to the situation of refugees and stated that trauma-focused therapies were typically inappropriate and ineffective while people do not have the security of refugee status. These are important and powerful points. We are dealing with people whom we have recognised as refugees. We acknowledge that they have suffered persecution. Some of them have been through very traumatic experiences. Some of them have serious mental health problems that need prolonged treatment. Everyone who is dealing with the matter, such as NICE and the psychologists, is giving us the same message&#151;that leaving those people with such uncertainty about their future will make it much more difficult to tackle post-traumatic stress, get them stabilised and deal with their mental health problems and the symptoms from which they have been suffering.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_328">I recognise that the 1951&nbsp;convention does not demand that we provide permanent protection, but experience shows that when conditions change in their countries of origin, people granted refugee status often go back voluntarily. There are voluntary returns going on all the time. Past waves of refugees&#151;people whom I remember meeting 20&nbsp;or 30&nbsp;years ago, who had come to the UK from Chile or Argentina, and who had been political activists in those countries&#151;wanted to go back when they saw that conditions had changed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_329">The change will affect another aspect of integration by making it much more difficult for people with temporary status to gain employment, which would help them to settle and to make a contribution. There will not necessarily be a fixed period of time. It is proposed that at the end of five years there will be a review if nothing has happened in the meantime, but in some cases that review could come within a year, 18&nbsp;months, or two years of their being granted temporary status. If a decision is made that there has been a significant change in the country of origin, that will lead to a review of all the individual decisions regarding people from that country. How many employers will be keen to take on people whose status is uncertain? We know now that many people who have been given exceptional leave to remain, even though that carries with it permission to work, have difficulty in persuading employers that that really is the case. I do not want to get into a debate this evening on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, but one or two of its provisions will make matters much more difficult, to the point where exceptional leave runs out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_330">There will be disagreements about whether conditions in countries of origin have changed sufficiently and&#151;another important factor&#151;whether such changes are permanent. The five-year plan and the statement referred to a change of conditions in the country that was regarded as sufficiently permanent. I am not sure how that judgment will be easily made. In the past 12&nbsp;months we have seen some of the arguments that have cropped up about the returns to Zimbabwe, and now the possibility of forced returns of failed asylum seekers to Iraq. There will certainly be disputes about whether there have been genuine changes of condition, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 129</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and that will lead to a clogging up of the appeals system, because anyone who is told that their leave is being withdrawn will have the right of appeal under the Bill that we are now considering. In time it will also lead to the clogging up of Members&#039; advice surgeries, because we will frequently be dealing with families with children who are in school and who have grown up here, and I am sure that I do not have to remind the Minister about how difficult it is now for the Home Office to deal with such removals. Those are the sort of people who will be told that, after three, four or five years of temporary protection, they will have to go back to wherever they came from. I do not know anyone who works with refugees who is supportive of the change. No legislation would be required. The measure was brought in without legislation and I urge the Minister to have another look at it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_331">Another matter that has been drawn to the attention of a number of hon. Members today concerns the situation of some British citizens who are married to failed asylum seekers. I would not necessarily expect answers this evening, but perhaps the Minister will consider what I have to say and perhaps write to me. Their husbands&#151;it is often husbands&#151;are told that they have to return to their country of origin. I understand the policies on marriage that have been applied in the Home Office for some time, going back to 1996&nbsp;and DP3/96, and the reasoning behind that. Obviously fake marriages have been used to avoid immigration controls, but the Home Office is not questioning the genuine nature of the marriage of the people whom I and a number of other hon. Members met today. Nevertheless, it says that, because a marriage took place after a failed asylum claim, the person concerned must go back to their country of origin, or their spouse can accompany them. To tell a British citizen that they can accompany their spouse to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran or Iraq, and make an application from there, is hardly credible when the Foreign Office advises British citizens not to set foot in such countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_332">The way such cases are being dealt with needs to be looked at. I understand all the arguments about the need to deal with fake marriages&#151;I have seen some fake marriages, as I am sure others have&#151;but I am referring to marriages whose genuine nature is not in question yet we are asking either British citizens or their spouses to go to countries that the Foreign Office regards as dangerous. I am sure that the Minister will be approached by hon. Members about this and I hope that he will consider such cases with some sympathy and see whether we can adopt a rather more humanitarian approach than we are at present.

<a name="stpa_337">We made that change for two main reasons: first, there should be a clear and consistent approach to those obtaining leave under the immigration rules on how long they have to be here before they become eligible for settlement, and we have decided to set that period at 5&nbsp;years for most categories; secondly, we should provide refuge to people for as long as they need it, but if conditions in their country improve significantly, it is reasonable to expect them to return, particularly where they have spent only a relatively short period in the UK.

<a name="stpa_338">Some have argued that the new policy is not within the spirit of the refugee convention&#151;I note that my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>spirit of the refugee convention, but there should be no doubt that where the conditions that gave rise to a refugee&#039;s fear of persecution continue to exist after five years, we will allow them to seek permanent settlement in the UK. However, where there has been a significant and non-temporary change in conditions in their country sufficient to suggest that they could return in safety, they will be expected to return there&#151;indeed, I am sure that many refugees would wish to go home in such circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_341">Some have questioned why we have reversed the decision that we took in 1998&nbsp;to give refugees immediate settlement; indeed, my hon. Friend raised that very point. He also anticipated the answer: we believe that the decision was the right one given the circumstances of the time and the immigration system that we inherited from the Conservatives, which was, as he will remember perhaps better than anybody, a system that was in crisis with huge backlogs. As a result, a large number of asylum seekers had been in the UK for many years before receiving decisions&#151;even initial decisions&#151;on their applications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_342">It is important to contrast that with the picture today. Backlogs in the system are at their lowest level for a decade. Asylum intake is back to 1997&nbsp;levels and has fallen further and faster than in the EU as a whole in recent years. It was 76&nbsp;per cent. lower in the UK in the second quarter of 2005&nbsp;compared with the peak in October 2002, and 32&nbsp;per cent. lower in the UK in 2004&nbsp;than in 2003. That is the essential context of this debate, and it is largely the result of action that the Government have taken to increase the efficiency of the asylum process. More than 80&nbsp;per cent. of initial decisions are now made within two months. We have brought forward legislation to deter unfounded asylum claims. As my hon. Friend knows, there have been three major pieces of legislation since 1997, as well as the Bill currently before the House on which detailed consideration will begin next week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_343">We believe that that process of reform should continue, and we are rolling out what we call the new asylum model that will result in tighter case management of asylum claims through to the final outcome, whether that be integration or removal. The new policy of limited leave for refugees is a return to one of the basic principles of the Geneva convention&#151;that generally someone is a refugee only for as long as the conditions that mean that they will be at risk of persecution continue to exist. It brings the UK into line with most other European countries&#151;that is an important point to stress. France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, for example, all require a refugee to complete a period of temporary leave before applying for permanent residence. Refugees are now granted five years&#039; limited leave from day one, which may&#151;I stress that word&#151;be subject to review if they bring themselves within the scope of the refugee convention&#039;s exclusion or cessation clauses through their own actions: for example, where a person commits a terrorist act or re-establishes himself in his country of origin.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_344">Those triggers for review are not new. The new element is that refugee status and limited leave may&#151;again, I stress that word&#151;also be reviewed where there

<br>&nbsp;<br>is a significant and non-temporary change in conditions in a country or part of a country that places in doubt the continuing need for protection in the UK of all or certain groups of refugees from that country or part of it. We would determine that such changes had taken place on the basis of objective country information. When we determine on the basis of that information, and other sources such as case law, that certain categories of claim are likely to be clearly unfounded and that the change is of a durable nature, we will consider whether to instigate a review of previous grants of refugee status and limited leave to those falling within the scope of those categories.

<p>
<a name="51010-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_345">However, I can give my hon. Friend assurances on a number of points, and I hope that they will go some way towards reassuring him. First, any review will be conducted on a case-by-case basis, and the burden of proof will be on the immigration and nationality directorate&#151;

<p><a name="st_347"><a name="51010-39_spnew0"><b> Helen Goodman  (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</b> 
 The Minister makes an important point about addressing this on a case-by-case basis. He said earlier that one of the key things about the policy is that it should be reasonable. I put it to him that its whole approach has been drafted from the perspective of adults, not children. Five years is a long time for a child to be in one country. Will special account be taken of situations involving families with children? To have one&#039;s childhood torn up once is a tragedy, but to have it torn up twice is devastating.
</p>








<p><a name="st_348"><a name="51010-39_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s point. I stress again that the review will be conducted on a case-by-case basis. The circumstances, such as country conditions, will be the trigger for a review but the factors that she mentions will be taken into account in any review of a specific case. I am sure that my hon. Friend believes as we do in the Home Office that that is the right thing to do. Reviews will be conducted on a case-by-case basis and the burden of proof will be on the IND to determine whether the individual continues to qualify for refugee status and limited leave.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_346">The second assurance is that any decision to trigger a review on the basis of a change in country conditions will be made only following consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

<p><a name="st_349"><a name="51010-39_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 Will the trigger mechanism for a specific case and country be reported to the House for debate?
</p>








<p><a name="st_350"><a name="51010-39_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I was about to deal with that point, which is very fair. The third assurance is that the scope of the review, before its conclusions had been reached, would be communicated to the House through a written ministerial statement.

<p><a name="st_351"><a name="51010-39_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 The Under-Secretary will have heard last week&#039;s reports about regular criticisms of the country reports as inaccurate. The new process is welcome but it is no good if the reports that lead to the decision are inaccurate and therefore give wrong information that could prove fatal if someone is sent back to much more dangerous circumstances than the country report suggests.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_352"><a name="51010-39_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. The quality of the country reports is obviously crucial in reaching a reasoned and fair judgment on the conditions and circumstances that exist in a country. The reports originate in the Foreign Office. The hon. Gentleman will have seen some of them. The material is drawn from many different sources; the documents are well grounded. If he considers the recent process that we went through on Zimbabwe, great effort was made and care taken to establish the conditions in that country. I can give him the assurance that he wants. We will continue to take great care in establishing facts on the ground before taking further action. We do not want to act on wrong or misleading information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_347">We are ensuring through the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill that refugees will have an in-country right of appeal against a decision to take away their leave and that the decision will not take effect until that appeal has been heard. I can further assure my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow that when an individual no longer qualifies for leave as a refugee, we would always consider whether a grant of leave on another basis was appropriate, for example, on European convention on human rights grounds. Although it is possible that some refugees will be allowed to remain because they have established a private and/or family life in the UK, we need to get the balance right between offering a family a permanent life in the UK and expecting them to return to their country of origin if conditions improve there.
</p>








<p><a name="st_353"><a name="51010-39_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 The more I listen to the description of the mechanism that will operate, the more I wonder whether we want it. The Home Office has enough to do&#151;it has enough backlogs for years. Do we genuinely want to take on all the work of reviewing cases and clogging up the appeals system for the relatively small number of people who are given full refugees status? For that small number, the decisions are tremendously important. From the Home Office point of view, are the benefits of the new mechanism worth all the effort?
</p>








<p><a name="st_354"><a name="51010-39_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I shall describe some of the exact processes of the review shortly. I believe that that will give my hon. Friend some assurance about the work load for the Home Office. I stress that we are not considering a system that will continue as it has done in the past. We do not want an overloaded and sclerotic system, from which people cannot get clarity or a decision. We have enabled claims to be decided much more quickly, and we want the system to be able to function quickly and to give people clarity in a much more timely manner than we have achieved hitherto. I think that my hon. Friend would accept that one of the problems with the old way of doing things was that people were left in limbo for so long.
</p>








<p><a name="st_355"><a name="51010-39_spnew8"><b> Michael Jabez Foster  (Hastings and Rye) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister has gone to a great deal of trouble to explain what he intends to do, but he appears to be developing a very complex system, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) says. Has the Minister made any assessment of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Oct 2005 : Column 134</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>obligations and costs that these measures will place on his office, and of whether any extra resources will be provided to support this complex system of review?
</p>








<p><a name="st_356"><a name="51010-39_spnew9"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Yes, we have. I think it will be of interest to my hon. Friend if I describe some of the ways in which the measures will work in practice. The ability to move cases through the system more quickly has enabled staff time and resources to be deployed in different ways, and we have obviously weighed up those considerations, but if I describe the system, it might make more sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_348">A number of hon. Members have given the impression that the new policy will leave a sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of all refugees for up to five years. I do not believe that that will be the case. Nor do I accept that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal will be swamped with appeals flowing from decisions to curtail leave granted to refugees. Many of the countries that generate large numbers of refugees, regrettably for those who live there, are unlikely to become safe and stable within the next few years. I anticipate that declarations that country conditions have changed will be used sparingly. The Government consider, however, that it is right in principle to undertake a case-by-case review of grants of refugee status and limited leave when there is a significant and durable change in a particular country affecting some or all categories of claims. I stress again, however, that many of the countries that we are talking about are unlikely to reach the position in which there would be a trigger for review. We all know from our constituency postbags that not many countries have experienced such a change in in-country conditions as to warrant the kind of review that we are discussing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_349">If a refugee completes five years&#039; leave without a review having been triggered, there will not be an in-depth review of their case as a matter of routine when they apply for settlement before the expiry of their leave. We would, however, check to ensure that the triggers for review on the basis of the cessation clauses had not previously been missed. We would also check for evidence of serious criminality or exclusion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_350">Some have suggested that the change of policy will have a damaging effect on refugees&#039; entitlement to benefits and services, and undermine their integration into the UK. I am clear that this is not the case. Refugees continue to have access to key mainstream benefits, as well as to social housing and to employment. The Government are committed to ensuring that refugees are able to contribute to their communities while they are in the UK, and to participate fully in our economy and society. For that reason, they will retain access to a whole range of assistance, including personal integration plans, mentoring and integration loans. Indeed, we are currently legislating to ensure that refugees with limited leave will have access to such loans. By promoting integration, we will ensure that refugees can contribute fully to the life of the UK while they are here. If conditions improve sufficiently to allow them to return home, the skills that they have acquired here should stand them in good stead for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_351">I do not believe that my hon. Friend is right to say that the measures will set back the good work that has been done on integration in communities up and down the country. We are currently embarking on the reform of

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_352">Finally, I want to touch on the position of resettled refugees and changes to humanitarian policy. We have decided that refugees arriving in the UK under resettlement programmes such as Gateway should continue to get immediate indefinite leave to remain. These refugees have been outside their countries of origin for many years and have no realistic prospect of returning there. Many are held in UN camps in different parts of the world. Integration in the first country to
