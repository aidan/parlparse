 We certainly want every opportunity to be explored. I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s interest and support. The Severn barrage could create up to 35,000 jobs over the nine-year construction period, half of them in areas surrounding the Severn estuary. It is anticipated that in the longer term about 40,000 permanent jobs would result from the barrage, which would lead to economic regeneration in terms of recreation, transport, housing, industrial and commercial property, tourism and infrastructure development. My hon. Friend is right that renewable energy has enormous potential not only to fight climate change but to strengthen the economy and to create more jobs.</p>

 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interest in that issue, and the Sustainable Development Commission is looking into it. However, previous assessments suggest that a lagoon alternative in the Severn would produce less than a third of the generating capacity of the barrage, and in addition the barrage would save about two and a half times more carbon dioxide emissions than a lagoon. Prior to any further investigations at least, the barrage therefore appears to me to be a much better bet, and it would also offer the opportunity of a transport link between Taunton and south Wales, which could be of enormous benefit on both sides of the Severn.</p>

 Yes; my hon. Friend raises an important point. The European Union birds and habitats directives must be considered in relation to the project. However, I should draw it to the House&#146;s attention that the experience at La Rance river in France is that biodiversity can increase as a result of the construction of a barrage. Also, if we are not prepared to take bold steps to fight climate change, biodiversity will be, in a sense, a secondary matter. That will be the case if we get the terrible consequences to life on this planet that would come from climate change, which can be avoided by the adoption of projects such as the Severn barrage, which could create up to 5 per cent. of the UK&#146;s electricity-generating needs.</p>

 While I welcome tidal energy in the Severn estuary, is the right hon.

However, given that all bar one of the Labour deputy leadership candidates said on &#147;Newsnight&#148; that they support more nuclear power stations, including the right hon.

 It is not a sham. I have always made it clear that if a nuclear new-build is necessary in order to keep the lights on, it would be irresponsible to rule that out. As the hon. Gentleman knows, no one is more enthusiastic about clean, green renewable energy than me. Indeed, I often have scraps with Liberal Democrats about wind farms and other sources of clean, green energy, because they are in favour of green energy in principle, but in practice differences can arise. However, I think that we can work together to make sure that Wales benefits from all forms of energy. Sometimes there is a demand for a replacement nuclear power station. That is the case in Anglesey. The local council and my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) support a replacement of the existing nuclear power station, and they deserve to be supported.</p>

However, will the Secretary of State assure me that funds and support will not be diverted from established and emerging options into one big project, such as the Severn barrage? If we are serious about security of energy supply and lowering carbon emissions, we need a rich energy mix.</p>

 We do, and we need our energy to be developed and sustained as much as possible in home-grown forms, so that we are not dependent on fossil fuels imported from abroad, including from many unstable areas of the world. So this is not just a climate change but a security of supply issue. However, I see no conflict here between strong renewable energy and considering the nuclear option in Anglesey, for example, if that is appropriate. The Severn barrage is a privately funded project; the construction companies&#151;McAlpine, Balfour Beatty and others&#151;that formed a consortium intend to fund it privately. Indeed, that is the point: there would not be a big draw on public funds.</p>

 Will the Secretary of State assure me that despite the obvious, early and absolute backing for the Severn barrage scheme given in answer to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), the Secretary of State is not going to rule out investigating tidal lagoons? Has he had the opportunity to read the research produced by Friends of the Earth showing that the generation cost from tidal lagoons is more economically beneficial than that from the barrage; and will he give this House and the people of Wales an absolute assurance that he will carry out full investigations into the environmental impact of the barrage and of the lagoons, and not rule out the lagoon option at this stage?</p>

 I can assure the hon. Lady that I am not ruling it out; indeed, the Sustainable Development Commission is looking at this option. However, the facts are reasonably clear&#151;unless they are contradicted by any further study&#151;that the barrage would generate masses more power and is lower in emissions, and there are other benefits. The risk in the Severn area of flooding, especially as sea levels rise, is enormous, and the barrage would clearly help by providing a much securer environment for local houses and businesses. It also offers the exciting prospect of a transport link, with Cardiff airport being just round the corner. So there are benefits, which is why there is a lot of support in the south-west of England for this proposal, especially along the coast. The local regional development agency, for example, supports the idea of a barrage. So that is where my preference lies, but obviously we will look at the evidence.</p>

The process is working well in Wales and we now have more than 2,200 doctors in training in Wales. The number of training places in Wales will rise from 261 last year to 320 next year. The investment in doctors&#146; training and medical students is proving to be a great success, and that is why we are seeing substantial improvements in the quality of care being provided in Wales and in England.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for that optimistic response.

 The facts are that there are no Welsh patients waiting more than eight months for treatment in hospitals, including the Royal Shrewsbury, compared with 900 a year ago, and in the past three years the number of Welsh patients waiting for more than six months for a first appointment at an English hospital has fallen by 61 per cent. Those are significant improvements. Yes, further improvements can be  made, but the Welsh Assembly Government will spend &#163;5.5 billion on the health service in Wales next year, amounting to &#163;1,800 per person, something that could not be achieved by the hon.

 In discussing with the First Minister his proposals for climate change legislation, will the Secretary of State ensure that the First Minister is fully aware of the controversial cross-border issues that will arise over proposals for the Severn barrage? Will the Secretary of State and the First Minister ensure that before they proceed they visit the barrage de La Rance at St. Malo, where they will see how over 40 years, and to generate only 3 per cent. of the electricity of Brittany, the environment has been devastated and biodiversity has been sterilised? The impact of the barrage on that part of France has been devastatingly bad and there will be great opposition to the Severn barrage on those grounds alone.</p>

When I raised this with the Prime Minister two months ago, he promised a review of the unclaimed assets and said that he would try to get the maximum compensation level.

Secondly, let me point out to him that the reason why we have not gone beyond 80 per cent. is that it is wrong to promise that we can go further than that unless we can say how it will be paid for. We simply cannot, on the basis of the Treasury loan scheme or the idea of unclaimed assets, make future spending commitments outside the  &#163;8 billion. That is not sensible and it is not responsible. As for suggesting that we are not helping people, it is true that more than 1,000 people have already been helped, but in the years to come there will be tens of thousands more.</p>

 There are 1 million more people who receive treatment, but the right hon. Gentleman is right to say that we need to go further. The commitment is to do that by 2010, and I hope that we will recommit to that at the G8 summit at Heiligendamm. In addition, the announcement by the Americans to double their HIV/AIDS spending from $15 billion to $30 billion is extremely important. The Germans have now committed an extra &#8364;3 billion of aid to Africa over the next four years, which is also important, and this country is making a huge contribution to fighting HIV/AIDS. Yes, we need to go further, but it is important to realise that, as a result of what was done at Gleneagles, 1 million more people are now receiving treatment.</p>

 Charities such as ActionAid believe that the specific proposals set out in the draft communiqu&#233; do not go nearly far enough, and they believe that the goal agreed at Gleneagles is on the verge of collapse, which would result in millions of preventable deaths. We have long argued for interim targets, as the Prime Minister knows. Does he agree that it would be a disaster if the current wording of the communiqu&#233; is allowed to stand?</p>

 We are trying to strengthen that language and put in some specifics, particularly in relation to HIV/AIDS treatment. For obvious and natural reasons, pressure groups always say that not enough is being done or that the situation is in danger of collapse. Since Gleneagles, however, there has been almost $40 billion of debt relief; there have been substantial increases in aid, including to Africa; millions more children are in primary education; and, as I said, 1 million extra people are receiving HIV/AIDS treatment. As I saw for myself last week in South Africa, the possibility, if we expand the use of drugs for those people, is that we can save millions of lives, so we have to do so. It is precisely to achieve those types of commitments that we will go to the G8 and negotiate.</p>

They have the winter fuel allowance, the free TV licences for the over-75s, and a substantial uplift in many of the payments that are made through the pension credit.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I know you take very seriously the convention that Members should notify other Members when they go to their constituencies, so I wanted to ask for your advice about this matter. When the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) was conducting her deputy leadership tour on Friday 25 May, she not only appeared in my constituency, but featured in the local newspaper. My office has been in touch with hers to ask for an explanation of that oversight and still awaits a reply. Could you, Mr. Speaker, perhaps give me some advice about what I can do about it?</p>

 I beg  to move,</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070606/debtext/70606-0004.htm"/>


<a name="70606-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07060669001339"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the establishment of a Federation for the Armed Forces; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07060669000147">I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this Bill today. Last year, I had the pleasure of serving on the Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill. During consideration in Committee, I moved new clause 23, which would have established the formation of an armed forces federation open to serving and retired members of Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces, both regular and reserve. I have to say that I was neither surprised nor disappointed that the new clause was not accepted, but our consideration of it allowed the Committee to discuss the issues surrounding it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07060669000148">I now believe that there is a groundswell of opinion among the public as well as among members of the armed forces that it is time that those members should have an independent voice to represent their interests. Recent controversies surrounding accommodation, the treatment given in medical facilities to injured personnel returning from Iraq&#151;and, of course, the scandal at Deepcut&#151;have highlighted the increasing need for members of the armed forces to have an independent voice and to ensure that it is heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07060669000149">There is also increasing evidence that members of Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces need to have access to independent legal advice. In the previous Parliament, I also served on the Committee that considered the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004. It was clear from those deliberations that members of Her Majesty&#146;s armed services needed independent employment advice and advice about their pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07060669000150">I propose not a trade union but a federation along the lines of the Police Federation. I want to build on the excellent work already done by the British Armed Forces Federation, which was set up in 2006, has recently been incorporated as a company limited by guarantee, and is now recruiting members. The work of Douglas Young and his team at the BAFF has been important in raising awareness of such issues among members of the armed forces. The Bill would put the federation on a formal recognised footing with the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07060669000151">The aim of the Bill is to encompass the 10-point plan put forward by the BAFF, which states:</p>
<a name="70606-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="07060669001340"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The federation&#146;s mission shall be to represent, foster and promote the professional welfare, and other legitimate interests of all members of the federation in their capacity as serving or retired personnel of the fighting services of the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07060669000152">That will help to maximise the operational efficiency of our armed forces and improve retention and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07060669000153">The activities of the federation would cover five main areas: first, professional and career development through the provision of education and information; secondly, liaison, monitoring and response to proposals or developments within the armed forces and in Parliament, and the provision of services in the public or commercial sector for armed forces personnel; thirdly, advocacy and consultation to protect and improve the conditions  <br>

<notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2007 : Column 261</b><br>
of service life, including pay, accommodation, medical and welfare services, resettlement packages and all other areas of support for armed forces personnel and their families; fourthly, support to personnel facing court martial or other legal proceedings in connection with their service; and finally, negotiation of commercial benefits for armed forces personnel and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07060669000154">It is important that the federation is seen to be independent, and is not beholden to any political party, pressure group or defence interest. While the federation needs robust and adequate funding, it is important that it is not seen as just another pressure group for defence interests. The federation will not take a view on defence strategy or operational decisions, although it may raise individual, legitimate concerns affecting its members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07060669000155">To clarify, I reiterate that the federation will not be a trade union for the armed forces. It will not conduct or condone any form of industrial action or insubordination within the armed forces. The federation will seek to work with the Ministry of Defence to put in place a form of understanding that could deal with such issues. It will also recognise the importance of the chain of command. If we look at the BAFF&#146;s website, we see that it clearly reinforces the point that the chain of command is to be recognised, not overridden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07060669000156">The proposal might be seen as radical and dangerous by certain members of the armed forces, and possibly by some Opposition Members. But may I point out that many other nations, including the United States and Australia, already have such federations, which have the support of the military command in those countries? The proposal, however, is not to copy those, but to bring forward a British solution for the British armed forces. It will reflect the ethos and robust traditions of the three fighting services, but it will also meet the requirements of men and women who are serving in our armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07060669000157">The best example that I can give is that of the Armed Forces Federation of Australia. It is an independent voice on pay and allowances and represents members of the armed forces on employment issues. It also gives legal advice, financial assistance and advice, and allows for discounts and savings schemes nationally for all members of the Australian armed forces. The federation is controlled and structured by its members and is independent of the Australian military, although it has the backing of senior military figures. In the introduction to its latest handbook, Air Chief Marshall Houston says:</p>
<a name="70606-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="07060669001341"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As an independent representative body for military personnel, I welcome the Federation&#146;s continued contribution to the development of personnel policies for the ADF&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07060669000159">The Bill would not set up an armed forces federation; it already exists. Instead, it would allow the BAFF to be recognised by the Ministry of Defence and be valued for providing a voice for ordinary members of our armed forces. The BAFF has already stated that if legislation, such as this Bill, were introduced, it would look to work with the Government and stakeholders to develop the appropriate structures for the representation of members of our armed forces. The Bill provides just that opportunity, and I urge the House to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07060669000166">Let me be clear from the outset: Conservative Members believe in ensuring that all patients in our NHS will get better care in future, from the expertise, dedication and wonderful work of NHS doctors, nurses, therapists and, yes, NHS managers, by harnessing information technology to improve the processes for patients&#146; treatments and their clinical outcomes. So, yes, we endorse the aims of the NHS national programme for IT, known as NPfIT and succeeded by Connecting for Health, which we support in principle, but&#151;it is a big &#147;but&#148;&#151;the reason for the debate, in Opposition time and in the absence of the Government bringing such an important and costly programme for debate on the Floor of the House, is to highlight, sadly, the woeful shortcomings of the way in which the Government have first designed and then sought to implement this vital programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07060669000167">The fact that the shortcomings were identified and predicted by us and many others over the past five years puts the onus on the Government not only to account for their delays, design U-turns and serial incompetence, but to accept that it is the official Opposition who now offer a constructive way forward in the interests of NHS patients&#151;a constructive approach that is consistent with all that my hon.

this IT programme that they would stop it in its tracks expect me to call for even an audit. That would imply, as audits do, that we want to look back at something that has stopped&#151;finished. We do not. Rather, it is because we believe in the positive potential benefits of IT in the NHS, implemented correctly, for the good of patients and the morale and professionalism of all staff, that we now call for a full and independent zero-based review. We want to see a contrast with the Government&#146;s performance to date: we want to see the programme put right, because that is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07060669000169">The review&#151;and this is the difference between a review and an audit&#151;can and must be carried out while work on the programme is in progress, to prevent even more lost time and, potentially, lost lives. If the Government do not agree to a full and independent review today as a result of our call, we will, as a matter of urgency, set one up ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70606-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07060669000170">Why is the need for a review so urgent? It is because this is some remote, geeky, abstract topic, with IT experts arguing about the best platforms, protocols and data-sharing mechanisms and employing all the gobbledegook jargon that passes for language in the ethereal IT world, but because the Department of Health itself claims that the care records service&#151;only one part of the programme&#151;will prevent &#147;thousands of unnecessary deaths&#148;. As the programme is already at least two years late, by the Government&#146;s own admission the consequences of its incompetent implementation must be those very thousands of unnecessary deaths. That is the real cost of the delays, the incompetence and the lost opportunity&#151;let alone the estimated financial opportunity cost of &#163;1.4 billion of taxpayers&#146; money. According to the National Audit Office, that was the cost last year, and it is rising.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman, my constituency neighbour, for allowing me to intervene. Given that he does not want the system to be scrapped&#151;and given that  there are now 19,778 instances of IT deployment, the 250 millionth picture archiving and communication system record is now in existence, and the 22 millionth prescription since the last Conservative-initiated debate has been issued; the number has risen from 237 million to nearly 250 million&#151;he must recognise that real progress is being made.

 On the contrary. The hon. Gentleman has made something of a speciality of trying to understand this issue. He has read out some of the statistics in the Government amendment, but if he looks at the measures that the Government have set themselves, he will realise that the statistics in the amendment are irrelevant even to those. Furthermore, the electronic prescriptions account for only 5 per cent. of all prescriptions, which is way below the Government&#146;s own target. Those statistics are, in fact, a mark of the Government&#146;s lack of progress. Although they may indicate the progress that the hon.

 My hon. Friend is making an excellent case. Does he agree that confidence in NHS IT projects in my constituency has been fundamentally shaken by two failures in the past six months? First, because of an IT failure, ambulances were diverted from taking patients to Royal Surrey county hospital and took them to Frimley Park hospital. Secondly, a failure in the choose and book system made it difficult for GPs to book people into appointments at Royal Surrey county hospital, as opposed to neighbouring hospitals. What did they both have in common? They took patients away from Royal Surrey county hospital, which is currently threatened with closure.</p>

However, there are still other systems that must be brought up to standard.</p>

<a name="70606-0005.htm_brev2"><a name="07060669001349"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One of the things they haven't done very well is to clarify some of the benefits...I haven't seen a good list of benefits&#148;.</p>

The paucity of the evidence base testifies to the hurried planning and procurement of the programmes. With at least &#163;12.4 billion of taxpayers&#146; money being committed, some cost-benefit analysis should have been done, and a robust business case established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70606-0005.htm_para8"><a name="07060669000204">The growing cost of the programme has been the inevitable and wholly avoidable consequence. The programme was launched with the putative cost, as we know, of &#163;5 billion, which was excised from the document. Once the contracts were signed, the ministerial line was that it would cost &#163;6.2 billion over 10 years, although Lord Warner admitted on &#147;Newsnight&#148; that</p>
<a name="70606-0005.htm_brev3"><a name="07060669001350"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the full cost of the programme was likely to be nearer  &#163;20 billion&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70606-0005.htm_para10"><a name="07060669000206">Despite the highest paid civil servant being in charge of Connecting for Health, the programme has suffered from a lack of leadership. In two years, there were no fewer than six &#147;senior responsible owners&#148; of the NHS IT programme at Richmond House. Lack of leadership was one of the key themes of this week&#146;s PAC report into Government IT. It highlighted the failure of Ministers across Government to meet the senior responsible owners of mission-critical and high-risk IT programmes, or to take a grip by meeting them sufficiently regularly. It also highlighted the low profile and high turnover of chief information officers and the lack of clarity about their roles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70606-0005.htm_para11"><a name="07060669000207">To all of that we must add that one of the design flaws of the NHS IT programme has been its massive centralisation. The programme structure has, in effect, established several regional monopolies through local service providers. From the original four, there are now three providers serving five regions: the CSC Alliance  <br>

in the north-west and west midlands, the north-east and the eastern clusters; Fujitsu Alliance in the southern cluster; and the Capital Care Alliance&#151;CCA&#151;in the London cluster. CSC took on two clusters from Accenture when it pulled out of the programme in September 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70606-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07060669000208">Hospitals have been forced to accept the IT imposed on them by those local service providers, or in some cases have had to invest in costly interim solutions due to delays in the programme. A recent BMJ study into the implementation of the programme suggested that the Connecting for Health software is more expensive than software on the open market. One medical director said:</p>
<a name="70606-0005.htm_brev4"><a name="07060669001351"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A lot of things are being sold to us at a much higher price than we would have been able to get if we&#146;d been in a real market situation, so the total costs to the NHS have been very high indeed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70606-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07060669000209">Those regional monopolies have caused serious supply-chain concerns. The exit of Accenture&#151;at an estimated loss to it of &#163;250 million&#151;was a big blow to the credibility of the programme. The supplier that has been most in the public eye is iSOFT. Its share price has plummeted twice&#151;that is public information&#151;and on 6 April the shares fell a further 40 per cent. It appears that iSOFT&#146;s previous accounting policy, which it has now had to abandon, was based on its receipt of letters of credit, centred around advance payments from NHS Connecting for Health. In evidence to the PAC on  26 June, Richard Granger of Connecting for Health stated that it would make an advance payment only when covered by a letter of credit from a bank. That is nice work if you can get it. <i> [Interruption.] </i>That completely undermines the Department&#146;s claim that suppliers get paid only when they deliver. <i> [Interruption.] </i>But as the Minister cannot be bothered to listen, she will not understand that.</p>

The trouble is that she is so bored by IT that she has not bothered to have regular meetings, or to supervise or take a grip of the process. She needs to listen to a proper critique of where the Government are wasting taxpayers&#146; money, and to take control for once of a programme for which the Government are deeply responsible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned iSOFT and the role of the private sector. Following on from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), may I caution the hon. Gentleman about IT projects in the private sector? IT projects across the piece&#151;in both the private and public sectors&#151;are notoriously difficult. This project comprises several programmes and we are all aware that it has not gone smoothly. However, it is wrong to have a rose-tinted view that things go smoothly in the private sector. The difference is that the private sector hides things. Moreover, when iSOFT was booking revenues and declaring them against future revenues, which is very dodgy accountancy practice&#151;it has been caught doing that&#151;the chair of its audit committee was that private sector champion, Sir Digby Jones.</p>

 Whether or not things were hidden or inefficient in the private sector, at least scrutiny was exercised by both competition and shareholders. It appears in the public sector that the Government have also been seeking to hide things. Why else have they not had a debate on this subject on the Floor of the House? The Opposition have had to secure this debate. Furthermore, taxpayers&#146; money has been used and the Government have created a series of monopolies for delivery, and they are not exposing that to the true test, which is competition. Competition is one of the best ways of making sure that things are not inefficient and not hidden.</p>

Will the Secretary of State come to the House to state that that will be made clear in the literature going out to patients at the pilot sites?

 Does my hon. Friend agree that choose and book might have been a lot more successful had there been proper consultation with key stakeholders&#151;namely, the GPs who use the system?

It is noteworthy that when the Conservatives were last in government, the NHS was one of the last bastions of garage-built computer and paper systems. Despite the Labour Government&#146;s inheriting from the Conservatives in 1997 an NHS that was spending approximately 2 per cent. of its overall budget on computer systems, the one thing that unified almost all the systems bought for the NHS by that Conservative Government was their incompatibility and their inability to pass information from one site to another.</p>

well thought through four-year programme to develop pilots of electronic records. The electronic record development and implementation programme, known as ERDIP, led to a number of small-scale yet successful local installations. The key issues that contributed to this programme&#146;s not being sustainable in itself were the need for it to be taken up on a national basis and to deal with the unaffordability created by this local development. Such affordability issues were driven by significant cost inefficiencies as a consequence of small-scale local procurements and a high degree of variability in the software from one NHS location to another. During 2001 and 2002, it was with these lessons in mind from the preceding three years that we established a strategy group under the auspices of Professor Sir John Pattison, then director of research analysis and information at the Department of Health, in order to pull together a strategy that we published in 2000, entitled &#147;21st Century IT for the NHS&#148;.

I will concede that there are unavoidably a number of users who have not been consulted, but during the four-year pilot process the NHS Information Authority, and predecessor organisations such as the information management group, undertook extensive consultation with end-users about the content of the national strategy. We now have a system in place through a rolling programme of service implementation, led by a veteran NHS manager, Richard Jeavons, to ensure that before the implementation of systems all users, especially those on the front line, are satisfied with what they are receiving and how it will be implemented.</p>

It has also established user forums for live systems and continues to improve these systems in line with feedback from users. Perhaps the greatest example of the way in which the national programme for IT does listen to its end-users relates to the picture archiving and communication systems, or PACS. Today in London, every NHS hospital is now equipped with that type of system. That means that patients wait significantly less time for reports and follow-up consultations, that films are no longer lost and that care is delivered more safely and efficiently. Picture archiving was not part of the programme when the contracts were let in 2003. Those systems were added to the contracts in 2004 in direct response to feedback from front-line clinicians and groups representing patients, so the system has been updated and remains as flexible as possible to take account of new IT developments.</p>

One such example is the choose and book system. It benefits a patient nearly every second of any day.

It resulted in modifications both to the requirements and the consent model from what was proposed in 2002. Far from regretting that aspect of delay in the programme, I think it was a prudent course of action. In our opinion, to have proceeded hastily with the delivery of the system, in the absence of consensus for the consent model and the content of the summary care record, would have been ill advised.</p>

For example, any doctor outside a GP practice who makes an emergency visit to a patient in the middle of the night would have an up-to-date and accurate summary of the patient record in front of them without having to put questions to an elderly patient who may or may not know the answers, or even be in a position to give them.</p>

Although much may be heard within the confines of Westminster about the public&#146;s concerns about confidentiality, it is the case that less than 0.2 per cent. of patients in the early adopter communities for the summary care record have so far expressed a wish to opt out of the summary care record as it is launched.</p>

As the Minister responsible for vaccination programmes and public health, I am concerned to ensure that we have joined-up systems in terms of vaccination. There are clearly real issues in London in respect of the movement of families from one side of the city to another. I have taken them up by holding meetings with Connecting for Health and Department of Health officials responsible for immunisation so that we can tackle some of the problems and make sure that the systems are fit for purpose.

 We are of course looking at exposure risks in the networks&#151;at issues relating to access, PINs and smartcards&#151;as well as the offences that are appropriate if individual members of staff misuse their security access and clearance.

 Does that not demonstrate that we are open to listening to all voices in the debate? We do not approach this from a narrow, partisan point of view. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that it is useful if people are transparent about who they are providing advice to and the parties for which they are writing  IT policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70606-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07060669000288">In our opinion, it is lamentable that a programme that is focused on the delivery of safer and more efficient health care in the NHS in England has been politicised and attacked for short-term partisan gain when, in fact, it is to the benefit of everyone using the NHS in England that the programme is provided with the necessary resources and support to achieve the aims that Conservative Members have acknowledged that they agree with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70606-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07060669000289">Owing to delays in some areas of the programme, far from it being overspent, there is an underspend, which is perhaps unique for a large IT programme. The contracts that were ably put in place in 2003 mean that committed payments are not made to suppliers until delivery has been accepted 45 days after &#147;go live&#148; by end-users. We have made advance payments to a number of suppliers to provide efficient financing mechanisms for their work in progress. However, it should be noted that the financing risk has remained with the suppliers and that guarantees for any advance payments have been made by the suppliers to the Government. That contrasts sharply with the policy of the Conservatives when they launched the now abandoned policy of financing IT projects through the private finance initiative. The national programme for IT in the NHS has successfully transferred the financing and completion risk to its suppliers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70606-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07060669000290">It is untrue that there is not a firm timetable for delivery.

However, each software delivery from BT, the contractor concerned, has been on time for more than 12 months. Similarly, the quality management analysis system for GP payments was delivered on time. The picture archiving system is on time. The core software for choose and book and the electronic prescription service has been delivered on time, and the network underpinning all those applications was delivered&#151;[Hon.

really understand the computer industry. I do not claim to be an expert on it, but I spent some of the previous Parliament as a member of the Work and Pensions Committee, which produced a report on computers. The Conservative motion calls for a &#147;full and independent review&#148;, but the NAO has already carried out a review. Given that the nature of the industry is such that there are few suppliers, where on earth would the Conservatives get an independent body to conduct such a review? It does not exist. If there were a big enough body with sufficient expertise to carry out a review, it would certainly be in the system of government already.</p>

<p><a name="st_o149"><a name="07060669000293"><a name="70606-0007.htm_spnew7"><a name="07060669001624"><b>Caroline Flint:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend. The review is a red herring and part of the attempt constantly to undermine the good progress that is being made under the national programme. The Conservatives are trying to build in more stalling mechanisms, instead of constructively engaging on delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70606-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07060669000294">When the Department of Health published the principles of the procurement arrangements for the national programme in January 2003, it stated clearly that it intended to transfer financing and completion risk to the supplier community. All suppliers bid voluntarily for the delivery of services to the NHS under those contracts, and in a small number of cases there have been significant supplier failures. While that is unfortunate in itself, it is fortunate that the costs of those failures have not been borne by the taxpayer. Simply pouring further funds into inefficient and often paper-based administrative processes might be what is recommended by the experts advising Conservative Members, but the Labour Government believe that a properly supported and financed national programme for systems in the NHS is absolutely essential to how we deliver health services in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70606-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07060669000295">There is strong evidence pointing to the fact that the chaotic and ad hoc procurement of local systems delivers poorer care as a consequence of tests being unnecessarily repeated, patients&#146; treatments being delayed and appointments having to be rebooked when information is not available. Properly networked systems operating across multiple locations with a high degree of standardisation are the common-sense solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70606-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07060669000296">Far from there being a significant opportunity cost to patient care, efficiencies are delivering significantly better patient care as a consequence of the NHS having a universal wide-area network, an online demographic service that is accessible from more than 7,000 locations and used by more than 50,000 front-line staff each day, and a picture archiving system, the deployment of which throughout the whole country is nearing completion. It would be naive to imagine that the implementation of such long overdue and complex systems would not be without disruption. Many end-users are far from disillusioned; they are delighted to have modern tools available. That is especially the case in community settings, where staff, especially nurses, were frequently dependent on paper and often needed to visit offices to obtain notes and details of further visits.</p>

Unfortunately, Professors Ross Anderson and Martyn Thomas were unable to articulate any firm grounds to substantiate an independent review, other than the existence of a large volume of negative media coverage&#151;I have seen it&#151;some of which they generated.

My plea to Ministers and to Labour Back Benchers is that they should acknowledge that there are genuine anxieties and problems. What winds up health professionals most is Ministers simply refusing to acknowledge that there is a problem.

 Indeed, it was noble. I note that the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) does not entirely accept the argument for secrecy. Earlier, he asked what the proposed review should cover. In March, we put it that first there should be an assessment of whether it is still possible to achieve the original stated objectives, and if so, within what time scale. I shall return to this point later, but given that many IT experts state clearly that it is not possible to achieve those objectives, there is a powerful case for including that consideration in the review. Secondly, the review should consider the impact on health trusts and on general practitioners&#146; surgeries of the delays in completing delivery of the project. The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) made the point that hospital trusts are having to acquire interim solutions because they cannot wait any longer. That is pretty crazy, and it is an extraordinary waste of resources.</p>

 Let me complete the points about what should be included in the review. Thirdly, there should, for the first time, be a proper cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the scale of the project can be justified. To my knowledge, that has not properly been undertaken; if it has, it certainly has not been made public. Fourthly, there should be a full assessment of the civil liberties implications of the national spine. I hope that Labour Members share our concern about ensuring that people&#146;s rights are not undermined or compromised because of the risk, even with summary records, of very sensitive information getting into the wrong hands.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s observation&#151;it is important that records are properly protected, but conversely, does he accept that in years to come, when the system is fully flowing, if the No. 73 bus hit him, it would be rather a good idea for the first responder instantly to blood-match him, identify his allergies and so on? There are costs and benefits to be traded off, and we need to work carefully on that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman proves my point: a cost-benefit analysis has to be done, so that we can balance the potential benefits. On the example that he gives, when I talk to clinicians, they are somewhat resistant to the idea that it would be valuable for them, if I got knocked over by a bus in Cornwall, readily to access my records on-screen in Cornwall. They say that there are protocols that they would follow in those circumstances, and that if there was any error in the national records, mistakes could be made. I repeat that the hon. Gentleman makes the case for me that a cost-benefit analysis needs to be conducted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="70606-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07060669000338">Finally on the review, there should be a proper and thorough consideration of where we go from here.

 On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s complaint about delays with the project, is not one of the problems with his proposal the fact that it will cause injury to patients, as his review would further lengthen the time needed for the implementation of valuable projects? Reviews have taken place, not only at the gateway stage but throughout the project, and that has indeed caused delay. On the gateway reviews, is it not important that there be a degree of confidentiality, so that consumers, end-users and suppliers can be honest in any dialogue about what works and what does not? Surely that is more important than the hon. Gentleman being able to read gateway reviews, if he so chooses.</p>

 I pray in aid the Minister&#146;s comments: she said in her speech that it was better to get it right than to rush ahead. That is precisely what she said in justifying the delays that had occurred. The experts whose opinion I have read who have argued the case for review say that it would be possible to conduct a review quite quickly; it would be a matter of weeks, and not months. Surely it is in the Government&#146;s long-term interests to conduct such a review, and to make sure that wherever we go from here, we have the backing of clinicians and, hopefully, everyone in the House.

He has substantial experience in the NHS and with the national programme, so we should take his evidence seriously, as I am sure that Labour Members will agree. He focuses on the central infrastructure for the national patient data, and he highlights the fact that Connecting for Health has not published any details of the calculations that it made to demonstrate that implementation on the scale envisaged is technically achievable. He says that Connecting for Health has not presented that evidence to us. He asks what records clinicians should rely on if there is a difference between the records on the national register and those held locally. It is quite possible that there may be a difference between the two because of inputting errors. Who is accountable for clinical or care errors resulting from reliance on the national summary record? He has direct experience of the national programme, and his conclusion is that the Government should acknowledge that the original goal is unattainable.

In November last year, <i> E-Health Insider </i>reported hospital plans to replace the patient administration system just 18 months after it had been introduced. The Nuffield orthopaedic centre reported problems with the installation of Cerner software, with patient records disappearing. We cannot be happy about such experiences. An insider described the system as a &#147;white knuckle ride&#148;. Is that something that should give us confidence? In September last year, <i> Computer Weekly</i>, which has already received a fair airing in our debate, referred to the fact that there had been 110 major incidents&#151;incidentally, Tony Collins has spoken to me, too, so it is not just the Conservatives to whom he is talking&#151;that impacted on patient care.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that under previous systems, particularly before 1997, there were numerous examples of systems breaking down, not for days but for weeks? The paper system, as well as a system in which computers could not even communicate from one GP practice to another or from one hospital to another, left much to be desired in terms of patient safety. I acknowledge the fact that there have been some breakdowns, but it is wrong to distort the problem by failing to compare it with the systems that the NHS operated in the past, both electronic and paper.</p>

 I fully accept there were many problems, but that is no reason for failing to be concerned about the situation or failing to acknowledge the concerns of people working in the system about the problems that are occurring here and now. In April this year, 79 doctors and admin staff in Milton Keynes hospital wrote that the patient administration system was &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;. It was reported in May this year that the Royal United hospital in Bath had still not had its Cerner software installed. The system was supposed to go live in November 2005, but the hospital was still waiting in May.

When Labour was in opposition I was shadow health spokesman for a while, and I went to my local hospital to look at the patient administration scheme. That hospital, Rotherham district general hospital, is now famous for its work with Gerry Robinson, which was on BBC television earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70606-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07060669000385">When I visited the hospital, it had just introduced a pass scheme.

We have been paying for electronic patient systems in the primary and acute sectors for decades. Those sectors have had the choice to buy what they believed to be right for their little part of the national health service. We have allowed patients, some of whom have ongoing medical needs, to be discharged from the acute sector without anybody asking the question, &#147;Why can&#146;t we contact the primary care sector electronically, so that the ongoing care that this patient needs is provided?&#148; I am not saying that that is happening today, but that is one of the major issues behind the national programme. As someone who is concerned about health care and the use of taxpayers&#146; money, I say that something should have been done decades ago. There should have been some choice about what was put into surgeries or hospitals, but such bodies should at least have had the ability to talk to their immediate health family neighbours about the needs of the patient. That did not happen, and that is what the national programme is about.</p>

As Members of this House, we should talk about not only clinicians&#146; choice in how they spend our money, but patients. Where does the patient come in all this? In Homerton hospital today I saw a great system, and other members of the Health Committee saw it, too. It allows appointments to be booked electronically in clinics before discharge. It does not allow the hospital to talk to the local GP practice, but the system is a bit better than that used at Rotherham district general  <br>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate. I have followed the national programme for IT in the health service for several years, principally because of my membership of the Public Accounts Committee and that Committee&#146;s interest in value for money, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency and economy. Of course, IT projects are notorious, across Governments of different political persuasions, for failure to deliver. The national programme for IT in the health service is the largest civilian IT project in the world. For that reason alone, I have been following its progress with great interest.</p>

That is what we do. I say in parenthesis that I agreed with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about private sector IT contractors. Of course, things go wrong with such contractors and they are better at hiding it. I hold no brief for any national or local IT contractors or any specific supplier.</p>

 That is a good question. The company has a range of other products. Many experts would say that some of them, especially some GP systems, work well. However, what people would be paying for if they bought iSOFT is a moot point. It is especially worrying that CSC announced this morning that it might consider a bid for iSOFT. The idea of having a vertically integrated model under which the local service provider actually owns its main software subcontractor is very worrying at a time when the Government, the Department of Health and the NHS are only just beginning to acknowledge the need for more choice locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07060669000417">In that environment, if CSC actually owns iSOFT and the area is controlled by CSC, it is hard to see how, if that bid went through, other suppliers of competitive products for mental health and other aspects, such as primary care, would get a look-in. It was an odd reflection on customer relations when iSOFT sought last week to improve its relationship with CSC, which must be one of its biggest customers, by saying that it was probably going to take legal action against it. That is not what one normally thinks of as a way of improving relations with one&#146;s biggest customer. The company seems to have come to its senses yesterday, saying that it was probably going to suspend the legal action for the time being.</p>

Clearly, it is not the Government&#146;s fault that iSOFT is a thoroughly dodgy company, but does the hon.

I also commend the excellent work of Simon Bowers on the financial pages of <i> The Guardian. </i>Yes, the DTI should get involved and the current investigation by the Financial Services Authority should be speeded up. No, it is not the Government&#146;s fault if iSOFT is a dodgy company, but it may be their fault if, not having exercised sufficient and due diligence, they continue to make advance payments through the local service provider and in effect prop up a dodgy company that has failed to deliver, has made false statements about the availability of its products to the stock market, and has misled investors, the public and the NHS.</p>

No. Does it mean that if they do not want to, they will not have to install iSOFT&#146;s Lorenzo&#151;apart from the fact that it has not been written yet? No, it does not, so they do not really have choice. I fear this is all about not real localisation, but the decentralisation of blame. It is about handing over to others the responsibility for implementing the unimplementable, and then being in a position later to blame them when they cannot do it. I thus have my doubts about the national local ownership programme. </p>

 It probably will, which is one of the reasons why I suspect that CSC has been sniffing around with iSOFT&#146;s banks. By the way, iSOFT was not aware of this until after it had happened, but CSC&#151;the local service provider for three fifths of the programme&#151;has been talking to its main software subcontractor&#146;s banks about buying iSOFT&#146;s debt, presumably because that would put it in pole position for a bid, should it wish to make one. I believe that it is incumbent on the Government to state their view of local service providers owning a main software subcontractor and the potential impact on competition and choice, which are essential if we are to get out of this mess. Greater choice, I believe, is essential.</p>

Member for South Derbyshire nodding in agreement&#151;that a lot of the problem is about human behaviour, changing attitudes and so forth. In order to do that, we have to have ownership. The question is how we get ownership, and the answer is through choice, and by making local trusts accountable for choosing what they want, and then accountable for delivering it. That, rather than having systems foisted on them that they do not want and will not use, is what is needed. We must have more choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07060669000425">Some hon. Members have referred to the Public Accounts Committee report, which I had some hand in.

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07060669000426">My belief is that such a review of the performance of LSPs against their contractual obligations would strengthen the Government&#146;s arm in the negotiations that would be necessary if the value of the contracts were reduced. Let us look at what has been going on with British Telecom in London, for example. BT employed the software firm IDX for a considerable period, and my best estimate is that about &#163;200 million was spent before it sacked the firm and moved over to the Cerner product. The effect is akin to owning a Ford transit van, getting rid of it, then buying a Mercedes van, but still trying to do the maintenance with the old Ford transit manual; it does not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07060669000427">The money is completely wasted, yet neither BT in London nor CSC in its areas&#151;not to mention Fujitsu in the south&#151;has done anything to try to account for the losses that must have been made. At least Accenture had the honesty to come up front and say that it was making provision for $450 million. I am certain that the other local service providers are hiding millions of pounds&#151;probably hundreds of millions&#151;of losses. The Government ought to be aware of that now, because it has consequences for the behaviour of the LSPs in trying to claw back money because they did not make any on the contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07060669000428">Finally, I want to say a quick word about CSC and iSOFT. I have already mentioned them in passing and in response to interventions. We cannot overstate the importance of the fact that three fifths of the national programme for IT in the health service depends on this relationship between CSC and iSOFT, so it is of considerable interest that the president of European business development, the president of the northern region of the UK and the Netherlands, the senior vice-president of global infrastructure services for Europe, the middle east and Africa, the vice-president of service delivery for Europe, the middle east and Africa, the service delivery director of the NHS for the original contract in the north-west region, the vice-president for new NHS accounts, the chief operating officer for Europe, the middle east and Africa, the vice-president for service delivery to BAE Systems, the president for CSC southern region, and the director of services for global accounts have all resigned quite recently. I therefore wonder in what fit state this company is, in terms of its senior management, to continue to be a local service provider, let alone to bid for one of the main software subcontractors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07060669000429">It is interesting to note that CSC in Europe, the middle east and Africa has recently announced a continuation of the two-year freeze on all training. What does that mean for the NHS? Contrary to what the Minister said earlier, I do not think that Opposition Members have any interest in protecting local service providers or IT suppliers. We want to see competition and choice and things working. It is not obvious to me from the available evidence that CSC is in a particularly healthy position.</p>

 To give my background briefly, I was an IT director before coming to this place. At one time in the distant past, about 15 years ago&#151;which shows how easy it was to conceive of such things&#151;I did an acquisition study of a small company that sold systems to general practitioners, in which I dismissed the original purpose of the acquisition and instead set out an argument for a network in information provision in the NHS. At that time, my company did not choose to buy into that&#151;it was correct in thinking of the huge risks that lay ahead. Nevertheless, it was possible some years ago to conceive of many of the things discussed today in relation to the NHS IT programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07060669000434">To be honest, any IT programme is misunderstood in this place; we are talking about business change programmes facilitated by technology. Some key preconditions exist for success in that area. First, the project must be rooted clearly in a business strategy. Challenging targets must be set by the business that wishes to run the project. A clear understanding is needed of the environment in which the project will operate. There also needs to be an understanding of the politics of the organisation, any professional constraints that might be in the way, protectionism&#151;which is almost inevitable, and on which other Members have touched briefly&#151;where the accountabilities lie for delivery of the project, and the balance between local and central decision making in delivering outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07060669000435">As the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) said, any project is largely about people, not technologies. More than 10 years ago&#151;given that I have been in the House for 10 years&#151;I used to advise my company that its task was to conceive of the business that it wished to run, and that by and large we would find the technologies to deliver what it conceived of. In relation to people, the critical issues to be resolved are normally their motivation, their engagement with the goals of the project, and how to retain them through a process of disruption and change, which many might find unwelcome. The project needs clear organisational leadership, both professionally and at board level&#151;and, in the context, at political and ministerial level&#151;to ensure a clear direction for the project. That leadership needs to be focused on delivering the benefits identified in the first place, and on resisting creep and diversion, which are all too readily put forward as the directions that any project should take. I shall return to that issue.</p>

in the collection of projects under discussion, and there are problems inherent in working within the NHS. One is a lack of what most people in the private sector would regard as corporate accountability. General practitioners are effectively small businesses, with their own IT choices and a history of making such choices. Consultants are not actually employees, but carry out duties within a defined contract. There is also a huge problem of scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07060669000437">There are also problems inherent in working in a political environment, such as the likelihood of high-profile opposition to what is being attempted, and changes in political leadership&#151;not changes of Government, but the reshuffling of Ministers, once they get some grasp of a subject, into another job in double quick time. A learning process is involved, and the management of projects of such a scale and complexity takes time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07060669000438">Other problems have been introduced from outside. One of those is the restructuring of primary care trusts and other trusts through the project, so that partners established at local level to deliver certain parts of the programme have changed, and have had to reapply for their jobs and reconsider their futures, which is certainly a risk that would have to be taken into account. I was surprised by the view expressed by some Opposition Members that there is no local process, and that everything is centrally driven. In fact, each trust must produce its own business case for implementing substantial parts of the programme. Bearing in mind that skills and enthusiasm are differential, passing that task on to those trusts has also introduced significant risks to the project. Most suppliers would have started by thinking that the project was likely to be a bed of nails.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70606-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07060669000439">Many of the people involved in working in the NHS would have had dissenting opinions.

It would not have covered everyone who had an opinion, however, because opinions are numerous in that organisation. The consultation could be going on now and still leave many unsatisfied. I am not therefore surprised at the dissenting voices.</p>

Too many suppliers were tempted by the scale of the opportunity and the potential for sell-ons of technologies developed under the contract into other environments. I attended a briefing with CSC yesterday, and it was reasonably clear that that was its view, and it was certainly its interpretation of Fujitsu&#146;s view of how it participated in the programme in the first place. In spite of my repeated question as to whether CSC were making money, it was extremely careful about what it said in response.</p>

I have been involved in cancelling a major IT project, and there are points at which one must simply say, &#147;We are not achieving what we set out to do, and we should be brave enough to own that.&#148; I assume that there is a proper review process within the project; certainly, there is a process through the Office of Government Commerce gateway mechanism to examine how the project works.

 The review in which I am interested is outlined in the recommendation in paragraph 4 of the PAC report&#151;a review of the contractual obligations into which local service providers originally entered. My contention is that that would strengthen hugely the arm of the Government and release resources, as it would show that LSPs have in many ways failed to meet those obligations.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman is interpreting the motion, and if that is what it means, I would accept that that is a helpful step. That has not been explained, however, in the vague and sometimes naive remarks made on the subject by those on either Opposition Front Bench.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07060669000446">There certainly needs to be further robust engagement on the care record, its design and security. I say that partly because I have a concern myself, but also because we have an opportunity to reassure the profession and re-engage them in the project. The argument for sharing the care record was extraordinarily well made by the appalling incident of the woman who repeatedly contacted an out-of-hours service but there was no inherited memory of her previous contacts with it and what had been said. As a result, she received no proper treatment for her condition. Obviously, having a decent care record even within one organisation would have been a huge benefit in that example, and the case for it to be shared on a wider scale is clear.</p>

 I pay tribute to the knowledge and experience of the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), who is at the very least smooth, and almost plausible, in his defence of the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07060669000452">At times like these it is clear that we have a poverty of ambition as a Parliament in holding the Executive to account. Frankly, that would not be the case were we in the House of Representatives in the United States. The Government have criticised the Opposition for bringing to the attention of the House the fact that an IT programme initially mooted to cost &#163;2.6 billion is now likely to cost &#163;35 billion or perhaps &#163;50 billion. As you will have seen yesterday, Mr. Deputy Speaker, <i> The Daily Telegraph </i>reported the bizarre and appalling situation, especially given the warm words of our new Prime Minister un-elect that he is open and listening, of civil servants, under the auspices of the Office of Government Commerce, being encouraged to shred documents, in particular reports that are critical of the mismanagement of the NHS IT programme. How we can be lectured by the Government that it is inappropriate that we should draw that to the attention of the House and the electorate is perverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07060669000453">As my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) said, we are dealing with a huge programme involving 30,000 general practitioners and 300 hospitals, and which has risen exponentially. The last official figure was in June 2006, when the National Audit Office put the cost at &#163;12.4 billion, but in May last year, Lord Warner no less said that it may be  &#163;20 billion or more.</p>

The Government have generally sought to disregard the PAC&#146;s report, published in April 2007, but its remarks need repeating. Being critical of the Government and the way in which the programme has been handled is not to say that we inherently disagree with the programme. Of course we believe that it is right to proceed in that way, but individual Members of Parliament with an interest&#151;I have the honour and privilege to serve on the Select Committee on Health under the chairmanship of the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07060669000456">The report says specifically that the pilot schemes are two years late, especially in relation to the care record service, and that no fall-back date is in place, although Ministers disagree with that. Cost estimates are opaque and have not been fully quantified. There has hitherto been no proper cost-benefit analysis on what will have been delivered to the NHS when the contract ends in 2014. We have heard that Accenture has pulled out of the project at a loss of anything between &#163;240 million to &#163;385 million, along with other IT providers, IDX and ComMedica. Other companies with the skills and experience have not come on board for the programme. We learned earlier that iSOFT faces an uncertain financial future, and we will see whether it manages to stay afloat after its refinancing later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07060669000457">The key point is that despite protestations from the Government, health care professionals up and down the country have not voted to support the programme with their opinions and have voted with their feet. I said that it is all very well for Ministers to say that choose and book is working, but if they do not collate the figures properly, there is no way they can fully understand the efficacy of that particular record system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07060669000458">As we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), the number of GPs that support the programme has plummeted from about  55 per cent. a year or so ago to the most recent figure of only 26 per cent. We have a North Korean-style thumbs down from readers of the <i> Health Service Journal</i>. In a poll of its readers, 97 per cent. said that they did not believe that the choose and book target could be met by March 2008. Incidentally, that is the third target; the other two were missed. We now have approximately  38 per cent. take-up of choose and book, although we do not have the raw data to confirm that.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07060669000460">It is reasonable for people who make their living as professionals and experts in information technology in the academic world to express a value judgment on the success or otherwise of the programme. It is right to draw attention to the fact that core software has not yet been delivered, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk said. There are issues about technical architecture, project planning and detailed design, and about the estimate of the amount of data and the traffic in the programme when it is fully operational. That is a fair point to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07060669000461">There is a degree of complacency. I draw the House&#146;s attention to the Minister&#146;s comments last year, when she said:</p>

administration system. Incidentally, the Department of Health promised a year before that 35 acute trusts would have it in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07060669000464">I have some key questions for Ministers. Before I ask them, however, I want to deal with the questions asked by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) about privacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07060669000465">I was present when the Health Committee heard evidence from the Patients Association and others recently, and I must respectfully tell the hon. Gentleman that I think he over-egged the pudding slightly in describing the dangers involved in privacy issues. It is incumbent on him, and on others, to prove that the changeover would have a significant negative impact on most or all patients. However, he made an important point about accountability. At present patients benefit from a degree of accountability through their local primary care practices and local trust, but that accountability will be removed if all data are transferred to a national system. We are talking not about articulate, intelligent, well-read middle-class people but about the most vulnerable, those who are least able to say: &#147;I do not want my medical records to be online.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07060669000466">These are my questions to Ministers. When will they engage properly with health care professionals to win their support for the implementation of a system that has demonstrably failed so far? Will they ring-fence primary care trust funds for expenditure on opt-out information? Will they concede that there has been a systemic failure as a result of the dichotomy between national contracts for procurement and the local delivery of those contracts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07060669000467">We need action now. I strongly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury that we need a full, zero-based review as well as an audit. We need an annual statement of where we are now and where we will be in 2014. As one or two Members have said, we need to disaggregate local delivery to local trusts where appropriate, with a wider range of suppliers in the IT market. We need to review current performance, and we need to communicate the importance of the programme to all health care professionals more effectively. I agree with the hon. Member for South Derbyshire in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07060669000468">The consequence of failure is massive. The expenditure of &#163;50 billion of public money should give us all pause for thought. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury said, this is not just a &#147;techie&#148; issue; it is about the importance of reforming the NHS through choose and book, about electronic prescriptions, and about the care records service. If mistakes are made, people may die.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07060669000469">As the right hon. Member for Rother Valley observed, patients should be at the very heart of our considerations. The Government must get a grip on the situation. They owe it to patients, they owe it to my constituents, and they owe it to the whole country. It is right and proper for us to call the Government to account today, and for the Government to explain why this has happened and how we can adopt a bipartisan approach to ensure that we deliver the results that patients expect.</p>

published about the purpose of the project and the safety case for it. That is manifestly untrue. The introduction to a document entitled &#147;Supporting  the Patient Safety Agenda&#148; clearly explains the purpose of the scheme. It tells us:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07060669000471">That, then, is the core reason for the programme&#146;s existence. I shall say more in a moment about the work undertaken thus far&#151;enormous strides have been made&#151;but I am glad to see that the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), has arrived, as I am about to refer to him. He wrote the foreword to a document called &#147;Computerising the Chinese Army&#151;Information Systems in the NHS&#148;, which has been mentioned tangentially by a number of Opposition Members. That is not surprising, because it originated from a Conservative think-tank. Contributors include Tony Collins of <i> Computer Weekly</i>, the shadow Secretary of State and Dr. Simon Moores of the Conservative Technology Forum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07060669000472">Having read the document closely&#151;particularly chapter 10 on the proposed action plan&#151;I can see the genesis of the Opposition motion. It is the result of people thinking very carefully about how to exploit what is, after all, a complex change management programme, described in some detail by my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd). In a sense, it is pushing at an open door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para26"><a name="07060669000473">I have experience of dealing with change management programmes, having been both poacher and gamekeeper. As was acknowledged by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), people have been put on the spot. They do not like having change imposed on them. The net consequence is a potential for what could be described as insubordination in the ranks. In one company with which I dealt, a senior director fed shop stewards information to undermine what he saw as the damaging impact on his bailiwick of the change management programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70606-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07060669000474">If I have any criticism of Ministers, it relates not to the superb work being done by Richard Granger and his team, but to the management of people in the process. In preparing for the debate, I noted how successful the roll-out has been&#151;contrary to what one would believe from some assertions, and contrary to what I must tell my colleagues on the Public Accounts Committee was a very out-of-date PAC report. As I said earlier, there have now been more than 250 PACS records: as of this week, 25.981 million digital images have been stored. That is a fantastic success. The roll-out has made enormous progress, complex though it may be.</p>

Members who think it is a big joke and who appear never to have heard of the people I mentioned, would have read Professor Sampson's letter in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, in which he fundamentally criticises the NHS IT programme. Those hon. Members say that they have never heard of him&#151;perhaps they do not read <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>. Professor Sampson is at the university of Sussex. He has been fundamentally critical of the work of the project, and here we have a complex interaction between people who may not be members of the Conservative party&#151;I am not sure where they fit in&#151;but who are heavily engaged in some outside bodies that are seeking to influence Conservative party thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07060669000489">Against that background, we look at the reality of what is happening in the NHS IT programme. That is where it becomes mission-critical. We should dismiss the motion out of hand as it is ridiculous. There are, of course, ongoing reviews within the management of the process. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire said, reviews took place in both the industry and the Department, and there is an argument for such reviews being more transparent. However, the facts cannot be refuted: there are now some 354,559 users of the NHS IT system within the NHS and among prescribing pharmacists and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07060669000490">I agree that there are issues to do with security of data. The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) expressed concerns about that, and it is inevitable that there will be security issues. However, it is not unreasonable to state that the vast majority of those who manage our NHS on a day-to-day basis&#151;the doctors, clinicians, pharmacists and administrators&#151;are fantastic and fundamentally honest people who work their socks off for the benefit of the NHS. Having said that, there will of course be the odd rogue among them who will sell data, as there is among police forces and in any other organisation that holds data, and we should rigorously apply data protection rules. I would make further recommendations if I had more time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07060669000491">The system is growing. This week alone, almost  7 million picture-archiving and communication records were added to it. This year, a further 307,000 new studies were added, taking the overall figure to more than 11 million. As the system is growing effectively and consistently at a great pace, it does not require an immediate review. The Tory party wishes to force that on it because it wants to make cheap, opportunist attacks on the Government. What the system needs is firm management to take it through some of the difficulties that it has faced, so that we can make sure that we have a world-class and world-beating IT system that leads to the improvement of the health of all citizens.</p>

the internet. In any major IT project&#151;the one we are discussing is the largest in the world&#151;account must be taken of the technologies that are developed and those that are under-developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07060669000493">I spent about 20 years in the IT industry; other Members, including the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), have also spent a long time in industry and have had dealings with the IT sector. Anyone who has worked in and around the IT industry comes to learn bitter and painful lessons about the implementation of IT systems. One thing that we learn fairly early on is that if we choose a brand new, bespoke system&#151;one that has never been used before and is created specifically for one purpose&#151;we are bound to come a cropper. We in the IT industry use the term &#147;bleeding edge&#148;&#151;rather than leading edge&#151;technology. That is where the purchaser and the person responsible for a project endure a lot of pain in the attempt to deliver something that ends up not being delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07060669000494">There is also a point to be made about automating inefficiency. If the system currently in service in the NHS does not work efficiently, by automating it we simply make the inefficiency even more part of the system, which is not good. In letting large IT service contracts from the public sector, we must also consider motivation. If a civil servant or a Secretary of State is not accountable for the failure of an IT project, their motivation is to play safe&#151;to get in consultants to make the points that they wish to hear from them, so that ultimately they can say it was the supplier&#146;s fault or the consultant&#146;s fault. I fear that in this case, that is what has been going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07060669000495">We must bear in mind the fact that if one is paying a consultant by the hour, their motivation is no doubt to prolong matters for as long as possible&#151;unlike my speech, which I shall end now by saying that it would be far better if patients were able to choose whether to be part of the national patient record system. It would also be far better if GPs could choose from various systems, and if the Government now chose to accept a review, which would highlight some of the deficiencies in their approach.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) and his expert remarks. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon.

She accused the previous Conservative Government of spending less than 2 per cent. on IT, but she did not know how much she has spent. She touted our figure of 2 per cent., but she should have known that in 2005-06, she spent 1.92 per cent.&#151;revenue and capital&#151;which is rather less than the 4 per cent. that Wanless recommended.

Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), whose remarks I usually value, did not want to draw parallels between MTAS and the national programme for IT. I say to him in all respect&#151;dream on. The MTAS debacle has lost the confidence of a generation of junior doctors. The very people whom the Government need to operate NPfIT have seen how the Department of Health mishandles its own confidential material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07060669000501">would have secured the resignation of a Minister. Apparently, however, these Ministers do not think this matter serious enough. It is hardly surprising that the Medix polling organisation found that 79 per cent. of GPs feel that the national electronic care record service will damage confidentiality, and that 51 per cent. would not upload records on to it without explicit consent. The remarks of the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) about GPs&#146; reluctance in the Bolton pilot in that respect were very relevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07060669000502">A cohort of doctors will grow up bruised by the experience of having their addresses, phone numbers, sexuality, faith and criminal records displayed for all to see, with nobody apparently responsible. We know that nobody was prepared to take charge, because when &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; asked a Minister to respond to the MTAS security breach in April, nobody was available. However, the Health Secretary did eventually pop up to reassure the House that only a couple of dozen or so unauthorised users had found the relevant MTAS URL. Unfortunately, one of them just happened to be &#147;Channel 4 News&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07060669000503">The Health Secretary hinted darkly at that time that criminals might be involved. Was this a smokescreen to prevent further discussion? If not, six weeks on, how many charges have been brought, what involvement has the Criminal Records Bureau had, and what disciplinary action has she taken? Given the monumental scale of this disaster and the inevitable contempt in which doctors will now hold Department of Health IT systems, it is vital that appropriate action be taken if there is to be any NPfIT buy-in by the health care professionals whom the Health Secretary expects to operate this system.</p>

I have to say that that is pure supposition without a shred of evidence to support it. If Ministers were genuinely exercised about the need for transportable medical records, why have they not been promoting more vigorously the simple devices that already exist for people at risk? If Ministers imagine that doctors will spend time bashing away on computers trying to download the details of&#151;they hope&#151;the patient in front of them, Ministers need to get out more. I am struggling to recall times when I was a casualty officer and the absence of the sort of data that Ministers assure us is so critical genuinely affected the outcome for my patients.</p>

Can he say<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I hope that the Minister is paying attention, because my last question is very important and I would like a specific answer to it. What back-pedalling will be necessary, given the divergence that emerged last month between Europe&#146;s data protection commissioners and the Government in respect of the electronic patient record?</p>

an enthusiasm for what they are pleased to call &#147;local ownership&#148; and in March they issued a tender for bids to become &#147;additional systems suppliers&#148; from which individual trusts will be able to buy. Given NPfIT&#146;s sheer scale and its extraordinary cost, why has the Minister not come here of his own volition to explain an apparently significant change of tack? Is it because he would have to admit that his troglodyte stateist solution has caused good local systems that were working effectively to be dumped? Is it because he would have to admit to having alienated the very people that he now invites to make the national programme work&#151;our long-suffering health care professionals?

Will the Minister explain how the public interest&#151;not his political interest&#151;is served by withholding the gateway reviews that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70606-0012.htm_para33"><a name="07060669000527">In an extremely practical way, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) talked about the reality for a patient in his local hospital. He described the outdated, luddite handling of a discharge, which would have led to the patient not receiving the care that we would expect a modern health and social care system to provide. Use of the technology is about making a reality of our aspiration to a patient-centred national health service, as well as empowering front-line professionals to do the job as they want to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07060669000528">The hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) is not exactly an objective observer on these matters. He refuses to acknowledge the system&#146;s benefits of archiving, networking and core infrastructure. He selectively marshals evidence that does not represent a true or balanced picture of the benefits of the system. He referred to Milton Keynes, but the local organisation in Milton Keynes refused help from both the strategic health authority and Connecting for Health. Since our intervention, many of the problems have been resolved and significant progress is now being made. The hon.  <br>

Gentleman also referred to questions about the iSoft group. The press statement on that issue that was released today is readily available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07060669000529">My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) is an expert specialist in this area. He defined the characteristics and components that represent a good approach on the project management of the system. His main message was that he believed that best practice was being applied on the whole. He made it clear that he thought that the key was for the Government to hold their nerve. At this stage, it would be wrong to go into reverse on the project because that would have a damaging impact on the NHS and patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07060669000530">The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) raised the question of the disposal of documents by the Office of Government Commerce. Of course, that has nothing to do with the Department of Health. Connecting for Health was fully submitted to the OGC&#146;s process of gateway rating and was given a green rating virtually every time. The hon. Gentleman also talked about escalating costs, but every time that the programme has been examined independently and objectively, it has been acknowledged that, on the whole, the programme is on budget and not in overspend. I would have thought that he would welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07060669000531">My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) talked about the vested interests that sometimes apply when opposition is articulated against the project. He also referred to the motivation of some individuals with a common view about the use of technology to improve public services. That view is out of date. If we truly want to provide responsive, modernised and person-centred public services in a modern world, advanced technology and the sharing of information and data are absolutely crucial.</p>

 I welcome the investment in the NHS, not least because I hope that the Department will sign off on a new &#163;400 million hospital for north Staffordshire in the next few days. However, I have by no means been uncritical of the IT system, and I have followed iSoft along with Ian Griffiths, a former colleague who has investigated its affairs. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a shame that the contributions from official Opposition Front Benchers were not as thoughtful as that of a Conservative Back Bencher, although he was critical, namely the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07060669000534">The Government have saved and repaired the national health service. However, our challenge is now its transformation. To achieve that, we need to use the full potential of modern scientific and technological advances so that we can make people better and save lives; provide health care closer to patients&#146; homes in a way that is tailored to individual needs; give patients maximum information, choice and control; empower doctors, nurses and other professionals so that they can offer world-class patient care; and tackle the health inequalities that are an affront to a civilised society. We need advance and progress that are rooted in the Government&#146;s principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use, irrespective of ability to pay, and  <br>

</ul><a name="70606-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="07060669001405"><ul><p class="tabletext">The way forward is compulsory insurance. It is up to the Conservative Party to think innovatively and radically about a health shake-up that will benefit all.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07060669001061">We have initiated this debate for a number of reasons. One of them is that too infrequently does the House ever look at the overall picture of an entire Department. Over the past few months we have debated energy, the Post Office, and Select Committee reports, but we have never stopped to take an overall look at the functions and effectiveness of the entire Department. It is the purpose of today&#146;s debate to try to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07060669001062">The attempt to take an overall look comes at a timely moment. With the inevitable series of changes that will follow the change of Prime Minister, there is likely to be upheaval in a number of Departments, reform, change and reallocation of responsibilities&#151;and the newspapers are full of rumours that the Department of Trade and Industry is under the spotlight. Many think that the Department is even fighting for its very existence, and that it may not be long for this world. It is important to take a step back and assess and evaluate the purpose and effectiveness of the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70606-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07060669001063">The DTI does not enjoy a high reputation among many people who have to deal with it. It is easy to deride.

In a world of globalisation where free markets are left to be free as much as possible, the interference from a Department should be minimal.</p>

It said that it did not want the competitiveness agenda to be undermined in critical policy areas, including employment and energy.</p>

However, I agree with him that it needs to undergo a complete cultural transformation. That is what, essentially, I am trying to convey to the Secretary of State.</p>

We have debated post offices several times. In 2001, the Government promised to keep them open except in unavoidable circumstances. Those unavoidable circumstances appear to be arising thick and fast every day. The Government have presided over the largest annual closure of sub-post offices. In total, more than 4,000 have closed since the Government came to office. We know from a recent statement that they intend to close a minimum of a further 2,500 in the next two years. That amounts to a closure rate three times that under the Conservative Government.</p>

It was the product of the Government&#146;s third major energy review, under their eighth Energy Minister. Yet no definite decisions have been made about the future of our electricity generation.

Government, and share the same view. The only thing that we have not done that the Liberal Democrats have done is to rule out nuclear power altogether&#151;a simple posture that is unrealistic in its assumptions about how electricity will be generated in future. I will tell the hon. Gentleman exactly what Conservative party policy is. We want a cap and trade regime for carbon, in which permits are allocated as far as possible by auction and far less by historic use. We want a properly understood and priced regime&#151;the Government have been slow on this&#151;for handling waste. We would reform the climate change levy, which attacks nuclear energy even though it is a non-carbon-emitting process, and we would have a fair planning regime in order to enhance the regime under which a future nuclear power station can be built by having site and type approval.

 That would depend on a number of factors. One is the early and effective advance of carbon capture technology, which I am coming on to in a moment, and another is the scale and scope of the contribution that the renewables sector can make. There is no doubt that in the absence of carbon capture, it will be very difficult to make the carbon emissions reductions that we all want to see. The Government have to admit&#151;this is partly another charge to be levelled against the DTI in some respects&#151;that carbon emissions are rising and that their plans are probably insufficient to meet their emissions targets. In March the Government signed up to an ambitious EU target to get 20 per cent. of all energy from renewables by 2020, but the measures outlined in the energy White Paper are nowhere near sufficient to meet it.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that he was very quick in bringing this matter before the House after the statement was made. In fact, I too raised it during the statement, and no indication was given of any difficulty with it. Given that the Government have announced that there is to be a competition, and given that the current partners in the Peterhead scheme have already invested about &#163;50 million in the pre-engineering phase, most of which appears to have been lost, what confidence can other projects have in this competition, which the Government are to announce some time later this year?</p>

 As I understand it, the Government have announced a competition that will either open or close in November. By whatever means they hold the competition, they cannot escape from the accusation that research and experimentation in carbon capture has been deferred, probably by as much as two or three years, compared with the point that BP had reached. That is a disaster in terms of wanting clean coal to make an effective contribution to our power generation mix. The Government&#146;s track record on carbon capture is therefore pretty grim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70606-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07060669001100">The Government&#146;s strategy for nuclear waste is also unfortunate. Anyone who is to invest in a nuclear power station will need to know the planning regime and the costs of building and dismantling it. Those are now pretty well within the scope of a potential investor. But what they do not have&#151;and they can only get it from the Government&#151;is a clear understanding of the costs that they will face for handling, looking after or treating nuclear waste. Until the Government say in clear terms how new nuclear waste will be handled, and how the Government and the investor will interact, no company is likely to invest. If ever there were urgency, it is to clarify that. The Government have said that urgent decisions need to be taken about our future power stations, but no such decisions can readily be taken until they are clear about the handling of nuclear waste.</p>

The budget for science is about  &#163;3.5 billion, and is largely administered by the research councils. Broadly, the Government have done well on that. They have doubled the budget in the past 10 years. My criticism, however, is that science projects need continuity and certainty, which does not get bounced from one year to the next. I am critical of the Government&#146;s decision to claw back &#163;98 million from the science budget to pay for things that they knew had to be paid for, such as the Rover inquiry.

Let me point out the crucial deceit in the last Government. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry might not have seen it coming, but he should have were he genuinely defending British business interests.

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70606-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07060669001115">Let me turn to the issue of business support. A year ago, the Government announced their intention to reduce 3,000 business support schemes to a mere 100.  <br>

<notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2007 : Column 330</b><br>
Let us stop and think about that for a moment. The very fact that the Government imagine that a quantum leap can be made from 3,000 to 100 is a vivid illustration of the absurdity of the present regime. There are 3,000 schemes, and most people simply do not understand how they work. The Government are spending perhaps &#163;12 billion on these schemes, and can provide no measurable evidence of the effect of that expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70606-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07060669001116">Only 15 per cent. of small businesses have had any contact with the schemes. Instead of a clear structure for support, there are roughly 3,000 schemes administered by around 2,000 public bodies. That is absurd. The system needs vigorous and urgent rationalisation, a proper assessment of its effectiveness, and an explanation from the Secretary of State of how he expects it to work in the future. The chief executive of the Small Business Service has described it as</p>
<a name="70606-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07060669001411"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an incredibly complex system... an inaccessible business support system for customers that is inefficient and ineffective for Government&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70606-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07060669001117">That takes us to a issue on which deep thought is needed: the issue of regional development agencies, on which the Government spend the second largest amount in the DTI budget. Each of the nine RDAs  has a budget of anything between approximately  &#163;250 million and &#163;450 million, and for a long time there has been no convincing explanation or analysis from the Government of what good they actually do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70606-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07060669001118">As we all know, over the years Governments of different colours have wrestled with the best model for enhancing the economic development of our regions, and with the task of releasing pockets of poverty from economic inactivity. Where previously we had the development corporation model, involving some fantastically effective and evident flagship schemes in derelict docklands, we now have a lot of jam spread very thinly throughout the country. It is not clear whether that is to do with regional policy or with economic development. We do not know, for instance, whether the RDAs&#146; remit includes a demand that they should invigorate an enterprise culture in areas dominated by the public sector, such as the north-east.</p>

to the competition between them. Most people in India, China and Brazil, for example, think that England&#151;or the United Kingdom, for that matter&#151;is a small country stuck in the middle of the Atlantic. They do not know the difference between the west midlands and Tyneside, and they find that competition between the RDAs that turn up for the trade fairs trying to sell the wares of one particular region gets in the way of money coming to the UK.</p>

 I am going to come on to that in more detail in a minute, but essentially I agree with my hon. Friend. Regional development agencies opening offices abroad has become an absurdity. The Trade and Industry Committee has today published a report criticising the proliferation of those offices abroad. What is the point of having nine regional development agencies possibly competing with each other on the streets of Shanghai for business? That business needs to come to Britain if it possibly can, regardless of which region it goes to. It has become nutty. The Secretary of State needs to address that problem urgently.</p>

However, if one scratches a bit further, one discovers deep frustration among the business community about a wealth of resource ineffectively spent. It tends to be a spoonful of jam here and a spoonful of jam there, with a little joint venture in skills, a little joint venture in a building project and a little joint venture in some training project. That means that the RDA builds up an entire client base in its region and that, whenever there is a threat to abolish it, there will be people in the region who say, &#147;That is half my project down the spout. The RDA should stay.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70606-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07060669001125">The question we should ask is not whether RDAs should have all those partnerships with people that somehow justify their existence, at least cosmetically, but whether the RDAs are having a genuine effect and changing the culture of enterprise and the economic prospects of the region.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that, although it is true, as  my hon.

averaged out. Do they think that they should provide the bricks and mortar, restore derelict areas and clean up sites so that they are fit for further occupation? Do they think that they should be champions of infrastructure by asking that the A1, for example, be widened as it heads north past Newcastle? Should they be the ones that encourage enterprise and arrange for school leavers aged 16 or 17 to acquire the skills to get jobs that can give real added value? The RDAs do not really know what they are about. They are a bit of this and a bit of that. The danger is that in the end they are a lot of nothing. Therefore, I encourage a rigorous debate on the future of RDAs, with a clear picture, in policy and in purpose, of what they are there to do.</p>

The biggest gripe one regularly hears is that UK Trade and Investment is an ineffective body for the promotion of British trade overseas. It is thought that inward investment increasingly means buying British companies, rather than bringing new investment into the UK. It is thought that UKTI&#146;s efforts abroad are utterly fragmented and never cohere. It has concentrated on China, India and Brazil but its structure of offices does not seem to have much rhyme or reason. Although I accept that under Andrew Cahn much work has been done to sharpen up its act, under this Government we have completely lost the brand image of Britain abroad that we used to have. That is down to there being a multiplicity of offices, and to UKTI having lost its vim and vigour. That is destructive to the reputation and interests of British industry in other countries. I am also critical of the fact that DTI Ministers have made inadequate numbers of visits abroad to promote British interests.</p>

Personal visits abroad matter, but over the past 10 years DTI Ministers have paid very few visits to much of the middle east. Some of our closest allies have received no trade visits at all. I understand that the Secretary of State will soon visit the United Arab Emirates, which is to be welcomed. However, there is at present a lot of money in the middle east and despite the Iraq war there is deep affection for Britain. People in the middle east understand that Britain is a good place to put their hundreds of millions&#151;or even billions. We have neglected countries such as Oman and Kuwait.

During our exchanges across the Floor of the House, it is important that we record the fact that within the DTI, as within the rest of Whitehall, there are many dedicated and effective men and women who have served this Government&#151;many have also served previous Governments&#151;in an exemplary manner. Much that they do will continue to be necessary, however Whitehall is organised in future. However, it is important to record that many people have contributed greatly to policy development and, therefore, to the development of the economy.</p>

I am very happy to debate for the rest of our time today and on many future occasions the contrast between what has happened in the past 10 years and what happened in the previous 18. Indeed, as my starting point, I could do no better than quote the report of the very committee that was chaired by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), which the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said would be published shortly. I look forward to that. My understanding is that it was ready last December, so it must be really good if it has been kept back. It says, among other things, the following:</p>

 Whether or not it is advice into the committee, it is extraordinarily good advice and I commend the right hon. Gentleman on having given it. He well knows that there have been major structural changes in our economy over the last 10&#151;indeed, 20&#151;years, as I shall discuss shortly. Despite the fact that the services economy has grown rapidly&#151;I was surprised that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton did not say anything about that&#151;we still have a very strong manufacturing sector, particularly in pharmaceuticals and aviation, for example; I shall return to that issue shortly. The key for us, especially in today&#146;s global economy, is to make sure that the United Kingdom economy is a good place to do business&#151;we have that&#151;so that as these changes take place, we get the new jobs and industries and the new research and development that will ensure our future prosperity.</p>

That is 2.5 million people more than in 1997, and contrasts with the position for much of the 18 years in which the Conservatives were in power. People forget about that, but it should be remembered that whole generations lost the opportunity to get on and to do the best that they could for their families, because, at a time of massive change, no help was given to them when they needed it most.</p>

 I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman. Since 1997, through the new deal and other measures, this Government have done more than any other to help people who were previously workless to get back into work. Many of the measures that we introduced were opposed&#151;indeed, the Conservatives and the Liberals opposed the very funding of that programme&#151;but they have made a difference. The right hon. Gentleman is right in that there are still people who would be capable of work, with the right support, and we want to ensure that they get into work, especially at a time when the economy continues to grow. It is right both economically and socially that we do everything we can possibly do to achieve that.</p>

in the past 10 years and there was a 5 per cent. increase in research and development in 2005 over the year before. There is also much research and development and innovation taking place in intangible assets&#151;such as skills and software, which are not always captured in the statistics but are very important to the service economy&#151;and that is making a real difference. Of course, research and development in pharmaceuticals and aerospace are bearing fruit. Our pharmaceutical industry is doing extremely well, because that industry sees Britain as a good place to do business. Indeed, some firms have relocated their activities in the UK because they see it as a good environment in which to develop.</p>

However, despite being invited on three occasions to name three regulations that he would repeal, he could come up with only one&#151;the taking down of the no smoking notices. I am sure that for some firms putting up such notices might be a burden, but I would hazard a guess that even if they were all taken down again it would not make much difference to whether businesses felt free of regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70606-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07060669001153">I agree that reducing the regulatory burden on industry is essential. The companies legislation, which the House debated at length last year, removed many of the regulatory requirements on companies. The unfair commercial practices directive from the EU, something that is not universally popular in this House, repeals  22 separate consumer regulations. I am clear that the DTI has to play its part in reducing the regulatory burden. We should ask ourselves whether we need to regulate, and if we do not, we should not. It is important that we change the culture. Under successive Governments, if something undesirable happens,  there is a call to ensure that it does not happen again, so legislation is introduced, but sometimes the consequences are not fully thought through.</p>

 I do not agree. Many people in the oil industry said that they wanted stability in the North sea oil tax regime, but earlier this year when they saw the reduction in corporation tax rates in the Budget they said they would like to take advantage of them, too. I understand why they might say that, as I also understand why low gas prices, which actually benefit large sectors of our economy, might have an adverse effect on North sea investment decisions. In addition, owing to the high cost of operating in the North sea compared to other fields throughout the world, the industry has to tackle a number of issues. We are working on a number of aspects with the industry, through PILOT, with which the hon. Gentleman is familiar, and we met recently&#151;in April. We do not expect universal agreement on everything all the time, but I think the industry itself would readily accept that over the past few years the PILOT regime has worked quite well to resolve some of the difficulties that the industry faced. As I said a couple of weeks ago when I launched the energy review, although the North sea oil field is mature, it is in all our interests to do everything we can to exploit its remaining reserves.</p>

According to the International Monetary Fund, we are the world leader in financial services, so we should bear in mind how important that is to the economy&#151; not just self-evidently in the City of London, which is the pre-eminent place in the world to do business, but in other parts of the UK, such as Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester or Bristol. The financial services industry is very important to us, as are  other parts of the service industry where we are doing extremely well.</p>

The fact that exports of services have grown by more than 120 per cent. over the past 10 years demonstrates the importance of that sector of the economy.</p>

Ten years ago, in the last year of the Conservative Government, the UK was bottom of the G7 in terms of gross domestic product per head, yet now it is second only to the US, overtaking France and Germany.

Member for Rutland and Melton for 45 minutes, but I waited in vain to hear what the Conservative policy positions might be in some of the key areas he covered. I want to consider two in particular, because they are important. Both are long-term issues about which, for the good of the country, it would be useful to know what all the political parties think and whether they have set views&#151;it might be too much to expect the Liberal Democrats to go that far, but it would be helpful for the rest of us. Those two big issues are energy and science and technology. The future of this country depends on our ability to invest and to get ahead of other countries.</p>

Even if people were in doubt about the importance of security of supply two weeks ago, a look at the newspapers of the past few days would have brought home to us the real problems we will face unless we start taking decisions now about security of supply to avoid becoming over-dependent on importing oil and gas from parts of the world where the political situation may be difficult.</p>

However, it is not right to suggest that after simply pressing a button, the company would be ready to go. It spent a substantial sum on preliminary work, but the project will involve not only power stations but the chemical processes to capture the carbon, in addition to transport and storage. The commitment could stretch to hundreds of millions of pounds. It would not be possible for the Government to award a contract to one company without a proper competition process.</p>

 I understand why the hon. Gentleman and the leader of his party believe that it would be right to enter into partnership with BP, given the base at Peterhead. However, given the amount of money we are talking about and the fact that half a dozen other groups are interested, it is not possible for the Government simply to say, &#147;Never mind the rest of you.

 I accept that the Secretary of State cannot offer special favours to one company. However, he can change the rules of a regime so that everyone is affected equally.

 Whatever else carbon capture and storage is, it is not renewable&#151;it mitigates the effect of carbon. If I were to do such a thing, it would remove all the support for renewable energy itself&#151;wind farms, marine power and so on&#151;because the costs of carbon capture are so great that that would clean out everything else. In passing, I should point out that the hon. Gentleman is against the renewables obligation.

We all know in this House that if we want infrastructure of the sort that we need, whether for energy, transport, housing or whatever, we will have to reform the planning system. The test will come when proposals finally come before the House and we see whether they are supported.</p>

He did not say much, but he said that we were doing the right thing. We have indeed doubled the amount that we are spending on science, and it will rise to just under &#163;4 billion by 2010. We have spent &#163;3 billion on rebuilding our science infrastructure in universities so that we have the first-class facilities that we need. Importantly, we are putting money into getting that research from the laboratory into the marketplace, which is absolutely essential. We are beginning to see the results of an improved science base in this country, with the decoding of the human genome, the fact that a fifth of the world&#146;s top 100 selling medicines were developed in the UK, and the fact that we have only 1 per cent. of the world&#146;s population but produce 9 per cent. of all science papers and 12 per cent. of all citations. Our expenditure on research and development has been increasing. Encouragingly, in the past three years 25 university spin-out companies have floated on the stock market to the value of &#163;1.5 billion. That is all very welcome.</p>

Before my right hon. Friend moves away from the subject of the car industry, an equally successful plant is the Halewood plant in Merseyside, which produces X-type Jaguars and the Freelander 2 using a groundbreaking production process that is driven by new technology. Partnership between the trade unions and the management has enabled the plant to produce two completely different makes of car on the same production line at the same time.

 I should be happy to do that, if it is possible. My right hon. Friend makes an important point&#151;the automotive industry has been transformed over the past few years, and we need to remember that. Of course there have been difficulties, such as those encountered by Peugeot, but there have been great successes, too. Similarly, in aerospace, although Airbus has its difficulties&#151;I think that there are more problems yet to be resolved in that respect&#151;we now have every opportunity to develop the new technologies that are likely to power new aircraft and enable them to fly. Of course, we have expertise from firms such as Rolls-Royce. I have mentioned the pharmaceutical industry, but there is also the environmental industries and bioscience to consider. They are all areas in which we are doing well. Incidentally, they are also the areas in which the regional development agencies have been able to help. I think that having RDAs is good; it has enabled us to focus help on different parts of the country, all of which have different needs, but of course it is appropriate to take stock and ask ourselves whether improvements can be made.</p>

It is quite possible for us to market Britain while drawing attention to the fact that we may have particular strengths in different parts of the country, depending on what we happen to be involved in at the time.

concentrate on those parts of the world where there are developing markets. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about visits. I am not the greatest traveller in the world, but from my visits to China, India, Brazil and Russia, I know that it makes a difference if Ministers go out. Despite what he said, companies across the world think highly of Britain, and there are many areas where people can see great potential, particularly in our research. UKTI has done a great deal to encourage investment in this country, as well as investment in countries abroad, and that is something that I want to develop.</p>

As well as making sure that Britain is a good place to do business&#151;we have a competitive market and a liberalised economy, far more so than some parts of the European Union&#151;we believe in having a fair society and we believe that fairness at work matters. Whether it is the national minimum wage, equal treatment for part-time workers or maternity and paternity leave&#151;most of those measures were opposed by the Conservatives&#151;it does, in fact, matter. When the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton talked about red tape, I was surprised that he could name nothing more than the no smoking notices that he wants taken down. I think that I am right that, last autumn, he launched the campaign for enterprise, which was hostile to what it described as Labour&#146;s family-friendly legislation. It was not awfully keen on protection for sacked employees and it was not terribly keen on trade union rights. I seem to remember, too, that it coined the phrase, &#147;discrimination is not a dirty word&#148;. That probably gives us an inkling of the Conservatives&#146; position, so I very much hope that we can achieve consensus about the need to make sure that there is fairness in the workplace. We must recognise that people need to balance their responsibilities at work with their family responsibilities. Just as the leader of the Conservative party said that it is easy to talk green, so it is sometimes easy to talk about being family friendly: the proof is what we are prepared to do about it.</p>

 The sentiments that the Secretary of State has just expressed about fairness are ones to which we can all sign up to varying degrees. However, how can we square that with fairness for some of the more vulnerable members of our communities? At the same time that he says that we need fairness in business, post offices have been closed up and down the country, even though they provide the only access to financial services, cash, benefits and pensions for many of the most vulnerable people in the community.</p>

 It is very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that we can all sign up to fairness. This is the first Parliament in which he has served but, over the past  10 years, some of us can remember Conservatives fighting to get into the Lobby to vote against all those things. The national minimum wage, we recall, was going to cost millions of jobs: that is what the Tories said but, in fact, they were so wrong in that prediction that they have been forced to say that it is a good thing. As for post offices, I would make two points to the hon. Gentleman. First, we are committed to a national network. Secondly, unlike the Opposition, we can pledge the money that is necessary to support that network.</p>

I was struck by his remark that the party&#151;the Conservative party, that is&#151;was not involved in an ideological exercise but in a branding one. That is the problem that the Conservatives have. Whether on grammar schools, energy policy, nuclear policy, planning or any other topic, there is too much emphasis on branding, without the implications being thought through. They do not have an economic policy. We do. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

 I feel that in this debate we are picking over the carcase of the almost dead. The Government amendment to the Conservative motion is astonishing in its lack of mention of the DTI. The word &#147;Government&#148; but not &#147;DTI&#148; frequently appears in it. The rather sniffy comments from the Secretary of State about the Liberal Democrats may reflect his chagrin that the policy that we have long advocated of eliminating the DTI is suddenly about to turn into Government policy. I understand why he might be feeling a little sniffy. We saw that coming a long way away. Indeed, we recommended it as far back as 1995. It is true that it has taken a long time for a good policy to be implemented, but I suspect that in the next few weeks it will be in place. That is perhaps long-term thinking at its best.</p>

Many civil servants at the DTI have carried out their roles very well, and I have found that many Ministers have performed their roles and represented their areas of responsibility well. The problem is an institutional one, not a problem with the individuals involved in the Department.</p>

 Many of the things that have happened, particularly in science, technology and innovation, are positive. We have been, and continue to be, very supportive of cutting-edge basic research science. The hon. Gentleman is missing the point that many of the functions of the DTI could go elsewhere and be better carried out there. It is the institution itself that is fundamentally flawed. There are pieces of the DTI that work, that are relevant, that are effective and that are appropriate for Government to do. However, there is nearly always a related Department that also has an interest in those tasks, and they should be transferred to that Department. The dead wood should be dumped and the cost to the taxpayer saved&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>For people who think that they have read Liberal Democrat policy over 10 years, I find that comment extraordinary.

It has a rag-bag of activities, which means that we end up with a completely unfocused Department that has no clear and effective voice in the areas in which that voice must be effective.

The problems of the Post Office exercise more people in this country than any other issue. The DTI has looked on the Post Office as an organisation in terminal decline. Some 2,500 more branches are about to close, and there is the move to WH Smith&#151;nearly always in unsatisfactory circumstances&#151;of 70 more Crown post offices. What shows the negative view that the DTI is taking of the Post Office, even more than its looking upon it as a declining network and set of services rather than examining its potential, is the fact that it is also eliminating Postwatch, just at the key time when its services are needed to support consumers as they go through the process of trying to work out what the individual closures will mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70606-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07060669001219">Indeed, part of the problem with the Department is the constant fault in implementation. The timing of abolishing Postwatch shows lack of sensitivity to the way in which services should be delivered on the ground if they are to be effective. People need support to go through a proper consultation process about a critical decision, which will determine whether some communities thrive or decline further.

It is not clear that the required information on costing&#151;for example, the Ernst and Young report, which is available only in heavily redacted form&#151;will be in the public arena to enable us to hold an effective consultation. Indeed, the Government have refused to publish the submissions to that consultation until the end of the process, so no one can rebut them or respond to them at all. Flawed process is a constant feature of the Department&#146;s actions. That leads to general scepticism that the Government&#146;s direction, especially on nuclear power, is essentially driven by Downing street rather than by the Department, or by a reasoned review of all the issues.</p>

The BP Peterhead experience will be looked back on in a year or two as the first example of a carbon capture and storage programme that got crowded out by the nuclear announcement and by the direction being captured within the energy White Paper.

We hear about 20 per cent. of electricity being provided from renewables, but the Government constantly get electricity and energy muddled, and they have never been able to tell us how they will reach the EU target of providing 20 per cent. of energy&#151;not electricity&#151;from renewables by 2020.

 One can only agree with the hon.

I have visited players in that industry and it is clear to me that they see nuclear power as their death knell. They thought that a source of funds might be provided for their industry to help them build on the real potential. Many projects are sitting in prototype, but they are unable to move off that prototype base into real demonstration and production, precisely because the funding lying on one side will be directed into nuclear if that is where the Government intend it to go. If the Minister does not know that, I suggest that he do some travelling and talk to some of the people in those industries. If he did, he would find it an eye-opening set of experiences.</p>

According to the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the money was being diverted to cope with the overspend on the Rover inquiry, but, sad to say, there is a strong suspicion that it was really to do with part of the overspend on nuclear decommissioning.

This again illustrates the fact that the existence of a Department of Trade and Industry will not necessarily provide the international tool that we need to achieve our goals in what has been identified as one of the most important strategies of this Government&#151;or, frankly, of any other Government. If developing countries are to have a future, something with the characteristics of a development trade round must succeed.

 As I made clear, the &#163;8 billion figure was in our previous manifesto. As there have been changes in the DTI, we are working through the numbers again. That is not inappropriate. We did not call this debate; we are responding to it. We will come forward with the numbers. We are not changing policy. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I have just described the business support services aspects; one can tell that that has not stirred the blood of many people to come and participate. There is plenty of scope to eliminate aspects of the regional development agencies&#146; activities, many of which compete with export schemes, and even the Government seem to have finally realised that that is a complete waste of time and money. As we work through the structure, we will come out with hard numbers, as we always do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70606-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07060669001240">As the DTI disappears, two essential elements must remain and be captured within whatever the new structure is. First, there must be a voice for business at Cabinet level, where it will have an impact. That is less an issue for large business&#151;which is able to lobby and reach Government in the ways that it finds necessary&#151;than it is for small business, which has been under-recognised and under-heard over a long period. We envisage that role being in the Treasury, perhaps in the No. 2 slot. It should be a powerful voice, and perhaps the word &#147;Business&#148; should finally be brought into the Minister&#146;s title, so that it is evident that that voice is at the Cabinet table, and heard within the context of economic development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70606-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07060669001241">Secondly, the energy portfolio must be put in a place where climate change can be the umbrella, so to speak, under which it functions. In the past, energy policy has essentially been business-driven, and exceedingly slow to recognise environmental and climate change issues. That is partly why we are in such a pickle today, with the struggle to reach the necessary targets over the years. The structure that I am proposing will be essential. There are business voices that very much want energy, transport and planning to go off into a sort of infrastructure Department that would separate them permanently from the climate change discussion, other than in a most tenuous way. We do not support that, as it would be utterly inappropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70606-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07060669001242">My goal in coming into this role has been to put both myself and every other Front-Bench DTI spokesman out of a job. It looks as if I will achieve that later in the year. When the Department is eliminated and elements of it restructured, it is crucial that it is not done simply to accommodate rival politicians who are looking for particular titles, or to sort out different political balances within the party. There needs to be a sunset clause on every aspect of what the DTI does, so that it will be examined and a decision will be made on whether it is a worthwhile and appropriate activity for the Government to carry out&#151;and whether it can be carried out within a particular Department or constructed in an alternative way. An alternative home should be made available for those aspects that are worth while; that would be more effective, and would eliminate duplication. Those parts that are inappropriate should disappear for good.</p>

It has been a drive of the Government to ensure that as much manufacturing as possible is carried out in this country, and in automotive, pharmaceutical and other key areas that has been achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70606-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07060669001245">That has been achieved by a strategy started by the first inquiry into manufacturing in 30 years&#151;the developing our manufacturing strategy&#151;and by creating the manufacturing advisory service and a centre of excellence for manufacturing in every region.

Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), who spoke for Halewood, highlighted the multimillion pound&#151;&#163;7 million&#151;DTI investment that has brought in &#163;1 billion of investment in Jaguar and the new X-type. There are many other such examples. In fact, more than 50,000 manufacturers have been helped by the Government&#146;s manufacturing strategy, which is why manufacturing productivity has risen by 30 per cent. since they came into office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70606-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07060669001262">Nationally, Liberal Democrat policies on post offices are just as bad. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) wrote a policy paper advocating the privatisation of post offices along Dutch lines, which has meant mass closures. By contrast, this Government have invested some &#163;3 billion in post offices to secure the best possible network that can be secured in this day and age. That reflects what Labour councils such as Edinburgh have done. The Government have given financial support because it was worth while putting money into post offices.</p>

 I ask the hon. Member, are the wind farms there now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07060669001267">The position is clear. I make sure that in my constituency people do not have to travel beyond the recognised distance to visit a post office. I also support my local postmasters and postmistresses who decide that they want to move out of that business and into another one. That might be one of the reasons why I got their support in the election&#151;because they realise that in Edinburgh we have had a realistic strategy that has led to managed closures, even though we regret some of them, of course. However, I am not in favour of the Liberal Democrats telling this House one thing&#151;that they will save every post office at all costs&#151;and then failing to support post offices in Aberdeen by not paying for the services there.</p>

 No, I shall explain what I am saying. The Government are being criticised because they are unwilling to pay high fees to post offices to deliver certain services where technology has taken over. However, local councils are, like the Government, spending money; the sum being spent on this programme is &#163;3 billion. If local councils are willing to spend money, they should do so. Under Labour, they did so in Edinburgh, but they did not do so in Aberdeen, which is indefensible.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the characteristically lively and well argued speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), even though I did not agree with every word he said.

If true perfection were the test of which Departments to abolish, in my opinion many others should come before the DTI. My list would include the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Home Office and the Department of Health before the DTI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07060669001274">I wish to spend a few moments analysing Liberal Democrat policy. I am the Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee, and I must be as non-partisan as possible, but I must say that the Liberal Democrats are profoundly and seriously wrong, and I urge them to reconsider their position. Their policy is good news for the two major parties in the House because it will lose them the votes of business, but I genuinely believe that what they advocate is not in the interests of UK business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07060669001275">Two issues flowed from the Secretary of State&#146;s opening remarks. Whenever I speak in this House on DTI or economic matters, I seem to have to make the following points, and especially the first. The Secretary of State talked a lot about macro-economic stability and the Government&#146;s great economic record. It is worth reminding the House that that is built on Conservative foundations. The reforms of the Thatcher and Major Governments and the golden economic inheritance of 1997&#151;the likes of which few incoming Governments have ever received&#151;enabled that record to be continued. The Government should, however, take the credit for not having blown it, which previous Labour Governments did. They did not blow it, although they have nibbled at the edges of that inheritance and made matters more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07060669001276">The roots of what have been achieved lie in Conservative policies. Those with longer memories will remember the mess that we inherited in 1979; that was the real mess that had to be cleared up, and it was done very successfully. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I did not catch the Minister&#146;s sedentary remarks, but I am sure that they were characteristically witty and well argued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07060669001277">The Secretary of State also rightly paid tribute to the success of the automotive sector in the UK. That is also a Conservative policy that has come to fruition. I had the privilege of being a special adviser at the DTI in the late 1980s when the then Secretary of State, now Lord Young of Graffham, set as an industrial strategy&#151;to employ a word that he would not like me to use&#151;the attraction of all internationally mobile automotive investment to the UK. He aggressively wooed Nissan, Toyota, Honda and other companies, and they all came. It is from those companies driving up standards, particularly in the automotive supply sector, that so much of the good that has happened to the automotive sector has come. So it is worth remembering that two of the great bits of credit that the Government have sought to take in fact belong to the Conservatives. But never mind&#151;we move on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07060669001278">I want to emphasise in my, hopefully brief, remarks that the DTI has a crucial role to play, albeit in perhaps a slightly different incarnation. However, the centrality of the need for not just a Minister but a Department representing business within Whitehall is crucial. At a time when Britain faces competitive challenges as a result of globalisation&#151;an issue that many people in this country, and even in this House, do not fully understand&#151;it has never been more important to have an effective voice for business. We need not a junior Minister in the Treasury, where other issues will always take priority, but a Department that stands on its own, free in the Whitehall jungle to argue the case for business on each and every issue that impacts on it. It is not a sign of weakness that the DTI has to interact with many other Departments; it is a sign of its  <br>

importance and of the number of issues in Whitehall that affect businesses. The voice of business must be there and expressed clearly.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and the argument that he is making is certainly one to take into account. However, is not the difference between having a Minister and a Department that the latter spends its time looking for activities to justify its existence? In general, those activities are not about supporting business in other parts of government, but about inventing new regulations. That is the danger of having a Department devoted to such matters.</p>

<p><a name="st_o338"><a name="07060669001282"><a name="70606-0019.htm_spnew9"><a name="07060669002325"><b>Peter Luff:</b>
 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has seriously misunderstood the DTI. I have some sympathy with the arguments of the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) about the Small Business Service, which seems to be a relatively unloved part of the DTI. However, her proposal certainly would not save  &#163;8 billion in the lifetime of a Parliament, even if the SBS were abolished. I cannot think of any other function&#151;she did not, I think, name one&#151;that could be abolished within the DTI. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>I will run through the list later, but I doubt whether there is another function that we could even consider abolishing. Of course there are things that could be reformed, improved and made more effective; but abolition, no. All these functions have one thing in common. They are not the rag-bag that the hon. Lady suggested; they are coherent and deal with issues affecting business. That is the common theme that gives them their importance, and the DTI its coherence. Perhaps the DTI is not always as effective as it might be, but broadly speaking it is a very coherent Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07060669001283">The DTI has done a lot of things well. Under this Government, I would single out the handling of the problems relating to Airbus, where a very successful outcome was achieved by the Minister for Industry and the Regions. Actually, the DTI&#146;s handling of the fallout from MG-Rover&#151;working, to be fair, with Advantage West Midlands&#151;was not bad, either. However, in a number of areas it has fallen short of the high standards that we have a right to expect. Reference has been made to deregulation, and the Department has not been effective enough in getting other Departments to be as strong on deregulation as they might have been.</p>

the DTI is there arguing the deregulatory cause, to make sure that such burdens are reduced and minimised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07060669001287">The Government were slow and confused in their handling of energy policy. I personally welcome their conversion to the nuclear cause, but it is a shame that a previous White Paper effectively dismissed the nuclear possibility. Of course, their handling of the energy review did not cover them in glory: it led to a successful judicial review that has significantly delayed the energy review&#146;s implementation. Aspects of the post office closure programme have also caused my Committee concern. We have produced one quite critical report already, and another report, to be published on Saturday morning&#151;I will not say much about it, as I must not leak my own report to the House&#151;will have further things to say about the closure programme. We were concerned, moreover, about the lack of priority that the Government in general and UKTI in particular attached to places such as India. However, the Government have responded magnificently, and I am very grateful for the serious way in which not just the DTI but other Departments treated our report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07060669001288">The real problem for the DTI is that it has taken quite a hit on efficiency savings. Its staff have struggled hard to face round after round of cuts. It has not been confident of its own future, which has been very damaging and has demoralised it. That is another reason why the Liberal Democrats are seriously mistaken in the position that they are adopting. They do not understand the demoralising effect that such talk has on hard-working civil servants. That is another reason I urge the Liberal Democrats to abandon their policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07060669001289">The Department has also been subject to external pressures. The report on UKTI, which we published this morning, highlights the fact that that organisation has had three strategies in four years. Those strategies have been imposed on UKTI by the Treasury, so the ineffectiveness of UKTI&#151;which my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) mentioned&#151;is not its fault, but that of the Treasury for demanding arbitrary and unnecessary changes in strategy. The organisation now needs a period of stability, because it is capable of doing a very good job.</p>

 As a member of the Committee, I agree with the hon. Gentleman about UKTI. Does he recall that when we spoke to members of UKTI abroad, many of them were well thought of and were doing good work, but they felt that the problem lay back here, with the continual changes that the organisation had been put through? A period of stability is essential if it is to make progress.</p>

 It will not surprise the House to learn that I strongly agree with my&#151;for these purposes&#151;hon. Friend, who was present for our consideration of the report. He makes an important point. Although performance is obviously variable, in the main the UKTI staff overseas do a first-rate job and we have been consistently impressed by the quality that they offer to exporters. We have often had reservations about management back here, and that could be an element in the successive strategy reviews and the demoralisation. We are concerned about that, as we say in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07060669001292">The functions of the DTI do need to be done, somewhere. The &#147;Capability Review of the Department of Trade and Industry&#148;, which has not been mentioned so far, is an excellent document. It has some criticisms to make, but it is an objective and fair document. Its major concern is the one that I expressed about the lack of political stability undermining confidence in the Department. That is one of the major reasons why the Department has not performed as well as it might  have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07060669001293">The document lists the areas with which the DTI deals. I remind the hon. Member for Richmond Park that those include inward investment; outward investment; encouraging innovation; management of Government assets and liabilities, including nuclear liabilities and coal, steel and shipbuilding; Government interests in public corporations, such as the Royal Mail and British Nuclear Fuels; competition policy; and company law. Those functions have to be performed by someone. What is the point of moving the deckchairs around for no net benefit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07060669001294">The capability review is clear about the importance of the DTI strategically in delivering any Government&#146;s objectives, never mind this one&#146;s. The voice of business is also clear on that point. I have received a briefing from the British Chambers of Commerce which mentions the importance that it attaches to maintaining the DTI, although it has doubts about the way in which it is administered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70606-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07060669001295">I also have a copy of the detailed report of a survey for the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which says that 59 per cent. of respondents think the DTI is fit for purpose, but 92 per cent. think there should be a Government Department responsible for enterprise, business and the private sector, and 92 per cent.&#151;presumably the same 92 per cent.&#151;think a Cabinet Minister should be responsible for business interests in the community. Fascinatingly, the survey also lists the duties that the respondents think are important for a Department with responsibility for business, and the Liberal Democrats must answer the questions raised by those findings. I am aware that I sound partisan, but I speak out of passion for UK business, not out of partisanship. Some 99 per cent. thought that it was essential, very important or important to have a Department that supported small businesses, and 85 per cent. think it should promote corporate and social responsibility. Some 75 per cent. think it should be responsible for employment relations, 96 per cent. for deregulation, 97 per cent. for productivity, and 98 per cent. for the promotion of UK trade overseas. Those are high figures. The only area of responsibility that the respondents do not think important is regions policy. There is a strong consensus in the business world about the need for a Department, not just a Minister, with responsibility for business.</p>

I am slightly nervous about the wording on UKTI, which does not do justice to the organisation; the problems it has experienced are not of its own making, but due to external factors. UKTI, like the whole DTI, could do better; it needs stability and a vote of confidence. I am delighted that the official Opposition called the debate because I agree strongly with my hon.

Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I wish to make a few remarks about energy because it is obviously very important, especially for Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07060669001315">We have had the energy review and the Government have come up with the new nuclear option. Luckily, strangely enough, one of their planning functions that is devolved to Scotland means that Scotland will perhaps be saved from new nuclear stations. However, the problem of waste will affect us all. The Government and official Opposition Front Benchers had an interesting discussion about that. When the Government introduced the energy review, they talked about the private sector meeting a &#147;full share&#148; of the costs of disposal, but we have not yet had an explanation of what a full share actually means. Today, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) seemed to be talking about a deferred subsidy to the private sector. Under any provision, it appears that the public purse will have to bear the cost of disposing of new nuclear waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07060669001316">I have argued in the House on many occasions about the transmission charges affecting energy in this country, which result in higher costs of energy production in the north of Scotland than in the south of England and act against the interests of renewables. Nothing in the energy review will change the situation. The review includes a section on fuel poverty, but it does little to add to the attack on it. For example, nothing is proposed to help rural areas by examining price mechanisms and social tariffs. Various specific issues influence fuel poverty in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07060669001317">We have already discussed carbon capture. The fact that BP is pulling out of the Peterhead project will be a huge blow to Scotland. Some 300 people are employed on the project, so its winding down will have a serious impact. However, it is worse than that. As I pointed out earlier, the energy review makes a lot of carbon capture&#146;s potential to help developing countries that use a lot of coal and other fossil fuels to clean up their act. Such projects will be important as we move beyond Kyoto towards a new carbon reduction scheme, so it is clear that the developed world needs to deal with this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07060669001318">The Government first said that they were in favour of carbon capture some three years ago. However, although BP, Scottish Power and others have made a massive investment in Peterhead, little progress seems to have been made in any other area. The argument that the Government cannot simply award a contract to one project does not hold water if we are seriously considering the technology as a contributor to carbon reduction, rather than just another aspect of energy policy. It is worth noting that even in the United States, which is often seen as an ogre by the green movement, a $90 million tax allowance is available for a carbon capture and storage pilot project. Other countries are pushing ahead on such projects, so, yet again, we might be left behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07060669001319">Carbon capture and storage could be important for not just Peterhead. Scottish Power is investing in cleaning up the Longannet and Cockenzie coal-fired power stations in Scotland, which could be important for the future of energy in Scotland and the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07060669001320">I want to speak briefly about the Post Office&#151;and I will be brief, as I hope that others may yet contribute.  <br>

What can I say about the Post Office? I have talked about it in this House for the past six years and things do not seem to be getting much better. I shall end with a story. The Government have taken away much business from the Post Office, but sometimes the Post Office does not help itself. A constituent contacted me today to say that they were moving house and went into their local post office with the simple aim of getting a redirection of mail form, but they were informed by the local postmaster that he could not supply one; it could only be downloaded from the internet. There were no redirection of mail forms in  the post offices in Angus. That is utterly ludicrous.  Not everybody has access to the internet, and for something as simple as that form to be not available is an absolute disgrace.</p>

 We have had a valuable and constructive debate this afternoon; it has been brief, but it touched on an important issue that goes right to the heart of government and the future structure of government. In his opening comments, the Secretary of State paid tribute to the Department of Trade and Industry staff, and we certainly wish to associate ourselves with that, given their dedication and the expert work that they do. Our criticism, such as it is, focuses on the failure in leadership at the Department, rather than on the personnel, with whom we hope to work in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07060669001322">I join the Secretary of State in paying tribute to business in this country. There are many outstanding businesses in this country that do a remarkable job around the world. The entrepreneurial spirit still thrives in this country, but that does not mean that we should not do better. He asked various questions, and in particular he asked about our position on science policy. I should like to say to him and to the House that we broadly support the Government&#146;s position on science, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) made clear when he expertly opened the debate. Outstanding scientific work is being done in this country, but not enough is being done to turn that science to commercial advantage. It has to be recognised that leading companies at the forefront of technology are having to ask whether their next investment should be here or overseas because of the situation with regard to tax, regulations, skills and other matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07060669001323">I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) for some clarification of Liberal Democrat policy on trade and industry until I virtually lost the will to live. I think that none of us yet understands which DTI activities she thinks should be retained, and which she thinks should be got rid of, but what certainly came through, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) said, is the fact that business will be in despair at her proposals, which essentially remove the voice of business and subjugate it to the almighty Treasury, and give more power to the unloved regions, although she cannot even tell us what those proposals will cost.</p>

at the forefront of the sector are diversifying, and it is the giants who are investing both in the major elements of nuclear, and in aspects of renewables. BP has announced an $8 billion investment in alternative energy, and E.ON is prepared to invest in not just nuclear, but offshore wind and tidal power. The involvement of those major companies in investment in those forms of energy is the key to helping new technologies to come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07060669001325">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, made an excellent and insightful contribution, as always. He was not always as impartial as he set out to be, but thank heavens for that. He reminded us that the foundations for the economic success for which the Government have been able to take credit were laid well before it came to power in 1997. One of the great things that the Government did right was not to roll back the changes that the last Conservative Government made, which made this country one of the most successful economies in the world. He is absolutely right to say that there must be a Department that represents business&#151;not just a Minister in the Treasury, but a Department that will argue the case for business with other Departments, and which will make sure that the needs of business are fully understood.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that I do not have time to give way to him, especially as he has not been in the Chamber for most of the debate. It seems that in virtually every debate in the Chamber, someone creeps in from the planet Zarg and makes an out-of-this-world contribution. Today, that role fell to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), who said that there is a &#147;creditable record&#148; on manufacturing. He said so of a Government under whom 1.2 million jobs have been lost, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) made clear, and under whom the share of gross domestic product attributable to manufacturing has dropped from 20 to 13 per cent. I hate to think what the hon. Gentleman would regard as a disappointing or even a bad record but, nevertheless, we were glad to hear his contribution, and perhaps his next appointment in the new regime will be as Minister for space.</p>

makes it difficult for any business to come forward and invest. The Government say that they want to encourage renewables, yet the British Wind Energy Association reacted to the planning White Paper by saying that  the UK</p>
<a name="70606-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="07060669001427"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is no nearer to the 2010 renewables target with the Planning White Paper&#148;</p>

BP delayed the closure of that plant by a year to give Ministers time to introduce proposals to make the project feasible, but I am afraid that ministerial delays mean that an additional three years of delays have been built in before a pilot scheme can be made to work. It is the delays and indecision by DTI Ministers that have increased the likelihood of power cuts in the years ahead.</p>

Just 7 per cent. think that it is effective. What business needs is a Department of Trade and Industry that regards its primary goal as supporting business, not regulating it. Some 30,000 new regulations have come into force since the Government came to power 10 years ago; there are 14 new regulations a day; and it costs the average business &#163;13,500 a year to implement them. We need a DTI that is up to speed with business, and we need a culture that stops the unnecessary and over-zealous interpretation of EU directives, rather than one that fails to argue its corner and defend British business adequately in the EU. We need a DTI that does more to ensure that the needs of business are incorporated more effectively in the debate about skills, as we face unprecedented pressure and competition from countries such as China and India. There is no business today that is safe from the threat of relocation overseas, and even world-class British businesses find it hard to justify each new decision to invest here, rather than abroad.</p>

We do many things outstandingly, including bio-pharmaceuticals, finance, technology, design, services, aerospace and top-end engineering. We do many, many things that are brilliant. We are still a nation of great genius and innovation and brilliant leadership, but that is in spite of the Government, not because of them.</p>

 I will do my best to be both focused and purposeful in answering the debate. We have had an extensive debate and it has been interesting in all sorts of ways. The shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry opened the debate with a 45-minute speech, but that was not long enough, because he clearly did not have time to spell out much detail&#151;to put it mildly&#151;of Conservative party policy as it affects the DTI. When he did the saloon bar rant, as I might call it, on the need for a bonfire of regulations, he was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) to name just three regulations that should be abolished. After a while the hon. Gentleman said that he would take down all the no smoking signs that are going up&#151;surely an indication that despite what we usually think, there can be smoke without political fire.</p>

Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer). I was particularly interested in her plan to save &#163;8 billion from the DTI budget&#151;to be fair, I must add that that was to be saved over the lifetime of a Parliament. She, too, was unable to speak for quite long enough to say how that arithmetical conjuring trick would be managed. The science budget is about half of the DTI budget. It has gone up substantially and is some  &#163;3.4 billion a year. Clearly, to manage &#163;8 billion-worth of cuts in the departmental budget over the lifetime of a Parliament would involve enormous slashing of the science budget. We will have to spend some time making sure that any academics who, sadly, voted Liberal Democrat last time know exactly what the plan is to slash the academic, science and research base of our country.</p>

He argued that all the great benefits to the country from a new Labour Government were based on a Tory economic heritage&#151;but then he remembered where part of his salary comes from and became the reasonable even-handed Chairman of the Select Committee. Like the Opposition spokesmen and others, he paid tribute to the very good officials we have in different parts of the DTI. I thank him, and echo those words about the excellence of our officials, whatever our political differences might be about the DTI.</p>

They are challenges, of course, but opportunities as well, for those willing to reach out to embrace them. We need to make globalisation work for us, and for the people of our country, and ensure that we shape globalisation rather than being shaped by it. That is the nature of the challenge. Over the coming decades there will be global changes at least as profound as those brought about by the industrial revolution of the  18th and 19th century. What took 200 years to evolve in that earlier epoch will take perhaps 20 or 30 years in the new global industrial revolution. My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07060695000009">The DTI is at the centre of ensuring that globalisation is good for UK employees through the creation of new high-value jobs, and that it is good for the consumer through fair competition and prices. In 2005-06, UK Trade and Investment&#151;we have heard quite a lot about UKTI&#151;helped nearly 6,000 UK companies move into overseas markets and landed more than 1,220 inward investment projects, with nearly 90,000 jobs being created or safeguarded. I saw at first hand the excellent work of UKTI at the recent Biotech 2007 conference in Boston.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07060695000010">The Government are responding to the changing business climate, which involves dealing with the challenges of globalisation and energy security. The DTI is tackling those challenges head on, taking tough decisions and making a real difference. We have heard about the energy White Paper, which will provide a framework for delivering a secure, low-carbon energy mix for the United Kingdom, tackling the twin challenges of climate change and&#151;this is, as the Secretary of State noted, increasingly important&#151;providing energy security. The White Paper announced specific measures to make inroads into reducing our carbon emissions and ensuring secure supplies for decades to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para27"><a name="07060695000011">For the UK, but also for Europe more generally, globalisation demands what we increasingly refer to as a knowledge economy, which means a strong emphasis on science and innovation. The DTI continues to invest in our science base at unprecedented levels. The figure is currently &#163;3.4 billion, which is more than half the DTI&#146;s budget and double the sum of 10 years ago. That figure will rise to almost &#163;3.9 billion in 2010-11. We have a worldwide reputation for being excellent at science. In the past few years, we have spent more than &#163;3 billion building world-class laboratories, and one can see that huge investment in any local or regional university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70606-0020.htm_para28"><a name="07060695000012">Patents are up 98 per cent. and income from intellectual property is up by 112 per cent. Since 1997, the value of collaborative research between universities and businesses has increased by more than 50 per cent. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para0"><a name="07060695000016">I listened very carefully to what the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) said about the difficulties faced by small businesses. We do not understate those difficulties, and we need to cut unnecessary regulation. There are now 600,000 more small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK than there were 10 years ago, so something is going right, and I hope that that includes the estate of Verulamium as well as the rest of the United Kingdom. The work of the Small Business Service and its delivery partner, Business Link, is  very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07060695000017">It is also important to consider some of the domestic challenges that we face. As this century progresses, in our judgment there will be growing demand among our citizens for a better balance between economic activity and their private lives&#151;what we often call the work-life balance. Reforms in the labour market, which now help parents and carers to make choices about flexible working to balance their time at work and time with their families, are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07060695000018">We are taking action across a wide range of areas that I do not have time to discuss. We want to ensure open and competitive markets, which are a hallmark of our approach. We are committed to reducing the administrative burdens of regulation by 25 per cent. Our plans will see 500 areas of red tape abolished, which will deliver an overall &#163;2 billion reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07060695000019">It is important to discuss the political differences between us. There are areas of consensus that I welcome, but whereas the previous Conservative Government devalued science, Labour has invested heavily in it. Labour has produced an energy strategy of which we can be proud to tackle climate change and bring about energy security, which is so important to national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07060695000020">It is worth quoting again the views of the leader of the Tory party, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State quoted earlier. What was his contribution to energy security? He said:</p>
<a name="70606-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="07060695000570"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Let&#146;s give green energy the chance and then have nuclear there as a last resort.&#148;</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) for giving me a chance to get here. If she had not done so, I should have lost the debate. I also thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak about aspects of policing in the Middlesbrough area of my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07060695000532">Most people are aware that the Government have made combating crime and antisocial behaviour a key community priority. In practice, the police and our local crime-fighting partnerships have been supported consistently by resources and backing from the Government, and it is on the concept of partnerships and their success in Middlesbrough that I want to concentrate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07060695000533">We cannot rely on the police alone to fight crime; crime-fighting must be the business of the whole community. In order to identify the problems and determine the appropriate strategies with which to confront them, we must ensure that there is broad participation by all the relevant stakeholders. The supervision of policing through an active and involved police authority is central to the process, as is full support from the local authority. Combined with a highly competent and dedicated chief constable and a committed team of senior police officers, that approach has given Middlesbrough what is perhaps the country&#146;s most impressive crime-fighting partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07060695000534">That partnership is certainly performing. Let us look at the facts and figures. In 2006-07 crime was down by 5.1 per cent., with around 1,298 fewer victims than in 2005-06. Robberies were down by 12.7 per cent., house burglaries by 23.8 per cent., vehicle theft by 34.7 per cent. and sexual offences by 8.6 per cent. The key driver of those reductions was the crime detection rate, which rose by 5.2 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07060695000535">I believe that Sean Price, who became Cleveland&#146;s chief constable in April 2003, has been one of the key factors in this great success story. He has united and lifted the morale of a force that had been divided by internal tension under its previous leadership. He has established a hands-on management style that has led to higher personal involvement by senior officers in front-line policing, and has delegated more decision making to officers on the beat. He has also successfully argued for extra officers to be deployed on the ground. As a result of his determination, along with the support from the Home Office, Cleveland will soon have the highest number of officers in the force's history. That equates to 1,727 full-time police officers, 197 police community support officers and 50 special constables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07060695000536">The force has been able to recruit 23 more police officers and, crucially, 20 of those new posts have been earmarked for neighbourhood policing. That has been accompanied by an intense programme of collaboration with Middlesbrough council and with community and neighbourhood groups across the town. The Cleveland police motto of &#147;putting people first&#148; is not just a catchy mission statement. It forms part of their whole ethos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="70606-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07060695000537">In Cleveland, we now have at least one dedicated police officer in place for each neighbourhood across the force area, based in well known public buildings. As the chief constable said recently:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07060695000538">Sean Price's comments were echoed by our police authority chair, Councillor Dave McLuckie, who recently said:</p>
<a name="70606-0022.htm_brev3"><a name="07060695000578"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In all our consultations and discussions with local people we know that what they value most is a visible police presence on their streets and in their communities&#151;and that is what neighbourhood policing is all about.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07060695000539">Middlesbrough demonstrates the importance of visibility to a successful neighbourhood policing model. It is key to gaining public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07060695000540">The council and other private and voluntary agencies have helped the police immeasurably by allowing their premises and facilities to be used by the police neighbourhood teams as drop-in offices and venues for ward surgeries. In my own area of Middlesbrough, the council has allowed the use of community centres in Park End and Marton and libraries in Hemlington, Coulby Newham and Easterside. The teams have also worked with local churches by using church halls in Stainton and West Marton and businesses such as Spar have enabled the police to use their facilities as a community policing base in areas such as Nunthorpe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07060695000541">Local housing associations are also helping. The Anchor housing trust has allowed the Marton neighbourhood policing team to use its community centre in Gypsy lane, Marton, and the Guinness Trust has opened up its centre in Coulby Newham. The Sure Start initiative has also helped by basing neighbourhood police teams in its centres in Hemlington and Beechwood, which gives local mothers and young women the opportunity to talk to the police about issues of concern to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07060695000542">That approach to community policing means that special initiatives managed by the police can be targeted at very small neighbourhood areas and tailored to meet community concerns. A good example of the local partnerships can be seen in the outlying estate of Hemlington, which has social exclusion problems and a history of antisocial behaviour on the part of a small, but persistent number of youths. Police have teamed up with colleagues from Middlesbrough council, youth services and housing organisations in a bid to clamp down on that antisocial behaviour. A couple of weeks ago, a dispersal order was put in place so that youngsters can be moved on, taken home or even arrested if they are behaving in an antisocial or  <br>

criminal way. The partners hope that the young people will instead make use of the facilities at the nearby Hemlington recreation centre, such as its skate and play parks, youth shelter, football pitch and tennis court. These are early days, but I have high hopes that the exercise will yield positive results. The role of the council in the partnership should not be understated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07060695000543">The mayor of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon, is a former police officer, and he pioneered the concept of zero tolerance. He has been re-elected twice and his leadership has made a great contribution to the town. Since coming to office, he has introduced new initiatives and projects to fight crime and social disorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07060695000544">The council&#146;s lead member for community safety, Barry Coppinger, has also recently hit the headlines with new crime-busting policies and projects. The most significant and recent example was the initiative to combine a CCTV system with live audio microphones that enable controllers to warn offenders. That might have seemed like a gimmick to some, but it works. Moreover, that initiative has been developed by a neighbourhood &#147;community company&#148;, thereby allowing local people to manage and control its development. It has also created new jobs for local people in personal and premises security. The task now is to cement that partnership and to build on its achievements to a level where people in Middlesbrough can live without the fear of crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07060695000545">In order to realise that goal, we must ensure that support from central Government continues. Such programmes must also not be seen as the preserve of the Home Office&#151;other Departments must also be part of the process. The Department for Education and Skills, for example, has a key role to play in supporting projects aimed at disaffected young people and backing programmes to combat bullying and truancy. That will have a knock-on effect on the level of crime and antisocial behaviour on our streets. The new Ministry of Justice and the Department for Communities and Local Government should also pay regard to what is being achieved in Middlesbrough. It helps little if the police and the council are tackling crime only for it to be seen that sentencing policy fails to complement the tough approach that must be taken to isolate and deal with the core of troublemakers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07060695000546">The Department for Communities and Local Government should be aware that there is a clear link between neighbourhood design and architecture and crime. Like many other towns and cities, Middlesbrough has ambitious plans for redesigning estates and building new ones, and to replace both the planning mistakes of the 1960s and outdated Victorian terraces. In the new communities and estates that will spring up, the need to design-out crime must be the central feature. DCLG must be prepared to be guided by local communities and Middlesbrough partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07060695000547">I invite a cross-departmental group of Ministers to visit Middlesbrough to meet the people I have mentioned, who are implementing the partnership model and serving their communities. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) on securing this debate on policing. He is always an eloquent and effective champion for his constituency and his police force. Indeed, he has raised such issues with me many times. I should say at the outset that if he contacts my office, I am more than happy to visit Middlesbrough at a time appropriate to him and his colleagues, in order to see the work that he has outlined for us this evening. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07060695000549">I take this opportunity to congratulate Cleveland&#146;s chief constable, Sean Price, whom I know personally from his time as a senior police officer in Nottinghamshire, where his work was very effective. I am happy to join my hon. Friend in congratulating him on the performance improvements that he has brought to the Cleveland area and the steady progress that he continues to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07060695000550">I also welcome the opportunity to reflect on the progress made not only by Cleveland police but by police forces across the country. My hon. Friend has highlighted the progress that Cleveland has made in introducing neighbourhood policing, which has been very effective. I am an enthusiastic supporter of neighbourhood policing and the tremendous benefits that it brings to our communities. I want to say something about that, but first I want to join my hon. Friend in congratulating Councillor Dave McLuckie on his work, and in congratulating Ray Mallon, the mayor of Middlesbrough, whose contribution my hon. Friend spoke of. What we are seeing is that partnership is crucial if we are to achieve our aims, and it is clear that in Middlesbrough such partnership has been very strong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07060695000551">We should bear in mind the work not only of Dave McLuckie and Ray Mallon, but of the council and the various housing associations and schools. My hon. Friend referred to the difference that has been made in Hemlington. It is also important that we see the full use of the powers that have been made available to police forces, local authorities and other bodies in tackling antisocial behaviour. I was very pleased to hear about the use of a dispersal order, which is a very effective way of tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07060695000552">My hon. Friend mentioned the level of support that Cleveland police currently receives from the Home Office and what it can expect in future. He will know that the Government are committed to providing a well-funded police force in Cleveland and in England and Wales as a whole. I do not think that our commitment to that can be called into question. For 2007-08, Cleveland, like all forces, received an increase in general grant funding of 3.6 per cent., above the rate of inflation, which comes on top of a sustained increase in funding. My hon. Friend will probably like to know that since 2000-01, Cleveland&#146;s total grants have increased by &#163;30 million, which equates to 14.9 per cent. in real terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07060695000553">That money has been spent well. As at 30 September 2006, Cleveland had 1,681 officers&#151;222 more than in March 1997. There were also 116 more civilian staff than a decade ago, which has of course helped to release officers for front-line duties, which I know is where my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents want to see them. I am pleased to hear that so many officers are providing that visible presence on the street. Last September, there were also 111 police community support officers&#151;an innovation under this Government. That figure has also   <br>

increased, and I shall say a little more about neighbourhood policing and PCSOs in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07060695000554">However, it is important that we do not just focus on inputs but look at the results, which have also been impressive in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency. Between 2002-03 and 2005-06, overall recorded crime in Cleveland fell by 2.5 per cent., representing nearly 2,000 fewer victims of crime a year. Especially impressive was the performance on burglary, which fell by almost half in that period. The results in the Middlesbrough basic command unit, which serves my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents, are equally noteworthy. Between 2003-04 and 2005-06, recorded domestic burglary fell by 13 per cent. and robbery by a staggering 54 per cent., so the investment is making a huge difference to my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07060695000555">Middlesbrough is also one of just 40 respect areas nationally&#151;identified for their strong track record in tackling antisocial behaviour and its causes. The local crime and disorder reduction partnership has made good use of the full range of tools and powers available to tackle antisocial behaviour. In 2005-06, it used  137 acceptable behaviour contracts and in 2005 it took out 34 antisocial behaviour orders. We know that those powers work and that their use has brought important respite to communities living with the burden of antisocial behaviour. As my hon. Friend said, Middlesbrough has also made good use of other powers such as dispersal orders, crack house closures and parenting orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07060695000556">Importantly, action is being taken across the breadth of the respect programme. Middlesbrough is one of  77 areas with funding for an expert practitioner to co-ordinate parenting services for families involved in or at risk of antisocial behaviour, while the council and partners are implementing a family intervention project to tackle the behaviour of the most antisocial families in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07060695000557">The area has also led the way in experimenting with talking CCTV to promote good, and challenge bad, behaviour. I congratulate my hon. Friend on saying that talking CCTV is not a gimmick, because I completely agree with him. Indeed, on Monday my officials were in Middlesbrough to attend the launch of the council&#146;s scheme selectively to license private sector landlords in an area of the town where antisocial behaviour has been an issue. It is only the second council in the country to have such a scheme in place&#151;another example of the work it is doing</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para19"><a name="07060695000558">The range of action is encouraging and I urge the council, police and other local partners to keep up their proactive approach to tackling antisocial behaviour and its causes so that residents in Middlesbrough can enjoy their neighbourhoods. I pay tribute to all of those in Middlesbrough and Cleveland generally whose efforts have led to those excellent results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para20"><a name="07060695000559">I know that my hon. Friend is interested in future funding arrangements. I have to tell him that no decisions have yet been taken on police funding for the three years of the comprehensive spending review. It is no secret that the financial climate will become tighter. However, the funding increases that we have given in the last few years have provided a very solid foundation on which the police can build as we move into a period of consolidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para21"><a name="07060695000560">I was very pleased to hear my hon. Friend talk so warmly about neighbourhood policing and I too would like to congratulate Cleveland on the progress it has made in rolling out neighbourhood policing across the force. All of us know of the demand for a visible, accessible and responsive police force, with a presence on the streets, and that is what neighbourhood policing is designed to achieve. I understand that there are now 15 dedicated neighbourhood policing teams across the Cleveland police area, which includes 173 police sergeants and constables and 126 PCSOs. In my hon. Friend&#146;s area in Middlesbrough, I am advised that there are four neighbourhood policing teams, which include 61 police sergeants and constables and 34 PCSOs. Those teams cover areas that are coterminous with the clusters of community councils that are the main resident representation body in each local authority ward area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07060695000561">The progress made by Cleveland is being repeated across all 43 forces and we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to provide a dedicated neighbourhood policing team for every community by April 2008&#151;a significant achievement. In fact, we recently reached a significant milestone in the neighbourhood policing programme: forces across England and Wales increased PCSO numbers to 16,000&#151;a tremendous achievement. The police service doubled PCSO numbers over a seven-month period and I take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who worked so hard to make that happen. In addition, more than 12,000 police constables and sergeants are dedicated to neighbourhood policing in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07060695000562">I know that my hon. Friend is concerned about continued support for his police service and we shall do all we can to ensure that every police force can maintain a strong and visible presence on the street. It is of course a matter for chief constables, such as Sean Price, to determine the best staffing mix for their neighbourhood policing teams, taking into account local circumstances. We have extended to police forces the freedom to determine their own arrangements, while providing greater sustainability for neighbourhood policing in the future. My hon. Friend will know that those changes had an unintended impact on Cleveland, which we have done our best to address by providing an allocation for new PCSO recruitment in 2007-08 as an exceptional arrangement. That shows our commitment to support the measures in Middlesbrough that my hon. Friend described. The outcome is that the Cleveland police force has been allocated &#163;2.6 million towards the cost of neighbourhood policing in 2007-08, which is an increase of 63 per cent. over funding in 2006-07&#151;the highest in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para24"><a name="07060695000563">The force will have at least 166 PCSOs in 2008, contributing to the roll-out of neighbourhood policing across Cleveland. It will not be expected to increase PCSO numbers further, although it is free to do so if it wants, but it would need to look to partners for funding, in line with other forces. That is important because, as my hon. Friend pointed out, community safety is a shared responsibility and local decision making, with the involvement of the community and local partners, is crucial to the success of neighbourhood policing. Wherever I go, I realise that co-operative working by the police, the council, health  <br>

authorities, schools and residents is fundamental to delivering not just effective neighbourhood policing but neighbourhood management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para25"><a name="07060695000564">As my hon. Friend pointed out, in Middlesbrough&#151;as in other areas&#151;people need to see that broken windows, smashed-up bus shelters, graffiti or litter are sorted out quickly. If they see that graffiti is cleaned off quickly, broken street furniture is dealt with and litter is swept from the streets, other aspects of neighbourhood policing will also be seen and people will believe that things are improving in their area. The effectiveness of the neighbourhood management model in Middlesbrough that my hon. Friend described&#151;the effective working partnerships&#151;means that we can have a combined approach to tackling some of the quality of life issues that confront people. As we all know from our constituents, when people open their doors they want to be proud of their neighbourhood and to have a visible police presence. I congratulate all those in Middlesbrough who have made that possible in their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para26"><a name="07060695000565">I shall finish with some more general remarks about the future. In March 2007, the Home Secretary announced the establishment of an independent review of policing in England and Wales, to be led by  Sir Ronnie Flanagan. It will focus on four specific  <br>

aspects, which will help areas such as Middlesbrough. It will further reduce bureaucracy, focusing resources on the front line and freeing up police officer time. It will embed neighbourhood policing in areas such as Middlesbrough, ensuring that it becomes a permanent part of the policing landscape. Local accountability will better ensure that the public drive local policing priorities; Middlesbrough is leading the way, with local people helping the police to determine those priorities. It will also focus on how the service can best use its resources to meet all the challenges that it faces. The report will be produced at the end of this year and there will be an interim report in August. My hon. Friend will recognise that that will be highly relevant to the matters that he has raised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70606-0022.htm_para27"><a name="07060695000566">I repeat my thanks to my hon. Friend for securing this extremely useful debate and the way in which he put forward the interests of his constituents. He has demonstrated that the only way to move forward on issues relating to crime and antisocial behaviour is for everyone to work together. By working together, real progress can be made. I congratulate everyone in Middlesbrough and the whole Cleveland area on the work that they have done.</p>
