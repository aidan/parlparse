Indeed, my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Chancellor have just returned from a trip to India to explore some of those issues. The industry is now about value-added manufacturing. It remains important, as it accounts for some 14 per cent. of gross domestic product&#151;the figure is rather higher, I think, in my hon.

Secondly, we remain very good at aspects of manufacturing. We are still producing 1.6 million vehicles in this country, which is close to the peak of the early 1970s. Our aerospace industry is important and we are well placed in emerging environmental and energy technologies. It is about adding value, as well as what we are good at.

and I hope we can build on it. There has been a great deal of offshore development recently. Just before Christmas I announced the go-ahead for the Government&#146;s interest in a very large wind farm, the London Array project. It is a pity that that has been blocked by a Conservative council.</p>

I tell the hon.

We could not, for example, end up being substantially dependent on the actions of millions of individuals in order to get enough electricity to heat and light our houses and factories.

We need to consider how we can change those procedures. I have always said that our planning system is completely out of date in this regard. We need to streamline the planning process, especially in relation to major projects, and I wait to see whether we will get cross-party support on doing that. The hon.

There will never be a network of anything like that size without public subsidy. About 4,000 branches could be supported on a commercial basis&#151;perhaps 1,000 or so more&#151;but I believe that the Government have an obligation to ensure that there is a national network. That is why we believe that the size of the present network needs to be reduced; otherwise, it will become more and more expensive.

Following on from the point about WH Smith made by the hon.

I do not think that there is any support for those companies in any part of the House, and I hope that they will put their house in order before they are forced to do so by legislation. We are consulting on the introduction of those holidays, and we expect to introduce four later this year and four next year.

We are discussing with the industry the possibility of pooling resources in order to get a network to bring that oil ashore. The hon.

That initiative is a really important element in taking the matter forward.</p>

The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill received its First Reading before Christmas and will take oral evidence. On the other hand, the Pensions Bill, which also had its First Reading before Christmas, cannot take oral evidence, yet the Minister for Pensions Reform tabled an amendment on the written evidence for the Committee yesterday; so it is subject to some of the new procedures but not all of them. Surely, the decision as to the powers of Bill Committees is a matter for the House and not for the Government. Will the Leader of the House confirm that under Standing Order 83C decisions about the number of evidence sessions should be taken by the relevant Public Bill Committee through its Programming Sub-Committee? Will he also confirm that a Public Bill Committee can decide to take evidence notwithstanding a decision to the contrary by the Government?

Lady&#146;s first point was not bad, but she then made a terrible one, by drawing a contrast between our record on school building and her own. I advise her not to pursue that, because our record on school building is astonishing when compared with hers. I remember when I was shadow Education Secretary that, year after year, I had to publish a dossier on crumbling schools because of the terrible state of the buildings. That is illustrated by the fact that in 1997, just &#163;700 million was being spent on school buildings, and that figure has now risen to &#163;6.4 thousand million. I say to the right hon. Lady that on this, as on NHS spending, she voted against such increases in public spending, and everyone knows that the unquestionable improvements that have taken place in every school across the country under our Government would not have taken place under her. The Building Schools for the Future programme, from which thousands of children will benefit, is simply a further stage in the brilliant programme that we have followed&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>One or two Conservative Members may well&#151;</p>

Some Conservative Members may be laughing about this, but all they have to do is look at the state of school buildings in their constituencies and compare what they are like now with what they were like before 1997.

If she looks at what I said when the matter was debated&#151;I was very grateful for her support for this important change both on the Modernisation Committee and on the Floor of the House&#151;she will see that I said that the new procedures would be introduced for all Bills that were introduced into this House after Christmas. I made it clear that the number of Bills to which the procedure would apply in this Session would be limited. The reason for that is to ensure that this change&#151;unlike, for example, the change to Special Standing Committees, which was a good idea, but never properly bedded down&#151;is properly bedded down.</p>

Gentleman says that he does not want to make the Home Secretary&#146;s life difficult, but the record of the Liberal Democrats has been one of making public protection and the responsibilities of the Home Secretary much more difficult. There is no point in the Liberal Democrats complaining about a shortage of prison places when they have campaigned against an increase in those places. I can bet my life that if there were proposals to increase the amount of secure accommodation, they would be campaigning against them as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70118-0004.htm_para33"><a name="07011841000197">I am also concerned about rail services. I occasionally use First Great Western, and its service is poor and among the worst in the country. However, although the House is responsible for the total investment in the railways, which has increased considerably, and for investment in, and the ultimate control of, Network Rail, which is effectively a publicly-owned company, it is not responsible for the private companies. I do not think that the Liberals voted for the idea, but the Conservatives certainly did. The responsibility for the ludicrous decision to take good, new stock out of commission and to replace it with fewer carriages of old stock must rest not with the Government, but with those who run First Great Western.</p>

He deprecates just as much as the House such ludicrous over-interpretation of the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70118-0004.htm_para35"><a name="07011841000199">Of course I will look at what I said last week about the BAE Systems-Saudi decision. I do not have the record with me, but if it needs correcting, I will of course do so. I certainly recall that the combination of what the head of the Serious Fraud Office and the Attorney-General said was that a judgment had been made that continuing the prosecution would not be in the national interest and that a continuation of the process, even for a further 18 months, would be very unlikely to produce evidence that could secure a prosecution. The Liberal Democrats claim to be the first to defend the civil liberties of others. They need to be very careful before they continue to spray around allegations of culpability by anyone, including BAES and the Saudi Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07011841000254">Over the past three years, the public, industry and Parliament have all contributed to a national debate about the BBC, its future shape and its funding in an unprecedented exercise in public involvement. I am now in a position to announce what the funding will be over the first part of the new 10-year charter period. The settlement will be for six years, with annual nominal increases in the licence fee of 3 per cent. for the first two years, and 2 per cent. in years 3, 4 and 5 of the settlement. There will be an increase in the sixth year&#151;2012-13&#151;of up to 2 per cent., depending on a further review nearer the time. I have written to the BBC Trust today setting that out. Those are cash increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000255">The price of a colour TV licence will rise from its current level of &#163;131.50 to &#163;135.50 from 1 April this year, reaching a figure of up to &#163;151.50 in 2012. Based on the Treasury forecast of the consumer price index&#151;the Bank of England&#146;s inflation measure&#151;that will either be above or in line with inflation for each year of the settlement. That will enable the BBC to deliver its new public purposes, which we set out in the new charter. As digital technology transforms the media world, it will enable the BBC to take a leading role in making the most of such technology. Investment in high-quality content&#151;the driver of creative industry and what audiences value most of all&#151;will remain high. The settlement will enable the BBC to do that. It will also allow the BBC to move key departments, including children&#146;s programmes, sport, new media and learning, to Salford in the north-west of England. I, like hon. Members in all parts of the House, will welcome the trust&#146;s confirmation, due later today, that that will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000256">This is a vital opportunity for the BBC to widen its geographical spread and relevance, and make better use of the creativity and talent that exist right across the United Kingdom, bringing huge benefits to the regional economy, estimated at &#163;1.5 billion and 15,500 jobs. Through greater efficiency, the settlement will allow the BBC to maintain all its current services and provide up to &#163;1.2bn for investment in new activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000257">The people of the United Kingdom spend more of their money on the BBC than any other country in the world spends on public service broadcasting, except Germany. So the new BBC Trust must ensure that licence fee payers get the best possible value for that investment. We expect the trust to ensure efficiency in the BBC. On the basis of independent evidence from the consultants PKF and others, we believe that the BBC can realise up to 3 per cent. cash-releasing savings annually from 2008. A separate report published today by the National Audit Office confirms that our judgment is based on adequate evidence. It will be the trust&#146;s responsibility to set specific targets and hold the management of the BBC responsible for meeting them.</p>

&#163;600 million scheme that we are putting in place to help elderly and disabled people make the switch to digital, as part of our commitment to universal broadcasting and to ensure that no one is left behind. The Government&#146;s expectation is that the BBC will lead the delivery of the scheme. We respect the independent status of the trust, and clearly there are details of the implementation of the scheme still to be discussed. The Government will retain responsibility for the policy, including helping with procurement and determining eligibility for the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07011841000259">The BBC will also pay for the &#163;200 million public communications campaign being run by Digital UK to ensure that people are properly prepared and properly informed about switchover. These sums will be ring-fenced within the settlement and so will not form part of the BBC&#146;s baseline at the end of the settlement. We have made it clear that carrying out these responsibilities will not impact on the BBC&#146;s core services and budgets. We are giving the BBC a 12.5 per cent. increase in its borrowing capacity to help deliver this commitment. We will ensure that the BBC&#146;s services are protected from any cost increases in the help scheme, above our existing estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07011841000260">In last year&#146;s White Paper on the BBC, we noted that Channel 4 was likely to face major financial challenges from digital switchover in the future. Ofcom is assessing the potential scale of those challenges. We said at the time that we would consider potential forms of help, including asking the BBC to help towards meeting Channel 4&#146;s capital switchover costs, and possible access for Channel 4 to some of the BBC&#146;s digital TV capacity. As I said, Ofcom&#146;s review of Channel 4 is looking in detail at its financial prospects and is expected to report towards the summer. I am therefore keeping open, within the licence fee settlement, the possibility that we may require the BBC to contribute to the first six years of Channel 4&#146;s switchover costs. This will be no more that &#163;14 million in total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000261">I welcome the BBC&#146;s conclusion that, in principle, it can make available some spare digital terrestrial capacity, amounting to a TV slot in England and three radio slots, at switchover. Under the BBC agreement, I can direct the BBC to make capacity available to another public service broadcaster, where it is in the interests of public service broadcasting in the UK. I shall decide whether and how to use that power in the light of the Ofcom review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000262">The settlement that I have set out for the BBC provides stability and certainty over the crucial period of digital switchover. The sixth year will, in effect, also form the first year of the following settlement. It will allow us to undertake a further review of the licence fee level in the run-up to the mid-charter point, taking account of the wider review of public service broadcasting, consistent with our commitment in the White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000263">A strong, independent BBC, accountable to its licence payers&#151;its paymasters&#151;and providing the highest public value: that has been our fundamental goal throughout this long process. It is now complete, and the BBC, along with other broadcasters, can plan and prepare for digital switchover, the next great revolution in television, ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected and that the founding  <br>

The licence fee settlement was not announced in today&#146;s statement by the Secretary of State. It was leaked by Treasury officials to Channel 4 News two days after Parliament rose for Christmas, and in a series of subsequent leaks to the media. Will the Secretary of State therefore apologise to the House for the shameful way in which it has been treated over the announcement?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000266">Is not the real point that the statement is the Chancellor&#146;s announcement, not the Secretary of State&#146;s, and that it is as much a defeat for the right hon. Lady as for the director-general of the BBC? Not for the first time, the Secretary of State has had an unfortunate collision with the &#147;great, clunking fist&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000267">None the less, we are grateful that the process of negotiating the licence fee has at last drawn to a close. There have been three years of what the Secretary of State would call consultation, which has in fact been dithering and indecisiveness on her part and the part of the Government. Time and again, the Secretary of State let it be known that an announcement was imminent, and time and again she was forced to postpone it&#151;first, last summer, then the autumn, then Christmas. Finally, a decision has been reached, and months of damaging uncertainty may at last be coming to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07011841000268">The Opposition fully support the important contribution that the BBC makes to the lives of the British people. The BBC is clearly one of our greatest organisations, and one of the most effective global ambassadors that we have. Of course we wish to see it appropriately resourced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07011841000269">The Secretary of State was originally convinced by the BBC&#146;s inflation-busting argument. We were not. We argued that, at a time of falling advertising revenue, no other media business could expect such a substantial guaranteed income stream over the next seven years. We believe it is right that the BBC should be asked to live within the realities of today&#146;s rapidly changing media environment. This is a more realistic settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07011841000270">The settlement, combined with greater income from household growth, means that the BBC will receive substantially more money than it does today&#151;something that none of its competitors can hope for. However, no other media organisation has been asked to take on the huge new responsibilities that the Secretary of State has foisted on the BBC. The BBC is now responsible for digital switchover. At least, the right hon. Lady said in her statement that the Government&#146;s expectation remains that the BBC will lead the delivery of the scheme. Perhaps she could take the opportunity to clarify whether the BBC Trust has agreed to deliver on targeted assistance on the terms that she articulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07011841000271">Not only that, but the BBC is expected to move a large part of its organisation to Salford&#151;a move that will cost at least &#163;400 million. Those two new obligations will cost the BBC about &#163;1.5 billion over the next four years&#151;money that will have to be taken out of the licence fee. According to the Library, the cost of targeted help for digital switchover&#151;&#163;600 million&#151;would, on its own, add &#163;7.20 to the cost of the licence fee. Does the Secretary of State believe that those new obligations can still be met under this settlement? Can she assure us that programme quality will not be jeopardised? That is certainly not what the director-general, Mark Thompson, is on record as saying this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07011841000272">On digital switchover, given that the Secretary of State has said that the money will be ring-fenced, will it appear as a separate item on the licence fee so that viewers know that they are meeting that cost? Where will any extra money come from if the cost of switchover exceeds the Department&#146;s estimates? Will it come from the licence fee or from the Treasury? Once switchover has been accomplished, will the level of the licence fee be reduced accordingly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000273">Even after today&#146;s announcements, there is still a huge degree of uncertainty. The reason is clear. The Chancellor, who cannot resist interfering with anything and everything, could not resist the chance to meddle with the licence fee. He has loaded it with a stealth tax and forced obligations onto the BBC that it did not want. Future licence fee settlements must not be negotiated in that way. Under the next Conservative Government, it will be for Parliament to debate the role of the BBC in a rapidly changing, technologically driven media world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000274">The Secretary of State cites the National Audit Office, yet the NAO has not seen the books. As an organisation in receipt of more than &#163;3 billion of public money, it is surely right and proper that the BBC should be subject to independent scrutiny and that the results should be debated properly here in Parliament. Will she at least allow the NAO full access to the figures outlining how the BBC spends &#163;3 billion of public money?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000275">This licence fee settlement has been subject to superficial consultation and grubby, behind-closed-doors negotiations.

That money is ring-fenced subject, on the Government&#146;s decision, to very clear protection of the BBC&#146;s major function, which is to put high-quality programming on to people&#146;s screens. That ring-fenced sum will ensure that the BBC&#146;s role in running the targeted help scheme and leading on the digital switchover will not be detrimentally affected by other considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para23"><a name="07011841000279">Those costs will be levied on the licence fee payer specifically for the period of switchover. If the hon. Gentleman had listened to the statement&#151;he continues not to listen to my answer to his question&#151;he would know that they will not form part of the BBC&#146;s baseline. That means that at the end of the switchover period the BBC Trust will be able to return those moneys to the licence fee payer or, in consultation with licence fee payers, to make judgments about how else they might be used.</p>

Does the Secretary of State acknowledge that based on realistic, not Treasury, estimates, this is a below-inflation rise in the licence fee, and that that will put the BBC&#146;s reputation at risk? Surely the only person who will cheer her statement is Mr. Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para26"><a name="07011841000285">The Secretary of State accused the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) of being contemptuous of consultation. Does not she recall a survey that she commissioned that demonstrated that the vast majority of licence fee payers are willing to see a modest real-terms increase in the licence fee in return for improved quality? Why is she ignoring her own research?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para27"><a name="07011841000286">Surely it is the case that, for the equivalent of buying only five copies a year of <i> Radio Times</i>, licence fee payers could have what they wanted&#151;a modest increase in the licence fee in return for improved quality and more services. Perhaps the hon. Member for East Devon put his finger on the problem in that the Secretary of State should not be entirely blamed because the statement has &#147;Treasury&#148; stamped all over it. It means that, for the period of the settlement, the BBC will have &#163;2 billion less than it said that it needed to deliver the Government&#146;s White Paper vision. Even if the BBC estimated its costs wrongly and underestimated the amount of income that it can make, the shortfall means that it will have to slash its plans for new services and investment in new programming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para28"><a name="07011841000287">The settlement confirms that the licence fee payer will pay for the Government&#146;s policy of targeted assistance to help vulnerable people switch to digital. Surely the Government should pay for that. Will the Secretary of State answer the question that she has still not answered and say whether she has confirmed such a scheme with the BBC? What will happen if the cost is higher than the &#163;600 million that the Government predict? Will she pay the extra or will the BBC have to cut its programme budget?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="70118-0006.htm_para29"><a name="07011841000288">The Secretary of State offered warm words about the BBC&#146;s future but they are not backed by the reality of her announcement. Against the wishes of listeners and viewers, and in response to Treasury demands, the BBC has to face a real-terms cut in its income, bear the risk of inflation and fund the cost of the Government&#146;s policy of digital switchover out of its programming budget. The Prime Minister tried to bully the BBC over Iraq, but his likely successor appears to want to destroy it.</p>

A third of those surveyed wanted to pay less; a third were content with the current licence fee, and a third were willing to pay more. However, the class and ethnic make-up of those willing to pay more was marked. Seventy-five per cent. of those surveyed said that any new services that the BBC offered should be funded not by the licence fee but by subscription. The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70118-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000293">The cost of digital switchover is a broadcasting cost and that is why the licence fee should cover it.

We know that the Liberal Democrats bravely play fast and loose with public finances and unfunded tax commitments, but it is right that the licence fee payer should meet a broadcasting cost.</p>

Friend agree that, when the BBC made its declaration for an increase of 2.3 per cent. above the rate of inflation, many of us&#151;including me&#151;thought that that was outrageous? I am pleased that the Jowell-Brown combination has come up with something much more reasonable. If the BBC finds difficulty in managing its books, it should consider some of its programmes. I do not fall for the nonsense about the wonderful journalism&#151;the starry-eyed views that I had when I first came here have changed over the past many years. I would sack Andrew Neil and all his cronies on &#147;The Daily Politics&#148; programme and fire Nick Robinson&#151;another Tory who works for the BBC. If any more savings are needed, what about telling Jonathan Ross that he gets too much money? Finally, the BBC should be told that, if it is going to help Channel 4 with its switchover costs, that station had better drop crap programmes like &#147;Big Brother&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para0"><a name="07011841000342">The debate is also timely, as such issues are always rightly under public scrutiny and subject to substantial media interest. Lately, however, that spotlight has been even more intense. Recently, the Public Accounts Committee discussed antisocial behaviour; on 2 November, the Youth Justice Board reported on antisocial behaviour orders; and on 7 December, the National Audit Office published its report, &#147;Tackling Anti-social Behaviour&#148;. It is important that I put my comments in the context of those excellent documents.</p>

It is right and proper that elements of our antisocial behaviour policy and the whole respect agenda should be subject to due scrutiny. We should not, however, dwell on particular aspects. Antisocial behaviour and the Government&#146;s policy on it are on a continuum from prevention and preventive measures to control and effect.</p>

Intervention&#151;and especially prevention, as she suggests&#151;works best in the context of that focused, multi-faceted and multi-agency approach. The debate should take place in the context of that range of policy initiatives. That is not to demur from a debate on ASBOs, and the National Audit Office report was particularly useful in that regard. However, we must debate the issue in the context of parenting orders, individual support orders and other initiatives carried out by a range of agencies. The real success of such a programme in alleviating the effects of antisocial behaviour in our communities will be seen when all the prevention works, and there is no longer a need for more severe forms of intervention.</p>

policies and the use of ASBOs, whose effectiveness has been demonstrated in Manchester. However, I am disappointed in the Government&#146;s approach to the licensing of mini-motorbikes. There have been 26,000 calls about them to Greater Manchester police in the past year. It is true that the police have powers to deal with them individually, but is that a sensible use of police resources when most of the problem could be dealt with by a licensing regime?</p>

Friend&#146;s disappointment, but I take his point about the general problem of mini-motos. I agree that the task of dealing with it should not fall entirely to the police, and that other agencies or systems should also come into play. A licensing system is one possibility, but I think the most fruitful area to explore is direct intervention with manufacturers and retailers, in the full and certain knowledge that not much mini-moto activity can be legally sustained. Mini-motos are not allowed on roads or in public parks, and they are not allowed on private land without express permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000348">This is a huge and growing issue, and we are trying increasingly to deal with it. We are already working with manufacturers and retailers, and we need to do more of that. I will pass on my hon.

Friend&#146;s points about ASBOs, but if we are to engage in a mature debate we cannot slip into the belief that we are criminalising an entire generation by deploying them. That is not the case, and the numbers involved do not sustain such a suggestion. Nor should we assume that they do not work because they are seen as a badge of honour, that they do not work because of the breach rates, or that they do not help with prevention and helping young people to develop. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Let me say in response to the chuntering on the Opposition Front Bench that I will return to the issue of the Youth Justice Board. I have a few words to say about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07011841000350">As I have said, ASBOs are not ineffective, and they are not criminalising an entire generation. They must be used as one element in an overall continuum. Criticism of their use on either of those counts often constitutes a counsel of despair from people who would rather do nothing than help our communities. It should also be recognised that, more often than not, young people themselves are victims of antisocial behaviour. It is important to understand that ASBOs are not just about attacking young people.</p>

That is largely due to back-up from the police&#151;community beat officers and managers working together&#151;and the local authority provision of community wardens. It worries me that local authorities are reducing the number of wardens and a visible presence on the streets, which is allowing antisocial behaviour to become rife again. Has my hon.

thus bringing continued respite to the community. I know that there is a debate about breach rates among young people and others, and we will come to that, but it is important to note that the NAO&#146;s sample showed that 65 per cent. of people desisted from antisocial behaviour after one intervention and 93 per cent. did so after three.

That is relevant to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle).

Therein lies a conundrum, in the sense that the more that we seek to focus on intervention and the outcomes of antisocial behaviour and the more resources that we put into neighbourhood policing, the more&#151;initially, at least&#151;people take an interest in problems of antisocial behaviour and low-level crime and the more their wish to have them resolved is heightened. Such intervention and awareness of problems and possible solutions to them might well increase people&#146;s confidence in the ability to seek their resolution. Therefore, to pursue the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, although I cite in argument those British crime survey statistics, they might well fluctuate. That is relevant to his point about analysis and understanding what is really going on. Nevertheless, the notion that there has been success has been proven.</p>

We are ensuring that areas are increasingly measured on their effectiveness in tackling antisocial behaviour through the introduction of local area agreements. From&#151;I think&#151;next April, all local authorities in England will have a local area agreement setting out the priorities for that area as agreed, crucially, between local partners and central Government.</p>

The respect programme, which was launched at about this time last year, will step up and broaden the Government&#146;s clampdown on antisocial behaviour, promoting good behaviour and challenging bad. The taskforce continues to support, encourage and challenge local services to implement approaches that will build respect and tackle antisocial behaviour, and ensure that communities see and feel that action is being taken.</p>

antisocial behaviour, and the precursors of it, should be at the centre of all that they do. Providing locally tailored solutions to antisocial behaviour is no easy task. Every perpetrator of antisocial behaviour is different, so one-size-fits-all solutions do not work. As I have said, that is also true for responses on a locality basis; solutions in each constituency or borough must be different given the different natures and make-ups of our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000370">In consultation with experts in the field, we have equipped those on the ground with the necessary range of tools and powers to do their job in the best way that they see fit. They can tailor use of interventions according to the antisocial behaviour committed and their knowledge of the perpetrator. Our guidance strongly advocates an incremental approach. In practice, that means that to turn around the petty nuisance behaviour of a child at school, an acceptable behaviour agreement can be made; that the group of children who cause a nuisance on a housing estate can be arrested if they fail to abide by a dispersal order; that there are fixed penalty notices for litter louts and those who cause disorder; and that, for the persistent perpetrator of antisocial behaviour, the courts can make an ASBO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000371">Alongside those measures, &#163;45 million of additional funding has been made available to youth offending teams through the Youth Justice Board to develop and enhance a range of evidence-based preventive programmes. Those schemes enable young people who are referred to be supported and challenged in order to address the underlying causes of their antisocial behaviour. Effective sanctions are available for those who do not comply and there is support throughout the process in order to change bad behaviour. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport suggested, for young people given an ASBO we have created the individual support order and the parenting order to tackle the root causes of their behaviour and to achieve that preventive dimension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000372">An effective approach to tackling antisocial behaviour must be based on a mixture of support, sanction and, crucially, prevention, as well as intervention. The key aims of any intervention are to enable the individual to recognise the consequences of their behaviour, to ensure that they change their behaviour, to protect victims, witnesses and the community, and to provide the support and education required to address the behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000373">We have taken huge strides in providing those tools and powers and we are now consulting on whether we need to strengthen them further with new measures, including proposals for a deferred penalty notice for disorder. That will encourage adherence to acceptable behaviour contracts by attaching a penalty notice for disorder which would come into effect only if the contracts were breached. I hesitated a moment ago because my speaking notes say &#147;incentivise&#148; and I refuse to use such words; &#147;encourage&#148; or &#147;motivate&#148; are better. We are also proposing new powers to close premises that cause persistent, significant and serious harm to local communities, but as a last resort and backed up by court order.</p>

youth issue, as many believe. The latest statistics on ASBOs, published on 7 December, show that nearly 60 per cent. of ASBOs were issued to adults and only 40 per cent. to children. We are working harder than ever to divert young people from antisocial behaviour, and I should like to highlight the good work that the Youth Justice Board is doing in this respect. It is one of the many partners that must be at the table in looking at antisocial behaviour interventions in communities such as those in my hon. Friends&#146; constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para23"><a name="07011841000375">In 2005-06, youth offending teams delivered parenting interventions in respect of 11,007 young people with final-warning interventions and community-based penalties; that is more than double the estimated number delivered in 2003-04. Of those interventions, 87 per cent. were delivered on a voluntary basis, and 13 per cent. under parenting orders. Most parents are willing to engage without a contract or order, but where more structure is needed a contract can be offered. Where parents are not willing to engage in tackling the child&#146;s behaviour voluntarily, a parenting order can be made. YOTs will also be providing more parenting support, using funds provided through the 2004 spending review and the 2005 Budget, with a focus on preventing youth crime and antisocial behaviour. Many colleagues present will know that in every area there is a hard core of persistent antisocial behaviour offenders, just as there is in respect of a range of other crimes. Our job is to try to turn around those offenders, as well as to deal with them in other ways if that does not happen. Equally, we must ensure that what is a minority of yobs is not added to by that potential reservoir.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70118-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07011841000376">Some 84 YOTs are putting in place targeted parenting programmes that are aimed at preventing offending or antisocial behaviour by children. The funding for these programmes amounted to some &#163;4 million in 2006-07, and it will be &#163;5.5 million next year. It should pay for several thousand more parenting interventions, which will be counted toward a YOT performance target and reported to the Youth Justice Board. That new funding is also being used to develop parenting services directed at young fathers, black or minority ethnic parents and young parents in custody. Most YOTs are also putting in place youth inclusion programmes and youth inclusion and support panels, which deliver parenting interventions as part of a package of support for at-risk young people. As was pointed out earlier, the make-up of families and their at times apparently dysfunctional nature is a factor, which is why I am particularly pleased about these interventions on young fathers and on young mothers&#151;with or without the father in tow. That must be part of the overall process.</p>

In a survey conducted by University College London last May, the UK was thought by respondents to be Europe&#146;s worst country for antisocial behaviour, with more than three quarters of them believing that Britain had a &#147;big or moderate problem&#148;. The cost of responding to reports of antisocial behaviour in England and Wales is &#163;3.4 billion a year, and approximately one in five people now perceives a high level of antisocial behaviour, according to the British crime survey. A count of antisocial behaviour conducted by the Home Office in September 2003 came up with a total of more than 66,000 reports of antisocial behaviour in one day. That is equivalent to 16.5 million incidents a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70118-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000379">A number of official indicators of antisocial behaviour show an increase. Of the seven strands that make up the measure, three have shown an increase since 2004-05&#151; teenagers hanging around on the streets, people being drunk or rowdy in public places, an issue to which I shall return, and noisy neighbours or loud parties. This is primarily, but certainly not exclusively, an urban problem. The British crime survey found that people living in urban areas were twice as likely as those living in rural areas to perceive high levels of antisocial behaviour. Social renters were almost twice as likely as those in owner-occupied or private rented accommodation to experience high levels of perceived antisocial behaviour. However, the key point is surely that antisocial behaviour affects the poorest in our society the most, and disproportionately. In addition, the fear of youth crime is rising. Nearly a third of people now believe that young people hanging around on street corners represents a serious problem; significantly, that is an increase from the approximately one quarter who believed that as short a time ago as 1996.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70118-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000380">Antisocial behaviour can be nuisance behaviour, but much of the time it is neighbourhood crime and should be dealt with accordingly. The use of abusive or intimidating language and drunken behaviour are crimes, and our concern about the Government&#146;s response is that too much of it involves keeping such offenders out of the courts, while failing to tackle the offences that are taking place. Let us consider the essential part of the Government&#146;s toolkit: antisocial behaviour orders. The National Audit Office report shows that more than half&#151;55 per cent.&#151;of ASBOs are breached. Of those breaches, more than a third&#151;35 per cent.&#151;occurred on more than five occasions. In my county of Sussex, there are four breaches for every ASBO that has been issued. Some 79 per cent. of those who receive an ASBO have previous convictions, and  <br>

First, it may be the case that the courts are not being tough enough, but they are of course under pressure not to produce custodial sentences because the Government have not planned for sufficient for prison places. Secondly, there are many offenders who should have been dealt with in the courts in the first place, rather than through this remedy. Nevertheless, it is unacceptable that such a low number of breaches are dealt with through custodial sentences, and I am happy to agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point.</p>

Nearly 22,000 penalty notices for disorder were issued for shoplifting in 2005 and nearly 17,000 in the first six months of 2006.

Not surprisingly, those plans did not make it into the Government&#146;s consultation paper on antisocial behaviour, published in November. But the suggestion alone indicates just how out of touch the Home Office is with the public. It has a strange notion of what constitutes proper justice.</p>

<p><a name="st_o234"><a name="07011841000409"><a name="70118-0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="07011841001139"><b>Meg Hillier (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The hon.

Is that his party&#146;s policy?</p>

By that measure, the true justice gap&#151;the failure to bring offences to justice&#151;may have increased over the past two years because, if penalty notices for disorder involve no admission of guilt, can they really be considered to be true justice? The Government have taken hundreds of thousands of quite serious cases out of the courts and punished criminals with little more than a slap on the wrist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70118-0009.htm_para28"><a name="07011841000414">The Government&#146;s latest idea, outlined in the November consultation paper, is a deferred penalty notice for disorder. The proposal would mean that a fine would not be payable for up to six months, or might even not be paid at all. In effect, the notice would be a warning that the offender would receive a warning. I wonder whether the Government plan to count those deferred penalty notices for disorder as offences brought to justice. That would certainly help their detection rates.</p>

The prohibited phrase epitomises a sentiment that is probably shared by 80 per cent. of the general public. It is almost certainly shared by the occupant of No. 11 Downing street, but it apparently constitutes an offence meriting a fine of &#163;80. That is plainly nonsense. If there had been any attempt to take the case to court, it is inconceivable that a sensible magistrate would have convicted the man for wearing the shirt. That shows another danger arising from the increasing use of penalty notices for disorder&#151;that they can lead to injustice, with improper decisions being taken by the police and people effectively being coerced into accepting a ticket rather than run the risk of a prosecution.</p>

By contrast, the NAO reports research from the United States, which shows that the savings from diverting an individual from a life of antisocial behaviour and crime range from &#163;0.9 million to &#163;1.2 million a year. It makes economic as well as social sense to look more creatively at the type of interventions that the NAO says will work and which are cost-effective, including special education programmes and support for families.</p>

It rarely can, and in the case of antisocial behaviour, it has not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70118-0010.htm_para28"><a name="07011841000457">We believe that a new approach is needed, which epitomises our belief in social responsibility&#151;that we all, not just the state, have obligations to our neighbours and communities, and that politicians should put trust in people and the local associations that they naturally form. That means ensuring that voluntary organisations and local communities are empowered to participate in the organisation of community safety.</p>

I talked about the police, but I did not mention wardens. I am happy to echo his support for them. In my constituency, successful warden schemes operate in some villages, and they are popular with the local community; but in other villages in my rural constituency, there is unhappiness that too much of the burden is now being put on the local community, which has to make its own provision for wardens. The police precept has increased&#151;it has doubled proportionately in terms of the funding for police&#151;yet people feel that they have not been given police officers in return. The Government&#146;s recent reneging on their promise of PCSOs for those villages has deeply upset people. They feel that they are being asked to pay twice; they are paying increased council tax and not receiving police officers in return and now they are being asked to pay for wardens, too.</p>

Crime and disorder reduction partnerships are invisible to the public, exactly as police authorities are invisible to the public. Much stronger local accountability is needed, as well as diversity in the delivery of community safety and an enhanced sense of community among the organisations involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70118-0010.htm_para31"><a name="07011841000462">We favour a right to policing; communities should be given ownership of community safety and a real say in how it is delivered.

That puts a question mark over how effective the interventions have been and whether the Prime Minister&#146;s rhetoric about engaging in the causes of crime has actually been met in reality. I hope that we can all agree about the importance of tackling the causes. What I am seeking to examine is whether or not the interventions have been effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70118-0010.htm_para32"><a name="07011841000465">I had moved on to the issue of the extent to which the public feel excluded from the decisions that are taken about community safety in their area. As far back as 1988, the Prime Minister said:</p>

People do not know who is responsible and that is part of the problem. The crime and disorder reduction partnerships are, as I have said, intensely bureaucratic and usually invisible to the public. Police authorities are essentially invisible to the public&#151;though the police have made great strides in advancing their own visibility&#151;and if neighbourhood policing is going to be withdrawn as a result of cuts in promised PCSO numbers and so forth, it will obviously not be a solution. As the partnership approach becomes increasingly important, we believe that it is essential to rebuild the bridges between the community and the agencies that are delivering community safety. The community must be given a real say&#151;with respect to budgetary control, where appropriate&#151;in terms of the delivery of community safety in local areas.</p>

almost every night. People&#146;s lives were blighted by burnt-out cars, vandalism, and loud music. Drug-taking took place openly on the streets and fireworks were let off as a signal to drug addicts to come and get their fix. Sue set up the Aysgarth community association and badgered the local council and police for help. The council has now refurbished many of the squalid one-bedroom flats that used to house the drug dealers. The rest were bulldozed. Four years on, the estate is almost trouble free. People used to sympathise with Sue about living in Aysgarth, but now they want to live there. Sue&#146;s tenacity has transformed her area and she is a credit to her community.</p>

Last year, the Calder Grove area of Wakefield saw large groups of young people loitering on street corners, drinking, being unruly and generally causing traffic problems. A parish councillor for West Bretton, Hazel worked with the local neighbourhood police teams to identify the young people involved. They met the parents and agreed acceptable behaviour contracts&#151;and they worked. The Home Secretary visited Calder Grove in May 2006 and saw for himself how those teams had reduced the problems in their community.</p>

Mini-motorbikes are dangerous, antisocial and illegal. Councillor Ron Halliday represents Wakefield East ward, which covers the Eastmoor and Portobello estates. Ron took me out to Portobello to show me the damage that those bikes had caused. They are simply a death-trap for children, yet I have never seen any young rider wearing a helmet. Ron has been campaigning to stop young people riding mini-motos and to educate parents about the dangers of letting their children ride them. Mini-motos cost at least a couple of hundred pounds and I cannot understand why parents insist on buying them for their children. Ron&#146;s work is improving lives and could even save lives.</p>

Wakefield&#146;s Westgate area is famous for its clubs and bars, but recently it has become a magnet for drink-fuelled antisocial behaviour, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. Wakefield, known as &#147;the Merrie city&#148; since mediaeval times on account of the quality of its pubs, was getting a terrible reputation. Families were afraid to venture out after dark and the Wakefield theatre and restaurants claimed that brawling drunkards were scaring people away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000482">I saw that arresting people takes huge amounts of officer time. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister visited Wakefield last summer and is aware of the booking-in problems at Wakefield station. We cannot tackle 21st century crime in 19th century buildings. Right at the end of the evening, outside the police station, I also witnessed the arrest of an extremely drunk and highly aggressive young man. I will not repeat the language that was used, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it was a stream of four-letter words&#151;the worst two that can be thought of, so I will leave it to your imagination. When he was told to stop, he repeated the words insistently. Later in the cells, he indignantly demanded to see a senior officer to complain about his detention. However, he soon piped down when it was pointed out to him that he had been arrested by the chief superintendent, accompanied by an inspector and witnessed by his MP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000483">The police city centre team, led by Inspector Dave Westwood, has transformed the landscape of Wakefield city centre. There has been a 25 per cent. reduction in violent incidents on Westgate in the last two years. I know that anecdotes do not make evidence, but that fact represents a real reduction in the levels of violent crime. Wakefield&#146;s Labour council also deserves praise for playing its part. It has introduced a traffic order banning cars from Westgate on weekend nights better to manage the flow of people and taxis and to stop people who have taken too much to drink falling under the wheels of cars. It has also brought in an alcohol exclusion zone to stop street drinking in the city centre during the daytime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000484">The Church, too, has played its part. A pilot street angels scheme involves volunteers patrolling the city centre to offer help to those who may be vulnerable or in danger because of drugs or drink. They provide a reassuring, sober presence on busy weekend nights and their interventions are estimated to have saved the lives of four people in the last month alone. I am delighted that that scheme will be formally launched next month. I would also like to highlight the work done by our local newspaper, the <i> Wakefield Express</i>. In December 2004, it launched a campaign called Streetsafe to improve the safety of the city centre, improve the city&#146;s image and reduce alcohol-related violence. Its campaign was nominated for a national press award and given a commendation from the divisional commander of West Yorkshire police.</p>

I know that he takes an interest in the police, because I bumped into him in the force training school in August last year. He and I were both spending time with West Yorkshire police force. I have heard anecdotal evidence from the police that things such as drinking banning orders are incredibly effective because they divide people from their drinking buddies and they know that they are banned from their own local clubs. I do not know what the rate of breach of ASBOs is in Wakefield. I know that the council has issued 155, but I do not know how many have been breached. It is obviously important to take into account the reasons for those breaches and their nature. We need to look much more creatively at how we use ASBOs and at making them more personalised to the individual. I will come to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000487">I pay tribute to everyone who works tirelessly against antisocial behaviour in Wakefield by standing up for decency, running sports and youth clubs and standing up for the silent majority. They are a credit to our city. But the success of their work in tackling antisocial behaviour is also a credit to the measures that the Government have brought in. I am not going to rehearse the police numbers. Suffice it to say that West Yorkshire police have seen 600 more police officers in the last 10 years and the successful introduction of police community support officers, which Opposition peers voted against in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000488">This is about the police engaging with communities. The introduction of neighbourhood policing has been a step change in the way in which we deal with antisocial behaviour. Last summer, as I said, I spent three days attached to Wakefield police. I went out on the beat with the safer neighbourhoods team in the Agbrigg, Belle Vue and Portobello areas to see how their new working methods are helping to restore respect by providing reassurance, and tackling antisocial behaviour and low-level crime. I visited the Portobello estate with neighbourhood beat officer Eddie Davis. We spotted a mini-motorcyclist. The officer did not give chase, because it could have been dangerous, and potentially fatal, for that young person. Eddie Davis did not need to give chase to that young person. To my amazement, he already knew the child&#146;s name and address. He had confiscated one mini-moto already from the boy and that child was about to lose his second mini-moto. Those new seizure powers were introduced by this Labour Government and they are helping the police to make life better on the Portobello estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07011841000490">I would like publicly to thank the officers from the neighbourhood policing team who have started to accompany me on joint roving surgeries, both in our city centre tower blocks and on the Eastmoor estate. It is clear that Sergeant David Monaghan-Jones, PCSO Helen Pickles and PCSO Victoria Mann have established warm and productive relationships with the local communities and tenants&#146; organisations, particularly in the city centre. I went out and about with them last November. One lady who answered her door said to me, &#147;It&#146;s just like the olden days. We know who our officers are. We know that they are around. We recognise the work that they are doing in the city centre.&#148; It was clear from listening to the interaction of the police with those tenants that they knew what the tenants could see&#151;and how they could help the police to tackle crime in the city centre&#151;from their tower block windows. They could see the drug dealers in the city centre car parks, where the dealers know that CCTV does not reach. There was a true spirit of co-operation. The men and women who serve as police officers or PCSOs in Wakefield do an incredibly tough and often harrowing job with professionalism, enthusiasm, dedication and good humour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07011841000491">The council also deserves praise for taking the problem of antisocial behaviour seriously. It uses the Government&#146;s neighbourhood renewal fund to put teams of neighbourhood action patrollers on to the streets. In Wakefield, we are fortunate that people have one telephone number that they can call to report antisocial behaviour. There are joint patrols and there is a police inspector permanently based with those neighbourhood patrollers to ensure that information is shared effectively. Antisocial behaviour, whether it is fly-tipping, drug dealing or noise nuisance, can be reported. That enables problems to be tackled from both a council and a police perspective so that powers can be combined and information shared more effectively.</p>

They are a vital tool to tackle antisocial behaviour. They help to protect young people, individuals and the community from the harms caused by antisocial behaviour and they are effective. The Government have not only brought in measures to tackle antisocial behaviour, we have done a huge amount of work in tackling the underlying causes. We know that poor housing can blight whole areas and create a bad reputation. The Government&#146;s commitment to make all council and social housing fit to live in and decent by 2010 is one of our least praised policies. However, it is transforming the lives of Wakefield&#146;s residents by giving them warm, safe and modern homes in which to live. Such physical regeneration, together with the growing role for tenants in shaping their own environments, is transforming communities. Last week, I was delighted that regulations were laid before Parliament that will give tenant management organisations powers to apply for ASBOs. That is another step towards making social transformation a reality throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07011841000493">I called my local neighbourhood police yesterday to ask their opinion of what more is needed to help them in their fight against this scourge. Inspector Karen Bailes was keen to impress on me the importance of parents taking responsibility for their children&#146;s actions. I have already mentioned the child who had one mini-motorbike confiscated, yet whose family seemed to think that it was acceptable to buy him another one and for him to continue to break the law. Many children&#146;s first brush with the police is through low-level antisocial behaviour&#151;a bit of graffiti here, some verbal abuse there; or perhaps throwing stones at a window. Neighbourhood police officers can identify problem children, but they are most successful when working with parents who take responsibility for their children&#146;s actions and help their children to learn that such behaviour is unacceptable.</p>

The community support officers in her constituency and mine whom I have had the pleasure to meet do a fantastic job. However, when I spent time out late at night with CSOs in my constituency, I noticed that some of the yobs and thugs whom the officers try to move on and disperse do not treat the officers with the respect that they should because they do not see them as real police officers. Many CSOs to whom I have spoken have encountered that problem. If they had more powers, such as the ability to use handcuffs, more respect for them might be fostered. Has the hon. Lady given any thought to whether CSOs should be given more tools so that the yobs and thugs will treat them with the respect they deserve?</p>

However, on my night out with the chief superintendent and the inspector, I noticed the general lack of regard in which they were held as police officers by people going past. They told me tales of people saying, &#147;I smell bacon,&#148; meaning, &#147;Here come the pigs.&#148; That general lack of respect for police officers, despite their high visibility, shocked me. The problem affects not only PCSOs. The police officers whom I know would back me up in saying that there is a lack of respect for police officers across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07011841000496">We need to keep the powers under review. PCSOs sometimes undergo further training to become police officers. They are an important conduit for training and recruitment. If PCSOs were given additional powers, it might create a disincentive for them to progress to become fully qualified police officers. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s idea is interesting, but I do not necessarily think that it would work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000497">Let me return to my point about parenting. Inspector Bailes told me that the problem arises when parents do not take responsibility, put their heads in the sand, swear that their child is innocent and blame other people&#146;s children or the police&#151;they blame everyone but themselves or their child. It is the children of such parents who cannot learn respect. They learn that they can escape the consequences of their actions and get away with it. Inspector Bailes told me that those children move on from nuisance behaviour to criminal behaviour. They go from spraying walls to attacking other children or older people. In many cases,  <br>

those children become adults who are lost to society for ever simply because their parents would not face up to their responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000498">Chaotic parenting can have a terrible impact on the lives of children and young people. The failure to set boundaries early teaches children that they can keep pushing, which can lead to antisocial behaviour. When I was out with the police, I met a woman in a hostel for victims of domestic violence. Although she did not really want to say what had happened to her, in the end she said, &#147;I love my son, but he beat me and I could not stay.&#148; That is where antisocial behaviour can lead: beating up one&#146;s own mother so badly that she has to leave her own home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000499">I was delighted when the Home Office announced that Wakefield council would receive &#163;50,000 to help to pay for staff dedicated to helping local parents. When the <i> Wakefield Express</i> announced that news, my office took several calls from distraught mothers who were desperate for help with their unruly teenagers. I am glad that Wakefield parents will get more of the help and support that they need, whether they are dealing with toddler tantrums or teenage tearaways. However, I urge Ministers to continue to look for ways to improve parenting and to support difficult families. The Children Act 2004 states that all agencies should work together to support a child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000500">The Youth Justice Board published a report in November on the use of ASBOs among under-18s. Although I take on board the Minister&#146;s point that only 40 per cent. of ASBOs go to children aged between 10 and 17, those people make up only 13 per cent. of the population, so we can argue that ASBOs are disproportionately focused on that age group. However, I reject the badge of honour theory that has been widely reported in the media and repeated in the Chamber today. Any schoolteacher or parent of a teenager knows that what children or young people say, and what they actually feel, can be two totally different things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000501">If a young person is answering a question, or talking in a braggartly way to their family, they will say those things to make themselves feel hard, and to make themselves feel better about what is essentially a shameful experience. Children feel such things deeply. In addition, the review focused on only 10 of the 156 youth offending teams in England and Wales, and that cannot be described as a representative or statistically broad sample.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07011841000502">I wish to offer Ministers some constructive criticism as they review their policy on antisocial behaviour orders. First, we need to make sure that it is not impossible for young people to comply with the conditions that magistrates impose on them, and that young people can remember what is expected of them. There are two prisons in my constituency: New Hall prison, for young offenders and women, and Wakefield prison, which is a serious, high-security prison. In my conversations with prison staff, they have told me that six or 12 months is an eternity to a young person. Those periods need to be broken down into much smaller, more manageable slots, so that they are not set up to fail by magistrates. Instead of talking about six months, we should say, &#147;The conditions will apply for  <br>

six months, but there&#146;ll be monthly reviews.&#148; Perhaps we could incentivise&#151;encourage, rather, as I know that we are not allowed to use the word incentivise&#151;young people to work towards complying for smaller, more bite-sized chunks of time, so that they feel that they can achieve what they are asked to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70118-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07011841000503">We need to include positive, alternative activities to enable the rehabilitation, reconciliation and reintegration of young people. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills talks about the personalisation of learning, and my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) talked about individual support orders, but we could consider the personalisation of ASBOs, too, so that as well as there being a negative and punitive side, we could consider forcing young people to engage in a tailor-made programme of positive behaviour that would promote their welfare and curb their bad behaviour. I pay tribute to the many organisations, such as the YMCA and Rathbone Training, where I served as a trustee for seven years, who take on the challenges of reintegrating the most difficult, disadvantaged and disaffected young people.</p>

We listen to communities, and we are serious about empowering them to resist antisocial behaviour. People in Wakefield know what respect is and they know how to behave well. They understand what common standards of decency are, and they uphold them, but a small minority will not obey the rules, and they undermine the lives of the decent, law-abiding majority in Wakefield. I am proud that the Government are in solidarity with that law-abiding majority, and that the police, whom I have met and shadowed, have the tools and resources to do their job of making sure that young people get the help that they need to change their lives. I am proud that the Government are in tune with the decent majority.</p>

spokesman, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert): sometimes, when people describe antisocial behaviour, they are really talking about crime, pure and simple. They are talking about criminal acts. However, the term includes vandalism, graffiti, late-night noise and behaviour that is inconsiderate but that may not be regarded as criminal.

We must make sure that people do not feel so insecure in their own home or so unsafe in their neighbourhood that they dare not venture beyond their front door after dark.

When I was old enough to take an interest in such matters, I tried to make a cool, dispassionate assessment of which political party offered the best prospects for our country.

Crime did not rise by 5 or 10 per cent., or even by monstrous figures such as 15 or 20 per cent., but by 100 per cent. We have paid for that under successive Governments, including the last Tory Government, as billions of pounds in tax have been spent on Home Office legislation and policing. We therefore had the right to expect crime to fall under the previous Government, but instead it went up by 100 per cent., so the lives of millions of our fellow citizens were blighted as a result of the Conservatives&#146; period in government and the way in which they exercised power for 18 years. Any rational person would object to the Conservative record so, instead, I shall consider the Labour party&#146;s record on crime and its critique of Liberal Democrat policy.</p>

of different parties introduced six criminal justice Acts. Roughly speaking, there was a criminal justice Act once a decade. Under this Government, the introduction of criminal justice Acts has become more frequent than an annual event. Such is the frenzy of legislation that the Government often plan the next criminal justice Act before they have implemented the previous one. So many Home Office Bills making legal changes have been proposed this Session that I cannot remember them all, and I have to refer to my notes. They include the Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill, the Legal Services Bill, a criminal justice Bill, an asylum and immigration Bill, the Offender Management Bill, a counter-terrorism Bill, the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill and, just this week, the Serious Crime Bill.</p>

For the first few years after Labour came to power, that was quite seductive, because Ministers were busy with new initiatives and legislation. They seemed to care about the problems and wanted to crack down on them. Then, after a period, people started to think, &#147;Wait a second. We keep reading in the newspapers about all the crackdowns and the other tough measures that are being taken, but where I live&#151;on my estate, or even in my village or small town&#151;they do not seem to be having any effect.

We asked legitimate questions, as any Opposition party would, about whether the Government had thought through every detail of ASBOs. The other example that Labour Members, in particular, cite is the Anti-social Behaviour Bill in 2003, which my party voted against. As we made clear throughout, there were measures in that Bill that we supported&#151;for example, the powers to close down crack houses&#151;but it is fair to say that there were aspects, particularly to do with dispersal orders, about which we had reservations. In a free society, it is right for opposition parties to have reservations about the power of the state to restrict people&#146;s freedom of association. That is what we argued in the House.</p>

Liberal Democrat councils have been notably at the forefront in offering many constructive alternative measures. For example, when Islington council was under Liberal Democrat control, its leadership pioneered acceptable behaviour contracts whereby the police, the local authority and, importantly, the individual and their family came to a conclusion about what would be an acceptable way for them to conduct themselves. Many people regard those as highly successful, and they have been taken up by many other local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70118-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000537">There is an interesting National Audit Office report that compared different types of intervention. It started with the warning letter, saying that the cost of issuing such a letter was &#163;63 and that the success rate was 63 per cent. Then it moved on to acceptable behaviour contracts&#151;as pioneered by typically innovative and imaginative Liberal Democrats in local government. They cost &#163;230 but are marginally more successful than the warning letter, with a success rate of 65 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70118-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07011841000538">Now we get to antisocial behaviour orders&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Let me finish my National Audit Office point. The Government and some of their friends on the Conservative Benches are hanging their hat on ASBOs. The cost is not &#163;230, like that of acceptable behaviour contracts, but &#163;3,100&#151;more than a dozen times greater. Anyone who is concerned about efficient public spending will follow my argument. One would believe that, for all that extra money and the claims that Labour Back Benchers make, the success rate would be 90 or 95 per cent. However, instead of being even 65 per cent. successful, like the acceptable behaviour contracts, the success rate is 45 per cent. That is telling.</p>

The latter have an important part to play, and one would be happy if one were among the 45 per cent. whose problem was resolved through them. I am happy for those people and I believe that ASBOs can make a contribution. However, when the Minister, Labour Back Benchers and some of their keener supporters on the Conservative Back Benches claim that the ASBO is the defining issue, and none of the cheaper, more constructive and more successful measures have a part to play, they do their constituents a disservice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07011841000551">The point that I was trying to develop before that series of interventions is that antisocial behaviour orders have a role to play. They are one of the clubs available to the golfer, to use a golfing analogy, but they are not the sole solution to the problem. The problems are much greater, as other hon. Members have said, and tackling them when an offence has already been committed and the people who have had their lives blighted have already suffered is too late in the process to be ideal. That is not to say that they do not need to be tackled at that stage, but we need to try to intervene much earlier in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000552">I remember taking part in a church debate in my constituency during the general election campaign, in which a couple of hundred people took part. The question of police numbers came up, and of which candidates supported additional community policing. Unsurprisingly, all the candidates claimed that they supported additional community policing, but I was in the enviable position of being able to make that claim more plausibly because my party was committed to abolishing identity cards and using the money to resource extra community policing over and above what the Labour party was able to offer. None the less, we all talked in those terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000553">I then asked the audience of 200 churchgoers, &#147;What is it that will prevent you from vandalising car wing mirrors as you walk back to your homes this evening? Is it the prospect of being caught by the police?&#148; The chances of being caught red-handed by the police and being convicted for that offence are extremely small. Even if police numbers were doubled, or quintupled, it would still be extremely unlikely that anyone would be caught. So why did those 200 people not choose&#151;I assume that they did not&#151;to vandalise any car wing mirrors? It was because they knew that it would be wrong. They knew that it would be an inconsiderate way to behave towards other people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000554">We need to imbue in people a sense of neighbourliness, community spirit, fraternity and awareness of other people&#146;s suffering. There are a number of ways in which we can do that. There is no magic solution, however. If it were that easy, the problem would already have been solved and we would be discussing something else this afternoon. Schools have a role to play, with the leadership and discipline that they provide, and the example that they set. Parents also have a crucial role to play in setting an example as they bring up their children. National role models, such as those whom children and young people see on television, also have an important role to play, although some have not been as impressive as they should be recently. Role models in people&#146;s homes and communities are also important.</p>

Member for Wakefield who, to be fair, spoke before the hon. Gentleman came into the Chamber and started to take an interest in the debate.

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07011841000559">I was talking about the crucial role that intervention at an early stage plays in schools, in parenting and in relation to role models. It is crucial that people exercise responsibility in their community and do not take a passive approach. I have met many local action teams and neighbourhood watch schemes, some of which are more successful than others. What unites them, however, is a willingness to stand up and say that the problem is not for the police to sort out for them, but for them to address. They recognise that they need to care about what their community is like and what children are doing in it. In my constituency, I have attended fetes, jumble sales and other events held by local action teams to raise funds to support local youth projects and such like. Those have been extremely effective in letting people know who is trying to solve problems in the community in conjunction with the police.</p>

People are seeing in their neighbourhoods a regular, identified police officer. They know that person and what they are doing, and they know that he or she knows the schools in the area, speaks to the head teachers and pupils, knows the local vicars and shopkeepers and is closely involved in day-to-day activities. The local action team and neighbourhood watch have close contact with that police officer. In some cases, they have that police officer&#146;s mobile phone number, which they can ring if they have a particular concern or problem to bring to  <br>

his or her attention. The police officer might have a small neighbourhood budget, which can be used to supplement the local action team&#146;s activities, perhaps by funding community or youth projects. That is an extremely successful model. Not only do such police officers get to know the opinion formers and pillars of such communities, but often, to put it bluntly, some of the persistent troublemakers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07011841000561">I am also extremely supportive of police community support officers. So many people say that they want visible policing. They want people working in conjunction with their community police officer, and they want people whom they know and empathise with, and who understand the area and get down to the nitty-gritty of problems. Most of the time, people do not want armed response units, although, on rare occasions, those may be the necessary and appropriate response. Most of the time, people are worried about low-level issues such as late-night noise, graffiti, vandalism and even litter. What they want is someone who they feel has a finger on the pulse and understands their concerns. Police community support officers can hold surgeries. People can go and see them, and can feel that they have a direct link with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000562">For all those reasons, I greatly regret the Government&#146;s decision to renege on their manifesto commitment and reduce the number of community support officers. In Avon and Somerset, the police authority area in which my constituency falls, the chief constable and chief superintendents carried out a large amount of consultation with community groups, local action teams, neighbourhood watches and others. They said &#147;You will have all these extra PCSOs. We want to use them effectively, and we want them to be part of the community. We will start recruiting soon, and we want to hear your thoughts.&#148; We were told that we would be given 541 PCSOs, which would be our share of the overall 24,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000563">After all that consultation, the police in my area and across the country have been left looking stupid. They have had to go back to those community groups and say &#147;We are awfully sorry; we told you that you would have an extra five PCSOs in your neighbourhood, but we have had to scale it down to three. And we are afraid that all the ideas for which we asked you have gone out of the window. We will have to go back to the drawing board.&#148; Avon and Somerset&#146;s allocation of new PCSOs has been cut from 541 to 346, a reduction of 195, which has had an extremely significant and detrimental impact on police plans for my area.</p>

I think it is fair to say that there has subsequently been a departure from that model and a greater concentration on larger-scale &#147;macro&#148; policing at the expense of community policing, which is a source of great regret.

The only reason why I intervened on the last occasion was that, true to form, Liberal Democrats make claims that do not necessarily have much in common with what actually happened. To claim to support PCSOs when they condemned them when the Government announced that they would be introduced seems rather difficult to do&#151;and amazing even for a Liberal Democrat.</p>

Hampshire constabulary made announcements on PCSOs and carried on hiring them at a time when the Home Office had decided to cut them back by a third&#151;from a total of 536, I believe. That happened even after community groups had been consulted&#151;as I understand was also the case in Avon and Somerset&#151;and after the PCSOs had been hired and had started patrolling the areas to which they had been allocated. They were making an extremely useful contribution to tackling antisocial behaviour in my constituency&#151;for example, in Eastleigh town.</p>

We are supportive of ASBOs where they are necessary and where they are likely to be effective, but we do not regard them as the absolute litmus test and the only effective measures in this area. Plenty of other measures have been pioneered by Liberal Democrat councils and others and have a vital role to play, such as acceptable behaviour contracts. We are in favour of community policing, of stimulating and supporting local community groups, and of trying to tackle the root causes of the problems that blight our communities.</p>

tired of what the Prime Minister called eye-catching initiatives, which are designed to get headlines in tomorrow&#146;s newspapers and to get Labour Ministers on to television but which have little or no effect in their communities.

Of course, we heard first from my hon. Friend the Minister, and I should apologise to him&#151;and to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;for arriving a tad late for that contribution as I was coming from a Standing Committee sitting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07011841000581">We then heard from the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert). I could say many things about his speech, but let me pick up on one point that he made in particular. I see that he is leaving the Chamber; he must be very afraid about what I am about to say about his contribution. He suggested that Labour Members do not think that antisocial behaviour is something to be treated seriously; he suggested that we think of it as a soft alternative to tackling crime. The reality is that Labour&#151;as the Government&#146;s actions have demonstrated&#151;sees both of them as part of the solution. We need to tackle crime and the causes of crime, and to tackle antisocial behaviour. In fact, it was the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)&#151;the lead Conservative Front-Bench spokesman on this subject&#151;who described antisocial behaviour orders as gimmicks. We have got to remember where those who are prepared to tackle antisocial behaviour really are to be found in this House; actions speak louder than words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07011841000582">I was very impressed by the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), and particularly by the inspiring stories that she told of people working from the bottom up on these issues. As we all recognise, it is the people whom we are here to represent, and it is the tools that the Government have put into their hands that are helping them to tackle such problems in their neighbourhoods. My hon. Friend gave some great examples in that regard.</p>

Forgive me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for raising the issue of crime&#151;even though this is a debate about antisocial behaviour&#151;as other Members have done. I want to draw Members&#146; attention to yesterday&#146;s <i> Evening Standard</i>, which highlighted London&#146;s crime figures. Between 2005 and 2006, there was a drop in every single area of crime except robbery. Homicide and violent crime are down, racist crime is down by 12 per cent., and homophobic crime is down by nearly 9 per cent. Gun-enabled and Operation Trident gun crime are both down by more than 14 per cent. The evidence shows what is really going on; the scaremongering is irresponsible.</p>

I pay testament to my own police force in Hackney, who have made great progress; I shall touch on that issue shortly. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07011841000585">I have risen to speak on this issue because of its extreme importance to my constituents. We know that problems still exist, and I want to highlight some of the complex issues associated with antisocial behaviour. We have heard too much debate just about antisocial behaviour orders&#151;I want to talk about some of the other issues, as well. I want to stress that in discussions about rights and individuals, we must not forget the rights of the community: the rights of the majority of decent folk, who just want to have a quiet life at home without having to deal with antisocial behaviour and crime. As I have mentioned, tackling crime is key, and it is only fair to highlight the progress made in my own borough. Between April and November last year, house-breaking declined by 39 per cent., to the lowest level since 1998. Muggings are down by 7 per cent., gun crime is down by 34 per cent. Overall, crime is down in the borough of Hackney by 15 per cent. Between April and November last year, 2,700 fewer crimes were committed. We must recognise the important work that has been done in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000586">The Government&#146;s aim has been to put antisocial behaviour on the national agenda. Until the Labour Government were elected in 1997, antisocial behaviour was something that people had to put up with. It was not mentioned, and people lived with it daily on their estates and streets; they had no tools to deal with it. I was a councillor during the 1990s, and I remember sitting in many a meeting with residents, and trying to bring together the different agencies, council officers, the police and other enforcement officers to tackle many of the day-to-day irritants of antisocial behaviour. We had some success, but&#151;by gum!&#151;it was a long and tortuous process. We could have done with some of these tools then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70118-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000587">In 1997, a Government were elected who were committed to providing those tools. They have also introduced the excellent neighbourhood policing model, and I pay testament to the Mayor of London, who has progressed that model faster than in other parts of the country. We have seen a real difference. In Hackney, by and large, people know who their neighbourhood policing teams are. I regularly refer problems to those teams, and I usually find that they already know about them and are tackling them. We are therefore beginning to nip such problems in the bud.</p>

I disagree with Opposition Members who suggest that there is a Whitehall-led policy on this issue. The Home Office and other Government Departments clearly have a very important role to play in setting the parameters, and it is also clear that we need laws and tools. However, the solutions are best determined locally. Progress is being made in the form of the forthcoming London Local Authorities Bill,  <br>

I particularly welcome &#147;Youth Matters&#148;, the youth opportunity card and the youth opportunities fund. All of us in Hackney will agree that we need to do more to ensure that young people have alternatives. I am not suggesting that all antisocial behaviour and crime is linked to young people, but there is an issue here, which I shall touch on a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000590">Hackney council has recently been using more antisocial behaviour contracts, of ABCs, as they are frequently called. One of the issues that I wish to raise with Ministers is the cost of processing ASBOs. It costs thousands of pounds in court costs to process an ASBO. Hackney is trying to get partners to work together on that issue so that we can get money from different sources&#151;landlords and other agencies&#151;to fund it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000591">Another issue in London that affects evaluating the efficiency of ASBOs is the problem of people crossing borough boundaries. Data are collected on a borough basis for the police and the councils, but London is one city and people move around. I know that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has announced a review of data collection in the Home Office and mentioned some of the problems with the quality of data collected. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will pass on to my right hon. Friend and his team the need to consider this issue in particular if we are to have a proper evaluation of the success of ASBOs and be able to tackle the problems that Hackney council tells me it faces on a daily basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07011841000592">Another issue that I wish to raise relates to the role of landlords. I know that my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government recently announced an initiative to encourage registered social landlords and housing associations to play a more active role, but in Hackney&#151;thanks to historic funding mechanisms&#151;we have several estates with multiple landlords, sometimes six or even more, managing different parts of the estate, sometimes even different bits of the same block. That often leads to a buck-passing mentality and a lack of co-ordination. Nothing is ever anyone&#146;s responsibility, because it can always be blamed on someone else. For example, in the Lee Conservancy road area in Hackney Wick, it is difficult to get to the root of problems such as dumping of rubbish and car parking problems&#151;we have not quite reached the state of parking rage, but there are many difficulties&#151;and more serious matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07011841000594">The National Housing Confederation recently launched its campaign &#147;iN business for neighbourhoods&#148;, which was its way of saying that landlords had a bigger role than simply dealing with housing. We need to see landlords walk the walk as proof that they take the issue seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000595">I have already mentioned some of the issues of CCTV and other parties, so I shall not repeat those points. However, the Liberal Democrats, represented eloquently today by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), are fond of talking about Big Brother. I prefer to talk about Big Sister, which involves support for the community and family, and keeping a watchful eye out for them. That is not a problem for me or for the people in my constituency. In fact, they would probably like to see more of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000596">My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield rightly touched on some of the issues involving parenting in her detailed speech. We need to do more to tackle poor behaviour by young people. That is a challenge for those of us who are parents, whatever the age of our children. I pay tribute to our schools in Hackney, which I have often described in the Chamber before as &#147;schools plus&#148;. They deal with a range of children, some from challenging backgrounds, who do not have stable family homes and whose parents do not&#151;frankly speaking&#151;take the responsibility that they should. I want to stress that the vast majority do, although some do not. Hackney schools have been very good at delivering parenting support. The Government as a whole could learn from the experience in Hackney.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000597">For example, Karen Glenister has been the head teacher at Burbage school in Hoxton for just over a year. Being keen to improve behaviour, she began to challenge pupils. One boy regularly misbehaved, and she made a series of telephone calls to his father to complain that the boy&#146;s behaviour was not acceptable. At first, the father railed against her, and said that she was not describing the child he knew. He did not believe what he was being told, and refused to take responsibility for his son&#146;s behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000598">Gradually, through grit and determination, she won the father around and persuaded him to go on a parenting course held in the school. At the end of the year, she wanted to reward everyone&#151;pupils and others&#151;connected with the school who had achieved something in the year. She asked the parents who had attended the course to go to the school for a certificate presentation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000599">To her surprise, the father I am speaking about turned up booted and suited, and asked if he could make a little speech. In his emotional address, he talked with gratitude about the important impact that the lessons had had on him. He said that they had given him a different and better perception of his role as a father, and enabled him to have a better relationship with his son. That is the sort of day-to-day success that is being achieved in Hackney, and we need more of it.</p>

trust. Its aim is to give parenting skills and support to people even before they have children. That is in addition to the Sure Start investment in Hackney, which has given the borough 14 children&#146;s centres.</p>

I went with my hon. Friends the Minister for Pensions Reform and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. We visited the newly refurbished and extended school building and saw the one-stop shop through which the fantastic new centre provides very welcome support for parents and the under-fives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07011841000602">I have some personal experience of these matters. I am a parent of children under five years old and have benefited from the sort of support that I am describing, which has helped me with all the little niggles associated with the difficult job of bringing up children. As I have said before, Sure Start should not be confined to the under-fives. It is also needed for children in primary and secondary schools, and for teenagers. To some extent, the respect agenda addresses that problem, but we need an even more joined-up approach across Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07011841000603">I also want to congratulate Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin, a visionary vicar in the Queensbridge area of Hackney. She is not afraid to challenge parents to take their role responsibly and seriously. She speaks out where others fear to, and tells parents that they need to take responsibility and question their children about their activities, especially when they are in possession of new goods. Where do they get the money from? She is not afraid to encourage parents to ask such questions, and we need more people in leadership positions to do that.</p>

The Hackney safer schools partnership is led by a police sergeant and a senior officer of Hackney&#146;s learning trust, which is the borough&#146;s education authority. The partnership is supported by an education worker based in the youth offending team, and is an example of good, joined-up local government. Recently, the partnership has linked with the safer neighbourhoods teams at ward level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07011841000605">The partnership provides educational programmes, and supports schools in responding to risk and identifying points of intervention. It also makes referrals to the local youth inclusion programmes. It plays an important role in Hackney by contributing to the development of routes out of gang involvement by which children are helped to relocate and find employment or training. The partnership has also introduced acceptable behaviour contracts in schools.</p>

However, just after the 2005 general election, there was a problem of serious drug dealing on the estate. The  <br>

police mounted a major campaign, working with local landlords and the council, to tackle the problem. The issue was not only criminal&#151;this may be where we disagree to some extent with the Opposition Front-Bench speakers: people associated with the drug dealing were congregating and there were no-go areas. They were not necessarily committing crimes, but by congregating they made residents worried and alarmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000608">The police operation was a great success. The police took their time; they did not rush things and residents patiently lived with the problems as the police moved in. The operation was successful not only because the police took action to imprison most of the 20 main ringleaders, but also because they brought in a dispersal order on the estate. It was so effective that no one realised it had been lifted. When I visited the estate with a Home Office Minister, people were not aware that the order had been lifted a month previously because the problems had gone. Obviously, when we live in a city we know that things will not always be perfect, but by and large the improvements have been massive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000609">The point about Holly street that I particularly want to highlight to Ministers is the impact of low-level nuisance. Crime is identifiable and the police can make arrests. We have ways of tackling crime, although we can argue about their effectiveness, but small things that often go unreported have a significant effect on people&#146;s lives and force them to change their behaviour. There was someone who used to lurk every morning at a bus stop on Kingsland road in the Holly street estate, sometimes dealing drugs, but not always committing a crime, which meant that most residents walked to another bus stop so that they could get to work. The local newsagent opened later in the morning because he did not want to deal with people who were drugged up or drunk, which meant that commuters could not buy their newspaper. Parents were accompanying their children to and from the bus stop. Those little irritants, which are actually quite big in the day-to-day life of residents, do not register as reported crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000610">I urge the Metropolitan Police Service and the Home Office not necessarily to measure such things&#151;we are always so keen to do that&#151;but to acknowledge that although those annoyances are difficult to define, it is crucial to deal with them if we want peaceful, decent lives. I illustrate the benefit of dispersal orders with a quote from Vincent Stops. He is a councillor for Hackney central, which covers my constituency and straddles that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott). The dispersal order had a great effect on the Pembury estate and he said:</p>

Happily, the vast majority of estates in Hackney are no longer run-down, thanks to the decent homes programme that my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield rightly highlighted as a significant measure.</p>

Tenants have complete control of a small budget provided by Hackney Homes&#151;formerly Hackney council&#151;and can use it to improve physical facilities on their estate. That is residents&#146; control, putting power in the hands of the people who know what they want.</p>

I do not believe that we can talk about tackling antisocial behaviour&#151;certainly in Hackney&#151;without talking about drugs. Drugs are still a scourge on our streets. The police have a role in enforcement and arrest, but activity around drugs&#151;taking in everything from gangs and low-level crime to drugged-up individuals&#151;is the cause of many problems. We need to recognise that these daily irritants that change people&#146;s behaviour can be a problem. On the Holly Street estate, the victims were almost always effectively the wider community, so we need really joined-up government to deal with the problem.</p>

This stronger form of the drug is, according to anecdotal evidence from the police&#151;we are still trying to work out ways of measuring it&#151;more widely available and causing great problems. I am working with Anglican deans, councillors and residents in the local area to highlight the problem. We can talk endlessly about the classification and reclassification of cannabis and about big drug policy, but we need to recognise that drug policy is often behind what is actually happening on the streets. That is what people are living with now.</p>

went out one night, not particularly late, and said to the &#147;children&#148; sitting on the stairwell, &#147;Will you please be quiet as I have to get up for work tomorrow?&#148; For that &#147;crime&#148;, he was stabbed and killed. He left a widow and two children to live with the consequences. That is one of the reasons why, in Hackney, we take the issue of drugs very seriously&#151;it is not something to laugh about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para31"><a name="07011841000621">In fairness to other Members, I will not go in great detail into other antisocial behaviour issues, but I need to touch on them. Hackney has seen a ban on street drinking in some areas, which has had a great effect and reclaimed the streets for ordinary decent folk. The power given under the Licensing Act 2003 to local authorities&#151;rather than distant magistrates living a long way from the area&#151;to take decisions about what happens in their areas is another important issue. I pay tribute to Councillor Christine Boyd, who led very effectively on licensing issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para32"><a name="07011841000622">We have seen a creative partnership with a local hospital develop in Hoxton. An ambulance is now stationed in Hoxton&#151;an area with a large number of bars and effectively the saturation zone in Hackney. It picks up people who are very drunk, dealing with them there, rather than clogging up accident and emergency. There are many problems connected with alcohol abuse, but we do not have enough time to go into them all today. Alcohol certainly causes many problems in Hackney, but at least the partnership I just mentioned goes some way to tackling some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para33"><a name="07011841000623">I welcome the Gambling Act 2005, which comes into force some time later this year. It will allow local authorities to have a say about betting shops in their area. Much to residents&#146; and the council&#146;s dismay, an application for a third betting shop in Chatsworth road in the Homerton area of Hackney was recently made. The problem cannot be dealt with under current law, but thanks to the Government&#146;s introduction of a change in the law under the Gambling Act 2005, local authorities will be able to tackle it. They can make a judgment, as they know what works best for their area. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para34"><a name="07011841000624">Noisy neighbours are still a problem and even though Hackney has an effective noise patrol more work needs to be done. I raised the matter with my Front-Bench colleagues with particular respect to ASBOs. Perhaps we could use them more effectively around noise nuisance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70118-0014.htm_para35"><a name="07011841000625">Another issue is that although the Home Office often talks tough, we should look more to mediation. In a dense, inner-city area such as mine, talking to people can sometimes be one of the solutions. We were elected as Members of Parliament because people voted for us and we need to put that community first. We need to be on the side of those suffering from antisocial behaviour. The Labour Government have a good track record. I have highlighted some of the issues that I would like to see changed and improved, but we can be proud of what we have begun. I hope that it is just the beginning and that we have more to see.</p>

bears the scars of some of that. He can also probably testify to the fact that they are sometimes more partisan than most. On this occasion, however, I want to try to avoid both of those characteristics. In fact, I regret joining in the jollity earlier, because it might undermine the approach that I want to take. I can only plead that I was provoked beyond endurance and apologise to the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07011841000627">I want to say a few words about the issues that lie beneath and beyond the obvious manifestations of antisocial behaviour. I want to focus on the causes of antisocial behaviour rather than the symptoms, because it is the symptoms that are regularly discussed in the House. I am conscious that I am not an expert and that my constituency probably suffers less than many from antisocial behaviour. However, my mailbag, like everybody else&#146;s, bears testimony to the fact that large numbers of my constituents are concerned and some of them are genuinely fearful. They need speaking up for just as much as others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000628">Antisocial behaviour is routinely defined as a specific range of unpleasant activities. The Government statistics, if I understand them correctly, use just six categories: vandalism and graffiti, litter, teenagers hanging about, drugs, alcohol and rowdy behaviour, and noisy neighbours. Yes, those things are antisocial, but they are just the obvious and more extreme examples of something that goes much wider. They are examples, but only a few examples, of what the legislation on ASBOs says can cause &#147;alarm, harassment and distress&#148; to individuals. It is unhelpful to limit our thinking to a short list&#151;anybody&#146;s short list, not just the Government&#146;s&#151;or a narrow definition. It does us well on these occasions to reflect on the fact that none of us is perfect. All of us, whoever we may be, do things that, to quote the legislation, cause &#147;alarm, harassment and distress&#148; to other people. It is not just yobs and layabouts who are antisocial. It might be worth thinking quietly for a moment about whether those yobs, vandals and layabouts learn their behaviour from us all, rather than inventing it on their own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000629">To date, much of our response to the behaviour that we do not like is to seek treatment for the symptoms. There have been quite a lot of attempts to treat those symptoms. Like Gilbert and Sullivan, I made it my job to produce a little list. I have discovered: ASBOs, dispersal orders, local partnerships, fixed penalty notices, support and sanctions packages for parents, banning the selling of spray paints to under-16s, powers to close noisy pubs, conditional cautions, community payback, on-the-spot fines, the national parenting academy, the Minister for respect, the national respect squad, intervention orders for drug addicts, and respect zones. I imagine that I have missed some things out. Somebody is welcome to add to the list. This afternoon, I mean no criticism. I do not want to go into whether those measures are good or bad. I simply want to ask: how well has that, or any, list worked? It does not appear to have prevented a rapid growth in antisocial behaviour a little while ago. The best that it might have done is to stop that increase in its tracks.</p>

Such measures are worth implementing. However, I hope that he will forgive me for not going too far down that road, apart from by agreeing with him, because although we have tried a lot of measures and we can try more&#151;they can have some success&#151;I get the message that that approach is not curing the underlying problem. The message for a Government of any party is that while simply trying that approach might help, it will not bring about a cure, because that lies somewhere other than such lists of measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000632">The way towards the cure lies with serious thinking, rather than hyperactivity. We need long-term thinking. Although we can learn lessons from looking back at what we have tried, which has not been perfect, we must also look forward towards tackling the problem in a different way. Antisocial behaviour is not a short-term problem that can be dealt with by a short-term fix. Our thinking must be wide-ranging. Antisocial behaviour is not just the troublesome activities on that short list that are carried out by a few. Although being self-centred and disregarding others do not appear on anyone&#146;s list, they are just as antisocial as anything on a list that any Government have come up with. Our thinking needs to switch so that it focuses on the causes just as much as, if not more than, on the symptoms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07011841000633">Antisocial behaviour does not just happen, but develops over time. Paradoxically, society itself has helped to create the antisocial behaviour that we are trying to tackle. The behaviour of all individuals, including everyone in the Chamber, owes a huge amount to the values, standards, attitudes and priorities of the society in which they were born and grew up.</p>

behaviour. The problems seem to have been partly caused, albeit not wholly, by well-intentioned activities. Let me give the House two examples. I have deliberately picked controversial examples to find out whether they will persuade people to do a bit of the thinking on which I am keen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000638">Let us consider society&#146;s championing of human rights. Of course it is proper to protect individual freedom&#151;that is what we are here for. We must protect minorities against any abuse by the majority. I do not dispute any of that; it is right and proper, and we all sign up to it. However, if we take that too far, might it not end up with me believing, when I listen to all that, that I am entitled to do whatever I like and to behave however I like? We need to consider the fact that there is a downside to even the best of intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000639">I accept that my second example is controversial. We all accept that we must work to provide decent housing for all. Of course, homelessness and poor housing play a big part in creating the symptoms that we are concerned about, but ought we not to consider, even for a moment, whether even the nicest separate home can lead to problems of isolation for the single-parent family who are in that ever-so-nice house all on their own? The problem is the lack of role models, and the time that the children spend unsupervised, in that house. Might there not be a downside to all the things that we think are good? One could go through the whole list of good intentions, saying, &#147;Let&#146;s think for a moment. The outcome is not always 100 per cent. good.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="07011841000640"><a name="70118-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="07011841001218"><b>Mr. Hoyle:</b> The hon. Gentleman has developed an interesting point, but although he mentions exceptional housing, I cannot think of any place that provides quality housing for single-parent families&#151;far from it. I think that the problem is due to poor housing, in which people are pushed together, and the fact that such people have no other opportunities. I am pleased if he can say that quality housing is provided in his area, but I do not know of anywhere else where that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="07011841000641"><a name="70118-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="07011841001219"><b>Mr. Wilshire:</b> I said that I would be controversial. I am not arguing for any particular type of housing; I simply observe that although we all aspire to the situation that the hon. Gentleman would like, we need to reflect a little as we go. We should say to ourselves, &#147;There could be downsides to the good towards which we are working.&#148; That is my only point; I am not seeking to criticise anybody or anything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000642">My thesis is that we should not focus so much on the symptoms, but try to understand the causes in a broader and deeper way, and then consider how we can cure the problem. I owe it to the House to try to explain what I think needs to be done if we are to get to the causes, and then the cure, of antisocial behaviour. As I have hinted, I have come to the uncomfortable conclusion that it might just be society itself that has brought about the problem. Even if I am only half right in that conclusion, the solution can come only from society&#151;from local communities, and the individuals and organisations within them. The other side of the conclusion is that the solution will not come from a Government of any party. The solution will only come from within communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000643">Many aspects of society cause me concern, but the list is long and the hour is late, so I shall not burden the House with a long list. I shall mention just four aspects. They are all issues that relate to the example that we in society set for other people. The first aspect is that I sense a serious breakdown in social structures in society. I do not intend any criticism of anybody involved in that breakdown; I just observe that it has happened and is happening. I shall use the same example that I used earlier&#151;the growth in one-adult households&#151;but I do not criticise people for that growth. I do not want to go down that route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000644">In one-adult households, there are children who have very little contact, or less contact than others, with adults, particularly older adults. Should we then be surprised when people growing up in that sort of environment have less respect for a group of people that they have never lived with, or grown up among? We should be concerned about that, and about the large amount of unsupervised time. Of course the one parent has to work and provide for those children. I do not mean any criticism, but having tried to bring up children myself, I am persuaded that unsupervised time for the young is near the heart of trouble. If anyone wants to invite trouble, let a young child loose on its own for any length of time, and I can guarantee, from bitter experience, that they will find trouble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000645">Poverty is pointed to, but we should be concerned about poverty of experience, as well financial poverty. However, the problem is not just the financial situation of the one-adult household, but the lesser range of experience that can all too easily be found there. Again, I must underline the fact that I am not seeking to criticise anyone, but I shall do so in my second example. Role models have been touched on, and modern technology has made it easier for the super-successful to influence more and more people, not only in our own society but in the world at large. Am I wrong to worry about loutish behaviour on the football pitch by role models, because when I read the paper or talk to other parents I learn that such behaviour is copied on school playing fields? Role models are important, but I worry about the hedonistic lifestyle enjoyed by film stars and pop groups. Young people look up to them and idolise them so, inevitably, they will be copied. People have tried to argue that there is not any evidence that violence in the cinema and on television creates violence elsewhere, but I am not persuaded. If television does not influence people, why on earth do advertisers spend so much money trying to do so? The position of role models is crucial, and I am worried about the image that they project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07011841000646">Thirdly, we must look at the individual attitudes and behaviour if we are to get the bottom of antisocial behaviour. Are other hon. Members as worried as I am about the contribution of irresponsibility to the spread of antisocial behaviour? In my constituency work, more and more people tell me that someone else is to blame or is responsible for their predicament. They say that they have a problem, but it is the duty of the state, local government or someone else, to solve it. If that is the attitude that we pass on to the young, should be surprised by their antisocial behaviour?</p>

I am conscious of the fact that any politician who attempts to talk about values and standards is on dangerous territory. Those of us who were Members of Parliament in the days of the back to basics campaign do not need to be reminded of the trap that awaits us if we are not careful, but values and standards are important. Ultimately, they are a matter of faith and belief, and I do not have any intention of approaching those subjects. However, successful and stable societies are all based on clear values and standards, without which we cannot define antisocial behaviour.

I have taken longer than I intended, but I have done my level best to try to avoid being partisan. If there is one message that I wish to leave with the Government and Conservative spokesmen it is that we can, and must, do what we can to limit antisocial behaviour. We can and we must protect other people from it. But the cure will not come from us. The cure will come from society, via local communities and individuals. If I am right in that analysis, might it not be a little antisocial of us and of the Government of the day, whoever forms it, to say, &#147;Leave the problem to us.

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000652">Far too many individuals and communities in Hartlepool, as in other places, have their quality of life affected by nuisance neighbours, problem families, yobbish behaviour, drinking in the street, and gangs of youths intimidating decent people&#151;not only older citizens, but making other young people feel threatened as well. Reduction of crime has been a great success over recent years in Hartlepool, with examples of true partnership working to achieve significant results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000653">By coincidence, I had an e-mail this morning about crime figures in Hartlepool from the district commander of Hartlepool basic command unit, Steve Ashman. I will quote what Steve said in his e-mail.</p>

The district has never before returned less than 800 crimes in a month, going back to when crime records began. I have often thought that to get under 800 would be possible but difficult. We came in with 736, which has smashed all previous records.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000654">Given that December is traditionally a high point for crime, with more people being drunk because of Christmas and new year, and more burglaries because of Christmas presents, that shows a remarkable achievement. I pay tribute to Steve and all his staff in Cleveland police for their work in helping to reduce crime in the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000655">The success in crime reduction is not mirrored in attempts to deal with antisocial behaviour, which have faltered in recent years. There has been a belief in some organisations in Hartlepool that antisocial behaviour was difficult to define and so difficult to address. I was concerned that that followed the principle of &#147;It&#146;s too hard so we won&#146;t try&#148;, which is of no use to my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000656">In June last year I was fortunate enough to secure an Adjournment debate on the subject of antisocial behaviour in Hartlepool. In that debate I expressed my frustration that agencies, particularly the local council, were not being as proactive in both prevention and enforcement as agencies in other areas. The tools provided by the Government to tackle antisocial behaviour, such as ASBOs and acceptable behaviour contracts, were not being used as much as I or, more importantly, residents believed they should be. Hartlepool had seen 10 ASBOs issued in a six-year period, well behind neighbouring authorities such as Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07011841000657">In that debate I quoted letters and e-mails which expressed constituents&#146; concerns about, for example, loud music being played at 3 am, antisocial tenants being evicted only to turn up again in a different house in the same street, and gangs fighting in front of frightened residents. One of the e-mails from a constituent concluded:</p>
<a name="70118-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="07011841000866"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It seems to us that a number of agencies have powers to deal with a lot of issues but do not use the powers and many appear not to talk to each other.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07011841000658">Among decent residents there was a growing loss of faith in the ability of agencies to tackle the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70118-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07011841000659">I find that suffering from antisocial behaviour is not confined to a particular area or a particular class of people. I receive many complaints from people in the most prosperous part of my town about underage drinking in Ward Jackson park. Youths congregate, causing disturbance and intimidation. They move around frequently in order to trick the police, but tend to be in the affluent areas of Seaton Carew, the Fens estate and the picturesque village of Greatham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07011841000660">Having said that, it is fair to say that people living in the most deprived areas of Hartlepool are disproportionately more likely to suffer from instances of criminal and antisocial behaviour than other areas. The wards of Stranton, Grange and Dyke House are filled with energetic and committed people who are actively engaged with making their communities better&#151;people such as Julie Hetherington, Brian Maiden, Brian McBean, Muriel Boreland and Irene Nelson. Why should those people and their neighbours have to suffer from blatant and open drug dealing in  <br>

the street, litter, graffiti, and problem families, as well as the prospect of going to work and having to walk past people drinking in the street and not bothering to seek employment? Many of the Victorian terraced properties in areas in the centre of town have been sold to private landlords who do not care about the neighbourhood, who often do not even know where Hartlepool is, and are not that bothered as long as the housing benefit cheques keep coming in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000661">I am pleased that some progress has been made in Hartlepool in the six months since my debate. I am also pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), who responded to the debate in June, is on the Front Bench. I pay tribute to the work that he did after the debate. He put a rocket under the backsides of some people in Hartlepool, which has made a real difference. There is a growing recognition among certain elements in the local authority that enforcement need not necessarily be a negative or an exclusive policy that is completely contrary to prevention and rehabilitation, but can and should be undertaken with a whole range of other appropriate approaches towards tackling the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000662">Hartlepool was the pilot basic command unit in the Cleveland police area for neighbourhood policing. The local strategic partnership, which I chair, in conjunction with the Home Office, pledged &#163;250,000 to that project to ensure that policing was as close to communities as possible. An additional 74 police officers have been recruited&#151;we have 21 new officers in total&#151;or redeployed from back-office duties to ensure that the fight against crime and antisocial behaviour is led from the streets. Since April last year, there has been a local police team in each ward in the town, with leaflets distributed showing the photos of the police officers together with their contact numbers, and surgeries have allowed members of the public to discuss matters of concern directly with them. That has had an unbelievable impact on the sense of community safety for most of the town. The visible police presence on the streets of Hartlepool has led to a palpable sense of decent people reclaiming their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000663">In September, I was asked by community groups from Stranton, Grange and Dyke House to chair a meeting between residents and senior agency staff in organisations such as the police and the local authority to discuss the problems of drug dealing and to ensure that measures such as CCTV provision are operational and co-ordinated. A follow-up meeting in November showed that the closer working and, crucially, the level of discussion and debate between residents and police on matters such as the best approach to tackling suspected drug dealing&#151;whether we kick the door in or take more covert approaches&#151;has helped to increase faith and reassurance and ensured that residents are part of the process of reducing criminal and antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07011841000664">In addition, to tackle the problems of absent and uncaring private landlords, the local authority is in the final stages of considering the introduction of a selective licensing scheme&#151;under powers introduced by this Government&#151;which would mean that landlords in the town would have to show that they have in place suitable arrangements to deal with antisocial tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07011841000665">Perhaps most encouragingly for residents, local agencies are working with much greater focus and energy to put in place enforcement actions. At the time of my Adjournment debate six months ago, 10 antisocial behaviour orders had been issued in six or seven years; I understand that that figure has increased to about 30. The principle of naming and shaming young people who have been issued with ASBOs is making its first tentative steps in Hartlepool. Last month, 2,000 leaflets were distributed on the Dyke House estate regarding a three-year ASBO, informing residents that the individual concerned had been making threats of violence, had been verbally abusive, and had harassed residents, damaged property and thrown missiles. That is welcome. I have wanted that initiative to be introduced for some time to provide reassurance to residents blighted by the thoughtless actions of a small number of individuals and to make the individuals concerned accountable for their actions. I hope that there will be more instances of such publicity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07011841000666">Despite the undoubted improvements in the past few months, there is a need to do much more and to adopt a more co-ordinated approach in Hartlepool. One of the reasons why local agencies have been slow off the mark in using the extra powers that the Government provided was a feeling among some officials that a move towards enforcement was somehow contrary to attempts to rehabilitate and to prevent antisocial behaviour. I have observed a significant difference in approach and style between those involved in enforcement and those who work in prevention. I hope that those differences are ending, and that a more consistent approach, which can embrace prevention and enforcement as fundamental parts of a co-ordinated antisocial behaviour strategy, is coming to the fore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000667">The town could do much more to introduce early intervention to prevent the onset of antisocial and criminal behaviour. As other hon. Members have said, early intervention is crucial because signs of delinquent behaviour in children are one of the strongest indicators of future activity. It also allows those individuals to overcome barriers and fulfil their potential. Studies show that some factors, such as poverty, dependence on benefits, parents&#146; history of convictions and imprisonment, and the youthfulness of parents, are most closely associated with predicting a child&#146;s behaviour in later life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000668">A study in this country, which the National Audit Office report cites, shows that 63 per cent. of boys with convicted fathers were subsequently convicted themselves. The report concluded:</p>
<a name="70118-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="07011841000867"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Having a convicted parent at age 10 was the best single predictor of anti-social personality at age 32.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000669">That rings true in my experience as a ward councillor on Hartlepool borough council and as a Member of Parliament.</p>

young people&#146;s plans? Does he agree that it is important to identify early those children who might be at risk of committing crimes later?</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="07011841000671"><a name="70118-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="07011841001222"><b>Mr. Wright:</b> I agree. As soon as the debate finishes, I shall rush to the Hartlepool children and young person&#146;s plan to ascertain which factors it takes into account&#151;whether it includes not only children who have convicted parents but the range of risk factors that I mentioned&#151;as methods of trying to predict and prevent antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000672">It is important to stress that I do not suggest that everybody in the categories that I outlined is condemned to a life of crime and should be accordingly stigmatised. However, risk factors can be used to target and tailor more efficiently early intervention mechanisms that have greater chances of success. That approach would complement the Government&#146;s attempts to reduce social exclusion and improve chances in the most deprived areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000673">The Government&#146;s emphasis on education, the doubling of spend per pupil in Hartlepool, the provision of neighbourhood renewal fund money and the establishment of Sure Start centres all demonstrate that early intervention can make a positive impact. However, we could do more in a more co-ordinated and targeted way. For example, I should like an extension of education maintenance allowances to include graduation incentives, which would encourage young people in deprived areas, who hitherto had not even considered further and higher education, to do so. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary can expand on whether that is planned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000674">I am interested in hon. Members&#146; comments about neighbourhood policing, which is the 21st-century equivalent of the bobby on the beat. For a variety of reasons, that informal supervision is absent. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) mentioned community wardens. We have them in Hartlepool, where they have proved a huge success. People say that, 20 or 30 years ago, the bus conductor or the park warden could say, &#147;Oi Johnny, oi Mary, don&#146;t do that&#148;, and prevent things from escalating. There is a consensus that neighbourhood policing works. We need to consider other mechanisms and ensure that the 21st-century equivalent of the park warden or bus conductor is in society, not only to make areas safer but to prevent antisocial behaviour at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07011841000675">The borough of Hartlepool is relatively compact, and organisations such as the borough council, the primary care trust, the basic command unit that I mentioned earlier and the registered social landlords are all coterminous. They can and do work together effectively. The sharing of information takes place, but I would be keen to see whether the Government can facilitate even more data sharing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07011841000676">I would also like to see a much greater expansion of restorative justice. I have already called in the House for community justice centres in my constituency, like those in Liverpool and Salford. I was disappointed that we were not included in the latest batch, but I will keep fighting for them. Hartlepool would be an ideal location for such centres because of the well developed residents&#146; network and the sense of civic pride that my town has. That civic pride, which encourages a feeling  <br>

of positive engagement on the ground in neighbourhoods, needs to be encouraged still further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07011841000677">I will also continue to push for more powers to be given to residents&#146; groups, because I can see the potential for such powers in Hartlepool. Neighbourhood renewal money has given community groups in my constituency hundreds of thousands of pounds to improve amenities, by providing better street lighting and helping to keep neighbourhoods cleaner, for example. More could definitely be achieved if the Government gave residents associations more powers to take ownership and control of their area, and I would like the Minister to address that point when he winds up the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07011841000678">We should not shy away from enforcement as an effective tool to tackle antisocial behaviour. Early intervention and initiatives to break the negative cycle should be emphasised, but inevitably there comes a point when enforcement is necessary. The Government need to continue in the same direction and encourage magistrates to pass tougher sentences. I pay tribute to what my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley said about magistrates being soft. We need to tackle that issue, possibly by naming and shaming those who do not impose harsh sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07011841000679">I mentioned earlier the 17-year-old youth in Hartlepool who had a three-year ASBO placed on him. He has been locked up 60 times. That is unacceptable. We should ensure that any sentence passed, whether a prison or a community sentence, is served effectively. If a community order is served requiring litter in an area to be cleaned up for a week, we should not pat Johnny or Mary on the back if they turn up only once or twice. The litter needs to be cleaned up, and if that is not done in the time provided, those people need to be sent back until it is done. That not only provides discipline but gives reassurance to the local community.</p>

We must ensure that people who commit crimes tidy up the areas in which other people have to live and put up with the problem. Does he agree that part of the difficulty lies with the probation service? Often, young people turn up to do the work that they have been challenged to do, only to find that there is no one there to provide supervision. They are then sent away. That disincentive works against them and they end up not doing the hours that they were supposed to do as part of their community service, just because the probation service did not have anyone available on a Saturday or Sunday.</p>

One of the things that I would like to see in my area is an analysis of the probation service, to find out where the weaknesses are, and whether community sentences are being imposed and enforced&#151;and if not, why not?</p>

Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright). My mother&#146;s family hail from west Hartlepool and I have happy memories of visiting the town and being on the beach at Seaton Carew.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000686">As children, when we were not visiting the beach at Hartlepool, we would often visit the Yorkshire coast. From that experience, I know that antisocial behaviour is nothing new. Travelling down the A64 in our Standard Ensign, we would often come to Staxton roundabout, and be faced with the decision of turning left for Scarborough or right for Filey. If it was Easter, and the mods and rockers were in town, we would often decide to turn right, as the antisocial behaviour on the beach on such occasions was something to be believed. That paled into insignificance, however, when compared with Glasgow holiday week in August, when most of Glasgow closed down, factories closed down, whole streets decamped to Scarborough and the hard drinking of the men was something to be experienced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000687">The current problem with antisocial behaviour is much more ubiquitous and in many ways more complex. First, access and attitudes to alcohol are very different now, and drinking hours are much longer. In my constituency, people can drink until 5 or 6 o&#146;clock in the morning in nightclubs or at the new casino. Many tourists who visit the town now adopt Spanish hours, as I call them, going to sleep in the early evening only to get up so that they can club all night. Young people also have much more money in their pockets than they used to have. Many people, before they even go out for the night, will tank up on vodka in their guest house or at home. Alcopops have made alcohol a much more attractive option for younger people. Even if one cannot fight one&#146;s way to the bar in a particular establishment, waitresses, almost like those girls who sell ice cream in the cinema, go around with trays of shots. One can throw &#163;1 into the tray and quickly knock back a vodka shot between rounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000688">The other big change since the 1960s is that decent people go out more in the evenings. We have moved on a lot from the early days of chicken in a basket. More people now enjoy having meals in restaurants and spending time in our city centres, to which, previously, people largely went to drink in pubs, not to eat. People who go out for a good time, perhaps to binge-drink, are therefore intermixing with families and more  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000689">Towns such as Scarborough depend heavily on tourism; it is, I am told, the UK&#146;s premier tourist resort. We are trying to attract more families and conferences to the town, which we cannot do if we have this image of binge-drinking on our streets. We do not want undesirable people coming to the town. We do, however, have the UK Independence party conference coming to Scarborough in October&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Are you tempted?&#148;] On that occasion, I will be in Blackpool, to which the Conservative party is not too posh to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07011841000690">Forty-six per cent. of calls to North Yorkshire police are about criminal damage. I know, however, that Scarborough is not as bad as many of our inner-city areas. We heard from the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), who is not in her place, about the number of ASBOs served in her constituency. Last year, our newly appointed local police chief, chief inspector Andy Everitt, identified his top priorities: targeting the top five antisocial offenders; more ASBOs; the use of alcohol-free zones and, possibly, parenting orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07011841000691">Scarborough is a low-crime area. From speaking to my local authority today, I understand that only 25 incidents get phoned in for the whole borough, which pales into insignificance when compared with many London and inner city boroughs in the north of England. However, one in four crimes take place in either the town centre or Castle ward, and our crime and disorder reduction partnership is working well. Our Conservative-controlled local authority is well ahead of the game&#151;I am pleased that places such as Hartlepool are catching up&#151;which might be related to the fact that the leader of that council is a former chief of police in Scarborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07011841000692">The attitude taken in Scarborough is that ASBOs are not the way to go. The point at which an ASBO is issued to an offender is probably too late. We should be getting ahead of the game. Only two ASBOs were issued in Scarborough last year. We feel that the way forward is through other measures. As well as ASBOs, for which residents, the council or landlords can apply through the civil courts, we have CRASBOs&#151;criminal ASBOs&#151;five of which have been issued. I do not know for sure, but I suspect that those five offenders are the five referred to by Chief Inspector Everitt when he took up his post. CRASBOs are much cheaper to secure, because they result from criminal prosecutions. As we have already heard today, issuing an ASBO can cost up to &#163;3,500, and in cases in which ASBOs are contested it can cost many times more than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07011841000694">Scarborough has a successful crime and disorder reduction partnership, known as the Safer Communities Partnership (North Yorkshire Moors and Coast). There have been many successes, for instance in regard to problem drinking. There are four planks to that strategy. The first plank is responsible retailing. We have the Best Bar None campaign, which gives pubs and off licences accreditation if they can meet the required standards by identifying people who are drunk and refusing to serve them, and being vigilant about the problem of under-age drinking. The second plank is responsible drinking. Attitudes to binge drinking need to be changed. We distribute Spikeys, special caps for bottles to prevent people from putting spirits or date-rape drugs into them. We are also examining the problem of domestic violence linked to irresponsible drinking. The third plank is enforcement and fixed-penalty notices, and the fourth relates to the urban environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para28"><a name="07011841000695">Lighting is important in the urban environment. If people are to feel confident in our town centres, the lighting must be adequate. Conversely, one reason why we do not see too much antisocial behaviour in the villages is that there is no lighting. Young people do not congregate in the village centres because in winter it is pitch black, and no one can see what they are doing. We are also considering the location of takeaways and taxi ranks, where there can be flashpoints of antisocial behaviour as people congregate after leaving the pubs. We have a very good CCTV system in the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70118-0016.htm_para29"><a name="07011841000696">Led by the local authority, we have been giving thought to what it calls inter-generational activity. Elderly people, perhaps retuning home from a meal in a restaurant, are intimidated by young people in the streets at night. Although the young people may not be doing anything illegal or causing a specific problem, the fact that they are there, sometimes wearing hoodies, may make elderly people less than keen to rush across and hug them straight away. The local authority is organising another &#147;kids versus cronies&#148; bowling competition this year, following last year&#146;s successful roll-out. I am only sorry that, not being in either group, I shall not be able to take part in it just yet.</p>

They are a real bane for many communities, but we must think carefully before we regulate, because many people use motorcycles responsibly for recreation purposes. Some use them for trial riding, for instance, while others take part in motocross. I suspect that if we try to clamp down on mini motos, the majority of law-abiding citizens will comply with the new legislation but the troublemakers will ignore it&#151;that is similar to the situation in respect of guns. We must think carefully before we take action that might impinge on responsible motorcycle users.</p>

A young lady contacted me and I rang her back right away. She has a problem in her street with people who have been subject to certain of the measures that we are discussing; they are no longer able to roam the streets but instead they go to particular houses, and that can be a real problem. The young lady who contacted me said that at the house next door to hers 20 people come and go at all times of the day and night and that there is noise; she has even had to install her own closed circuit television camera so that she can observe what goes on outside her home. She is not an old fogey; she is a 23-year-old with a young family.</p>

Unlike in Hartlepool, we have been ahead of the game, and the lesson to be learned is that the types of issues that we are discussing need to be addressed not top-down by edict from Government, but from the bottom up by local people, communities and councillors deciding what is the best tailor-made approach to the problems that they face in their area. I am pleased that the Minister referred to that in his opening remarks; he said that we cannot have off-the-peg solutions to such problems, but that they must be tailor-made for every community.</p>

Lady&#151;I do not remember whether she was in attendance at the time, so I am unsure whether she recalls what was said&#151;declared that there was no antisocial behaviour in his constituency. That gave us much cause for hilarity, just as the speech today of the hon. Member for Taunton gave my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) some cause for hilarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07011841000710">I know the ins and outs of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 fairly well, and I was very enthusiastic about the measures introduced because they addressed my residents&#146; concerns. Since I was first elected to this House in 1997, a lot of people have raised issues such as vandalism, graffiti, nuisance noise and groups congregating. Back in 1997, there was not the language to address those issues, but an increasing number of Members started raising them, which in part led to the 2003 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07011841000711">There are two aspects to the 2003 Act: the behavioural aspect&#151;antisocial behaviour orders, parenting contracts, acceptable behaviour contracts&#151;and the environmental aspect, by which I mean abandoned cars, fly-tipping, graffiti and so on. Since that Act came into force, we have augmented the powers of local authorities and others through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. That has given local communities a lot of tools to deal with antisocial behaviour.</p>

Many powers exist that enable us to address antisocial behaviour, but as other Members have said to me, enforcement&#151;the use of those powers by local authorities, the police and others&#151;can be patchy around the country. That is my experience. My constituency is covered by two local authorities; unlike that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool, it does not have the luxury of being coterminous. North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire councils introduce different measures at different times, even though the communities affected by those different measures live alongside each other. That creates confusion. Also, the councils and the police do not use their powers to their fullest extent, so the perception in Grimsby, Cleethorpes, Immingham, Barton and the surrounding villages in my area is that  <br>

the 2003 Act is not addressing their concerns. However, the problem is not the Act itself and what the Government have done, but the use of those powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000713">Let me give a few examples. The former chief constable of Humberside once told me that he did not agree with the 2003 Act and some of the measures in it. Some councillors told me that they felt that it was an infringement of people&#146;s liberties, so they did not want to use the powers available to them. The chairman of the police authority at that time had similar views. Police community support officers&#151;they have been mentioned today&#151;and community wardens are integral to addressing antisocial behaviour, but unfortunately, when the first round of bidding came in for police CSOs in my area, the then chief constable and the chairman of the police authority decided that they did not wish to bid. Most other forces put in bids for CSOs, but our area did not, and we were left with zero. Members can imagine how that looked. We had councils that were somewhat recalcitrant about using their powers, and a chief constable who did not want police CSOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000714">One can therefore understand why some local residents are feeling let down by the Act, in spite of the fact that I was on the Committee and am an enthusiast for all the measures. Indeed, even before I was elected as a Member of Parliament, I had campaigned on the issues of community cohesion, respect, pride in one&#146;s neighbourhood and the need to address the antisocial behaviour of a minority who sometimes terrorise the law-abiding majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000715">Recently, the <i> Grimsby Telegraph, </i>a local newspaper that covers the north-east Lincolnshire part of my constituency, launched a campaign called &#147;Enough!&#148;, which probably summarises the views of my constituents. They have had enough of the antisocial behaviour sometimes manifested in our communities. To be fair to the paper, it sees this campaign as an extension of the Government&#146;s respect campaign and it is designed to encourage community action. I have mentioned the councils and the police, but community action is as much a part of addressing antisocial behaviour as the other issues that have been mentioned today. The newspaper always includes a link to the Government&#146;s respect website in its coverage of the campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000716">To date, some 8,000 people have signed the petition and it was presented to Louise Casey of the antisocial behaviour unit last week. The paper is not trying to come up with solutions, but to highlight some of the problems that exist in the urban areas of Grimsby and Cleethorpes because of quirky decisions made in the past by, for example, the chief constable. The council has been slow to take up the issue of antisocial behaviour. North-East Lincolnshire council has had financial problems and was languishing at the bottom of the league table for performance and, unfortunately, that has had an impact on our community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000717">Things are getting better, I am glad to say.

been in response, the answer was a big fat zero in terms of the latter. I do not know of any action being taken to combat noise nuisance, especially at night. As one can imagine, being a resort area we do get noise nuisance at night from, for example, parties with thumping music or cars that just park up outside houses with the music blaring out for a couple of hours. I do not recall any action being taken or fixed penalty notices being issued in such instances.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), who is a former chairman of Humberside police authority, is going to see the chief constable tomorrow to raise some of the wider issues surrounding antisocial behaviour and community support officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07011841000720">As I said, my local newspaper has been running a campaign to highlight the region&#146;s antisocial behaviour.

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07011841000721">I want to raise a couple of other matters. First, what can be done to help local authorities to make full use of their powers? My hon. Friend may want to discuss that question with colleagues in other Departments, but one element of the problem has to do with education. For example, I have become aware through my correspondence with the local authority that some of the people there do not know what powers are available to them. What can he do to get the message through about the powers that local authorities have?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07011841000722">Secondly, I want restorative and community justice to be extended. I welcome the introduction of ASBOs, parenting orders and so on, but some of the people who are guilty of antisocial behaviour do not understand the consequences of their actions because there is no real system of restorative justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000723">Often, the victims of antisocial behaviour just want to hear the perpetrators say that they are sorry. The people who cover a wall with offensive graffiti may have drunk a bit too much to be able to think straight, but the victims of that antisocial behaviour want to be able to tell them how it feels&#151;and to see them clean it up. An important element of this debate is that people must be made aware of the impact of their antisocial behaviour on its victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000724">In my area, most ASBOs are imposed after a crime has been committed. That system has its merits, but I  <br>

believe that many of the people who are given an ASBO are already too far down the line. We should use the antisocial behaviour measures that we have introduced to nip criminal activity in the bud. When behaviour becomes criminal, it is often too late to do anything to change the pattern of offending. I want there to be more emphasis on early intervention to stop people engaging in antisocial behaviour and then going on to commit crimes.</p>

The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety opened this debate by saying that we should adopt a reflective approach, and I welcome that. The debate is about striking the balance between preventive and putative measures&#151;between support and action. I have agreed with a lot of what has been said by the many hon. Members who have commented on that balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000727">One form of preventive action is the Sure Start scheme, which many Members have mentioned today and about which I have spoken on many occasions, because the Government are to be congratulated on it. However, it will take time for the effects of the first Sure Start programmes to work through and, because the schemes are confined to the most deprived wards, many families who live just outside those areas may not yet have been included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000728">Preventive strategies are essential. A report submitted to the Public Accounts Committee made it clear that there is much more scope for preventive action, as Liberal Democrats point out in every debate on antisocial behaviour. Such action is important. I would like more work to be done through our children&#146;s services and children&#146;s trusts to identify children who may be at risk, so that suitable measures can be adopted as soon as possible.</p>

Eventually, an ASBO was imposed on one young man&#151;in fact, it was the first ASBO that Purbeck district council, in conjunction with Dorset police, had managed to secure. However, although that ASBO was absolutely necessary, it was only necessary because there had been no earlier interventions. The village no longer had a community beat officer and many other things were lacking. I accept that there are occasions when ASBOs are needed as a stop measure to protect the community, but we should focus on the whole toolkit, as we have said many times, starting with warnings, which are cost-effective, as the National Audit Office report tells us.</p>

report refers to Labour-controlled Hackney council, which has made enormous use of acceptable behaviour contracts&#151;effectively, I assume, because the proportion of ASBOs is smaller. I am proud that acceptable behaviour contracts were pioneered in Islington.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07011841000731">I want to talk about the impact of ASBOs on young people. As the debate has shown, we are sometimes in danger of equating all young people with yobs. That is sad, because the majority of our young people are excellent and will grow up to become good citizens. There is a danger of stigmatising and of targeting antisocial behaviour measures on the young; much of the data shows various interventions in respect of under-18-year-olds. At a sitting of the PAC, someone put a good question to a Home Office civil servant. They asked whether it would be possible to have a breakdown of the figures for antisocial behaviour, because there is a big difference between a 17-year-old and 10 or 12-year-olds. Further breakdown of the statistics would be helpful for monitoring and evaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07011841000732">One of my particular concerns is vulnerable young people&#151;not because I am soft about antisocial behaviour, but because I am genuinely concerned about the unintended consequences of measures. That is why effective scrutiny in Committee is so important; far too much legislation has unintended consequences. I hope the Minister will reflect on and respond to the following point, which I raised at the PAC without receiving a satisfactory answer. The British Institute for Brain Injured Children conducted a survey of youth offending teams and antisocial behaviour co-ordinators between April 2004 and April 2005. It reported that 35 per cent. of children made subject to ASBOs had a mental health problem or recognised learning disability. It found that 3 per cent. had autism or Asperger&#146;s syndrome, while 42 per cent. had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07011841000733">I am really concerned that children and young people who may have complex conditions are getting caught up in the action against antisocial behaviour. Clearly, other measures could be used more appropriately in those particular circumstances. It is easy to say that the evidence is just anecdotal, but there is rather a lot of it, so I would ask the Minister to take the matter away and check out the evaluation and monitoring. Surely it is not a sign of a civilised society to impose punitive measures or conditions on a child with Asperger&#146;s who may be quite unable to meet those conditions. Surely it is a strength to recognise that individual cases may need to be treated rather differently. In those circumstances, we need a proper assessment from children&#146;s services so that children at risk are protected rather than wrongly given an ASBO. There should really be a legal requirement&#151;I have proposed amendments in various Committees in this respect&#151;for any order against a child to be preceded by a children&#146;s service assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para28"><a name="07011841000734">I welcome the introduction of individual support orders, but I would like to point out a time lag. ASBOs were introduced in 1998 and all along the Liberal Democrats said that supportive measures should be in place. It is no good just having stop measures, because if we are to make real progress, we need to change people&#146;s behaviour. We had to wait until 2004 before  <br>

individual support orders were introduced. As Liberal Democrats, we question the priorities and the balance that the Government have implemented. We welcome the introduction of ISOs, but we do not welcome the fact that only 1 per cent. of ASBOs on children presently appear to have support orders attached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para29"><a name="07011841000735">It would be good to hear the Minister&#146;s reassurance that more work will be done on encouragement and education. I think that the Youth Justice Board report made the point that the majority of sentencers appeared to be unaware of the support orders. It also noted that out of the &#163;500,000 of ring-fenced funding made available in 2005&#151;I congratulate the Government on making it available&#151;only &#163;62,000 was applied for by youth offending teams to provide the input necessary for individual support orders. It is important to build on this and ensure that young people with ASBOs have a support package wrapped around them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para30"><a name="07011841000736">I would like to comment on breaches. Acceptable behaviour contracts are discussed in the audit report and there is a lot about young people not understanding the conditions. Clearly, we need to work on that aspect, as full communication and understanding are necessary. We have to make these measures work better. In respect of breaches of ASBOs, there are questions about whether all the conditions are reasonable, so a full input from the local youth offending is necessary to ensure that they are reasonable. A young person has to have some interaction with others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70118-0017.htm_para31"><a name="07011841000737">I believe that an individual support order can have conditions attached to it and that a breach can also happen there. It is a matter for a bit more concern, as the support order is surely supposed to be supportive and it does not seem terribly helpful if someone ends up with a criminal record. I realise that we are back to the carrot and stick, but it remains a bit of a problem. </p>

I understand some of the arguments that are put forward. However, I am concerned about the naming and shaming of the vulnerable children that I have mentioned, and the potential consequences. My attention has been drawn to the guidance that is issued by the Home Office and I have read through it. Is the Minister sure that it goes sufficiently far? It requires factual information. I am not sure that it has the full common assessment that we need.</p>

I questioned parental orders during the Committee stage of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I did indeed. I did not vote against them, but I questioned them, because that is my role as an MP: to question in Committee. I could not see how we could make people do what they did not want to do. Being a former teacher, I made the point that, if one tries to make kids do something that they do not want to do, they sit there with folded arms and do not participate. However, parental orders have apparently been successful and I have said on many occasions that I am pleased that that is so.

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000742">It has to be better to have parental classes on a voluntary basis, as part of a change of culture. We all acknowledge that parenting is an incredibly hard job. There should not be a fear of being stigmatising or of being seen as a failure when it comes to seeking help. I have often said: if someone has a bad headache for a week, they go to the doctor, so if they are having issues with parenting, why on earth is it not the norm to seek help? I would like to see lots of parenting classes readily available right across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000743">As other Members have mentioned, the key to the issue is adequate policing in the local community. I cannot let this opportunity slip without mentioning that we have real concerns in Dorset. At this time, it is the second lowest funded police authority in the country. The chief constable is really concerned. It is an incredibly high performing police authority, which we are proud of. However, with the new demands on the force, there is no slack to cope with everything. Along with not having all our community support officers, the fear is that perhaps we will not be able to have all the resources that are needed in neighbourhood policing. I emphasise the importance of partnerships. I will give one example. With our local police station and local police force, a motor vehicle dealership recently provided quite a large vehicle for the police and the community wardens. It is used to take young people to activities. That is a fantastic partnership. There are many more examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000744">Finally, I draw attention to an important point in the National Audit Office report: are we giving enough support to victims of antisocial behaviour and to potential witnesses? There is more that should be done. I echo the point made by previous speakers that we should be doing much more with restorative justice. That system has been used in Scandinavian countries for years and we need to roll it out much faster than we are. All in all, we have a big problem. We need to work at partnership level in our local communities, but we need adequate funding for our neighbourhood policing.</p>

That shows how much store people put by the fact that antisocial behaviour is a big problem in constituencies. I have to agree with that. Where do we start in a debate about antisocial behaviour? The issue is about getting funding across in certain areas. Home-Start in Chorley is a good group that gives families support when they need it. The problem is that we could lose Home-Start in Chorley because of a lack of funding. We need to try to find new funds to ensure that we do not lose such schemes; otherwise we will pay the price somewhere down the line through antisocial behaviour.</p>

ASBOs. ASBOs are successful, but they are good only if strong magistrates are willing to back them up and if the court is willing to push through the problem people who will not respect the terms of their ASBOs. If that does not happen and the court is weak, police and the victims feel let down, although that might be due to not the magistrate, but the advice of a clerk that the matter should not be pursued, or that the person should be given another chance. Unfortunately, victims do not understand that. We have to put victims first, and the sooner we start doing that, the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07011841000747">I am pleased to say that the number of police has gone up in Lancashire&#151;may it continue to increase. A uniformed presence on the streets can make a real difference to fighting crime. The police community support officers back that presence up and operate with the beat manager to play an important role. The PCSOs are as effective as anyone I know. They can rightly call on the local council, and council wardens have a role to play with PCSOs because by working together, they can fight antisocial behaviour. They are committed to making our streets safer. We must not shy away from keeping a uniformed presence on the street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07011841000748">When people break their ASBOs and continue to be a problem, we must deal with that. An effective way of doing so would be to change the rules for court sentences. The sentences give should be not maximum sentences, but minimum sentences, so that victims will know the exact time that people will serve. At present, someone who gets a maximum sentence might serve only 50 per cent. of it, with good behaviour. If minimum sentences were given, victims would understand exactly how people were being punished. If those people misbehaved in prison, the sentence would be extended. A minimum sentence is important to victims, and we must continue to ensure that victims&#146; voices are heard and that they are first in the justice system. I am pleased that we are getting that message across.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000749">We must give alternatives. Young people need support, but when the council tax comes round, we always see a cut in the youth budget. That is always one of the first cuts to take place, yet we wonder why there is no funding for alternatives for young people. Our area does not have the pleasure of having a unitary authority; we have a two-tier system and are reliant on the county council. However, when the county council sets its budget, Chorley gets a poor settlement for youth provision, which leads to a cut in its youth service and problems on the street. We must change that and realise that the youth budget is important because it funds some of the ways of tackling antisocial behaviour. We must make it a priority that councils understand that they have a part to play. We need preventive measures&#151;not just a stick, but a carrot as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000750">I am pleased that there are people such as Tom Watson, who looks after Tatton community centre in Chorley.

and trying to be nosey. People involved in neighbourhood watch are trying to make their communities safer. Tom Watson has worked well with Keith Warren, who looks after the Lancashire neighbourhood watch and has been advising the Government on best practice and the way in which neighbourhood watch can work with authorities to bring about safer streets in Lancashire. I am pleased that those people are on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000752">I am pleased, too, that the Government have ensured that closed circuit television has a role to play in Chorley. I am pleased that there is a safer car park scheme, so that when people go to their cars and see youngsters hanging around under the floodlights, they understand that there is some protection, and that there is someone looking after them. We need to join up all those measures. I would like CCTV to be rolled out to all the rural villages in Chorley, as that would make the villagers safer. We have a big role to play in making our streets and communities much stronger and safer for all of us. I am sure that the Minister takes his job seriously, and I know that he cares passionately about ensuring that people are safe on the streets. We must fight antisocial behaviour, and we can do so by working together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000753">There is a responsibility on off-licences, too. They are the cause of a lot of antisocial behaviour, because they provide the drink that fuels it. Usually, it is not youngsters who go into the off-licence, but someone over 18, who buys the drink to pass on or sell to youngsters. They then go to the recreation ground, have far too much to drink and cause vandalism, using spray-paint cans to spray their names everywhere. That behaviour has an effect on people&#146;s lives, and it is a misery for people who have to put up with it, night after night. We must try to ensure that off-licences are policed, and that can only be done by bringing all the organisations together. We must be firm with anybody who breaks the code on selling alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000754">Of course, after alcohol, there is usually a next step: drugs. People start off with cannabis and go on to harder drugs. I do not care what people say&#151;there is a definite link between soft drugs and hard drugs. We must be tough and reclassify cannabis. There has been a trial, and the results show the consequence of being soft on cannabis. Whatever people might say, it is a dangerous drug with long-term health effects, and we need to tell people that it is dangerous. It is time to re-categorise it, because drugs are a blight on young people, and a major part of antisocial behaviour. Drugs and drink fuel young people in a way that causes misery, not just for the young person, but for the family that they go home to and the families that live in the neighbourhood. Drugs are a real challenge. We have to be tough on the dealers, and we must make sure that the sentence fits the crime. Dealers should be put away for a long time, so that they are not allowed back on to the streets to deal again. We must make sure that there is lifelong protection for the people who live in the areas that are affected. Of course, we must make our voice heard.</p>

I finish by saying that the Government want to be tough on crime, but we must keep proving to the people that we will be tough.

To understand the causes of antisocial behaviour is to understand the limits of opportunities in our society, the shortfalls of Government policy, and the decline in moral and social values.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07011841000760">Hardly a day goes by without our hearing about an incident on a train, in a town centre or a residential area in which people were disturbed by antisocial behaviour such as a fight, a tussle, someone letting off fireworks and so on. We live in a complex, interdependent, integrated social community, whose excesses and imbalances are enthusiastically exposed by the media, so differences in opinion and jealousy invariably arise. It is the Government&#146;s responsibility to ensure that any resulting antisocial behaviour is dealt with correctly, whether by tackling it long before a situation develops, by limiting the conditioning of the aggressor, who comes to realise that they are out of order, or by allowing the police to deal with the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07011841000761">There has been a flurry of activity since the Government came to office. More than 30 criminal justice Acts have been introduced since 1997 including, most notably, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. ASBOs were introduced in 1999, and the Antisocial Behaviour Act was passed in 2003. Recently, in January 2006, the respect action plan, which has been mentioned, was introduced, and last June, the national respect squad was formed. Last month, on 27 December, the respect tsar announced that 40 areas would be designated as respect zones and receive extra cash. There has been a huge number of initiatives but, as we heard from my hon. and good Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert), the Government are failing, which is reflected in the huge sum&#151;some &#163;3.4 billion&#151;that antisocial behaviour costs every year.</p>

Complaints about noisy neighbours, too, have increased. The Government&#146;s response to antisocial behaviour is largely reactive, as hon. Members have said, not preventive. The National Audit Office says that about 50 per cent. of ASBOs are breached. The ASBO is regarded as a badge of honour and, because of the pressures on the police, its conditions are not enforced. The police play a pivotal role, and I take my hat off to the Dorset constabulary, which is one of the best performing in the country but, unfortunately, one of the worst funded. It looks after Bournemouth town centre and keeps it relatively safe, but about half the police on duty on a Friday or Saturday night look after an area about half a mile square, so the rest of Bournemouth does not receive the coverage that residents expect their taxes to provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000763">Much has been said about the role of police community support officers. I hesitated to welcome their introduction, as it appeared to be a case of policing on the cheap. CSOs have a role to play but, unfortunately, they have limited powers, so the role of special constables should be bolstered. I come from an Army background&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I urge the Minister to bear with me, because I very much value the role of the Territorial Army in helping the regular Army when required to do so. In Bournemouth, people do not sign up to become police specials, because there is no money involved. Instead, they sign up to become CSOs, whose salary almost equates to that received by a full police officer. CSOs&#146; training does not approach the training given to specials, and neither are their powers of arrest comparable. I urge the Minister to shift the emphasis so that specials are paid a sum comparable to that received by members of the TA who work with the regular Army.</p>

Elements nightclub in Bournemouth, which has the capacity to accommodate 3,000 people, and the Dog and Duck in Weymouth are both classed as one unit, which is unacceptable. We have 30,000 visitors on a Friday or Saturday night, but those numbers are not taken into account in the manning levels for Dorset and Bournemouth, so I urge the Minister to reconsider them.</p>

There has been a change in attitudes, as we have heard, because those people do not have a sense of duty and have grown up with a different set of values. I blame the role models with whom they associate themselves or whom they look up to. What recently happened in &#147;Big Brother&#148; is a mirror image of British society. I shall leave aside the racist taunts. Shilpa Shetty is a Bollywood star and everything that Jo, Jade and Danielle are not. She is rich, famous, talented and intelligent&#151;everything they want to be but cannot be. Their behaviour has been fuelled by alcohol, which is typical of so many youngsters today.

their station in life without making any effort. Their behaviour is made worse because they have been trapped in the &#147;Big Brother&#148; house, but it is a true reflection of what is going on in British society.</p>

Their role models are pop stars, film stars and football players. We all know those characters and how they behave. They are in our papers every day. They are not the role models that I grew up with, and are certainly not the role models that my parents had. Unfortunately, there is a growing generation that has limited aspirations. Binge drinking is seen as OK. The spin-off from that is the antisocial behaviour that we have discussed today. The drinking culture in Britain is so different from that on the continent. In a roundabout way, &#147;Big Brother&#148; has done the nation a favour by allowing us to focus on what is happening to our culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70118-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000767">Not enough is being done to counteract that. We should try to catch people early, keep them active and engaged, build their confidence and manage their expectations. In Bournemouth there are examples to show that the opposite is happening. We have been told to build 20,000 houses. No consideration has been given to how close together the houses will be or the type of community that that will create. No consideration has been given to amenities, which will undoubtedly have an impact on community spirit when people are living on top of each other.</p>

In Britain, swings and roundabouts are provided for children up to the age of four, then there is nothing for kids to do to expend their energy, other than to hang around on the streets. Those who try to take the initiative, such as Bournemouth sea cadets, get no money because of the cuts in defence spending. Bournemouth canoe club gets no money because budgets have been cut by the councils.

Yes, they could join the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, but they could also join the Forestry Commission, a voluntary unit or a community hospital. Doing something that was not for themselves, but which would be to the economic benefit of the country, would cut back the &#163;3.4 billion that is being wasted each year dealing with antisocial behaviour.

increase, prisoner reoffending is up and, as has just been mentioned, teenage pregnancy rates have increased. That is a poor reflection of the Government&#146;s performance. Antisocial behaviour is the antithesis to society, and society is changing under the Government. I am worried for our younger generation. I am also worried that on current performance, the Government are not meeting the challenge to face those issues.</p>

That is precisely what we have had this afternoon, with some interesting contributions raising various issues associated with the problems of antisocial behaviour, which significantly affects so many neighbourhoods and communities across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07011841000773">Neighbourhood crime, neighbourhood nuisance and community safety have a major impact on the quality of life of countless people. There is little doubt that walls daubed with graffiti tags, smashed up bus shelters and rowdy groups on the streets intimidate many people and discourage them from venturing out into their own communities. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), like many other Members, talked about the local action, and she described how individuals in her community were taking the initiative. Those actions at community level are crucial in delivering the changes that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000774">I welcome the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) on his first outing on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. He made some interesting remarks about the history of community policing, albeit that Members in other parts of the House may not have shared his take on certain aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000775">The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) emphasised the importance of partnership working with the police and other agencies, as well as the role played by the community. I agreed with a fair amount of what she said, although I might look at her in a slightly different light in future given her theme of &#147;Big Sister&#148; and wonder whether she personifies that in her constituency in looking out for the interests of its residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000776">My hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) made a thoughtful contribution in which he observed that solutions can come only from the communities and individuals involved. He challenged Members on both sides of the House to reflect on that, and we certainly will.</p>

Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) emphasised the need for restorative justice, highlighting the community court in Liverpool that has been set up as a pilot. As more pilots roll out in the months ahead, we will examine their effects in bringing justice closer to the community.</p>

Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) emphasised the impact of the growth in late-night entertainment and the problems of alcohol and binge drinking. I noted his comments about the local initiatives that have been introduced in his constituency to deal with alcohol-related crime and about the importance of the built environment in making communities feel safer.</p>

Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) mentioned the problems in her constituency in relation to community policing. I will be interested to see how the Minister responds to her direct questions about that. The National Audit Office report indicated that about 80 per cent. of people in receipt of ASBOs already had a criminal record, which raises questions about whether they are given in appropriate circumstances. There is also the question of the overlap between antisocial behaviour and crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07011841000780">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) talked about the balance between support and action, which is a key aspect of the debate. It is important not to equate all young people with yobbishness, and we must all get that message across. Last night, I attended a presentation evening at Chafford school, where I said that it was great to celebrate young people&#146;s successes. They are not all bad, but that can be the perception from looking at the newspapers. It is much more sophisticated than that and we need to appreciate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07011841000781">It is important to take account of mental health challenges such as Asperger&#146;s, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, which can be triggers of or factors that lead to antisocial behaviour and crime. We must consider how to resolve those problems through dealing with people who experience such challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07011841000782">The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) highlighted the problem of ASBO enforcement: if breaches occur, ASBOs are not always properly enforced and proper sanctions are not applied. That is a powerful and important message about the impact and effect of ASBOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07011841000783">My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) mentioned the increase in antisocial behaviour in the past few years. He made an important point about the role of special constables. I want to put on record my congratulations to special constables on their work and service day in, day out, and my thanks to them for that. They are important and should be valued. My hon. Friend made important points about how their status could be further improved which I am sure will not be lost on hon. Members of all parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07011841000784">My hon. Friend also mentioned volunteering and getting young people involved in the social aspect of their communities. I welcome the initiative of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron): the young adult trust, which tries to promote a sense of social responsibility in communities, gets people involved and gives them new opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07011841000785">There is no doubt that antisocial behaviour makes an impact on all our communities throughout the country, but it also places a huge burden on the state. According to the National Audit Office, the cost to Government agencies of responding to reports of antisocial behaviour is approximately &#163;3.4 billion per year. The Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit estimates that problem families&#151;whose members commit crime&#151;live on benefits, have poor health and cost the state up to &#163;250,000 a year. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) drew attention to that.</p>

He accepted that aspects of his policies were not an unqualified success. Many issues that were mentioned today brought that to the fore. Against the backdrop of neighbourhood disorder, the Government have introduced an array of legislation, made many announcements and set up initiatives, culminating most recently in the launch of the much hyped Respect action plan. That included a host of interventions which fall outside the criminal law, from warning letters, through acceptable behaviour contracts and fixed penalty notices, to antisocial behaviour orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07011841000787">The Prime Minister has talked up ASBOs above all other interventions. In the Respect action plan, he stated that he was,</p>
<a name="70118-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="07011841000869"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;pleased that an ASBO is now a household expression&#151;synonymous with tackling antisocial behaviour.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07011841000788">The problem for the Prime Minister and the Government is that they simply do not know how effective ASBOs are at tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>

<a name="70118-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="07011841000871"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is little doubt that underlying some of the rhetoric are real problems affecting people in communities across the country. But Labour has become lost in the arbitrariness of its measures of anti-social behaviour. Furthermore, its flagship ASBO policy faced huge implementation problems at the start, and is looking increasingly discredited as a mainstream response.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07011841000791">The current lack of detailed qualitative analysis of the apparent remedies devised by the Government leads to confusion locally, with the National Audit Office suggesting that antisocial behaviour co-ordinators and others were</p>
<a name="70118-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="07011841000872"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;more likely to use interventions which related to their background or local preference rather than there being a clear relationship to the behaviour exhibited.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07011841000792">As for the public, according to Ipsos MORI, people believe that ASBOs are effective in showing the local community that something is being done about antisocial behaviour, with a positive rating of plus 18 per cent. The rating slumps to minus 7 per cent. when people are asked whether they think that ASBOs stop people engaging in antisocial behaviour. This is a case of presentation over delivery. The upshot of all this is that, having introduced a toolkit of sanctions, the Home Office does not know exactly what works, when it works or why it works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07011841000793">There has been some discussion about whether the ASBO has become a badge of honour among certain groups. It certainly seems as though the breach rate for ASBOs has become a badge of honour for the Home Office. The rate has become higher and higher, with the National Audit Office putting the figure at 55 per cent. and some studies suggesting that it is topping 60 per cent. We are now told by the Home Office that that is to be viewed as some kind of measure of success, on the basis that ASBOs are being enforced. That is absurd logic, even for the Home Office. It shows that  <br>

ASBOs are ineffective in getting the offender to change their behaviour, and that they are being breached. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether, if that analysis is to be followed through, he would welcome a further jump in the breach rate next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07011841000794">It is not just the antisocial behaviour order that has run into problems. Other key parts of the Respect action plan have also been derailed. The Government&#146;s manifesto commitment to increase the numbers of police community support officers to 24,000 by 2008 to &#147;revolutionise policing&#148; in our communities has been slashed by 8,000, as we have heard from many hon. Members today. The national single non-emergency number intended to be available across England and Wales by next year is now to be subject to an evaluation review towards the end of this year, despite apparently being a key part of the Respect drive. In the recent national community safety plan update, the Home Office gave itself a green traffic light on this issue. In fact, it looks as though the traffic light is firmly stuck on red.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07011841000795">More generally, one of the worrying aspects of the Government&#146;s approach is the conflation of antisocial behaviour and crime. The concept of antisocial behaviour is subjective and has been used to cover a wide range of issues including selfish or thoughtless behaviour, nuisance and crime. That has caused a damaging erosion of what is viewed as a crime. That sends out a wider message, and there are parallels with the Government&#146;s proposals to use fines rather than community punishments. The response of the judiciary to that proposal has direct relevance to the debate on the cross-over between antisocial behaviour and crime. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07011841000796">In response to the consultation on community punishments, the Council of Her Majesty&#146;s Circuit Court Judges was quoted in the press as saying:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07011841000797">There is a clear point of distinction between the desire for speedier, more efficient justice and the erosion of the concept of criminality. Summary justice does not mean soft justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07011841000798">We believe that it is right to hold individuals to account, to hold them responsible for their actions and to punish them when they break the law, but if we do not tackle the underlying causes of crime and disorder we will never have safer communities and safer neighbourhoods. There is a shared responsibility between the Government, local government, other public agencies, social entrepreneurs and the communities themselves to tackle the fundamental matters of family breakdown, mental health issues, drug dependency, and a lack of educational achievement, opportunity and hope&#151;all of which can act as contributory factors to antisocial and criminal behaviour for so many people.</p>

As various hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber have said, antisocial behaviour affects all our constituents and is of real concern to many. I join the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)&#151;who was here instead of in Committee this afternoon&#151;in congratulating all Members who have contributed to the quality of the debate. People outside will be pleased by the generally constructive nature of the debate&#151;although differences of view were expressed&#151;which will make an important contribution to tackling a real concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07011841000801">I intend to make some general comments, then to respond to individual Members&#146; contributions, and finally to say something about the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para28"><a name="07011841000802">I want to emphasise an extremely important point made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch and a couple of others. Much of today&#146;s debate has focused on yobbish behaviour and on the minority of young people in our communities who cause a criminal, antisocial problem, which drives people in many parts of the country to despair. Nobody can condone, in any sense, such behaviour. As hon. Members have said, however, we are talking about a minority of young people. We are not talking about the majority of young people, who are growing up in difficult times and, in many cases, caring for others, raising money for charity and making all sorts of wonderful contributions to their communities. It behoves us to ensure that the message that goes out from this Chamber is that, yes, we want to clamp down on the irresponsible and criminal minority, but we recognise that the vast majority of young people in this country are a credit to their communities and their families. That is an important point on which to start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para29"><a name="07011841000803">It is often thought that it is parliamentarians, the older generation or people who are somehow not in touch who want antisocial behaviour to be dealt with. However, when I go and speak to young people&#151;I am sure that many hon. Members, and many of my hon. Friends, have the same experience&#151;I find that it is young people themselves who are demanding that we do something about it. By and large, young people are much more likely to be the victims of crime or antisocial behaviour, to have their mobile phone taken, to be the victims of irresponsible drinking, to be mugged on the street, to have their bag stolen and to be intimidated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para30"><a name="07011841000804">Let us be clear: this is not a debate about out-of-touch parliamentarians or older people lecturing younger people about the way that they should live, or about some mythical age, which, if only we could return to it, would make everything better. It is about a demand from every section of the community, young and old, that we do something about the problems that exist. Young people want that as much as anyone else. That is also an important message to get across.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para31"><a name="07011841000805">Partnership is key to tackling antisocial behaviour, in any area. A strong partnership must be based on a strong police service and police force. As neighbourhood policing and issues relating to police officers have been mentioned, it would be helpful to run through some statistics. On a like-for-like basis, Government grants and central spending to help the police service in England and Wales tackle antisocial behaviour will have increased from &#163;6.2 billion in 1997-98 to &#163;11 billion in 2007-08. That is a cash increase of nearly &#163;4.8 billion, or 77 per cent. In real terms, there has been an increase of more than 39 per cent. between 1997-98 and 2007-08. We can debate the level of resources, but all Members should acknowledge that there has been a substantial increase. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para32"><a name="07011841000806">By the time recruitment has finished, there will be an additional 16,000 police community support officers&#151;because, obviously, there were none before&#151;and more than 14,000 additional police officers. There will be more specials, and a 35 per reduction in crime. There will be more than 20,000 additional civilian posts, which themselves make an important contribution to ensuring that we have police on our streets. However, we must ensure that we give our police the powers that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para33"><a name="07011841000807">The Government have listened to what communities and voluntary organisations have told us. We have listened to what has been said about what we know to be problems in our communities. Having listened, we have introduced a number of measures that have made a significant difference and provided additional powers. We have introduced parenting orders to deal with problem families. Antisocial behaviour orders&#151;about which I shall say more shortly&#151;have made a significant contribution to the tackling of antisocial behaviour in many areas, although I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) that it would be helpful if there were more individual support orders, which are intended to help those with antisocial behaviour problems. Powers have been introduced which have led to the closure of more than 500 crack houses across the country. The Government introduced those powers to deal with a very real problem that many of us have encountered in our communities. Mini-motos are illegal on the streets without proper licensing, and we need to remind people of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para34"><a name="07011841000808">The lesson of all those measures is that&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) pointed out&#151;when people work in partnership real change happens, and real differences can be made in the tackling of crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70118-0019.htm_para35"><a name="07011841000809">I agree with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) and others that it is not just a question of giving the police and law enforcement authorities more powers. We must try to tackle some of the problems in our communities, along with their causes. Some may complain that the Government have not done enough, or that action in certain policy areas has not been as effective as it might have been. However, the Government have spent enormous sums on working with communities to try to challenge some of the causes of antisocial behaviour in each and every community, and in society as a whole.</p>

Money has been invested in work with our teachers to provide good schools in some of our most difficult areas, on tackling truancy by encouraging people to attend school, and on raising standards and expectations. There have also been huge increases in parental support. People felt at first that Sure Start was a &#147;nanny state&#148; idea that would interfere with families, but the children&#146;s centres that have resulted from it represent a major attempt to help some of the poorest and most dysfunctional families in society. We as a Government should be proud of that. Every Member with a children&#146;s centre in his constituency will visit it, and will tell people how good the centres are and what a difference they have made to those who use and work in them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70118-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07011841000811">Alongside all those measures are diversionary tactics&#151;projects such as Positive Futures, intended to divert young people from crime&#151;and the most difficult project of all, trying to restore respect. A question that confronts us all and does not, I think, divide us is &#147;How do we pass a law saying that people must respect one another?&#148; There is a debate to be had about how we can restore respect for each other in our communities to make society function more effectively. The Government&#146;s Respect taskforce is a good example of the way in which we have wrestled with what everyone recognises as a real issue in communities. That is not the draconian, fascist-type of authority that it is often caricatured as; it is about having respect for the police, for teachers and for parents. People tell us that they feel that respect for such legitimate authority is missing. The work that is being done by the Respect taskforce, local authorities, MPs and the Government is part of the agenda of trying to restore that. Although we want to introduce new laws and we are trying to do many other things, we will only succeed in tackling antisocial behaviour if we manage to restore respect in our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70118-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07011841000812">My opening remarks have not been as brief as I had hoped, and although I cannot do justice to the contributions of every Member who spoke, let me pick up on a few of the points that were made. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs made an important point on PCSO numbers. The reason why there is flexibility in the budgets is not to do with the Government; it is because the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers have asked for that flexibility. Let me quote from their press release:</p>
<a name="70118-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="07011841000874"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are pleased that the Government has listened to the case, made by the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers, for greater flexibilities and freedoms in determining the ways that policing is provided to local people.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70118-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07011841000813">I know that the Conservative party is looking at its policy agenda. One of the things it is looking at is local decision making. One of the consequences of that is that sometimes decisions are made locally that are difficult nationally. However, if we are to have local decision making and flexibility, we must mean it. We have tried to respond to what we were asked to do in a way that protects policing but gives that flexibility in respect of local services. We gave flexibility to local services to determine how to spend the funds.</p>

I also welcome the conversion of the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) to the need for police community support officers. However, we noted that the Liberal Democrats remain opposed to dispersal powers. In communities throughout the country, dispersal powers are an effective tool in tackling antisocial behaviour. Let me make a party-political point: I hope that the hon.

I commend him on the community leadership he has shown in trying to ensure that the powers that are available to local councils and local people are used.

Sadly, it is not the first time that I have had to complain in this Chamber about the services from First Great Western and the problems of the deteriorating train service. To put it in a nutshell, there are not enough fast and semi-fast services for my constituents in Maidenhead and Twyford, or at the branch-line stations of Furze Platt, Cookham and Wargrave. They are suffering considerable delays and cancellations, the service has become less reliable in recent months&#151;it was by no means perfect previously&#151;and they are now suffering chronic overcrowding on the key trains that take commuters into and from London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70118-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07011844000009">Such problems have led the <i> Maidenhead Advertiser</i>, following the introduction in December of the new timetable, to state the following:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="70118-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07011844000011">I have mentioned the stations in my constituency. Many of my constituents commute to London or to Reading and the west using those train services. Although Maidenhead is only a 45-minute drive from London, they want to use the trains and are committed to using them, but sadly, in recent years the service has deteriorated. There are companies that situated their headquarters in my constituency because the train service to and from London was good, and because there were other good transport links in the local area. So this is an important issue for Maidenhead&#146;s economy, but it is also important for the economy of the wider Thames valley. If those companies move out, it is not only we in Maidenhead who will lose jobs and local economic vibrancy; the surrounding area, the south-east and the country as a whole will be affected. </p>

We used to have a very good train service, run by Thames Trains, and the franchise for our local commuter services was different from that for the long-distance services. Sadly, the Government and the Strategic Rail Authority chose to merge the franchises in 2004, and in 2005 they announced that, as from last April, First Great Western would be granted the merged franchise for nine years, with a possible extension for a further three years. Since then&#151;since First Great Western took the service over&#151;it has been deteriorating year on year.</p>

constituents of mine who were concerned, worried and appalled by the train service, and who wanted the Government and FGW to take some action to improve it. Those 2,500 people were telling FGW that the timetable that it proposed to introduce in December 2006 would not work and would cause them considerable problems.

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07011844000034">I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.

I hope too that they will act to ensure that my constituents see immediate improvements, rather than years of a deteriorating service. They need a decent train service, with good numbers of fast and semi-fast trains that are not constantly delayed or cancelled. In addition, overcrowding needs to be reduced so that passengers can get to work in reasonable comfort. In that way, they will be able to deliver the economic value for the country that is their objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07011844000038">The current franchise system is delivering. More than 1 billion passenger journeys were made last year&#151;40 per cent. more than 10 years ago. Britain&#146;s railways are the fastest growing in Europe, and that strong growth is expected to continue. The Government intend to support the growth on Britain&#146;s railways by spending an average of &#163;88 million a week on the network. Network Rail has embarked on a nationwide infrastructure renewals programme, worth more than &#163;2 billion a year. Thanks to investment from the public and private sectors, Britain has one of the youngest train fleets in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07011844000039">Increased investment in such initiatives as integrated control centres has improved punctuality to pre-Hatfield levels. On average across the country, more than 85 per cent. of trains have run on time over the past 12 months, as measured by the industry-standard public performance measure&#151;the PPM. Further improvements are targeted for March 2008.</p>

Friend paints is true nationally, but I must advise him that that national improvement is not reflected on commuter lines throughout the whole First Great Western franchise. Our services, which are critical to Britain&#146;s economy, are later, with more delays and more overcrowding, so I hope that he will use his powers to remedy that situation.</p>

First Great Western&#146;s performance has been below the national level.

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07011844000042">Statistics tell only part of the story, however.

biggest issue is capacity. That is why the Government will publish a high-level output specification in July, in which we shall explain exactly the outputs we require from the industry in terms of capacity and other factors, as well as how much money is available to pay for those outputs. That is in addition to the commitments we have received from various franchise operators, including FGW, about additional rolling stock. On infrastructure, I hope that we shall see progress on the Crossrail and Thameslink projects, both of which are vital if we are to improve the capacity of the rail industry.</p>

Lady&#146;s ire, and because we are not likely to agree on it. My own and the Government&#146;s position is that Crossrail will provide a vital infrastructure link to the capital and to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07011844000048">First Great Western, Network Rail and the other train operators who operate in the FGW franchise area&#151;including the freight train companies&#151;all have an important part to play. Under the new franchise, First Great Western is committed to spending substantial sums of money on improving the reliability of the whole of its train fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07011844000049">High-speed trains, which the right hon. Lady mentioned, are receiving new engines, other reliability modifications to the power cars and upgrades to the passenger coaches. Twenty-two re-engined high-speed train power cars are already in service in the franchise area, and I understand from FGW that they are proving to be very much more reliable than the older engines&#151;and much more environmentally friendly. Only yesterday, I had the opportunity to see the first fully redesigned and refurbished high-speed train to enter service. It has two re-engined power cars and new-look passenger coaches. Its engines are also more efficient as they use 15 per cent. less fuel than their predecessors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07011844000050">As the right hon. Lady mentioned, the First Great Western franchise is not just about longer distance services. FGW&#146;s services in the Thames valley, including those stopping at Maidenhead and Twyford, are another very important part of the franchise. They serve the needs of commuters and other passengers to London and to other towns and cities in the area, including such key regional centres as Reading and Slough. The lines to Marlow and Henley-on-Thames also form an important part of that transport system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07011844000051">I should therefore like to confirm that the new franchise also commits First Great Western to a series of reliability modifications to the turbo trains used on most of the Thames valley services. Additionally, FGW is committed to funding line speed improvements on the slower relief lines between Reading and London Paddington. Network Rail is also working hard to improve performance in that area and it is undertaking a very large amount of work to that end. In particular,  <br>

it is renewing and improving its infrastructure across the whole area on which FGW operates train services. That covers track, signalling systems and civil engineering structures such as bridges and embankments. I meet Network Rail on a regular basis to discuss performance on the network. I know that all the train operators in the area meet on a regular basis with Network Rail and that plans are in place to reduce the levels of delay that they cause each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07011844000052">I have placed particular emphasis on performance because I know how important it is to passengers in the Maidenhead and Twyford areas. The new franchise agreement also brings other significant investments and improvements to FGW&#146;s passenger facilities. In particular, FGW has committed to a widespread programme of station improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07011844000053">I would like to say a few words about timetables. The First Great Western main line serves a number of different markets, including travel from stations such as Maidenhead and Twyford, longer distance passenger traffic and heavy freight trains. Demand in all those markets has grown steadily, so I am sure that the right hon. Lady would agree that creating a timetable that meets each of those needs is a significant challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70118-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07011844000054">First Great Western introduced a new timetable on 10 December 2006. The timetable is based on the Department for Transport&#146;s specification included in the franchise agreement. May I say at this point that the right hon. Lady may have been misled in that the Department for Transport&#151;and the Strategic Rail Authority before it&#151;did not and does not specify timetables? The minimum specification and service level commitment do not specify timetables. The writing of timetables is up to Network Rail and the train operating company.</p>

Around that, First Great Western will decide on the precise times for the timetable. The real problem for my constituents&#151;and, I suspect, for those of the hon. Member for Slough&#151;is that the majority of services now go on the slow relief line rather than on the fast main line. The Government and First Great Western could solve many of the problems for my constituents if more of those services from Maidenhead and Twyford went back on to the fast main line. It is the specification for the overall service that has led First Great Western to put them on the slow relief line. Put them back on the main line and then we could be satisfied with a better service.</p>

It seems to believe that all rail services, everywhere in Great Britain, should be decided by train operating companies at the behest of the open market.

specification and the timetable implemented by First Great Western. I look to First Great Western, as I do to all train operators, to listen to its passengers and stakeholders and to make changes to meet their needs.
