<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51201-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson): </b> 
 The Government already encourage microgeneration in a variety of ways. For example, there is a 5&nbsp;per cent. VAT level on most microgeneration technologies. We have provided &#163;41&nbsp;million of support for solar photovoltaic projects through the major PV demonstration programme and support for field trials. There is &#163;12.5&nbsp;million of support for household and community renewable energy schemes through the clear&nbsp;skies initiative; and &#163;30&nbsp;million of funding for a new low carbon buildings programme. We have also amended the renewables obligation to make it easier for microgenerators to claim renewables obligations certificates.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">My Department is leading the development of a cross-Government strategy for the promotion of microgeneration. This strategy will be published by next April, in accordance with our commitment under the Energy Act 2004.

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">In relation to clear skies, I expect that all funding will be allocated by the time the programme ends in March 2006, but projects will have a further 12&nbsp;months to be completed and actually to spend the money.

<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51201-01_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 Despite the warm words of the Secretary of State, it is still clear that the take-up of microgeneration is minimal and that the market for it is still very underdeveloped. Will the right hon. Gentleman consider, in assessing the upcoming energy review, how, if the Government decide to go down the nuclear route, they will ensure that the nuclear industry does not

 Order. Perhaps this is a matter for an Adjournment Debate. That would seem to be appropriate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51201-01_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Lady&#039;s assessment that microgeneration is underdeveloped. Some of the reasons for that will be dealt with in our strategy, which we will publish next April. Much of it is about public awareness, some of it is about problems with planning and some of it is about connection with the grid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">As for the hon. Lady&#039;s question about nuclear energy, if the energy review went down that path, I do not think&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it would have any impact on the need to develop this particular area of microgeneration. Microgeneration is important in its own right, whatever we do in the rest of the energy mix.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51201-01_spnew3"><b> Colin Challen: </b> 
 This being the season of good will and festive cheer, as well as reviews, will my right hon. Friend review the amount of money put into the low carbon building initiative, which year on year is quite a bit less than what was put into the programmes that it replaces? If my right hon. Friend is looking for somewhere to get the money, may I suggest that he dips into his Department&#039;s nuclear fusion research money, which is considerably more than that being given to the low carbon buildings initiative?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51201-01_spnew4"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I suppose that as it is 1&nbsp;December we can officially say that it is the season of good will, but it is not the season of distorting our figures&#151;<i>[Interruption]&#151;</i>as every other season of the year. My hon. Friend is wrong about this. I understand how passionately he feels about the matter, particularly photovoltaics. On average, under the low carbon buildings programme we shall be spending &#163;9.5&nbsp;million a year compared with &#163;9.2&nbsp;million average yearly spend since 2000&nbsp;under the previous project. We have not diluted the amount of money that we are making available, although the use of grants is not the total picture in terms of how we can encourage greater use of microgeneration.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51201-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</b> 
 (PC): From the Secretary of State&#039;s earlier responses it is obvious that he has recognised the true potential of micro-combined heat and power generation. Has he seen the recent report of the Society of British Gas Industries, which clearly shows that micro-CHP could, by 2015, generate enough power to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.1&nbsp;million tonnes per annum? Will the right hon. Gentleman take urgent action to ensure that the right regulatory framework is in place to enable that to happen?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51201-01_spnew6"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I have seen that report, which is an important contribution to our strategy review. That strategy review, to which we made a commitment in the Energy Act 2004, was designed specifically to address these issues. I mentioned planning as a problem earlier. The report is an important contribution to the debate, and it is an area of legitimate concern on both sides of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the House. We will try to ensure that planning regulations do not inhibit the growth of combined heat and power.

<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51201-01_spnew7"><b> Dr. Alan Whitehead  (Southampton, Test)</b> 
 (Lab): I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his Department&#039;s strong support for two private Members&#039; Bills seeking to enhance the use of microgeneration to an enormous extent, one of which was unfortunately blocked by a maverick climate change denier on the Opposition Benches. If that block continues, is it my right hon. Friend&#039;s intention to find Government time to complete those Bills and place them on the statute book?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51201-01_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I reaffirm our support for the private Member&#039;s Bill tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz). As for how we could get around any blockage, that is a subject for others, such as the usual channels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith is present. His Bill contains important principles, and I am sure that it will be supported by Members in all parts of the House. I hope that the person responsible for blocking its passage will remove the blockage; if he does not, we shall have to consider other ways of dealing with it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51201-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex)</b> 
 (Con): The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) asked a pertinent question. It is in the Government&#039;s power to continue to pursue that Bill. Let us see whether they do so, or whether what we are hearing is just rhetoric. I do not support the action of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) in blocking the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers). We have had stop-go policies for the clear skies programme, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been very obstructive in regard to constructive building regulations for microgeneration and micro-CHP, although we know that those processes have enormous potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Why are the Government being so half-hearted about those programmes and that potential? Does their attitude not underline the fact that their entire energy policy is in a mess&#151;which, of course, is why the Secretary of State has to have a review?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51201-01_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 That is nonsense on stilts. On clear skies, we have a go-go policy. There is no gap. There used to be a gap of about four months between money going out and the receiving of, and responses to, bids. In this case there will be a five-month interval&#151;so if there can be said to be a gap, it is a gap of only a month&#151;between the end of the clear skies programme and the start of the new programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_o5">The hon. Gentleman should give some advice to his right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). We shall be able to proceed with that private Member&#039;s Bill if it is not blocked by Conservative Members. I was pleased to hear what the hon. Gentleman said. Why should we delay and lose time? Why should the Government have to rethink the whole programme and go through the usual channels when a quiet word in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s ear might allow us to proceed?

 (Lab): If he will make a statement on the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Hong Kong. [33377]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51201-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan Johnson): </b> 
 Her Majesty&#039;s Government remain committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development outcome at the Hong Kong ministerial conference, which will allow conclusion of the Doha development agenda by the end of 2006. The draft text for the Hong Kong meeting was issued on 26&nbsp;November by Pascal Lamy, the director general of the World Trade Organisation. He will consult Members further before the General Council meeting on 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;December. After that meeting, the text will be submitted for discussion by Ministers in Hong Kong.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51201-01_spnew11"><b> Hugh Bayley: </b> 
 Despite the best efforts of Commissioner Mandelson, the European Union seems to have forgotten that this was meant to be a development round. Will our Government continue to press for overall cuts in European agriculture subsidies under the common agricultural policy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_o6">Is my right hon. Friend aware of the World Bank&#039;s estimate that if only 2&nbsp;per cent. of tariff lines were protected as especially sensitive products, Europeans would be able to protect virtually every product that poor countries want to export to us? Yet under the EU&#039;s predatory policy, 8&nbsp;per cent. fall into that category. Will the Secretary of State ask the EU to reconsider?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51201-01_spnew12"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised an important point. It is difficult not to be pessimistic about our chances of making the progress that we would like to make in Hong Kong. We should have been in a far better position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para7">
<a name="stpa_o7">As my hon. Friend knows, there are now 149&nbsp;countries in the WTO since the recent accession of Saudi Arabia. Each country has a vote and a veto. Our role as President of the European Union is to ensure that the European Union has a coherent voice that Commissioner Mandelson can use during the negotiations. It is a difficult task, but we know where we are in the United Kingdom. I believe that there is all-party support for making this truly a development round.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para8">
<a name="stpa_o8">My hon. Friend made a crucial point about the percentage of sensitive products. Virtually any tariff can be imposed on such products, because they are sensitive to the countries involved. It is not just the World Bank but the United Kingdom, in our trade and development White Paper last year, that said that those should be limited to 2&nbsp;per cent. The American offer is 1&nbsp;per cent. and the European Union offer is 7&nbsp;per cent.&#151;but, to be fair to the Commissioner, I must add that one member state was vociferously arguing for 15&nbsp;per cent. Those are problems, but we have to come through them. It is no good our lecturing other member states; we have to persuade them to go down that route, so that we can achieve a proper outcome to the Doha development round.

<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51201-01_spnew13"><b> Norman Lamb  (North Norfolk)</b> 
 (LD): The Secretary of State has just highlighted the downplaying of expectations for Hong Kong, yet he will recall that the commitment at the G8&nbsp;was for Hong Kong to be a success, not some later ministerial meeting next year, and for Hong Kong to set a date for ending subsidies and dumping. Having just returned from a Christian Aid funded visit to Ghana, I can say that the Government there are desperate to ensure that we end the scandal of dumping subsidised agricultural goods, which destroys their local markets. What precisely are the Government doing to achieve a decisive breakthrough in Europe, and to make the European process more transparent?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51201-01_spnew14"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I am not accusing the hon. Gentleman of making political points, but let us put all the politicising to one side now. We have tried very hard, with all-party support, to use our presidency of the G8&nbsp;and the EU to create some momentum leading up to Hong Kong. I cannot think of any initiative that we could have taken that we have not taken to try to get to that position. The G7&nbsp;Finance Ministers are meeting this weekend, and at the instigation of the UK, Brazil and India will be there, so that the Finance Ministers can try to reach some solution. We were also at the Commonwealth conference last week. No stone has been left unturned as we try to get somewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para9">
<a name="stpa_o9">As for where we are now, and the important point that the hon. Gentleman raised about how we can make more progress, we have been instrumental in the production by the Commission of a development package. By and large, the G90&nbsp;countries&#151;the poorer countries&#151;have not heard anything about their problems yet, because the negotiations have been stuck in an agricultural silo. The idea of a development package is to pick out an issue, such as cotton, or the least developed countries&#039; right to export to all developed countries&#039; markets free of tariffs, which already applies to the EU, but not to the United States and other developed countries. It is also to examine the issue of aid for trade, which is a subset of the WTO discussions, so that there is at least a discussion of the developing countries&#039; agenda, rather than the continual and rather depressing concentration purely on agricultural issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51201-01_spnew15"><b> Ann McKechin  (Glasgow, North)</b> 
 (Lab): In that context, does my right hon. Friend agree that we also need to think about the NAMA&#151;non-agricultural market access&#151;side of the negotiations, and that we need to allow sufficient flexibility in any solution to those negotiations to allow the least developed countries to develop their own industrial bases?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51201-01_spnew16"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. The Commission says that if it is to have any chance of bringing the EU to a different position, not fixated on agriculture, it needs countries such as Brazil and India to start to move on industry. This is about agriculture, industry and services, but so far we have concentrated on agriculture alone. There is now a need for countries to start turning over cards&#151;with conditional offers; they do not have to say that that is their final position&#151;just to show European Union countries that there are huge advantages to be had. Everyone will gain from a

<br>&nbsp;<br>successful conclusion; this is win, win. On industry and services there are huge gains to be made, not between developing and developed countries but among developed countries, if we open markets. My hon. Friend has raised an important point, which is crucial to the successful outcome of the round.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51201-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b> 
 (Con): Only last week we heard about another food crisis in Africa, this time in the republic of Niger. I support emergency aid and debt relief, but we have to move things on with reforms of tariff barriers and export subsidies. Will the Secretary of State ask his friends in the EU this: as the common agricultural policy has driven our farmers to near bankruptcy, made the British housewife pay more for food than she needs to and is damaging the third world, exactly who is it helping?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51201-01_spnew18"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 It would not be all that fruitful if I asked that question. The argument used in the EU is that common agricultural policy reform, in so far as it has already happened&#151;it was a dramatic reform compared with the previous position&#151;should be a bargaining chip at Doha. The rest of the world tends to say, &quot;You would have done that anyway, so how can you argue for the virtue of such reform? You need to go further.&quot; I have to say that the vast majority of EU member states believe that we have gone far enough, and that it is now time for the industry to make a move; I am merely reflecting the views that we pick up on in our EU presidency role. One day there will have to be reform. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs achieved the breakthrough&#151;at last&#151;of a 36&nbsp;per cent. cut in sugar subsidies, which have not been reformed for 40&nbsp;years. So some movement has been secured there, at least, which will help us in Hong Kong.

 (Lab): Will my right hon. Friend consider getting on to the WTO agenda a worldwide asbestos ban? He may be aware that two or three years ago, the United Nations interim chemical review committee, which is part of the environmental programme, recommended that all asbestos be restricted because of dangers to health. However, we seem not to have made progress on this issue, and the way to do so is to get it on to the WTO agenda.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51201-01_spnew20"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I certainly will give consideration to the important issue that my hon. Friend has raised. There is an environmental dimension to this trade round&#151;we have got nowhere near talking about it yet&#151;just as there is a trade facilitation aspect. Because we have got bogged down in considering a particular pillar of agriculture, we have not got on to these important issues, but I will turn my mind to how we can ensure that progress has been made on asbestos by the end of this round.

<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51201-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. David Willetts  (Havant)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State accept that the European Union&#039;s agricultural tariffs are economic nonsense and morally indefensible? Is that not the starting-point that we should adopt as we go into the next round of the trade negotiations? I was very disappointed to discover that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 371</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>he is so pessimistic about the outcome. Why do we not enter into the negotiations in two weeks&#039; time committed to removing the EU&#039;s agricultural tariffs? That is the single most positive thing that we could do to help the third world. Surely our presidency of the EU should not be about neutrality and chairmanship, but leadership.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51201-01_spnew22"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 On the first question, I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman; indeed, my predecessor made that point in last year&#039;s White Paper on trade and development. We pointed out the hypocrisy of developed countries lecturing developing countries on removing their trade barriers, when we still hide behind protectionism, so we are sending out a very strong message. Developed countries have to dismantle protectionist policies and set a date&#151;we think that it should be 2010&#151;for the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidy in agriculture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para10">
<a name="stpa_o10">On the question of negotiating a settlement, the gung-ho part of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Havant constituency seems to have come to the fore; usually, he takes a thoughtful and reflective approach to these issues. Conservative Members will know, because their party held the EU presidency when in government, that the worst mistake that countries can make when holding the presidency is to push their own position from the presidential chair. If they do, nobody will follow them. Instead, they have to try to persuade other member states to their point of view. Lecturing the rest of Europe from the presidential chair and repeatedly telling them about the UK&#039;s position would be a disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-01_para11">
<a name="stpa_o11">On the question of my being pessimistic, we will move mountains, as the Prime Minister said in his recent Guildhall speech. However, as I said in my first answer, the text has just been released&#151;it should have been released last July&#151;and it would be misleading, going into the Hong Kong meeting, to say that we are wildly optimistic. Of course, that does not mean that we should not complete this round successfully by the end of 2006. What it does mean is that we have to make a sober appraisal of where we are, and plan to ensure that this round is brought to a successful conclusion.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51201-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 May I press the Secretary of State on this matter? Since enlargement, a blocking minority of free-trade countries has existed in the EU. That is how the world has changed. I do not know why the EU still does things like imposing tariffs on Chinese textiles, when it should be organising the free traders. The Trade Commissioner will play a crucial role, so will the right hon. Gentleman have a word in his ear? Has the Secretary of State learned to love the commissioner yet? Will he tell him that Opposition Members could find a tiny place in our hearts for him if he went to Hong Kong committed to free trade?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51201-01_spnew24"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 There is love abounding in my heart for the Trade Commissioner, and there always has been. When it comes to his role, he must not be seen as a UK Commissioner. That is part of the problem: people who are a little paranoid about these matters see that the UK position is one of liberalisation, that the UK holds the presidency and that a UK national is Trade Commissioner. We&#151;and the commissioner more than anyone else&#151;must ensure that everyone has faith in our

I think that it is inevitable that that regime will change, and that we have enough support to achieve that gradually. We do not have enough support to achieve it in time for Hong Kong, but I believe that we can bring the matter to a successful conclusion by the end of 2006.

 (Lab/Co-op): The Minister knows that financial inclusion is one way for people to get out of the hands of unscrupulous lenders, and that the Treasury Select Committee has set up an inquiry into financial exclusion to which he will be invited in the new year. However, there is poor co-ordination between Government Departments on this matter. For instance, research information about postcodes for financial inclusion is available to the Treasury and the DTI, but not to the Select Committee. Will he work with his colleagues in the Treasury to ensure that we get that information before the inquiry begins, so that a map can be made of the areas of financial exclusion?

 (Con): Even at this late stage, will the Minister reconsider his refusal to include more detail in the Consumer Credit Bill about what would constitute an unfair relationship? Is he not aware that both lenders and consumer groups are calling for greater clarity? Their concern is that as the Bill stands, it will harm the interests of borrowers. Without greater detail, lenders will become more cautious in their lending, driving those on the fringe to borrow from unscrupulous lenders or loan sharks at excessive rates of interest. Is not it wholly unreasonable to expect such issues to be resolved through the courts, requiring some unfortunate borrower to take on the legal might of the financial institutions to establish what is fair and what is not?

 This is an issue that the hon. Gentleman and I have discussed throughout the stages of the Consumer Credit Bill, and I am not minded to change my mind on the unfairness test. That test replaces the extortionate credit test, which did not work for consumers. The unfairness test will give the courts the opportunity to decide all relevant factors. We also have the alternative dispute resolution procedure before the court-based system. Transparency is at the heart of the Bill to ensure that lenders and consumers know what they are letting themselves in for.

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised that important question, because 97&nbsp;per cent. of benefit recipients now access their payments by direct payment into their bank account.

Way back in 1999, a dramatic change had already started in the number of people who received their benefits by other means. Because of the new facilities available to them&#151;internet banking and so on&#151;our constituents have chosen different methods to access their own finances and the Government have responded to that. In 2000, about 70&nbsp;per cent. of all benefits were paid by order book, but that proportion had already fallen to 57&nbsp;per cent. by 2003, when the direct payment scheme was launched.

Considerable progress has been made and the pay gap now is 17&nbsp;per cent. on average, but down to 13&nbsp;per cent. at the median. In the Equality Bill we are introducing a public sector duty to promote equality in various ways, including in pay. The work that will be done on pay will begin to make a difference, but it is only one aspect that we are considering. As I said, the local government pay and work force strategy addresses the causes and effects of occupational segregation, which we know is one of the main drivers of the gender pay gap.

<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="51201-04_spnew8"><b> Barbara Keeley  (Worsley)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that the measures in the Equality Bill and the new commission for equality and human rights, with its main site to be based in Manchester, will help greatly in the work to close the pay gap for women in the public sector? Will she welcome the news that Salford council has just appointed a woman chief executive?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o77"><a name="51201-04_spnew9"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I certainly welcome the news that Salford council has just appointed a chief executive who is a woman. One of the key issues about the pay gap in the public sector is not that there are not many women working in the public sector&#151;there are. The issue is the level of responsibility that they have and their position within the organisation. We are making progress on that, but we want to see much more progress made. The Equality Bill is one measure which will deal with that. We also have the Women and Work commission, which goes much wider than the public sector and will report next month on related issues. I hope that will take us a great deal further.

<p><a name="st_o78"><a name="51201-04_spnew10"><b> Michael Gove  (Surrey Heath)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister will be aware that one of the things the Government can do to ensure gender equality at the very top is to increase the number of women who occupy senior management posts in the civil service. The increase in the number of women in senior management posts over the past two years has been only 1.6&nbsp;per cent., yet the Government have a target of increasing that number by 5&nbsp;per cent. in the next three years. Can the Minister explain what measures she will use to achieve that target, and what the Prime Minister is doing to ensure that at Permanent Secretary level there is the representation of women that the country deserves?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o79"><a name="51201-04_spnew11"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman shares my and my party&#039;s concern that we should have more women in top positions. We should celebrate the existence of tough targets rather than fearing them. Implementing a range of measures to reach those targets is enormously important, and we expect all Departments to consider the issue. Fast-stream measures have been implemented to help talented people of both genders to move through the system. I am sure that improvements will be made very quickly and hope that I can report such progress in the future.

 (Lab): What steps the Government are taking to tackle women&#039;s pension inequality. [33394]


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 382</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a name="st_o80"><a name="51201-04_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Women  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 Earlier this month, we published the report &quot;Women and Pensions: The Evidence&quot;. The evidence tells us that men and women will reach the age of 65&nbsp;with similar basic state pensions by 2025, when the average entitlement to a full basic state pension among both sexes will be more than 90&nbsp;per cent. That is marked progress on the present situation and reflects the greater number of women in work. We will consider that evidence together, obviously, with the recommendations of Adair Turner&#039;s Pensions Commission to ensure that our policy proposals lead to fairer outcomes for women.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o81"><a name="51201-04_spnew12"><b> Lynda Waltho: </b> 
 As my right hon. Friend knows, women make up two thirds of pensioners, but their income in retirement is less than two thirds of that of men. Indeed, recent Department for Work and Pensions figures show that 2.2&nbsp;million women do not qualify for a basic state pension. In the light of yesterday&#039;s Turner report and with tomorrow being carers&#039; rights day, will she go further and confirm that the Government will closely examine the Turner recommendations to make sure that we deliver a pensions system that finally offers everyone the chance of a decent income in retirement, recognising that if we get it right for women, we get it right for everybody?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="51201-04_spnew13"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for the way in which she has campaigned to focus attention on the issue. I am sure that she welcomes the fact that 1.9&nbsp;million female carers have been helped by the second state pension and that 63&nbsp;per cent. of the 5.8&nbsp;million low earners who benefit are female.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o83"><a name="51201-04_spnew14"><b> Sandra Gidley  (Romsey)</b> 
 (LD): The Minister will be aware that the Turner report includes the recommendation that women over 75&nbsp;should receive a full pension. Although that recommendation is welcome, does she agree that she would be better advised to consider the Liberal Democrat proposal of a citizens pension for all women of retirement age?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="51201-04_spnew15"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 It is always worth, albeit briefly, considering a Liberal Democrat proposal. The position of women over 75&nbsp;will be a material consideration in deciding how to take forward the recommendations in Lord Turner&#039;s report.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="51201-04_spnew16"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the percentage of women coming into work has reached a plateau? If we are to achieve a successful economy and get the next surge of women entering the marketplace and becoming productive members of our community, we need a package for women that encompasses not only pensions, but pay and child care.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="51201-04_spnew17"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 If one considers full time and part time, the number of women entering work is actually increasing. My hon. Friend is right that if we are to see a sustained increase in the number of women who choose to return to work, it is important to ensure the implementation of child care and other measures that promote the flexibility that women need, if they are to combine looking after a family with being at work.

 (Con): I agree with the Minister that this is very important. I welcome what Lord Turner said yesterday, especially his particular attention to women and his stressing of the importance of flexibility for parents and carers in the work force and thereby in the provision of pensions. Unfortunately, however, the right hon. Lady will not take these decisions. She appreciates the difficulties of millions of women, but the Chancellor&#151;
</p>

 What will the right hon. Lady do to make the Chancellor see sense in this respect so that he appreciates the problem, stops rubbishing the Turner report, and does something for women pensioners?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="51201-04_spnew21"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 The position was clearly set out yesterday by the Prime Minister and the Work and Pensions Secretary. We will consider the Turner recommendations as a Government. We will take account of the pressing importance of meeting the needs 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 384</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of women, in particular, that arise from the necessity for flexibility in the currently inflexible pensions system, and ensure that we have a set of proposals for women that are sustainable. These decisions will be taken by the whole Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="51201-04_spnew22"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b> 
 (Lab): In a forum on women&#039;s pensions that was organised in early November in Milton Keynes with my local chamber of commerce, the view was strongly expressed that there needs to be a universal basic state pension available on the basis of residence, as suggested by Turner, if women are to benefit in future. Will my right hon. Friend take that message forward very strongly to her fellow Ministers to ensure that that is incorporated?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="51201-04_spnew23"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That aspect of Turner&#039;s recommendations is potentially particularly beneficial to women. It is one of the proposals that will be looked at very closely because of the importance of securing a pensions settlement that recognises the age-old inequality of the system in relation to women.

<a name="stpa_15">Does the Deputy Leader of the House realise how angry Members on both sides of the House are that the Government have again published another week&#039;s business and there is still no sign of the reinstatement of the debate on police reforms, even though there are several days on which business is light? The deadline for forces to submit their plans for merger with their neighbours is 23&nbsp;December.

<a name="51201-05_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">One way of making time would be to postpone the Second Reading of the Armed Forces Bill until January.

Ministers have had months to prepare and it is not right that the Government are now planning to rush the measure through when the Opposition and those interested in it have had so little time to consider it. It is a 250-page Bill and, as yet, there are no explanatory notes for one of the most complex measures in the Session. It is not acceptable to rush it through.

 Could my hon. Friend reassure me that the foundations of Government policy continue to include social justice and economic sustainability?

That will be enormously expensive&#151;the cost will be greater than the Government anticipate. Will my hon.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point.

The proposal to which he refers is a worthwhile one, which has commanded a lot of support, and it will be yet another way of ensuring that people can provide for their pensions.

 I think that I have made it clear that there is not likely to be a debate on the Floor of the House before Christmas, and also that the consultation period will be extended for a further four months in those areas where agreement has not been reached. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, who addressed Members in the Westminster Hall debate, has made it clear that she is willing to talk to individual Members, as well as police forces, who have concerns. The consultation period has not yet ended. There are another three weeks for Members and others to make their views clear, so it seems inappropriate to hold a debate now when the consultation period has not finished.

Every Member will be aware of the lives that have been transformed since 2000&nbsp;with the introduction of the current cancer plan, which put cancer at the heart of the Government&#039;s health policy. Indeed, we have cut death rates for breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men faster than anywhere else in the world and, with the 1,177&nbsp;more cancer specialists, we intend to cut cancer mortality further.

 The Deputy Leader of the House will know that yesterday the Home Office slipped out a new policy on the levels of possession of class A drugs, which will constitute the crime of possession with intent to supply.

 A consultation document was published on Wednesday. It reflected measures that were called for by the police to set supply thresholds to eliminate any inconsistencies between police forces in catching and prosecuting drug dealers. It removes the excuse used by dealers that their drugs are for personal use only. The House will want to know that there have been record seizures of class A drugs in recent times. I am sure that this will be a subject of continuing debate and discussion within the House. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman is supporting what the police were calling for.

 What is the future of the hapless Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, which would effectively give an amnesty to terrorists on the run, bearing in mind that every party in Northern Ireland is opposed to this legislation with the exception of Sinn Fein? It should also be borne in mind that every person who spoke at the meeting of the British-Irish parliamentary body, which met at Edinburgh on Monday, from both north and south of the border was opposed to the legislation. Only one Government Back-Bench Member supported it during the debate. Is it not time that it was knocked on the head completely? It is very bad legislation.

 Following the comments of the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) on the Black Watch, I am sure that my hon. Friend will be aware of the high profile of that issue in my constituency. My grandfather, Hugh MacDonald, served in the Black Watch, and is buried in the military cemetery in Gibraltar, where he died in 1941. I believe that one of the concessions made to the Scottish regiments during the merger process was that they would retain the right to their identity via the right to wear the cap badge at all times. Obviously, in the case of the Black Watch that means the red hackle. Will my hon. Friend use his good offices to ask the armed forces Minister to intervene to allow the Black Watch and the other Scottish regiments at least to retain their identity?

 Those guidelines constitute arrangements made under criminal justice legislation. Previous offenders were in the community with no oversight at all for a substantial part of their sentence. It is important that a more onerous regime for offenders be introduced, so that if they breach licence conditions, they can go back to jail. The problem that the hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We are dealing here with a very important piece of legislation, but it is not freestanding and does not introduce a new concept. Instead, it seeks to amend the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which makes that Act very relevant to our debate. I was shocked to be told by the Vote Office that that Act is not available. Therefore, we are being asked to debate a Bill that amends an Act of Parliament, a copy of which is not available for right hon. and hon. Members to peruse. I therefore ask that you consider suspending this sitting until such time as that Act of Parliament is available.
</p>








<p><a name="st_119"><a name="51201-11_spnew23"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I think that we must continue, and I have called Sir Paul Beresford to move his amendment. However, I instruct the officials that copies of the Act must be available for the right hon. Gentleman and any other hon. Member who wishes to see it.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker.

 As you can see, Mr. Speaker, there are many references to the Local Government Finance Act 1992&nbsp;in the Bill before us this afternoon. It is impossible to understand the force of the amendments without seeing the Bill that they amend. Can you give us some 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 407</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>indication of the point in our proceedings, if we must continue, at which we will have a copy of the Act available to us?
</p>








<p><a name="st_127"><a name="51201-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I knew that it was not a point of order. I have instructed officials to make the Act available and when I instruct officials, the House can believe that they move quickly. They will be moving quickly as we speak and I think that the request of right hon. and hon. Members will be met shortly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_128"><a name="51201-12_spnew8"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I am sure that we will be able to limp on without that Act, although I admit that I do not know it word for word. I am honoured to move amendment No. 3, which also stands in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). He intended to be here to support this little amendment on this little Bill. Unfortunately, the Government&#039;s last-minute decision to replace some uncomfortable business with this relatively non-urgent Bill has caused a major conflict in his diary and he is unable to join us. My right hon. Friend and I were both local government Ministers, but I note that my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who was our much more learned Secretary of State, is in his place and will be able to add his support and make a few points to the discomfort of the Government and, perhaps, our Front-Bench colleagues, judging from their response to Second Reading. I am also sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon will be able to find enough time to wheel across and join us in the event of a vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_48">Bearing in mind that council tax and local authority finances are excessively complex and generally dead boring, I must express my surprise and delight at seeing so many fascinated souls in the Chamber eager to join this debate. They are even, for the moment, still awake. The intention of the amendment is quite simple and straightforward. It would enable the Secretary of State to allow, or require, a particular billing authority, a group of adjacent billing authorities, or all billing authorities to carry out valuations for council tax purposes. It is perhaps worth emphasising that because of the nature of the valuations and the banding system that applies.
</p>








<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51201-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 On such matters, my hon. Friend&#039;s voice carries great weight with me, because I know that he has studied the subject long and hard and is an expert on it. However, I am most concerned by the scope and provisions of the amendment. Should it be added to the Bill, what would prevent a malevolent Minister from deciding to order a revaluation just for Conservative-controlled local authorities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_130"><a name="51201-12_spnew10"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 There would have to be some justification for doing so. An order would have to be produced, which could lead to a debate in the House and the opportunity to make points. However, given the trend of local elections, it is conceivable that there could be so many Conservative councils that a Minister had no opportunity to do anything else.
</p>








<p><a name="st_131"><a name="51201-12_spnew11"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 The point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) also 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 408</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>worries me. Were such a malevolent decision to be made by a Minister, could it be subject to judicial review? Does my hon. Friend think that there would be any protection, judicial or otherwise, against such targeted, political action?

<a name="time_3">
<a name="51201-12_time0"><h5>12.45&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51201-12_spnew12"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend answers his own question. In such a situation, a judicial review would be a protection, although I do not really envisage such a situation arising, even if the next local government elections&#151;as I anticipate&#151;result in a clean sweep for the Conservatives and a fall in the number of Liberal and Labour councils. We shall have such a collection of Conservative councils that that situation might be more likely than my right hon. Friend envisages.
</p>








<p><a name="st_133"><a name="51201-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 It is remarkable that it is accepted as completely plausible that a Government might behave in the way suggested. Would my hon. Friend care to reflect on the fact that the Government have already done so in their reallocation of local government finance and the budgets for primary care trusts? Some primary care trusts are under-funded&#151;and not over-spent&#151;because the Government have shifted money from Conservative areas to Labour areas on purpose.
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="51201-12_spnew14"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I agree, and the amendment derives from the point made on Second Reading that it would provide an opportunity to change the way in which the funding formula worked, to make it fairer and restore the balance that existed before the funding formula under which we now suffer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_49">I believe and I hope that you agree, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;the interventions may support the necessity&#151;that it would be appropriate to explain the background to the thinking behind this short amendment. As the House will be aware, on Second Reading, it was explained that the Bill in effect stops the programmed and vastly expensive national revaluation of every home in England to place them within council tax bands. It also gives the Secretary of State, whoever that may be at the time, the power to call for a national revaluation when he or she deems it appropriate, if ever. The whole discussion on revaluation for council tax purposes was questioned during the run-up to the election. Many felt that there was no requirement for a revaluation, and my Conservative colleagues and I numbered in that group.
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51201-12_spnew15"><b> Mr. Quentin Davies: </b> 
 Because we do not have the Act that the Bill will amend before us, it is very difficult to follow even my hon. Friend&#039;s lucid argument. Clause 1&nbsp;states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;A new list must be compiled, in relation to billing authorities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_50">What is that new list? Is it a list of people liable to pay the council tax, or a list of properties, or a list of billing authorities? What is the list that the amendment addresses?
</p>








<p><a name="st_136"><a name="51201-12_spnew16"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I should perhaps have explained that, but I was aware that in doing so I might transgress a little beyond the amendment. The new list is a list of valuations of properties within a billing authority, so 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 409</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they may be put in bands for the redistribution of grant, on the basis of ability to pay, and to determine the amount collected in council tax from the owners of the properties within the billing authority&#039;s boundaries. The Government, especially the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), were emphatic that a national revaluation was required and that, as it was programmed, it should go ahead. Suddenly, post the election&#151;

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51201-12_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to give a brief explanation. I was prepared to allow that, but I will not have another debate effectively on Second Reading. Perhaps just giving a brief background to the amendment will be appropriate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_138"><a name="51201-12_spnew17"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Would you not perhaps concede that a degree of flexibility would be helpful, given that we are struggling, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) has pointed out, because we do not have the originating statute in front of us? Would it not be more appropriate than normal for my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) and perhaps other hon. Members to give more of the background to the amendment and, indeed, to clause 1, given the absence of the originating statute? Would that not be helpful to the House, Madam Deputy Speaker?

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51201-12_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>

<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51201-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Quentin Davies: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am a slightly less experienced Member than my right hon. Friend and I probably know much less about local government finance, but I am trying to make a conscientious effort to participate in the discussion of this matter, which could be important to my constituents. We cannot follow the amendments because we do not have the text of the Act that is being amended. So we depend particularly on the acknowledged expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) to explain the background to and, therefore, the rationale of the amendment to the Government&#039;s proposals to amend an Act that we do not have before us. It would be most helpful to hon. Members in my position if he could be given a little latitude in explaining the background to both the Government&#039;s proposed amendments to the Act and his proposed amendment to the Government&#039;s amendment to the Act.
</p>








<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51201-13_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I do not accept that point of order. The hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) has been given an opportunity to give a brief explanation of the background to the amendment. The hon.

Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), but I am quite sure that he is more than capable of following the debate. The Minister may be able to elucidate a little when he replies.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_51">The Bill relates to a national revaluation, and as I have tried to set out, there is an opportunity for a smaller or minor revaluation in appropriate areas. Interestingly, my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and I are ex-local government Ministers and we have some knowledge of the matter. On Second Reading, I asked the Minister of Communities and Local Government to confirm whether the


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;Bill effectively puts revaluation in limbo, and there might be no revaluation in future if there is a rethink on the grant formula&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_52">The Minister, in effect, confirmed that by saying that the Bill was in keeping with a situation where the Government were leaving their options open and that

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;all options remain open in the future.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7&nbsp;November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 34.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_53">So such a revaluation is conceivable. That caused a bit of a flutter in the dovecotes for the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich&#151;whom I expected to be here today but he is not&#151;because he felt compelled to back his previous position. The hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow), who spoke as an ex-valuer, probably felt a little like a turkey at this time of the year&#151;if not more frequently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_54">Valuation for council tax is different from valuation for rates and business rates in that it essentially serves two purposes. First, it serves a role in the funding formula, as it is used to give an estimate of the ability to pay. As I said on Second Reading, that could be done in different ways. Secondly, it is used to rank properties in valuation bands, thus enabling a billing authority to distribute its council tax charge. As long as that proportion of spread remains the same&#151;generally, that seems to be so&#151;there is no need for a revaluation, especially an expensive national revaluation. However, one can foresee occasions where a national revaluation may not be needed at all for some considerable time but a small local revaluation might be appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_55">The example that most readily comes to mind is that the Government are following previous Conservative Governments in pushing for redevelopment on brownfield land&#151;in particular, the Thames Gateway.

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sorry to raise this issue. I have been carefully following my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford).

This is the first time that I have been following this bit of the argument. May I ask you kindly to allow him to refer to some of those places, so that we can judge whether the amendment is a good one?
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="51201-13_spmin2"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I remind the right hon. Gentleman that he is not chairing the debate&#151;I am&#151;and I have made a ruling.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_146"><a name="51201-13_spnew3"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am trying to set out exactly such an example, but perhaps I strayed a little far in pointing out a particular area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_56">It is conceivable that an area could have a large number of new properties, the valuation of which would be set by their sale price, but that would distort the gradation and, therefore, the proportional spread across the council tax bands of the rest of the authorities in that billing authority&#039;s area or the area covered by a group of billing authorities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="51201-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> 
 If I understand the spirit of the amendment correctly, it would essentially allow a localised revaluation, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all national revaluation process. New clause 1&nbsp;was not selected for debate&#151;in no way do I seek to challenge the decisions on the groupings&#151;but, in spirit, it would have allowed both a top-down power, whereby the Secretary of State could order a revaluation, and a bottom-up request, whereby a group of authorities could come together to seek the Secretary of State&#039;s authorisation of such a revaluation. My hon. Friend may be about to cover that anyway, but will he make it clear whether he believes that amendment No. 3, which is much briefer, would work in both ways and that the bottom-up, as well as the top-down power, should exist?
</p>








<p><a name="st_148"><a name="51201-13_spnew5"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I admit that my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and I tabled new clause 1, but we realised in retrospect that it could have been ruled slightly out of order. If my hon. Friend looks carefully, he will see that the drive of that new clause is, in effect, contained in this much simplified amendment. In fact, the effect is still there.
</p>








<p><a name="st_149"><a name="51201-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 I am afraid that my hon. Friend is not making much headway with me, because I have reached the conclusion that his drafting is defective. The amendment refers to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;a group of adjoining billing authorities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_57">Why must they be adjoining? Would not a better phrase have been &quot;a group of comparable billing authorities&quot;? City centre property values may well rise and a view may be taken that urban authorities, not county authorities, should carry out a revaluation, yet under his wording, they would have to be adjoining billing authorities, not comparable ones.
</p>








<p><a name="st_150"><a name="51201-13_spnew7"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Perhaps that explains why the opportunity to give a broader explanation would have been helpful, because the situation that my right hon. Friend mentions is covered by the amendment, as he will see if he looks very carefully. The amendment covers an individual authority or lots of authorities. I specifically picked the term &quot;adjoining authorities&quot; because I chose as an example&#151;I shall be ruled out of order if I continue with it&#151;the Thames Gateway, which includes a number of authorities to which such circumstances might apply. Given that they are adjoining, it would be appropriate to carry out a revaluation at the same time.

 The Secretary of State would decide. My hon. Friend needs to recognise that if the ability-to-pay assessment in the funding formula were changed&#151;as I mentioned earlier, before I ran the risk of being ruled out of order&#151;the readjustment in a billing authority or in a group of billing authorities would make no difference to the council tax for those properties, unless the local authority&#039;s sum council tax bill for the whole billing authority increased.

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="51201-14_spnew0"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b>

 I, too, have followed closely the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s exposition of the amendment. I understand that if the Local Government Finance Act 1992&nbsp;were to remain in place, there would be a guaranteed revaluation. Indeed, his party&#039;s position coming into the debate was that it wanted the provision for a guaranteed revaluation to stay in place because that was what they voted for. Is it the case that amendment No. 3&nbsp;would mean that the position relative to the 1992&nbsp;Act would change, so it would be an addendum to a Bill that he would then happily support, or does he want it to replace the position in the Bill? Alternatively, does he want to change the policy adopted by his Front Bench for the debate?

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="51201-14_spnew2"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his complex twisting questions and red herrings. I think that he will accept that the Bill changes the situation by removing the programming of revaluation, but allowing the Secretary of State to set the timing for a revaluation&#151;if that ever happens. I thus suggest that there might be an opportunity to save the enormous expense of national revaluation by having local revaluations, if that is appropriate. As the hon.

 Bearing in mind my accent and recent sporting activities in Wales, that is probably a very good thing, Madam Deputy Speaker. I thank my hon. Friend for citing the sort of situation in which a local revaluation might be appropriate.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51201-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Quentin Davies: </b> 
 My hon. Friend argues the case for the law to be changed to permit individual or group revaluation instead of universal revaluation. The Government have already disgracefully spent &#163;60&nbsp;million on preparing for revaluation, although they now say that that might not happen. A general revaluation would be enormously expensive, so perhaps my hon. Friend can indicate how much that would cost. What would be the cost of an individual revaluation for an average authority? Before we agree to allow individual authorities to be revalued, surely we should have an idea of the cost of such a revaluation that the taxpayer would be obliged to bear.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51201-14_spnew8"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Unfortunately, I do not have the figures with me. However, I am sure that the Minister for Local Government, who is smiling at me, has them in his large portfolio and that he will produce them. Presumably, the cost of revaluation for an individual authority or a group of adjoining authorities would be proportionate to the expenditure for a national revaluation. However, I suspect that the Minister will find reasons why a local revaluation would be proportionately much more expensive, if he does not

 This is an interesting debate on an important amendment. The basic architecture of the Bill would put off revaluation. There is little difference between the Opposition and the Government on that.

<a name="stpa_62">Amendment No. 3&nbsp;is simple, but there is a debate to be had on whether the revaluation should be national&#151;for the whole of England&#151;or whether it can be done bit by bit. The amendment states that

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 417</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>revaluation. Within the terms of the amendment, there are several options available in that respect. A regional revaluation would be possible&#151;as we discussed in the Committee, house prices change nationally, regionally and sub-regionally&#151;so that revaluation took place bit by bit. In effect, we have already had a regional revaluation in Wales. Some of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friends arise from the consequences of that revaluation. Revaluation county by county would also be possible: in a large county such as Hampshire, one could get the agreement of all the billing authorities&#151;the districts and boroughs&#151;and produce a revaluation on that basis. It would also be possible on the micro-level, with revaluation only within a district or borough area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_65">Implicit in the amendment are major policy decisions on how to proceed, because council tax is one part of a jigsaw comprising council tax, unified business rate and the Government grant structure. Historically, both Conservative and Labour Governments have set a grant structure once they know what local billing authorities are collecting through council tax and the unified business rate, and various forms of redistribution go on. Members are often unhappy with the grant their area gets from central Government&#151;it is a common theme. I have never heard an hon. Member say, &quot;My local authority has more than sufficient grant,&quot; and it has been argued that the way in which grant is distributed ought to be revisited. A national revaluation, as the Government propose, leaves open the possibility of moving resources between regions and councils, which makes it the logical thing to do from a national policy perspective. My concern about the amendment is that revaluing bit by bit will prevent us from seeing the national picture and making judgments on needs and on particular areas.

 I am beginning to wonder whether I should do as was suggested earlier and give my speech all over again, because that might enable my hon. Friend to follow my argument. As I understand it, the system of valuation, revaluation and council tax banding gives two results. First, there is a distribution ladder within the banding system for redistribution of council tax itself. Secondly, the system is used to assess the ability to pay. I made it clear on Second Reading and very briefly today, in case I got stopped, that that would have to change and that it could be changed into a much fairer system that used Treasury figures on earnings and income tax paid within the billing authority areas.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="51201-15_spnew13"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 I am glad that my hon. Friend has explained that&#151;even though he is straying somewhat from party policy&#151;because it is useful to the debate on amendment No. 3.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_66">A national revaluation enables the setting of national policy objectives on the redistribution of money. That becomes much more difficult if revaluation is conducted on a regional, sub-regional or local authority basis. My fear as one whose county is not treated well by the grant system is that local revaluation might freeze an unjust distribution of the revenue support grant, which is one of the main political elements of that system.

Is he saying this afternoon that because he does not feel particularly warmly disposed towards the amendment tabled by the hon.

 I do not want to stray too far, not because I do not want to answer the hon. Gentleman, but because I want to discuss amendment No. 3. On Second Reading of the Local Government Act 2003&nbsp;the Opposition moved a reasoned amendment. I sat on the Committee which considered that Bill, as did the hon. Gentleman, I think.

 My hon. Friend is very patient. I would hate to shorten his speech, but one of the difficulties with his argument is that he does not recognise a lifeline when one is thrown to him and he is starting to blow bubbles from underwater. He ought to recognise my earlier point that the ability to pay is the second way in which the valuation and the spread of valuation is taken into account for the national distribution, under the Government&#039;s present formula. That would have to change, and it could easily be changed and improved, as I have already suggested three times this afternoon.

 I thank my hon. Friend for putting that again on the record. The Lyons review is examining a range of issues, including banding and alternative ways of raising money via local government. The council tax as we know it may, therefore, not remain in its existing form in the future, particularly when we come to whatever date it may be for a future revaluation. The revaluation that we are putting off today was to have taken place in 2007. If we have a revaluation in 2010&nbsp;or 2011, it may be with wholly different bands, they may be

</p>








<p><a name="st_203"><a name="51201-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 There is no doubt that the cost of a national revaluation is a little under &#163;200&nbsp;million&#151;&#163;170&nbsp;million or &#163;180&nbsp;million. I think the Government would acknowledge that. When my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley moved amendment No. 3, he said that one of the advantages would be that a revaluation could be done in smaller chunks by moving slowly throughout the country, doing particular regions, and there might be benefits in that. I accept that that might be true.
</p>








<p><a name="st_204"><a name="51201-16_spnew8"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for taking another risk by giving way. In fact, that is not what I said. Although what he suggested is conceivable, there is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 420</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an opportunity to delay or even stop national revaluations by carrying out revaluations only in those areas or billing authorities where it became a necessity because of the spread across the banding system.
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="51201-16_spnew9"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 That is an interesting argument. Given the various options that amendment No. 3&nbsp;allows, how would that be actioned? Would it be by public consultation? Would the Member of Parliament need to have an Adjournment debate? Would the billing authority, having decided that things were seriously out of kilter in its area, have to petition Parliament to be a special case for revaluation purposes? I cannot see that happening, but I can see that the moment one moves from a national revaluation on a particular date to a local revaluation, that raises a number of questions such as in what order, when, which authorities are included, why a particular authority is included, the appeal structure, what happens when one area undergoes a rebanding process but an adjacent area does not. Would there be complaints from residents in that area?

 Does my hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51201-16_spnew11"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 That is a point. The Government acknowledged in Committee that putting off the revaluation meant that 1,250&nbsp;people who worked for the Valuation Office Agency would have to be made redundant. Many of them are on short-term contracts. An issue raised on Second Reading was how&#151;

 Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend get back to the amendment. Does he accept that although this may not be the right amendment, the Government need to embrace the concept that we need a mechanism for going to specific areas where there is such great change that any alternative would be very much worse? Will he ask the Government to do precisely that&#151;to take that element out of the amendment, so that it can be done?
</p>








<p><a name="st_211"><a name="51201-16_spnew14"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes a very good point. The difficulty is that if the current structure of council tax were settled, we could move away from a national revaluation, as the amendment suggests, and carry out regional or sub-regional revaluations, as we would still get similar bands A to H in each area. Under the Lyons review, the Government are considering alternatives, and&#151;this is relevant to the amendment&#151;they have the powers to vary the number of bands or make them more progressive, less progressive or whatever the Government want to do. If there was a

<br>&nbsp;<br>partial revaluation in one area of the country on bands A to H, but at a later date the policy changed so there was different banding in a different area, that would cause immense debate in the House. Until we settle the form of local government finance and the manner in which it is introduced, we cannot move from the concept of a national revaluation to the concept of a local revaluation. The Government are right that the Lyons review needs to examine all the options and report on them.

 There are two reasons why I shall be very brief. First, I am a late substitute for my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), who is sadly unwell. I hope that all hon. Members will join me in wishing her a speedy recovery. Secondly, I understand that there is some annoyance on this side of the House that we are taking this business rather than another debate today, which is a point that hon. Members raised at business questions. However, it strikes me that the protest would be more effective if we were to dispatch the business of the House without unnatural prolongation to demonstrate to the Government, as I said last Thursday, that we could have had both debates on the same day. I shall reiterate my party&#039;s position. We support the Bill and want to see revaluation stopped, for the simple reason that under the system of local government taxation that we would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adopt&#151;local income tax&#151;no valuations or revaluations would be necessary in the first place.

There is, however, a serious objection, which Conservative Members raised almost as soon as the hon. Member for Mole Valley rose to speak. As the amendment stands, the Secretary of State&#039;s power to order separate local or regional revaluations could be used in a politically biased way.

<p>
<a name="51201-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_72">The hon. Member for Mole Valley has repeatedly raised another serious problem in the debates about the Bill&#151;the connection between the council tax banding system and the grant that the Government hand out to particular local authorities. It would not be beyond the wit of the Government to use that connection to produce a politically interesting result, which has not been unknown in the past. In reply to that point, the hon. Member for Mole Valley said that he would institute a different system of calculating the grant. I was interested to hear him say that he would use a system based on income levels in various districts, which is the precise basis for equalisation under local income tax, and I urge him to go much further along that line of thinking.
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="51201-17_spnew1"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is being provocative, and I refer him to what I said on Second Reading. There is a distinct difference between my position and local income tax&#151;the proposition advanced by the Liberal party is mindlessly complicated and includes all the problems of the poll tax, and more.
</p>

 I was about to make the same point, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would be glad to debate the merits of local income tax on a different occasion, but we are discussing a particular amendment to a particular Bill, which is very narrow in its scope.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_73">If we were to adopt the system proposed by the hon. Member for Mole Valley, because income is distributed more evenly than property values the equalisation system would be easier to manage and less difficult to make work. Nevertheless, the central objection to amendment No. 3&nbsp;is that the system, which is a good idea, would not appear in the Bill. If amendment No. 3&nbsp;were passed, it would make the Bill worse rather than better. I urge him not to press his amendment to a vote and, perhaps, to discuss the matter with his noble Friends in another place to allow the introduction of a different version of the amendment that deals with the problems raised in the course of the debate.

<a name="51201-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_74">Let us get this out of the way, straight away&#151;I believe that if we have a property tax, we must have a revaluation. I said that during the election and hope that I have not offended my hon. Friends on the Front Bench. That is my view and I have retained it. Amendment No. 3&nbsp;is a way of ensuring revaluation, where local authorities think it necessary. Giving local authorities greater autonomy in that respect is a laudable objective.
</p>








<p><a name="st_217"><a name="51201-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 If what my hon. Friend has just said were in the amendment, I could agree with him. On reflection, does he agree that as the amendment is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 423</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>drafted, the power to order a partial revaluation rests not with local authorities, but with the Secretary of State, who may seek to use it to punish a particular area for voting for another political party?
</p>








<p><a name="st_218"><a name="51201-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Binley: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend has made a valid comment, but I argue that amendment No. 3&nbsp;would at least allow local authorities to appeal to the Secretary of State for a local revaluation, which would be a step forward from the current position. As for the Government&#039;s ability to distort the measure, that power ranges over a very wide area, if they were to choose to use it. It is up to this House to scrutinise their activity and make sure that the use of such powers does not stray too far from what most hon. Members consider to be decent and fair.
</p>








<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51201-17_spnew6"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for supporting the amendment. In response to my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), who is more paranoid and concerned than me and who is to my right in more ways than just geography, it is possible for the Government to change the funding system undercover and lay the blame on local government. However, it would be too open for the Government to distort the system in the way that he fears.
</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51201-17_spnew7"><b> Mr. Binley: </b> 
 I understand that point and accept the dangers. However, I see the matter from a local government perspective, and I am sure that my hon. Friend does, too. On balance, it is in the interests of local authorities to take such action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_75">Turning to my other points, first, as I have said in this House and Westminster Hall, there is considerable uncertainty in local government that ranges from the revaluation being put off to the Lyons report. I therefore believe that we should give local authorities the opportunity to exercise at least some power, and I repeat the point that there is power in the ability to appeal to the Secretary of State. Unless we give local authorities some power in that respect, we will diminish them to the point where they become almost worthless. I want to increase, not decrease, their powers, and the amendment would achieve that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_76">Secondly, the degree of unfairness increases with every year that goes by when a revaluation does not take place. That must be so, because the need for revaluation is based on creating a fairness taking into account local changes. The amendment would enable local authorities to recognise those changes instead of being forced by a Government into a situation whereby unfairness increases. That would increase the value of local authorities in this respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_77">Thirdly, there is no doubt that, by the very nature of the Government&#039;s decision on revaluation, local authorities will be increasingly under pressure with regard to appeals. My own local authority fears that as unfairness increases, so will appeals and complaints. Council tax payers put the whole issue of local taxation under considerable scrutiny as it becomes increasingly 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 424</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unfair. The amendment would give an outlet to local authorities in at least being seen to do something on behalf of their council tax payers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51201-17_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point about unfairness. Does he agree that unless there are regular revaluations the differential between new and old houses, with new houses being valued as soon as they are built and old houses not being valued until revaluation takes place, will become ever wider, creating great unfairness between different constituents within the same billing area?
</p>








<p><a name="st_222"><a name="51201-17_spnew9"><b> Mr. Binley: </b> 
 That is exactly the point that I was trying to make, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for supporting me. He is absolutely right.

<a name="51201-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_78">The sustainable communities programme will lead to massive changes in certain areas, dramatically increasing the need for revaluation. The Government say that they are fully committed to that growth agenda. In the light of that, the ability of authorities to appeal to the Secretary of State for local revaluation has considerable relevance.

Let me refer to new clause 1(2) to illustrate my point. That would give the Secretary of State a top-down power to permit a localised revaluation, which is the spirit of what my hon.

<a name="stpa_85">The Secretary of State could, for some arbitrary reason, decide to impose a revaluation on a local authority or group of local authorities that are adjoining rather than comparable&#151;as my right hon.

If there were two separate amendments&#151;the first to make the same provision as amendment No. 3&nbsp;and the second to provide that the power could be exercised only in response to a request from the bottom, so that it could be effected only when a group of local authorities had got together to make that request&#151;I would have more sympathy with the aim of my hon.

In those circumstances, the Secretary of State could grant a revaluation only when there was clear evidence that the local authority or authorities had made the request.

 Does my hon.

Friends have argued that an area of especially high growth might give the local authority an incentive to revalue. I understand the logic of that but it is no secret that, in some of the proposed high growth areas, there is much local resistance to the amount of house building that the Government want. That is true of parts of the Thames Gateway and I believe it to be true of the other growth areas that have been mentioned.

Members are familiar with the arguments, but they would also get a revaluation thrown in. That is not likely to be popular with residents and council tax payers even if the local authority wanted a revaluation for understandable financial reasons.

 My hon.

 I think that the anomalies could be corrected by a Secretary of State of a Conservative hue. That is why I think that there is some merit in the amendment. I accept the reservation articulated by my right hon. Friend and others who think that such a power given to the current Secretary of State would indeed be abused. There is some evidence that the Secretary of State&#039;s capping powers have been abused and used to bear down unfairly on small Conservative-run local authorities.

<p><a name="st_252"><a name="51201-19_spnew12"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 To drive the point home again, the reservations of some of us, to draw another parallel, are based on some of the planning decisions made by the First Secretary of Sate. I know that we are not debating planning this afternoon, Madam Deputy Speaker, but on a number of occasions local inquiries have found one way and the First Secretary of State has overruled the decision of the local inspector. Real practical examples therefore exist of the Secretary of State going beyond the merits of his powers. Those are additional reasons for our concerns.

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Of course, the First Secretary of State talks a lot about localism, but in reality he is in favour of centralisation. The amendment tabled by my hon.

<a name="51201-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_94">Beyond the Government&#039;s overall policy to increase the national burden of council tax faster than the rate at which national incomes have increased, the situation is much worse in some local authority areas and the amendment might address that. For example, in my constituency, under the Christchurch borough council billing authority, in 1993&#150;94, the average council tax per dwelling was below the national average at &#163;441&nbsp;per dwelling. This year, however, it is &#163;1,193&nbsp;per dwelling&#151;an increase in the average bill of 171&nbsp;per cent., which is 50&nbsp;per cent. more than the England average. To take up the Minister&#039;s point that that does not take account of council tax benefit, the amount of council tax benefit in Christchurch is very small, with only 16.2&nbsp;per cent. of households receiving it. We know, however, that more than 30&nbsp;per cent. of the population are aged 65&nbsp;and over. It is a privilege to be one of the younger people living in Christchurch. I am conscious of the burden faced by pensioners and those on fixed incomes.

<p>
<a name="51201-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_95">The situation is similar under East Dorset district council billing authority, which covers another part of my constituency. There, in 1993&#150;94, the average council tax per dwelling was &#163;516, significantly above the then national average, but it has continued to increase, going up by 163&nbsp;per cent. since then, and is now no less than &#163;1,356&nbsp;per dwelling. That is about &#163;350&nbsp;more per dwelling than the national average. It is not surprising, therefore, that my constituents come to see me frequently to complain about the actual and perceived unfairness of the council.

 What would my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents say if amendment No. 3&nbsp;were incorporated into the Bill and became law, and the Secretary of State made an order that one of my hon. Friend&#039;s billing authorities should revalue, but not the other?
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51201-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 My constituents would be angry with the Government for using such perverse reasoning. My right hon. Friend identifies what I see as a weakness in the amendment, but it is not such a weakness that we should not support it today. The amendment demonstrates some lateral thinking about how to try to introduce greater fairness into the system, rather than leaving things drifting under this Government. The prospects are that council tax will continue to increase way beyond the rate of inflation, and will increase by a higher rate in small district council areas such as Christchurch and East Dorset than in the metropolitan, urban areas that used to be regarded as Labour heartlands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_96">There is a problem, and I am not saying that the amendment is the perfect solution to it, but it contains the prospect of introducing some increased fairness. A revaluation in Christchurch or East Dorset would show which houses had increased in value by more than the average for the area, and which had increased by a lower proportion. The bills that were issued could then be adjusted to reflect that new equity. That should be a zero sum game within each local authority area, because otherwise we would end up having to pay much higher bills because of the redistributive effects of the national

<br>&nbsp;<br>grant system. Provided that it was a zero sum game, such a measure might have a role to play within an individual local authority area. The Secretary of State might decide which local authorities to include, but he might also want to start off by saying that the pensioners are really the ones complaining most about the unfair burden of council tax, and that, therefore, in all local authority billing areas where the proportion of the population aged 65&nbsp;and over is higher than, say, 25&nbsp;per cent., there should be revaluation to see whether the burden on pensioner households could be reduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_97">At the moment, the council tax is essentially a stealth wealth tax, and the value of properties is being used as a proxy for ability to pay. We know jolly well that the ability to pay of many pensioner households is very small.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">Another criterion that the Government could use when deciding in which billing authorities a revaluation should be held could be the percentage of households receiving council tax benefit. When I was a Minister in the then Department of the Environment, one of the Treasury&#039;s biggest concerns was the increased bills that resulted from high rates. The Government could decide to hold a revaluation in areas where the percentage of take-up of council tax benefit was relatively low. In Christchurch and in East Dorset, council tax benefit is available to far fewer households than it is nationally, and in East Devon the figure is only 13.7&nbsp;per cent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_266"><a name="51201-20_spnew5"><b> Anne Main: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend has so far mentioned only pensioners and people in receipt of council tax benefit, is he suggesting that, as part of the revaluation process, we should look more at the occupants of the property than the property itself?
</p>








<p><a name="st_267"><a name="51201-20_spnew6"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 I am illustrating a possible criterion upon which the Government might choose to exercise their discretion under the amendment. Does not my hon. Friend agree that the burden on pensioners is particularly great? Indeed, the Halifax paper pointed out that the burden of council tax had risen most among the pensioner population.

<p><a name="st_268"><a name="51201-20_spnew7"><b> Anne Main: </b> 
 There may be many elderly pensioners suffering in that way in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, as there are in mine, but they often occupy larger homes than they need and cannot afford to downsize, so they could be disproportionately disadvantaged in a revaluation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_269"><a name="51201-20_spnew8"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 That remains to be seen. As I said, it would be a zero-sum game. In my constituency, more modern bungalows, where people moved in more recently, or bungalows that have been modernised and extended would probably rise in value relative to properties occupied by more senior pensioners&#151;people in their 80s and 90s, of whom we have a large number in Christchurch.

<p><a name="st_270"><a name="51201-20_spnew9"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 May I slightly disagree with my hon. Friend? The whole point of the driver that I am proposing is that there would be revaluation where a change in the value of properties in a billing area needed to be reflected.

<a name="51201-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">The other part of my hon.

 It would be the consequence of having a national revaluation in one big chunk.

Whatever one&#039;s view of the sloppy drafting of his amendment, this is an important debate. There are merits in the broad principle of his amendment, because it has often been impossible for Governments to conduct national revaluations. The revaluation scheduled for 1938&nbsp;was deferred for two years, but the second world war broke out, so it never took place. A revaluation was scheduled for 1952, but it was deferred until 1953, and was eventually carried out in 1956. A revaluation was scheduled for 1961&nbsp;under a Conservative Government, but it was deferred until 1963. The Labour Government that followed deferred the 1968&nbsp;revaluation.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, that Government did not carry out a revaluation at all, and it was Edward Heath&#039;s Conservative Government who carried out a revaluation in 1973. Throughout our history, therefore, there have been occasional problems with getting national revaluations off the ground. If we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

I have explained why in my interventions. A politically motivated or malevolent Secretary of State, for example, may decide to make a blatant political order to carry out a revaluation of properties in areas that voted for another political party&#151;perhaps the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats&#151;to teach the residents a lesson. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked about judicial review, but I am not confident that such a review would work in those circumstances, because that Minister would be unlikely to say publicly that the basis of his decision was his wish to punish voters, even though that was the motivation behind his order.

: From memory, I think that it was Lord Acton who said that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Does my right hon.

That is not counter-balanced by a requirement that a request for revaluation must be seen to have come from the local authority or authorities in question. Does my right hon. Friend share my concern?

 My hon. Friend is right; I share his concerns. He has put his finger on the problem.

It is a dangerous precedent if a Secretary of State can instigate a review without a local authority wanting it. That is why I cannot support the amendment.

 I aim to be of assistance to the right hon. Gentleman. The amendment refers to &quot;adjoining .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. authorities&quot;.

 In this debate I have left my political axe outside the Chamber. I would be against the amendment being put into the Bill even if we had a Conservative Government.

 Perhaps I can help my right hon. Friend with the intervention of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), which was geographically and factually wrong.

The first, of course, is what the Government decide is a suitable sum for that local authority to have in grant. The second is what the local authority decides is a suitable sum to raise in council tax. The third is the incidence of that council tax as spread over the whole area.

I was told by my opponent, who belonged&#151;and, I think, still does belong&#151;to the Labour party, that a valuation was essential. As a country councillor, he was determined to explain to me that I did not understand the issue, and why we had to have a valuation. Now I understand that it was not essential, and that despite being a county councillor, he was wrong.

We are now going to discuss what difficulties even our earlier, right decision throw up. I am merely suggesting, from what I consider a non-partisan position, that the Minister needs some mechanism. We have to ask ourselves whether the mechanism suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley is the right one.

 I do not think it right for me to deal with the geographical issue that the hon. Gentleman raises, but the essence of his point is entirely wrong.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 441</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>impossible, it is very important to make this system work, which is why this amendment is so crucial. It would not be so crucial were it not for the fact that, if we do not make the council tax arrangements work effectively, we will not have a better alternative. So this debate is as important as I suggested to you that it was, Mr. Deputy Speaker, when you first took the Chair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">So the issue is: how do we approach this part of the mix that makes the council tax? The council tax is a property tax. Few countries have been able to handle taxation without some form of property tax. Ireland tried to do without one, but I suspect that it has been trying to change back&#151;a difficult thing to do. The real problem was identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois). He rightly said that he represented the Thames Gateway, where the changes promised&#151;if that word is not too generous&#151;by the Deputy Prime Minister will make this problem especially difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">The difficulty is that perception and reality are often very far removed from each other when the system involves so many components working together. I do not know about the Minister&#039;s constituency&#151;or yours, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;but I am willing to bet that not many people in anyone&#039;s area would be able to explain the interpenetration of the various elements, year on year. Therefore, we need to make the system more transparent rather than less transparent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_312"><a name="51201-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the great complexity of the system makes people wary about revaluation, especially after what happened in Wales? When we shifted from standard spending assessment to formula spending share as a mechanism to provide grant to local authorities, council tax rose by so much in the south-east that people believed that a revaluation in England would be, in a sense, bent. That is why they were so resistant to it in many parts of the south-east of England.
</p>








<p><a name="st_313"><a name="51201-23_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I think that the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) might be tempted again from the straight and narrow. I hope that he will not be.

<p><a name="st_314"><a name="51201-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My hon. Friend has made his point, and I agree with it, but I shall not go down that route.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">How do we make the process more transparent? One way is proposed in the amendment. Where it is obvious that the incidence of the council tax has ceased to reflect properly the nature of the area involved, there needs to be a way to remedy that by means of a local revaluation. That is the justification behind this proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">However, if it is a question of perception, whose perception matters? I disagree with my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) about that. He and I worked at the Department of the Environment in close harmony and, as far as I am concerned at least, with considerable pleasure. However, in this instance, I believe that he has thought too much about the central issue, and too little about the local issue. Because of that, in the end I decided that I could not support the amendment quite as I had hoped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">If there is a perception of unfairness of incidence in a locality, local people should be able to ask, through the local council, for a revaluation. Councils in East Dorset, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 442</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Christchurch, Suffolk Coastal or Waveney could say, &quot;We want a revaluation because we can&#039;t fairly deal with our population as a result of the huge change that has taken place. We need, therefore, to check out the incidence of the council tax, so as to be fair to the people who elect us.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_124">In such circumstances, I believe that it should be necessary for the Secretary of State to allow a revaluation. He should not be able to say, &quot;You can ask, but I&#039;m not going to do it.&quot; He should be required to allow the revaluation, because many people outside the House may be surprised by the mechanisms available to the Secretary of State to put pressure on people. It is for that reason that I dissent about the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_125">I cannot go into detail, for fear of straying out of order, but we have been talking about the Thames Gateway in particular. In that area, it might not be possible to build many of the houses intended because of the flood plain. What would happen if the Deputy Prime Minister insisted that the houses were built and the insurance industry refused to insure them? The valuation situation would then be very complex, but it would be localised, not nationalised. At the moment, the Secretary of State has outrageously bamboozled the insurance industry by ensuring that the life offices put pressure on those that insure houses by saying, &quot;If you get uppity with the Secretary of State, we will be in trouble over pensions provision, so don&#039;t do it.&quot; We all know the institutional corruption that goes on&#151;Governments use their power over one lot to make others not do something. I hope that the insurance industry will develop some toughness in that area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_126">If the houses are built in the Thames Gateway, their value will be crucially affected by whether they can be insured, and a local revaluation will be essential if there is to be fairness in the incidence of the tax. I hope that we do not reach that situation because, as an environmentalist, I do not want those houses to be built. I do not understand why we are trying to shove into the south-east of England houses that could, in today&#039;s world of communication, be spread more evenly over the nation. But then this is about the least environmental Government that we have had for a long time. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst does not help by holding up the one Bill that has been introduced that has been worth having. I hope that he will change his mind about that.

<a name="51201-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_127">The local revaluation suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley would be essential if significant local changes occurred that needed to be taken into account. I note that even those who have opposed this particular formulation, who come from a local government background, have emphasised the need for such a change. It would therefore be foolish of the Government to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_128">This is an issue of transparency and perception. Therefore, one has to face up to the second difficulty that the amendment presents. It could be used for purposes totally other than those that were conceived. Some of those purposes might be reasonable, but would not be suitably covered by this amendment. Let us for a moment accept that it might be sensible to have an elite group of people who went round the country carrying out valuations, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested, which might be cheaper. The people need not even be employed by the

<a name="stpa_129">The trouble is that the amendment would give no guidance to the Secretary of State as to the basis on which that sequential activity should be performed. My hon. Friend, in explaining that, gave us to understand that that was not really his purpose for the amendment, although my right hon. Friend rightly identified it as a possible advantage. I would go further. One of the reasons I liked the amendment was because it would enable pilot schemes to be carried out in several places, so we would be able to see whether the perception of our constituents that a change in valuation would be unfair to them was true or not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_130">Indeed, one of the problems, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;you represent a neighbouring constituency to mine&#151;that we have all found in this debate, across party lines, is that people feared that whatever the valuation was, it would do them down. The only way to deal with such a fear may be to carry out a localised valuation in certain places that are sufficiently different so that one could discover whether revaluation had the effect in England that it had in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_131">Of course the amendment would have an advantage. Unlike in Wales, where no ceiling was imposed and such things were not done in the same envelope, if a revaluation took place in an area, it would have to reach the same total that obtained before the reassessment realigned the weight on any property. The problem in Wales was that a lot more money came out at the other end. Of course, everyone knows that that is what the Government intended, which is why we opposed the revaluation in the first place.

<a name="stpa_132">Such a system could be used for the valuable purpose that I propose, but only if regulations were laid down to ensure that it could not be misused. For example, a revaluation should be triggered only by the local authority, except if a pilot scheme was restricted to a certain number to ensure that it was used for the intended purpose. There is a disadvantage in the amendment, because we have not covered that issue and we should try to do so.

I am happy to say that I understand all three, but that has not given me a taste for mediaeval philosophy.

<br>&nbsp;<br>amendment is therefore on the right lines&#151;although, as many of my hon. Friends have said this afternoon, it would have been much better and would more accurately have reflected my party&#039;s policy on the matter if it had allowed local authorities, not the Secretary of State, to make the decision.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_147">I have considerable worries about the Secretary of State being able to make such an order. If the Minister is inclined to accept the amendment, will he tell us on what basis the Secretary of State would make an order obliging an individual authority or a group of authorities to undertake revaluations? The measure amends section 22&nbsp;of Local Government Finance Act 1992, as amended by the Local Government Act 2003, and we are seeking again to amend that section.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_148">On what basis would the Secretary of State make such an order? I can think of a number of reasons why he might, but I wish to probe the matter further. In an area where, when the council tax was originally introduced, property prices were not rising at anything like the present rate, it was envisaged that properties would be put into a band and, provided they were put into the correct band, all properties would increase in price relative to each other. However, in the past few years property prices, particularly in the south of England and the commuter belt of London, have increased very fast. That has led to a huge disparity not only within individual billing authorities, but between billing authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_149">As I mentioned in an intervention, new properties are immediately put on to the valuation list in their full market band, whereas older properties are not. That immediately leads to a distortion. One could see good reason for ordering a revaluation in an authority that had had fast rising prices, such as my own in Cotswold, or in another authority&#151;perhaps that of my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)&#151;where a large number of new properties had been built. Those are two good reasons for ordering a revaluation. A third reason might be that large numbers of properties had been extended. The moment a property is extended, it tends to be revalued and put in an upper band. Because of the distortion of stamp duty, many people are finding it cheaper to extend their property than to do what they would have done in the old days&#151;sell a smaller property and buy a bigger one. That is happening to a lesser and lesser extent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51201-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lee Scott  (Ilford, North) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that another reason could be that property values have changed and there are two houses or more in the same turning with different bandings? Local authorities should have the right to alter that, so that it is fairer for everyone.

 Is my hon. Friend sure that if a new house is built, it is valued at today&#039;s price rather than the 1991&nbsp;price? If he is right about that, almost all new houses would be in bands G and H.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_150">A fifth reason for ordering revaluations in a particular local authority is that a large number of properties are bought and sold. A property can be revalued if its original value is severely out of kilter with its price when it is bought and sold. In the south of England, for example, many more properties are bought and sold in an individual billing authority than in some of the more northern authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_151">Those are some of the reasons for revaluations. I should like the Minister to tell us why he would want to order an individual billing authority to undertake a revaluation. What about the distortion that would cause between one authority and its neighbouring authorities?

<a name="stpa_152">My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chope) has mentioned that his constituency contains two billing authorities.

Under the amendment&#151;this is why I am going to vote against it&#151;the Secretary of State might order a revaluation for the Cotswold area, but not for the Stroud area. In those circumstances, what would happen to properties on the border? What would happen to people who live in Cotswold and who have low-paid jobs in Stroud? All sorts of distortions could emerge.

<a name="stpa_153">A fifth reason to revalue an individual billing authority is because it contains either a large number of empty properties or, as my hon. Friend has said, a large number of properties that have been demolished. A large number of such properties tends to distort the lists and make them out of date, and my central theme this afternoon is that lists should be up to date because values should reflect the amount of tax paid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_154">A sixth reason why the Secretary of State might want to instruct billing authorities to carry out revaluations is because the area contains a large number of second homes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) knows, because he and I served on the Committee that considered the Local Government Act 2003, it is now possible for local authorities to exercise their discretion and charge council tax on second homes by abolishing up to 90&nbsp;per cent. of the rebate, which means that people pay almost full council tax. That has happened in Cotswold, where people pay nearly full 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 449</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>council tax on their second homes. If there is a large number of second homes in a local authority area, it can cause distortion, which is another reason why the Secretary of State might want to order a revaluation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>find very convincing? Where there has been demolition in an area that is in the course of being redeveloped, is not there a good case for not having a revaluation but waiting until it is fully redeveloped, because that will have a huge effect on property prices?
</p>








<p><a name="st_333"><a name="51201-26_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes a partly good point. When I held my party&#039;s housing and inner-city brief, I found that large-scale redevelopments in areas such as Moss Side in Manchester tended to take place over several years. It is highly unlikely that the entire demolition in a redevelopment of any size would take place in one go&#151;it would be phased over a number of years. The effectiveness of the revaluation in dealing with the problem that my right hon. Friend mentions would depend on the stage in that process at which it was ordered. Any big redevelopment of that kind would have areas that had been demolished and rebuilt, areas that had been demolished but not rebuilt, and areas still waiting to be demolished. The point at which the revaluation was ordered would be a matter of judgment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_334"><a name="51201-26_spnew6"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend accept that that does not necessarily have to be the case? In some developments, the whole area is cleared at once&#151;for example, railway marshalling yards, where the land is cleared and then brought into use all in one go.

<p><a name="st_335"><a name="51201-26_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 That is entirely possible. Of course, in the bigger cities the scale becomes bigger. That would have to be considered carefully. I am sure that the Minister will tell us whether it is one of the factors that he would take into account in ordering a revaluation.

I am aware of the excellent work that he has done, and continues to do, in Northampton.

<a name="51201-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_157">The subject of the valuation base is very interesting, if dry. The whole business of local government finance is incredibly complicated. It involves about 200&nbsp;different sections, including algorithms and all sorts of complicated mathematical formulae, one of which relates to the council tax. House prices are rising in almost all areas in the United Kingdom and that means that the valuation base would probably increase on revaluation. I suspect that that would happen because the general area would improve. Moss Side is a prime example of such improvement. Houses were demolished, new houses were built and green parks, new schools and new doctors&#039; surgeries were created, thus improving the whole area to the extent that one of the most crime-ridden areas in Europe is now a pleasant place to live. The private sector has built houses in the area that sell for a great a deal of money. That proves what successful wholesale refurbishment of an area can do. I suspect that if an area were sensitively demolished and refurbished, the council tax base would increase.

For example, areas such as the Cotswolds, where the council tax base is high, lose out on the rate support grant settlement because some of our council tax is redistributed.

 My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech, but I echo the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) that it raises many questions. His explanation of the equalisation system suggests that local authorities whose rateable value is below average have a disincentive to go for revaluation, because if their council tax base increases they would lose the benefit of the transfers from south to north that penalise council tax payers in my constituency.

<p><a name="st_347"><a name="51201-26_spnew19"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has hit the bull&#039;s eye. That is what is wrong with the amendment. I believe that the Secretary of State will use the power for the wrong reasons and my hon. Friend outlines one of them. I should therefore like the power to be vested in local authorities because they know what is best for the area and whether they should order such a power. My hon. Friend raises a genuine, worrying possibility.

<p><a name="st_348"><a name="51201-26_spnew20"><b> Mr. Swayne: </b> 
 My fear is that whether the power is ordered by the local authority or the Secretary of State, it may inadvertently have the same effect. The Secretary of State could order it to cause a transfer of resources, but even if the local authority ordered it for some other purpose, it could have the same effect. Local authorities would not wish to use such a power lightly.

<p><a name="st_349"><a name="51201-27_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. Indeed, I made it earlier in an intervention. The Secretary of State could use the power for punitive reasons. For example, instead of council tax capping an authority, he could use the threat of the power to encourage it to keep its percentage increase of council tax down to a level that he deemed acceptable. Again, I would think that totally reprehensible, but one can imagine a certain Secretary of State&#151;not the Minister for Local Government&#151;who is very honourable, doing exactly what my hon. Friend says.

 As I said earlier in the debate, I have a particular interest in this matter because Wellingborough has had the biggest increase in council tax since the council tax was introduced.

 I will give way to my hon. Friend in a moment, although I think that I can answer what he is about to say&#151;that a revaluation per se does not necessarily give rise to an increase in council tax, although it probably will do so for the very reasons that I mentioned. Even if it does not give rise to an increase in council tax immediately, the revenue support grant will be reduced to support the redistribution mechanism about which I have talked. I therefore have a lot of sympathy with the point made by my hon. Friend the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 453</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone). I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley wants to contradict me.
</p>








<p><a name="st_353"><a name="51201-27_spnew4"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for the opportunity to do so. I think that he fails to understand something that I have stressed time and again. The aim of a revaluation locally is a fairer distribution within the local area, but a national revaluation will make a difference to the way in which the grant is distributed, which was also a point that I made. Ability to pay should therefore be estimated on a basis of tax paid or income earned within billing areas, which has already been done by the Treasury.
</p>








<p><a name="st_354"><a name="51201-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has huge knowledge of the way in which local government works and I am hesitant to contradict him. The way of the world, however, is that a revaluation will put considerable pressure on a local authority to increase council tax. To stick to the mechanism whereby council tax should not go up, if the revaluation causes an increase in the entire list the rate of council tax would have to go down. I cannot imagine many councils explaining to their council tax payers that they have put the rate of council tax down in order to keep the council tax the same. The way of the world is that the valuation would go up and the council tax rate would stay the same, so the actual amount payable would go up. I do not know whether my hon. Friend wants to come back on that point&#151;he is shaking his head. It is not necessary. There we are. The whole purpose of this kind of debate is to get differences of opinion out in the open&#151;parler, to speak, is what Parliament is all about. I am pleased to take part in this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_159">I have almost come to the end of my speech, but suffice it to say that when the Lyons&#039; committee comes to report on this matter&#151;next year, I gather, in tranches&#151;I hope that the Government will take it very seriously. We have had some excellent debate this evening. There is a lot of merit in the principle proposed by my hon. Friend&#151;that there should be an ability to have local revaluations, provided that it is under the democratic control of locally elected councillors. I hope that the Lyons&#039; report will deal with that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_160">Before I conclude, I want to deal with the problem of appeals. At the moment, appeals only take place in the categories that I have mentioned. Were there either a local or national revaluation, however there would be a lot more appeals. That would increase the work of the Valuation Office Agency, and perhaps it would be useful to sub-contract that to the private sector, too. Appeals take time, cost money and cause a lot of angst to our constituents, so we should try to get valuation lists accurate. Where changes do not take place for individual streets and houses within individual streets, whatever revaluation takes place under my hon. Friend&#039;s proposal or any future Government proposal the number of individual differentials could be kept to a minimum and the number of appeals reduced.
</p>








<p><a name="st_355"><a name="51201-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point about appeals and I should like to draw a brief analogy with the planning system. As resistance is hardening to many planning applications, particularly but not exclusively in the south-east, the Government 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 454</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are running out of planning inspectors to adjudicate, so it often takes more than a year to obtain a public inquiry as there are not enough planning inspectors to go round. That is becoming a real problem in the planning process, so does my hon. Friend agree that it could be an additional problem in the valuation system?
</p>








<p><a name="st_356"><a name="51201-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend, with his huge knowledge of such matters, is right. The Government are having to produce a special planning grant to try to encourage local authorities, such as mine, that are extremely short of staff due to high housing costs to employ planning officers. The same would apply for valuation officers in the listing authorities. Of course, as has rightly been suggested, the solution would be to employ the private sector to do the work. There would then be no need for a permanent overhead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_161">The amendment is premature. It contains many good intentions, as is always the case with proposals made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley. However, we should wait for Sir Michael Lyons to make his report and reconsider the amendment in due course.


</p>








<p><a name="st_357"><a name="51201-27_spnew8"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 This obviously essential debate has raised many subjects, and I should like to touch on a few of them in my brief contribution. I made a note that we have talked about local accountability and flexibility, the relative costs of different approaches, the impact of local developments, whether anomalies could be better corrected nationally or locally, the Valuation Office Agency and the role of the Secretary of State, to say nothing of appeals, which my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has just mentioned. All are relevant and I shall touch on them as I go through my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_162">To set a context, we need to establish the provenance of the matter. That takes us back to the beginning of the debate, when Mr. Speaker very graciously and with enormous efficiency was able to produce the missing Act&#151;if I may call it that: for we started the debate without the very Act on which the whole matter is based. Fortunately, we now have it and I want to ensure that the House understands that the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) refers to an order under subsection (1A), which in turn refers to the Bill where subsection (1) of clause 1&nbsp;refers to section 22B of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. That is where we got into immediate difficulty, as we were all wondering how on earth the debate could be properly conducted without the missing Act. It is fair to say that initially we were floundering in a mist, which is unusual for us as we are always clear-eyed and sharp of mind. On this occasion, however, we started at a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_163">Mr. Speaker sorted all that. He waved his wand. He exuded and exerted his authority and the Act was quickly to hand.

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="51201-27_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 I have a copy of the Act. It is a bundle of photocopied sheets and it looks as though there are about 1,000&nbsp;pages to go through. Is not it a bit late to do that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_359"><a name="51201-27_spnew10"><b> Mr. Forth: </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_164">In section 20, we find the genesis of the whole matter that we are discussing. It states:

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_165">We can see immediately that the matters dealt with by the amendment flow from clause 20. Section 21&nbsp;spells things out:

<p><a name="st_361"><a name="51201-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My perusal of the Act has not elicited that information, but I guess that, sadly, the reference is a general one. Section 21&nbsp;states:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carry out valuations of dwellings in England and Wales&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<a name="stpa_168">We can infer a national approach from that provision, but section 22&nbsp;states:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;In accordance with this Chapter, the listing officer for a billing authority shall compile, and then maintain, a list for the authority (to be called its valuation list).&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_169">There is therefore a trickle-down from the national approach with which the commissioners are taxed to the local level, so we are getting into the nitty-gritty of the amendment and the Bill. The 1992&nbsp;Act provides the infrastructure for the Bill and the amendment.

 May I echo my right hon. Friend&#039;s concern about the fact that certain documents were not available earlier? The Bill refers to the Local Government Act 2003, copies of which were not available in the Chamber when we began our debate. On investigation, I discovered that it was available in the Vote Office.

<a name="stpa_172">My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has identified a tension in the Bill.

 Is not the way in which the revaluation is undertaken in one billing authority, two billing authorities or nationwide relevant to the amendment?

<p><a name="st_368"><a name="51201-28_spnew7"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Indeed. My right hon. Friend knows all about his constituents&#039; dwellings. Accuracy is important and there is a contradiction in section 22B. It refers to steps which are &quot;reasonably practicable&quot;, goes on to talk about &quot;the time available&quot; and ends with a reference to accuracy. In many circumstances, the three requirements could well prove contradictory. The practicality is one thing and the timing another, but where does that leave the accuracy? Those contradictions have not been resolved, and even the amendment does not resolve them.

<a name="stpa_173">Labour as well as Conservative Members need to ask themselves to what extent they want to keep faith with the new mantra of localism. The practice has become popular among politicians of constantly reasserting how strongly they support the concept of local decision making, whether in schools, hospitals, local authorities or anywhere else. On the face of it, that is one of the attractions of the amendment. In some ways, it seems to move us in that direction by providing an opportunity for much more local decision making than has been 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 457</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>available hitherto in this great valuation exercise. That in turn, however, poses a number of questions, some of which have already been touched on today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_174">The most fundamental of those questions is whether we believe that, in the whole business of valuation of properties to establish a tax base, a national approach is preferable to a local approach. I must admit that, having listened to the debate so far, I have not yet made up my mind. I can see both sides of the argument, which is rare for me. As many of my right hon. and hon. Friends pointed out, there must surely be a strong case for saying that, because this is potentially such a local matter, we must give priority to the local decision-making element that the amendment would allow. Many examples have been given, ranging from new build to demolition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_175">The new build case is clear. My expert friends have observed that, with new build, the valuation tends to be at current market rates, if I have understood them correctly. Some doubt has been raised about the effect of demolition, however. It could perhaps move us in either direction. While demolition in a blighted area that was then cleaned up and made into a community facility would undoubtedly enhance the area, I am sure we can all imagine other circumstances in which the effect would be the reverse.
</p>








<p><a name="st_369"><a name="51201-28_spnew8"><b> Anne Main: </b> 
 I am glad that my right hon. Friend is exploring the anomalies. The Lyons report does not refer to assessment triggers such as whether a house is in a conservation area. In my constituency the small, modest two-bedroom cottages are in a conservation area, while the big five-bedroom houses are not.
</p>








<p><a name="st_370"><a name="51201-28_spnew9"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has, typically, given a good example of problems that feature throughout the valuation exercise, and with which we must all grapple. That is part and parcel of the important debate about the extent to which we believe that local circumstances and variations should override any other consideration. Again, on the face of it the argument is appealing, but I have my worries. I shall say more in a moment about the malign political influence that has already been touched on.

<p><a name="st_373"><a name="51201-28_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 Perhaps, in a way, I do want to talk about malign political influence. May I return to wholesale demolition and its effect on the charge base in an area? If it reduces the charge base, will not large equalisation payments be made to the local authority to enable it to provide services?
</p>








<p><a name="st_374"><a name="51201-28_spnew13"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 That worries me as well. Underlying much of the debate is the assumption that a beneficent Government, aware of the process described by my hon.

Friends have said that we must not make such assumptions about Governments, especially this Government. We have seen ample evidence of the

<p><a name="st_375"><a name="51201-28_spnew14"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 There is another issue associated with demolition. With a relatively large-scale demolition, such as that of a big 1960s council estate, when modern properties are to be built, working with a housing association, the people who live on the estate first have to be moved out and found somewhere to live. In the jargon, that is called decanting. Then rebuilding begins, and gradually people start to move back into the new properties as they are built. That process can take several years, so at what point do we revalue? Presumably that will happen when the process is complete, so demolition could be going on for several years, and people would then have to wait for revaluation when the estate had been rebuilt, which could take a long time.

 With large-scale demolitions, it is important to get some of the original tenants and owners back to the area to keep the community together.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for his generosity in giving way again. Without wanting to get too bogged down in demolition, may I remind him that there is another important facet? To continue my example, if someone wants to knock down an old housing estate and redevelop it with a housing association, that often involves tenants voting for a transfer&#151;say, from the council to the housing association. For the redevelopment to go ahead, the tenants have to vote for it positively. I have been involved in such cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_179">In the real world, the tenants want to know what the additional costs will be&#151;first, what will happen to their rent, and secondly and increasingly, what effect will moving into the new properties have on their council tax? That can affect how they vote in the ballot, and thus whether the whole redevelopment goes ahead. Does my right hon. Friend agree that having such information available could be important in allowing the redevelopment of some of the worst estates in the country?

 My hon.

 My right hon. Friend touched on localism, so let us consider the very small picture. A large supermarket retailer has bought a considerable number of properties and a small industrial area in a blighted part of my constituency.

Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) spoke about the allocation of health money and claimed that the pendulum had swung away from the problems of an elderly population and towards health issues. I point out that in areas where people have a lower life expectancy, in general that is due to the incidence of disease and illness. To me, that seems a perfectly reasonable criterion to govern the allocation of money. It certainly does not involve party-political bias.
</p>








<p><a name="st_398"><a name="51201-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 The Minister has not looked at what the deprivation index covers. The real problem is that the national health service should perhaps be an ill health prevention system, but it is not.

<p><a name="st_401"><a name="51201-30_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I shall direct my remarks to the amendment and its implications. The assumption behind several contributions this afternoon has been, frankly speaking, wrong. It concerns the fear of potential political manipulation, and it assumes that the relative increase in property prices within an area and between areas has taken place only or mainly in areas with higher incomes. However, statistics published by independent bodies show that that is not the case. In layperson&#039;s terms, the Conservatives assume for the purposes of this debate that &quot;oop north&quot;, we are all poor and live in terraced houses. I should point out to them that Cheshire is the second richest county in the country&#151;and a very beautiful county it is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_185">The second mistake that has been made is to assume that those areas that have had relative increases in prices, where a revaluation would increase the tax yield, are all under the control of the Conservative party. That is not the case. The Conservatives make the same mistake as my party made in the 1980s, which is to assume that certain parts of the country are naturally aligned with one party and parts are aligned with another. If a revaluation were to increase the tax yield and therefore reduce the resource equalisation element&#151;the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) covered that point&#151;the implication is that that would take place entirely in non-Labour areas. One could not achieve that outcome even if one wanted to, and I shall explain why. I reject the allegation about the allocation under the formula and I reject the allegation, also made by some Opposition Members, that that would be used in a politically manipulative way.

<br>&nbsp;<br>understanding of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve. He gave the example of a particular area in the country, but Madam Deputy Speaker ruled it out of order, so I shall not repeat it&#151;but it is by a big river in the south-east of England. The hon. Gentleman seemed to think that all the new properties that are built in that area will be revalued when they are first sold, and that therefore it is necessary to have a local valuation of the existing properties. However, the new properties will be valued and allocated to council tax bands, based on the values of the antecedent valuation date of 1991, the same date at which all properties in the country continue to be valued.

<p>
<a name="51201-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_187">If there were to be a subsequent resale of those properties, they would be revalued only if they had been significantly improved, for example, by the addition of a swimming pool, but perhaps not by the addition of a patio, as some hon.

Even then&#151;this is the crucial point&#151;the revaluation would still be based on the 1991&nbsp;antecedent valuation date. That addresses the point that was drawn to our attention by the hon.

Members have said, at first sight, the amendment seems consistent with the policy of devolution, given the flexibility to carry out a revaluation limited to a single billing authority or a group of adjacent billing authorities if a such a revaluation is demanded locally.

Following significant investment in modern technology, which essentially involves the computerisation of manual records, and the development of the automated valuation model, whereby a computer is given the details of different properties, it is true that the VOA could calibrate the system to cope with different valuation and revaluation dates for the billing authorities. Modern technology could allow what the hon. Member for Mole Valley suggests. However, let us consider for a moment the situation that could prevail in years to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_190">As a result of the amendment, we could face a national taxation system based on multiple valuation dates and a host of different banding structures.

 In my constituency, which is adjacent to the border with Wales, the situation that the Minister 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 464</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>describes already exists. There is a different system in Wales, where a revaluation has already taken place. Many of my constituents already face such confusion because there is a different system on each side of the River Wye. The systems on either side of the border differ under this Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_403"><a name="51201-30_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I appreciate that point. I thought of it myself when I was preparing for the debate last night. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the difference is caused by devolution, but the answer can be drawn out by considering what happened when the poll tax was introduced. The amendment would allow different valuations and bandings across boundaries in the same communities. In other words, the borders of Wales and England are well known and understood. Huge confusion was caused by the difference between one side of Narbonne avenue, which is in Lambeth, and the other side, which is in Wandsworth&#151;I think that that was the boundary&#151;and the danger of the amendment is that such boundaries would be drawn not just in communities and neighbourhoods, but along streets.
</p>








<p><a name="st_404"><a name="51201-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Binley: </b> 
 Is not the real confusion created by the different rates that are levied, rather than by the base on which the rate is levied? That will always be the case, so the Minister&#039;s argument does not work.

<p><a name="st_405"><a name="51201-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that that will always be the case, but if he were to read the 1992&nbsp;Act and, more importantly, the <i>Hansard</i> report of the debates on that legislation, he would understand that an essential part of resource equalisation&#151;the notional effort made by banding to equalise the system&#151;would not be possible, so the amendment would throw out the baby with the bathwater. There would thus be a confused situation with different banding systems operating in different billing authorities. If the hon. Gentleman stays with my argument, he will understand the position.

<p><a name="st_406"><a name="51201-31_spnew1"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Perhaps I should have explained a little more clearly that I thought that the power would be used in relatively isolated cases and that it would still be maintained by the Secretary of State, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) would perhaps deplore. However, local people would feel a difference if the revaluation were reflected in the assessment of ability to pay in the funding formula. If that were changed, the difficulty that the Minister cites would be offset.
</p>








<p><a name="st_407"><a name="51201-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b>

<a name="51201-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_191">The hon. Gentleman argued that such small-scale revaluations could help with the costs of revaluation, which the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) also mentioned. Taken in isolation, he is, of course, right, but taken in aggregate, across all the many different revaluations that could ensue, I believe that he is mistaken. There is a widely accepted theory that economies come from scale. Under national revaluation, even with the automated valuation model, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 465</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is still the case. The VOA could gear up to deliver one national revaluation and would calibrate its software with one valuation date in mind in such an event before revaluing in one concentrated effort.

<p><a name="st_408"><a name="51201-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 The fact that any revaluation creates winners and losers has not yet been mentioned. Those who are losers will call for transitional arrangements under section 79&nbsp;of the Local Government Act 2003.

</p>








<p><a name="st_409"><a name="51201-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I mentioned briefly my assumption that a transitional relief scheme would be needed in such circumstances, as was the case when the poll tax was abolished and the council tax brought in. That was also the case with the business revaluation, which proved to be successful and did not cause the controversy of the Welsh revaluation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_192">Under local or local area revaluations, the VOA could be faced with a constant cycle of recalibrating, revaluing and publishing draft lists, and then providing compiled lists to individual billing authorities.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_193">Let me turn to the impact that the amendment would have on the finance settlement and the grant distribution system. Imagine for a moment a scenario in which one billing authority was revalued. Let us say that in that case revaluation led to a reduction in its overall tax base because properties, on average, moved to lower bands&#151;hon. Members have cited examples of circumstances in which that could happen. At the outset, that appears to be entirely desirable for the householders concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_194">The expectation would be that the grant distribution system would compensate the billing authority for its reduced tax base by shifting a larger proportion of the overall grant pot into that area. However, we encounter a problem at that point because the grant pot is of course finite. Without another authority revaluing and increasing its tax base at the same time, which would effectively rebalance the whole system, we would not have the extra funds that would be needed. Everyone else would thus get less, effectively on the say so of the authority concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_195">Without any compensation through the grant distribution system, the billing authority would be faced with two options: either cover the deficit through efficiency savings or service reductions; or increase its tax rate, which would effectively mean asking its council tax payers to pay the same amount of council tax overall as they did before the local revaluation ever happened. Any overall benefit from revaluation would therefore be cancelled out. On the other hand, a billing authority with an increasing tax base going through a similar revaluation would be handed a windfall increase in tax yield, which would be left unadjusted until the next three-year settlement period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_196">We have gone on record on many occasions saying that we accept the case for revaluation and that it is right to maintain a fair alignment between house prices and council tax bands.

<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 466</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>person benefits from a reduction in band through a revaluation while their neighbour, who happens to be in a different authority that is not revalued, does not? As some speakers noted, we would be faced, I fear, with a flood of appeals as the public became increasingly concerned and confused by the ensuing unfairness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_197">The amendment appears to be based on an assumption about the factors influencing the housing market&#151;an assumption that is fundamentally flawed. It is that influences on the market could&#151;indeed, must&#151;operate at a local level in isolation from national factors. Why else would we ever conceive that revaluation could be justified in one billing authority separately from all others? Micro-economic factors play their part, but to revalue only on the basis of such factors would destabilise what is, after all, a national tax system based on relative values across the whole housing market.

 I thank the Minister and all Members for the support&#151;mixed support. We have had a substantial discussion, much more so than I anticipated, and the spread of knowledge of local government finance has been incredible&#151;from next to nothing to absolutely everything. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) pointed out, the subject is difficult for people to understand. Clarity is needed, and that was part of the inspiration behind the amendment. The difficulty, however, is that because of the wording of the Bill, the amendment had to be very tight. I could only touch on some of the consequential effects and answer them in a way that would enable the amendment to be carried forward. I shall study the amendment and the Minister&#039;s comments carefully, and we can return to the matter another day. For the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

 I beg to move amendment No. 4, in clause 1, page 1, line 8, at end insert&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_422"></p>





<br>
<a name="amdt_2">
<br>
&#039;(1B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State shall decide at least once in each calendar year whether to exercise the power granted by subsection (1A), and shall give reasons for his decision.
<br>







<p><a name="st_423"></p>





<br>
<a name="amdt_3">
<br>
(1C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons referred to in subsection (1B) shall include, but shall not be restricted to, the Secretary of State&#039;s assessment of the degree of divergence in relevant property values since the original valuations made under this Act or since any subsequent revaluation.&#039;.
<br>









<p><a name="st_424">The amendment is about giving reasons, and its origins lie in the different reasons that various people have for being in favour of the Bill. Our reasons are simple. Since we will replace council tax with a different tax system altogether&#151;local income tax&#151;we have no need of any revaluations, and therefore believe that any expenditure on revaluation would be wasted.</p>













<p><a name="st_425">There is more dispute about the Government&#039;s reasons for introducing the Bill. Their stated reasons are to do with the expansion of the remit of the Lyons review, but even Sir Michael Lyons said that a delay of only one year would be justified by the extension of his remit to function rather than just finance. In any case, there is no obvious connection between Lyons and revaluation, since Lyons has been told that council tax 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 468</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is Government policy&#151;the Minister repeated that in Committee&#151;so I see no reason to stop work on a revaluation as council tax will continue, under the Government&#039;s policy, to be the central tax for local government purposes after the review.</p>













<p><a name="st_426">The addition of structural change to the remit of Lyons and the announcement of a White Paper that includes structural change make no difference, as far as I can see. I welcome the announcement of a White Paper, which will increase the amount of policy direction given to the Lyons review. Since council tax is Government policy and will continue to be Government policy throughout the White Paper stage and the Lyons review stage, there is no reason for them to abandon revaluation.</p>













<p><a name="st_427">The second possible reason for the Government&#039;s move is the accusation that there are political reasons that explain the Bill. Throughout its consideration hon. Members in all parts of the House have pointed out that the problem with revaluation is that the political costs almost always outweigh the technical merits of conducting one. That is true even of this revaluation. The New Policy Institute estimated that under the revaluation as proposed for 2007, the winners would outweigh the losers by 5.5&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million. The trouble with that is that in such exercises the winners tend not to be very grateful, as they think they have been overpaying for many years, whereas the losers are furious, so the political cost is always very great.</p>













<p><a name="st_428">There is a rather less cynical reason contained in the New Policy Institute&#039;s analysis of the possible reasons for a revaluation, and that is a reason of fairness&#151;the revaluation would tend to benefit better-off people in some areas of the country at the expense of worse-off people in other areas. That is not a simple north-south divide, as some people think, but a geographical change and a change in the distribution of wealth and income that would be adverse. The problem of the unpopularity and the unfairness of revaluations is confirmed by the history of revaluations that the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) partially recounted in his remarks on the previous amendment. He did not get to the last example, when the threat of revaluation caused the poll tax, which is perhaps the most impressive error ever committed in the history of local government finance.</p>













<p><a name="st_429">A third possible reason to support the Bill is that property values have not diverged significantly. Until about 2001, property values diverged throughout the country, which was followed by a convergence, but in itself that is not enough to explain calling off revaluation, because the subsequent convergence has not yet outweighed the previous divergence. If we take property values in 1991&nbsp;as a base and count that as an index of 100, London was at 557&nbsp;in 2004, whereas the north-west was at 466.5. Although there has been convergence in property values since about 2001, it is not yet sufficient to outweigh the previous divergence.</p>













<p><a name="st_430">As the Minister said several times in previous debates, in particular areas of the country convergence and divergence do not follow the regional pattern. Is that the reason why the Government have introduced the Bill? The problem is that the Government refuse to take that point. Before the Bill was introduced in the autumn, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 469</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they had not commissioned a study of divergence or convergence in property values. There is a lack of clarity on why the Bill was introduced.</p>













<p><a name="st_431">The amendment&#039;s purpose is not to decide the debate about what has happened in the past or to explain why the Government have introduced the Bill, but to put any future debate on the same issue on to a more rational and informed basis. The amendment states that the Government must give reasons for not only going ahead with a revaluation&#151;if they decided to go ahead with a revaluation, one imagines that they would be keen to give the reasons why&#151;but a decision to decline to go ahead with a revaluation. We believe that that would help Parliament and the public distinguish between technical reasons and other reasons for a decision not to go ahead with a revaluation.</p>













<p><a name="st_432">The amendment also states that the reasons that the Government give must include a statement on divergence in property values, but it would not require them to state only their view on divergence in property values. The point is to obtain the Government&#039;s view of what the divergence has been and of what level of divergence would be intolerable, given the other possible factors.</p>













<p><a name="st_433">We moved a similar, although not identical, amendment in Committee, where a number of reasons were given for opposing it. The Minister said that the amendment appeared to require an objective view on when divergence in property values is enough for a revaluation, but that was not its purpose. It was designed to seek not an objective view whether divergence has become too much, but the Government&#039;s view of when divergence has become too much.</p>











<p><a name="st_434"><a name="51201-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman have any worries about the cost of that part of his amendment? If we are to have an annual statement by the Secretary of State giving reasons, and if, by implication, there will be an annual assessment of the degree of divergence, the exercise could be very costly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_435"><a name="51201-32_spnew2"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 I was about to come to that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_200">The second objection mentioned in Committee was that the amendment implied that divergence is the only reason why a revaluation might or might not proceed, but that is not what we are saying. We are saying that divergence is one reason that must be dealt with in the debate, whether or not the Government think that it is their central reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_201">The third point concerned cost, which the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) mentioned. It was said in Committee that there would be a cost in officials&#039; time. However, the figures are generally available from the Land Registry and from the series maintained by the Halifax building society and by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. There would be no great cost in compiling the figures, but it would involve a good deal of effort from Ministers in constructing their reasons based on the information available to them. That is not an unreasonable burden for the political heads of Government Departments to bear in the interests of greater openness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_202">I do not want to detain the House any further. The amendment is a proposed addition to the Bill from a party that is generally friendly to it. It would increase

</p>








<p><a name="st_436"><a name="51201-32_spnew3"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster) (Con):</b> 
 The Liberal Democrats&#039; amendment would require an annual decision to be made, with reasons, on whether a revaluation exercise should be undertaken, with an assessment of the divergence in property values. Such an undertaking would involve enormous cost and administrative time. Conservative Members oppose the amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_437"><a name="51201-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 As the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) said, the amendment is similar, although not identical, to the one that we debated in Committee. The Government&#039;s position remains the same. Let me emphasise that the Bill obliges the Secretary of State to come before the House at the time of a revaluation date and subject the order to debate and, no doubt, a vote. I assure the House that that will give it the opportunity to consider and challenge his reasons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_203">The amendment has been slightly reworded to make it clear that the duty on the Secretary of State to consider at least once each year whether to set a date for revaluation and to give reasons should include, but not be restricted to, an assessment of the degree of divergence in property values. Not least because it still refers to an assessment of the degree of divergence, I ask the House to oppose it if the hon. Gentleman wishes to press it to a vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_204">Although we readily accept the argument for a revaluation of council tax to maintain a fair alignment between house prices and council tax bands, we can see no case for the regular publication of statements. When we debated the similar amendment in Committee, it received no support from the official Opposition. Indeed, the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) said that he was not sure that it would be terribly helpful and that it was probably unnecessary. I would go slightly further than that. The mere fact that there would have to be a statement at least once a year would undoubtedly stir up excitement and controversy among hon. Members, particularly Opposition Members, the press and the general public, and that would in turn lead to considerable uncertainty and anxiety for council tax payers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_205">Even more of a problem is the specific requirement for an assessment of the degree of divergence in property values. Whatever the hon. Gentleman may say, that would simply encourage the view that there must be some sort of objective &quot;golden rule&quot; that would lead, or even require, the Secretary of State&#151;or anyone else&#151;to determine whether a particular level of divergence justified a revaluation.

<a name="time_19">
<a name="51201-32_time1"><h5>4.45&nbsp;pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_206">I appreciate that the hon. Member for Cambridge said in Committee that the similar amendment that we considered there did not assume the existence of any such golden number. He also said that he and his party were not trying to get an objective view of the conditions for revaluation. However, publication of the sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessment that he envisages would inevitably 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 471</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>encourage people to think that if, for example, X per cent. of houses in band Y had increased in price by more than Z per cent., there would be a case for revaluation more or less automatically. Furthermore, they would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infer that, if the Government then decided for whatever reason not to proceed with revaluation, notwithstanding that evidence, they would somehow be flunking the issue. Conversely, it would be inferred that, if a specific level of divergence had not been established, an insufficient case would have been made for revaluation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_207">The Government reject the notions that a specific level of property price movement necessarily justifies revaluation and that divergence that falls short of that level of property price movement precludes any case for it.

<p><a name="st_438"><a name="51201-33_spnew0"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 The main point of the amendment is to encourage the Government to be consistent from one year to the next so that the reasons they give one year are not contradicted the following year. Those reasons do not have to constitute an objective rule but they should be consistent over time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_439"><a name="51201-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. I believe that the provision to require the Secretary of State on the appropriate occasion to justify his or her decision or proposal to the House is sufficient. I stress that I studied the points that he made in Committee after that debate and that I understand them, but I believe that the amendment would inevitably lead people to conclude that there must be a golden rule.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_208">Revaluation is not simply about reflecting divergence in prices across the property market. The case for revaluation is simply to ensure that property values are fairly reflected in council tax bandings and that values are up-to-date and can be sensibly handled by the Valuation Office Agency and other interested parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_209">Above all, we are interested in fairness but it does not depend on passing some sort of arbitrary test on the level of divergence. Indeed, if the focus were to be too heavily weighted towards divergence as the overriding factor predicating a revaluation, according to the amendment, a virtual annual revaluation of all properties would have to take place in order to assess divergence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_210">I agree with the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) about the resources implications. The assessment would have to consider not only the national but the regional and local picture to reflect the fact that divergence can and does happen, and has an impact at the micro level&#151;the billing authority level&#151;as well as regionally and nationally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_211">I have no doubt that many individual householders would be tempted by the process to enter into some sort of annual debate about whether the Government should revalue that particular year according to whether they would win or lose&#151;the hon. Gentleman mentioned winners and losers&#151;by that specific set of figures. That would not offer any prospect of a sound basis on which to make the important decision of when to revalue.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_212">The right way forward is for the Government, in the light of the Lyons inquiry and our response to that, to propose and justify a date for revaluation to Parliament, and for Parliament to consider the merits of the date and the justification by the process of debating the affirmative order for which the Bill provides. On that basis, I ask hon. Members to oppose the amendment if the hon. Gentleman pushes it to a Division.


</p>








<p><a name="st_440"><a name="51201-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 The amendment has a superficial attraction. If one reads it quickly and not too deeply, it sounds rather good, especially to those of us who would love Secretaries of State to come to the House as frequently as possible to give an account of themselves. Goodness knows, some of them do it little enough. However, on reflection I am not sure whether the amendment would work in that way. On what basis would the Secretary of State report after having made the decision? How would the reasons that the Secretary of State would be obliged to give, under the amendment, be communicated to the House? You and I can bet, Mr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, that it would not be through an oral statement, because these days we have the trendy new process, which was sold to us as an improvement, called the written ministerial statement. More and more ministerial statements are smuggled on to the Order Paper in written form, which means that nobody can question them. I can predict with absolute certainty that that will be the vehicle chosen by Secretaries of State to fulfil the requirements of the first part of the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_213">One immediately runs into a difficulty. If I thought that there was any way of getting any Minister to come to the House, give a proper account of himself and be questioned, I would be all for it. I would not mind if the House spent almost all its time questioning Ministers on this and that&#151;it would give us less time to pass increasingly silly Bills from the Government and elsewhere. I have no objection in principle to mechanisms whereby Ministers must come to the House and give reasons, but that is not what the amendment says. It leaves unspecified the way in which reasons would be given to the House for the decision taken once a year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_441"><a name="51201-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend refers to once a year, but does he accept that, if we read the amendment carefully, it will be possible for the review to be done in December of one year and in January the following year, thereby negating the whole purpose of it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_442"><a name="51201-33_spnew4"><b> Mr. Forth: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>








<p><a name="st_457"><a name="51201-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I draw your attention to an announcement on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister? It states that the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons has announced in Parliament that the statements on the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 478</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provisional 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&nbsp;settlements will be made on 5&nbsp;December by the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas). I am confident that you made no such announcement today, and nor did any of your colleagues. What worries me is that the office of Deputy Speaker might be sullied by the squalid manoeuvrings of the ODPM. Is there anything that you can do to direct the Minister to change the website forthwith?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051201/debtext/51201-35.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_458"><a name="51201-35_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We have already had some confusion this afternoon, when the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) referred to the Deputy Speaker as the Deputy Prime Minister. It seems that a mistake has been made and I will correct it immediately. The website should of course refer to the Deputy Leader of the House, who made the announcement during business questions&#151;hardly the secret slipping out of an announcement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_459"><a name="51201-35_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) for drawing the House&#039;s attention to this error. I had no idea that my influence stretched so far. At the end of a busy parliamentary week, perhaps we should content ourselves with the thought that to err is human, to forgive is divine.
</p>








<p><a name="st_460"><a name="51201-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. This is emphatically not the end of the parliamentary week because as you well know, important legislation will be before the House tomorrow. I am sure that all Members present will be present tomorrow for that important work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_461"><a name="51201-35_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I perhaps slipped into the thought that it is drawing to the end of my parliamentary week. The House&#039;s arrangements are good enough to allow one Deputy Speaker not to be on duty on a Friday. I know that, as ever, the right hon. Gentleman will be assiduous, as will other Members.

<a name="time_20">
<a name="51201-35_time0"><h5>5.19&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_462"><a name="51201-35_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">I can assure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that your influence reaches to the very heart of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_227">This is of course not the biggest Bill ever to come before this House, but its provisions are important to the future of local government in England. That importance derives from the time and space that they give us to allow Sir Michael Lyons to complete his inquiry into local government function and funding. The Bill also enables the Government and Parliament to consider his recommendations properly. We will be able to consult on them and debate them fully before we move forward with a reformed council tax system and the revaluation that follows from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_228">We debated the Bill extensively on Second Reading&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_463"><a name="51201-35_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but perhaps the hon. Member for Alyn and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 479</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Deeside (Mark Tami) could conduct his business arrangements outside the Chamber, if he is not taking part in the debate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_464"><a name="51201-35_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_229">We also had some interesting exchanges in a short but nevertheless productive Committee stage. Sadly, however, the sensible debate in the House of the principles of revaluation and the relative merits of different timings&#151;and indeed of local area revaluations, the subject of the amendment moved earlier by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)&#151;has been in contrast in recent weeks to a stream of the most ridiculous misinformation and scaremongering promulgated through certain sections of the popular press.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_230">It is sad, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I have to inform you and the House that I am told by the Valuation Office Agency that those stories have given rise to serious concerns amongst agency staff. They are worried that, in going about their legal business and carrying out the duties given to them by the House&#151;and by the Opposition when they were in power and introduced the Local Government Finance Act 1992&#151;they may face verbal, and at worst physical, attack by members of the public. Perhaps not surprisingly, in the circumstances, those members of the public have themselves been fired up and worried by ridiculous stories about allegations of snooping and invasion of privacy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_465"><a name="51201-35_spnew4"><b> Mike Penning  (Hemel Hempstead) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Minister give some examples of incidents of physical or threatened abuse?
</p>








<p><a name="st_466"><a name="51201-35_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I took care to say that the stories have led VOA staff to fear such attacks, but I will give examples of intimidation in a moment. For example, my officials have received calls from worried householders, most recently an 84-year-old gentleman. He had read the confused and confusing stories and wanted to know why &quot;inspectors&quot; would be coming to his home, forcing their way in and taking photographs of his bedroom and personal belongings. One article said that those photographs would be given to burglars to help them target properties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_231">In all conscience, I cannot allow this situation to remain unchallenged. With your indulgence, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to attempt to put the record straight once again, for the benefit of the House, of members of the public who take such misinformation to be true, and of VOA staff who are daily faced with the consequences of these grossly unfair and misleading reports.
</p>








<p><a name="st_467"><a name="51201-35_spnew6"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 The Minister will accept that most hon. Members who understand this matter know that what he is saying is correct. Does he agree that the problem may have more to do with journalistic licence than with statements made by hon. Members?
</p>








<p><a name="st_468"><a name="51201-35_spmin3"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. Before the Minister replies any further on this point, I must remind him that, although I understand what he is anxious to do, an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 480</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>amendment on this matter was ruled out of order. On Third Reading, we should concentrate on what is in the Bill, and not on what might have been in it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_469"><a name="51201-35_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I hope that you will allow me to give the hon. Member for Mole Valley the assurance that he asked for. I deliberately said in my opening remarks that we had had a sensible and principled debate as the Bill made its way through the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_232">The Bill does three things, and three things only. It effectively postpones the 2007&nbsp;council tax revaluation exercise. Despite the confused messages coming from Opposition spokesmen and spokeswomen, we are postponing revaluation. We have made it clear that we do not believe that it will happen in the lifetime of this Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_233">The Bill removes the requirement for subsequent revaluations to take place at intervals of no more than 10&nbsp;years. Finally, it gives the Secretary of State power to set the date of revaluations by order, subject to affirmative resolution in the House. That is all that it does. There are no proposals for new powers for VOA staff. Indeed, the existing powers to carry out inspections have been in place since before the second world war and were affirmed in the Local Government Finance Act 1992. One of the reasons why those powers exist is to help the VOA to stop people avoiding paying their tax.
</p>








<p><a name="st_470"><a name="51201-35_spnew8"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Many of us feel that a property-based tax for local government purposes has some positive advantages, but one difficulty with the vague way in which the Minister approaches the issue&#151;we do not know whether there will be a revaluation&#151;is that it could make one suspect that he is sliding away from a property-based local government tax.
</p>








<p><a name="st_471"><a name="51201-35_spnew9"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, because it gives me the opportunity to say again in the House that the Government&#039;s policy is to postpone, not to cancel, the revaluation. The property-based council tax is the basis of the review by Sir Michael Lyons and I referred again to the desirability of reforming the council tax system and the measures that go with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_234">The important thing to recognise is that the staff and contractors of the Valuation Office Agency have no powers to forcibly inspect a property for council tax valuation purposes. The VOA does not forcibly enter people&#039;s homes&#151;it does not have either the legal power or the desire to do so. For a member of the VOA to take photographs of the inside of a property would be extremely rare and it would only ever be done with the express permission of the householder. In fact, the VOA has clear guidance for its staff about on-site inspections. It expressly states that photographs can be taken only with the permission of the householder, and must not show people, details of security systems, or valuable possessions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_235">The basis on which property is valued for council tax purposes is the same now as it was when the council tax was introduced. The VOA seeks to assign a market value based on the variables that operate in the market. If one property has a scenic view and another overlooks 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a chemical plant, it is likely that the one with the scenic view will attract a higher relative market value than the one with the view of a chemical plant. There is nothing new or surprising about that. If one property has an attribute that leads to its market value being higher than its next-door neighbour, it is only fair that that should be reflected in its banding. This has always been the case and nothing has changed since 1992.

<a name="stpa_236">As I mentioned in Committee, the fact that the VOA is capturing property attributes in a database using codes does not indicate some sinister, new, Big Brother database. It is simply the most effective and efficient way of capturing data in a form that can be used by the valuation model to come up with a fair and justifiable valuation, on computers, rather than on paper. That process has previously been done manually by a valuation officer. I recall that estate agents had to be hired quickly to ensure that the council tax could be introduced to replace the unpopular poll tax. The only difference now is that the valuation officers have the benefit of modern technology to support them in their task.

People who wilfully refuse to pay may be imprisoned under powers that have existed for many years, but that is entirely different from the position of someone who is unable to pay. Nobody has ever been jailed for being unable to pay, nor would they be.

<a name="stpa_238">Only last weekend, at the very time that winter fuel payments and &#163;200&nbsp;cheques for pensioners&#039; council tax rebates were landing on the doormats of millions of pensioner households, there were stories touting a survey about the impact of council tax increases on the elderly. That survey was mentioned by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)&#151;incidentally, he was the Under-Secretary who introduced the poll tax in the late 1980s&#151;and by its own admission, it excluded council tax benefits and rebates for the elderly.

: The Bill is very narrowly drawn, but it enables the Government to delay revaluation and to choose when it will take place in the future. It has aroused some very strong feelings in the debates this afternoon. This debate on Third Reading is the last opportunity for hon. Members to raise their concerns and put them on the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">The Minister&#039;s first major decision after taking up his post was to put off the revaluation and refer the issue to the Lyons inquiry&#151;much to the dismay of his predecessor, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford). The Government have essentially ensured that the revaluation will not take place before the next general election. So this is not goodbye to revaluation but au revoir, and the British people are highly likely to face a revaluation that significantly increases their council tax bills sooner or later, unless they show their disapproval in the ballot box at the next general election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">Amendment No. 3&nbsp;sought to introduce local revaluation, and we had a long and interesting debate that raised more questions than it answered about the great complexity of revaluation and how to make it fair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">As hon. Members know, the level of council tax is one of our constituents&#039; main concerns, and it occupies much of our time in correspondence and advice surgeries. That makes council tax one of the most explosive political issues that the Government face. Bills have already increased by 26&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. As one person said to me only today:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;I feel as though Dick Turpin raids my bank account every week&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">It was noted on Report that the value of a property is not always a reliable indication of ability to pay. I am sure that the Minister and other hon. Members know of examples of people who are cash poor, yet live in valuable properties. Elderly people, such as surviving spouses, may remain in a family home that has risen in value over the decades, although they have a modest disposable income. However, four working adults might live in a more modest property, so the value of a property is not always a reliable indication of its residents&#039; ability to pay their council tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">The Bill will postpone the revaluation of properties for the purpose of council tax that was to have occurred on 1&nbsp;April 2007, with council tax bills being based on the updated valuations that year. Conservative Members oppose the revaluation, not least in the light of the outcome in Wales. The revaluation in Wales was used as a tool to increase the overall tax take, so it was a stealth tax. If a typical house in England were moved up a band, it would become liable for an extra &#163;257&nbsp;a year on top of any other changes to the council tax bills. Of the 21&nbsp;million homes in England, 7&nbsp;million would be moved 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 483</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>up a band, but only 1.5&nbsp;million would move down a band. The Minister is looking puzzled, so I should explain that those figures have been extrapolated from the experience in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">The Bill does not go far enough. It only postpones revaluation, rather than scrapping it altogether. Approximately &#163;60&nbsp;million of taxpayers&#039; money has already been spent in preparation for revaluation&#151;including on a new computer system&#151;much of which will be wasted. It is ironic that an information technology project that the Government claim is excellent will not be used for its intended purpose. It is not clear whether the cost of the reduction of 1,020&nbsp;staff by June 2006&nbsp;is included in that &#163;60&nbsp;million figure. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">Even more alarming to council tax payers is the worrying fact that revaluation procedures will allow inspectors to enter people&#039;s homes. It is a great pity that the amendment on that matter was not selected for consideration on Report. I do not know whether you will indulge me, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_251">Improvements and maintenance must be budgeted and saved for. If the implication is that improvements to, and the maintenance of, houses will put people in a higher council tax band in the future, will we see falling general standards of upkeep as people wish to avoid paying more council tax? Some of my constituents&#151;ordinary law-abiding people&#151;have already expressed their concern to me about the likelihood of someone knocking on their door and demanding access. That is a worrying element of the revaluation exercise.

<a name="stpa_252">Under this Government, an Englishman&#039;s home is no longer his castle. The Bill will allow the Government to impose a revaluation date through secondary legislation with little debate in Parliament, although that could change the entire funding of council tax. Such a change must be carefully thought through and prepared so that we have a properly balanced tax on property and services, not simply property.

 Last Thursday, in answer to a question that I put to him during business questions, the Leader of the House said that he thought that the idea of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 484</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>programming Report stage and Third Readings raised constitutional questions. I am not sure that I agree. A lack of strict programming of this afternoon&#039;s business might have made things much worse. During the debate on amendment No. 3, I was fascinated to see what it is like to attend a meeting of the 1922&nbsp;committee, but the Bill survived that unfortunate experience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_253">The Minister of Communities and Local Government emphasised on Second Reading, and the Minister for Local Government repeated in Committee, that the context of the Bill was the revision of the remit of the Lyons review of local government to encompass function in addition to finance. That context has now changed and we are looking forward to a White Paper on local government which will take into account not only finance and function, but structure. I welcomed that announcement, especially as I called for a White Paper last Wednesday in Westminster Hall. I had no idea that the Government were so responsive to Opposition calls made in Westminster Hall debates. The Bill started out as a small part of a large picture and has now become a very small part of a very big picture. I hope to see a much more long-term constitutional approach to local government, rather than the short-term political approach that produced the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_254">As we have said all along, the Bill has its uses. We stated our support for it on Second Reading and we shall continue that support on Third Reading. We support it largely because our proposed reform of local government finance would involve the cancelling of the next revaluation, for the obvious reason that a local income tax requires no property valuations of any sort. Whether the Bill is passed or not, council tax will remain a bad tax. As the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) said, one of the great problems of council tax is its weak relationship to ability to pay, and revaluation does not affect that much. A group of people who are rarely mentioned in our debates are tenants, especially tenants of councils or local housing associations. It is often assumed that council tax is a type of wealth tax&#151;that it is related to the wealth of the taxpayer. In fact, for a quarter of the population that is not so and any revaluation does not affect that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_478"><a name="51201-36_spnew5"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on what was said on Second Reading and consider the possibility of changing the way in which ability to pay is assessed, combining that with a broad-scale income assessment, and feeding it into the funding formula in place of the current banding system? The resulting tax would have the advantages in terms of collectability that council tax has because it is property based. I believe that that would blow the Liberals&#039; suggestion out of the water.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051201/debtext/51201-37.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_479"><a name="51201-37_spnew0"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposal is a halfway house. It is technically possible&#151;in fact, it would be part of a reform that would introduce a different sort of taxation; it would be part of the equalisation necessary for the introduction of a local income tax. However, it does not go far enough. Collectability was discussed in Committee, but a point that is often missed, although the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) made it, is that often the published statistics on collection assume that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 485</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the tax is properly due as recorded, but if a lot of people claim falsely to be living as single people there is a lot of evasion going on that the statistics do not pick up.
</p>








<p><a name="st_480"><a name="51201-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I do not wish to misrepresent the hon. Gentleman, but I think he said a few minutes ago that there was very little discussion of housing association and council tenants during consideration of the Bill. May I correct him? On Report, some of us mentioned such people, not least in the context of housing redevelopment. Does he accept that some of those people at least get full or partial council tax benefit, which helps to ameliorate the effects of council tax on people in those categories?
</p>








<p><a name="st_481"><a name="51201-37_spnew2"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 What the hon. Gentleman says is, in part, true. Council tax benefit partly offsets the regressive nature of the tax, but the tax remains the most regressive major tax in the Government&#039;s taxation armoury, even after the use of council tax benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_255">Revaluation would probably make the council tax even more unpopular. That is presumably why the Bill allows revaluation to be called off. On the other hand, failure to revalue makes the council tax more unfair and more out of date. That sums up one of the reasons why we oppose council tax. It is simultaneously bad to revalue and bad not to revalue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_256">I am still puzzled by the Conservative party&#039;s position on the Bill. Conservative Members voted against Second Reading. The effect of voting against, if it had been taken up in all parts of the House, would have been to defeat the Bill. If the Bill had been defeated, the present law would remain. The present law mandates a revaluation in 2007. By contrast, when the Committee considered whether clause 1, which is really the only clause in the Bill, should stand part of the Bill, the official Opposition failed to divide the Committee. I shall be fascinated to see what they do tonight on Third Reading. I hope they discovered the error of their ways on Second Reading and have realised that others may have noticed that what they proposed was, in effect, to carry on with revaluation, which is the opposite of their announced policy.

<a name="51201-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_259">The Bill has just two clauses. It is one of the shortest that I have debated in my time in the House, but it serves an important purpose in that it delays the revaluation of properties for council tax purposes in England. In a briefing note that was produced in October, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors pointed out that the proposed revaluation which was to be undertaken by the Revaluation Office Agency would have represented


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;the largest exercise of its kind in the world&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_260">As such, the decision to delay it, which the Bill facilitates, represents one of the first major post-election climbdowns by the Government&#151;although given recent events, I trust that it will by no means be the last.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_261">It is a truism that no one likes paying taxes, but the level of council tax, even on the existing valuations, which will run for several more years at least, is one of the major features of my constituency mailbag. That is particularly true in the spring, when council tax demands go out, and in responses from pensioners, many of whom live on relatively fixed incomes and find that their council tax bill is their biggest single monthly outlay, particularly if they have paid off their mortgage. Many people experience considerable difficulty in meeting those bills, so at least they will not face the added burden of a revaluation in the short term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_262">As part of the debate on this Bill has related to the subject and process of billing, I want to make a few brief points on how changes in the billing system have affected public attitudes to the spending of funds by precepting authorities. The breaking-down of components on the overall council tax bill into individual line items, such as policing and fire and civil protection, has, I think, been a positive move on the whole. It certainly tends to concentrate constituents&#039; minds on how money is actually spent on those particular services, once they are itemised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_263">For instance, when I was first elected to this House back in 2001, I think that some of those items were still effectively subsumed within the overall totals. However, it is interesting to note that now that those have been broken out, constituents have started to ask more specific questions about how such itemised money is being spent. I see that one or two Labour Members are nodding in assent to that proposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_264">Policing precepts, for example, have generated quite a bit of correspondence from my constituents in the past few years. Indeed, one of the reasons why I am so opposed to the regionalisation of police forces in East Anglia is that Essex has a relatively low police precept compared with other East Anglian forces, so any regional merger would probably lead to a rounding-up of precepts, which could lead to proportionately higher increases in Essex on the policing precept and thus on the overall bottom-line level of council tax. I shall say nothing more about that subject this afternoon for fear 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 487</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of straying out of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but suffice to say that people pay enough council tax in Essex as it is, without having to pay an even higher bottom-line figure to prop up unpopular reforms that have little or no public support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_265">I suspect that part of the Government&#039;s rationale behind backing away from short term revaluation has been the howl of protest that followed the change to the formula determining the level of grant paid to local authorities by Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury. Because between two thirds and three quarters of the eventual council tax is determined by that level of grant, however the individual properties within the local authority are banded, any changes to the formula clearly have important implications for the remaining element, which has to be raised directly by the local authority. That then falls across the council tax base, which we now know is not likely to be revalued in the short term.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_266">I must challenge the Minister on a point that he raised on Report. Any alteration in the grant formula normally creates winners and losers, and the change, which took place a few years ago, from the standard spending assessment system to the revised formula spending share system certainly did that all right. The Minister contended on Report that there are very few specific examples where that has been a problem. I shall answer his point directly: most of the losers in the transfer of resources that took place in the switch from SSA to FSS were not exclusively, but overwhelmingly local authorities&#151;both county and district councils&#151;concentrated in the south-east of England; most of the gainers, although not exclusively, were urban and metropolitan authorities in the midlands and the north of England. There was effectively an important shift of resources from the south-east to the midlands and the north, which had important knock-on effects on the council tax bills subsequently levied on council tax payers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_267">In the year in which the switch took place, the county council precept in Essex went up by 16&nbsp;per cent. in one hit, because millions and millions of pounds in grant were removed from Essex and given to Labour&#039;s friends in the midlands and the north.

 The hon. Gentleman would be fairer if he acknowledged that the level of grant to Essex has increased in line with inflation or above it in every year since 1997. He can hardly say, therefore, that the increase in council tax was the result of taking away funding. He says that the Government were accused of having an underlying political motivation. That implies 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 Perhaps part of the answer is that even if the Minister is right that Essex got more in percentage terms, its proportion of the total sum available dropped, while many of the northern councils, especially in urban areas, received more money through the change to the SSA, particularly as many of the indices were subjective rather than objective and therefore able to be manipulated.

Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), we discussed whether, if we do eventually revalue at some point in the future, there would be any merit in running pilot revaluations in a few parts of the country to test the effects. I cannot imagine that many areas would rush forward to volunteer for that. Nevertheless, I suggest to the Minister that there might be some merit in doing it, not least to try to persuade people that the system is not bent. Whatever the Government were trying to do, a lot of the resistance arose because, given what had happened in Wales and with the grant shift, many people genuinely felt that the revaluation would not be fair. I think that the Minister would privately concede that. I make this as an entirely non-partisan suggestion.

I hope that the Lyons review will come up with an equitable formula, but if it is unable to do so, I hope and trust that an incoming Conservative Government will solve the problem.

<p><a name="st_495"><a name="51201-38_spnew6"><b> Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods  (City of Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 I am grateful to have obtained the Adjournment debate for which I asked because I am concerned about the present and future availability of national health service dental services in Durham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_273">Twenty dentists in Durham provide NHS care but some of them do so only for the under-18s and other exempt cases under a personal dental services contract. All practices in my City of Durham constituency have currently closed their lists to new NHS patients. I understand that the nearest open list is at Chester-le-Street community hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_274">Problems with the availability of NHS dental care in Durham are unfortunately not new. In response to previous representations from me and my predecessor, the primary care trust agreed to employ a salaried dentist directly. That appointment was made but that NHS list is also closed, albeit temporarily.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_275">The PCT intended to take on another salaried dentist and confirmed that in a meeting with me in the summer. In the event, that did not happen for a variety of practical reasons and the PCT does not currently have the financial resources to support it. Discussions with dentists about expanding their NHS provision are currently being held up until further details of the new general dental services contact are known.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_276">Durham, like many commuter towns, faces a problem of the demand for dental services being higher than the size of its population base would suggest was necessary because many people who work in the city but do not live there register with a dentist. The PCT argues that that makes planning for the correct amount of dental services difficult. It also has the effect of pricing local, low-income people out of dental care because many of those who come into the city for employment can afford to be private patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_277">The problem of &quot;privatisation&quot; has been happening for some years, with several dentists &quot;encouraging&quot; or forcing their NHS patients to become private ones. Sometimes lists are completely closed to NHS patients.
</p>








<p><a name="st_496"><a name="51201-38_spnew7"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 I am glad that the hon. Lady has secured such an important debate. When I listen to her speaking about Durham, I realise that her comments apply to Wellingborough, which suffers from exactly the same problem of dentists opting to go private. My constituents have to leave the constituency to find an NHS dentist.
</p>








<p><a name="st_497"><a name="51201-38_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. We cannot widen the debate by intervention. The debate, which the hon. Lady has won, is about dentistry in Durham.

 I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I have enormous sympathy for the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone).

<a name="51201-38_para10">

<br>&nbsp;<br>patients, did not inform the PCT, and told his patients that if they wished to re-register with him, they would have to do that on a private basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_279">I would like the Minister of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), to make some comments about how we can encourage dentists to take their social responsibilities to provide NHS care more seriously, especially as they are trained and supported by the NHS. I know that that applies only to some dentists, but I would welcome her comments on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_280">I can see that the Government have taken action to try to address the problem of a shortage of NHS dentists by employing more dentists, setting and recently achieving a target of 1,000&nbsp;new dentists, and I know that there are 170&nbsp;extra training places this year in dental schools&#151;a 25&nbsp;per cent. increase on 2004&#150;05. I also understand that additional capital money is being made available, and discussions are taking place about a new dental school. But those measures, welcome though they are, are not delivering on the ground for the people in Durham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_281">In addition to the extra resources now being put into NHS dental services, I understand that the Government are placing a great deal of faith in the general dental services contract being introduced from April 2006, which they say is a large part of the solution to current problems. Feedback from the Durham and Chester-le-Street PCT, however, does not fill me with optimism. Already the PCT has received one letter of resignation giving the reason as the introduction of the new contact. The primary care development manager has stated that she has had many discussions with dentists over the past few months and she has yet to hear a positive view of the contract.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_282">Orthodontists are also very unhappy with the proposals relating to them. Incidentally, Durham has only one orthodontist practice, and the waiting time for treatment is currently 20&nbsp;months, which is also very unsatisfactory. Anecdotal evidence suggests that once dentists receive their contract values and activity levels from the Dental Practice Board, which I understand is happening soon, most will not wish to renegotiate their NHS contracts. The majority are unwilling to commit themselves without that information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_283">Obviously, I find this information very worrying. Faced with a potential sudden large reduction in the amount of dental capacity available on the NHS, the PCT will need to provide a direct PCT service, but currently the PCT does not have the capacity either in terms of dentists or surgeries to be able to re-provide that service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_284">Patients involved in a PCT consultation exercise also had some difficulties with the new contracts. They seemed to be concerned that dentists would no longer hold lists of registered patients as there would be no long-term responsibility for the quality of care provided. They were concerned that patients might not be able to receive continuity of care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_285">Patients also feel that the way that charges are structured in the new contract&#151;with a fixed price for fillings, for example, no matter how many they have&#151;would encourage people to wait until they require a large number of fillings before visiting the dentist. That 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 492</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would probably apply more to those on lower incomes, creating inequality in dental care. That sentiment was also reflected in consultations with the professionals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_286">The PCT and the British Dental Association acknowledge that the new charging system is simpler, and that there will be winners and losers in terms of cost&#151;those requiring one-off, more intensive treatment are likely to be the winners, and those needing regular lower-level treatment are likely to be the losers. The British Dental Association maintains that we shall need to train yet more dentists and other dental team members. It notes that demand for dentists is outstripping supply, which is why dentists are closing their books.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_287">According to the BDA, in 2005, 15&nbsp;per cent. of general dental practitioners were not taking on new child patients, 37&nbsp;per cent. were not taking on new exempt adults, and 15&nbsp;per cent. were not taking on new paying adults&#151;a significant rise since 2000. It is also concerned that additional funding might not reach front-line dental services when PCTs become responsible for commissioning from April 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_288">The BDA acknowledges that the value of the private market has grown rapidly over the past 10&nbsp;years and that NHS care still outstrips private practice, but it suggests that the move towards private care is prompted by a lack of investment in NHS dentistry. Evidence shows that dentists do not typically earn more in private practice than in the NHS, but that they can earn similar amounts of money while being able to spend longer with patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para21">
<a name="stpa_289">I think that it is fair to say that reaction to the new general dental services and personal dental services contracts has been mixed. More than anything, dentists appear to want a break from the treadmill so that the link is broken between treatments provided and remuneration received. The view being expressed by the BDA, however, is that under the new contracts dentists will lose the flexibility to work at their own pace but will be unable to get off the treadmill. The basis of the new system is that the contractor will complete a number of units of dental activity, set by the local PCT, in return for a set monthly payment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para22">
<a name="stpa_290">Dentists are also concerned because the new proposals do not encourage disease prevention or the maintenance of good oral hygiene, as preventive care does not specifically attract units of dental activity. They are also of the view that the new system has not been sufficiently piloted before being rolled out across the country. They note that although one or two aspects of the new GDS contract proposals have been tested in the PDS agreements, the UDA output system is, they contend, as yet entirely untested. The BDA maintains that the shortage of dentists is likely to continue for some time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-38_para23">
<a name="stpa_291">I raised those more general points about the contract and work force planning matters because I should like reassurance from the Minister about the likely impact of the new contracts in terms of improving access to NHS dental services in Durham. I should like her to comment on the steps that she might take to alleviate the current unacceptable problem in Durham&#151;that no NHS facility is available to new patients. What support will be given to PCTs directly to employ dentists if the mixed economy of dental care does not deliver enough NHS capacity post-April 2006&nbsp;and they need to employ salaried dentists to achieve NHS output?

<p><a name="st_499"><a name="51201-39_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) on securing the debate. The topic is not only important but timely. As we speak, general dental services dentists&#039; individual contract values are being sent to them and details of the new system of charges for patients and the regulations governing the new GDS and personal dental services contracts will be released shortly. My hon. Friend pointed out that many dentists were waiting for some of that information before committing themselves. They will now be able to see exactly what the new contract means for them. I hope that that will address many of the issues that she raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_293">My hon. Friend referred to the situation in Durham and I want to touch on some of the improvements that have been made there, bearing in mind that there are still some difficulties, as she pointed out. I want also to talk about how local commissioning will give all primary care trusts assistance in developing local dental services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_294">As my hon. Friend rightly said, there have been severe access problems. We have tried to address them through a variety of means, including domestic and international recruitment and the expansion of personal dental services. In Durham, the PCT took various steps to deal with the problems. It appointed two salaried dentists a year ago and expanded personal dental services. In Durham and Chester-le-Street, six of the 23&nbsp;practices&#151;about 26&nbsp;per cent.&#151;are in PDS, which is close to the national average of about 28&nbsp;per cent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_500"><a name="51201-39_spnew0"><b> Dr. Blackman-Woods: </b> 
 Will the Minister give some further clarification about the two dentists directly employed by the PCT? Only one of them is employed in City of Durham. The PCT had intended to employ two salaried dentists in my constituency, but for the reasons I gave earlier it was unable to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_501"><a name="51201-39_spnew1"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The PCT area may be wider than that of the constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_295">The PDS practices have a combined contract value of &#163;1.78&nbsp;million, which includes growth funding of &#163;558,000. That is new money, and it has been made available by the Department of Health to my hon. Friend&#039;s local PCT. As she said, there are problems, but those practices were treating almost 24,000&nbsp;patients at the end of October. The roll-out of the new dental contracts will provide an opportunity for the PCT to look at the PDS agreements and make sure that the units of dental activity agreed with the practice reflect significant recent growth. May I emphasise the fact that the PDS contracts are pilots from which lessons have been learned? In the next few months, we will sit down with dentists to look at levels of activity under PDS contracts to see whether there is room for growth in certain areas. The PDS pilots, combined with the new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, provide greater flexibility. For example, patients do not necessarily need to see their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 494</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>dentist every six months&#151;the time between check-ups can be up to 24&nbsp;months. The lesson of the PDS pilots is that there is flexibility and room for growth in certain areas. That is one of the benefits of the new system, and it gives PCTs local flexibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_296">My hon. Friend&#039;s PCT received &#163;65,000&nbsp;from the &#163;50&nbsp;million that the Government made available to improve access last year. That sum funded 1,300&nbsp;additional patient contracts across 10&nbsp;local practices in the area. The PCT must await details of next year&#039;s budget before it makes further NHS dentistry commitments. However, I can assure my hon. Friend that those details will be released shortly, allowing the PCT and local dentists to look at the way in which local commissioning can be used for local investments. They can look at local priorities to ensure that dental services meet all local oral health needs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_502"><a name="51201-39_spnew2"><b> Sir Paul Beresford  (Mole Valley) (Con):</b> 
 I have a slight interest in our debate, although it is becoming slighter and slighter as I continue my parliamentary career. I hope that we can apply a little lateral thinking. At the moment, we look at the number of patients who are seen, contacts and so on. However, we have a mixed dental service, and patients can be treated on the national health service or privately. Dentists can offer different treatments for the same disease, but most of those treatments are available only outside the NHS. It is important that dentists remain with the NHS, because patients should have a choice as to whether they receive treatment on the NHS or privately. A treadmill system has been introduced&#151;I know that the Minister does not entirely agree&#151;and I urge her to reconsider the proposals and provide flexibility so that more patients can approach more dentists for NHS treatment if they wish to receive it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_503"><a name="51201-39_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I contest the notion that this is another treadmill. It is important that, under the new system, dentists can continue to undertake a mix of private, public and NHS work. The new contracts will reflect the way in which they have previously worked. We expect dentists who have recently undertaken units of activity or interventions to make a reasonable commitment to the same level of activity with the same cohort of patients, although we accept that they may undertake a mixture of private and NHS work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_297">My hon. Friend is concerned about access problems caused by the fact that people outside the city are registered with local dentists. That has been the case for many years, and we have no plans to replace the system because doing so would require many people to find different dentists from those to whom they have become accustomed. It is true that the system is not based on residency, but changing it could affect continuity of care for existing patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_298">My hon. Friend asked what would happen if dentists did not take up the new contract. The point of the changes that we are making is this: in the past, when a dentist has left the NHS the money has returned to the centre; now, the primary care trust will retain it locally. That money must be spent on NHS dentistry, which means that more dentists can be brought into the area if there is a shortage. It can be spent on salaried dental services if the PCT thinks that appropriate, although such services usually involve community dental access 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 495</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>centres and the like. PCTs can also commission additional services from existing dentists. The money will be there to meet local needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_299">As my hon. Friend said, in the longer term we are reversing the closure of two dental schools. The British Dental Association has spoken of the need to increase the number of dentists, and there is such a need&#151;although more dentists are registered, fewer of them work for the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_300">My hon. Friend is right about what we hope to achieve with the new system. We have discussed with dentists the need to move away from the drill and fill treadmill and to introduce a much simpler charging system. I hope that that will result in a commitment to NHS dentistry. We want to rectify many of the problems that dentists say they have experienced with earlier contracts. Our recruitment of some 1,400&nbsp;more dentists over the past year demonstrates that there are dentists out there who wish to work for the NHS, but we will continue the programme if some dentists do not want to join in our reforms.

<p><a name="st_505"><a name="51201-39_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_506"><a name="51201-39_spnew6"><b> Dr. Blackman-Woods: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister. Will she say a little more about why she and her Department are so confident that the dentists will be happy with the contract? The consultation in Durham revealed that no dentists were in favour of it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_507"><a name="51201-39_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Over the past few months, the acting chief dental officer has met a number of dentists who have been awaiting further information about the contract values and the regulations that will accompany the contract. I think that there has been a certain amount of misinformation about exactly what is expected. For instance, dentists thought that they would no longer be able to have children only or exempt only lists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_301">The aim of the regulations that we have submitted for consultation is to ban an unacceptable practice that has been raised by many Members in the House. Dentists were saying &quot;We will treat your children if you will register as a private patient.&quot; It will be perfectly possible in future for PCTs to say to dentists &quot;Yes, you can have a children only list.&quot; PCTs should be able to look at what is happening locally and say whether it is acceptable. We have tried to tackle a position that we considered unacceptable. Dentists thought that none of them would be able to have those lists under the new contract, which was not the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_302">One of the other issues that came up was a feeling that dentists would no longer be able to do some private work and some NHS work. Again, that is not the case. They will be able to mix the two. We must be clear that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2005 : Column 496</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we are offering a contract under which if NHS dentists give a reasonable commitment to the NHS, they will be able to earn about &#163;80,000&nbsp;a year, and up to another &#163;60,000&nbsp;can go towards the expenses of their practice. That is guaranteed for three years, for something like 5&nbsp;per cent. less activity. We are anxious to ensure that if there is room for expansion, the units of dental activity would cover it. I do not think that that is an unfair deal. Nor do I think that it is bad that we are simplifying the system of patient charges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_303">My hon. Friend suggested that preventive care might not be possible, but the new system of banded charges specifically allows for preventive oral health advice. That is clearly covered as part of the treatment provided, which is exactly what dentists have been asking us to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_304">My hon. Friend asked about the current provision of orthodontic services in Durham, which I accept is not ideal. The strategic health authority is looking into the matter and there has been a big increase in the number of orthodontic treatments over the past few years, although there is no doubt that there are problems in some areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_305">Today, the Department has issued guidance on commissioning specialist services, with particular reference to orthodontics. There is clear guidance on determining need, on targeting resources and on how to use the new contract arrangements both for general dentist practitioners and dentists with specialist orthodontic expertise. We hope that that will go some way towards relieving the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_306">I hope that my hon. Friend will be assured that we are moving forward very quickly. I accept the fact that some of her local dentists may have been anxious to know the details of the new contract and what their own contract values were, but I hope that in the coming period we will be able to show them exactly what the benefits are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_307">I reiterate that this is all about making the charging system simpler and taking dentists off the drill and fill treadmill. I think that it is a good deal in return for a good commitment to the NHS, and will ensure that dentists can do preventive work. That is built into the contract and the charging system. It is guaranteed for three years and it replaces the 400&nbsp;current charges and the way in which dentists have been paid for those, with fixed monthly income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51201-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_308">I feel that that is a good deal and it goes alongside the increases in training that we have already started and the fact that we will increase dental schools. Altogether, I hope that dentists in my hon.
