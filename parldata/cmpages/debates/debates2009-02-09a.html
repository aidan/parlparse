 I wonder whether the Home Secretary has seen the comments in the weekend press by Professor David Nutt, the chairman of the Home Office Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs? He says that in his view, ecstasy is less dangerous than horse riding. I will not ask the Home Secretary whether she has tried the drug, or whether she has ridden a horse, but I want to know when she plans to meet Professor Nutt to tell him whether she agrees with his comments.</p>

 I spoke to Professor Nutt about his comments this morning. I told him that I was surprised and profoundly disappointed by the article. I am sure that most people would simply not accept the link that he makes up in his article between horse riding and illegal drug-taking. That makes light of a serious problem, trivialises the dangers of drugs, shows insensitivity to the families of victims of ecstasy, and sends the wrong message to young people about the dangers of drugs. I made it clear to Professor Nutt that I felt that his comments went beyond the scientific advice that I expect from him as chair of the ACMD. He apologised to me for his comments, and I have asked him to apologise to the families of the victims of ecstasy, too.</p>

 Last month, the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse published figures that reveal that nearly 25,000 young people aged under 18 are in treatment for drug and alcohol problems. Is that not an indictment of the fact that the Government did not do more earlier on drug prevention, and the fact that just 12 per cent. of the drugs budget was spent on prevention? There is no evaluation at all of many of the activities.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise the progress made by those working in the drugs field over the past 10 or 11 years. Overall drug use and class A drug use among young people are now at their lowest levels ever, as measured by the British crime survey. Among school pupils, overall drug use has fallen. The rate of frequent drug use among pupils has also fallen. The people involved in that work should be congratulated, unlike the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party, which proposes cuts to the Home Office budget; that would certainly impact on our ability to counter the harms caused by drugs. I hope that he will back up his words with words advising his Front-Bench team to put back that money.</p>

 I welcome the Home Secretary&#146;s remarks on the comments made by Professor Nutt, but will she go a little further and suggest to him that the sport of horse riding provides discipline, whereas drug-taking not only wrecks&#151;and indeed ends&#151;lives, but fuels crime?

 I hope the hon.

One of the issues arising from that is how we record any instances&#151;the one and only instance&#151;of cannabis warning, and we are working with the National Policing Improvement Agency in order to make sure that it is possible to do that in future.</p>

 We spend considerable sums of money on counter-terrorism. We have expanded the budget for counter-terrorism activity across the country. Indeed, the counter-terrorism unit in the west midlands, my hon. Friend&#146;s area, is one of the most effective in the country at co-ordinating activity, both in its own area and nationally. Let me also say that counter-terrorism policing is not done instead of neighbourhood policing; it is done with neighbourhood policing because, as I said earlier, if we want to tackle terrorism, we need effective neighbourhood policing, as well as counter-terrorism policing.</p>

That shows the importance of enforcement, which is a key part of the tackling knives action programme. As my hon.

Local residents were less likely to say that drunken and rowdy behaviour was a problem.

People who go into a supermarket can buy any amount of alcohol and drink it on the street, but those who go into a pub are disciplined and subject to the survey of the staff of that pub.

 I had a couple of good nights out in Bournemouth over the Christmas break, although unfortunately the hon. Gentleman was not with me at the time. I agree with him that the Dorset constabulary are doing an extremely good job, which has resulted in a reduction in crime. They are working hard to ensure that Bournemouth is&#151;as I discovered for myself&#151;a good place to visit as a tourist, but I feel sure that the cut of 38 police officers that would be a consequence of his party&#146;s proposed Home Office spending cuts would only make that job more difficult.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. During Home Office questions this afternoon, the Home Secretary criticised Professor David Nutt, a distinguished scientist and an independent adviser to the Government&#151;as established in statute&#151;who writes about his areas of expertise in academic journals. Is it in order for the Home Secretary to criticise him here, where he cannot answer back, for views that he has expressed in scientific publications? If so, what is the future of academic freedom or independent scientific advice if the Home Secretary can demand that scientists apologise for their published academic findings and views?</p>

 I invite the House to approve the revised guide to the rules relating to the conduct of Members as set out in the fourth report of the Committee on Standards and Privileges, which we published last week. It paves the way for an early end to dual reporting, as well as making a number of other changes which I believe will be welcomed in all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0902097000164">Coming as it does shortly after the adoption of the new Green Book and the setting up of the new Committee on Members&#146; Allowances, today&#146;s debate gives us a opportunity to adopt a reporting regime that is intended to provide the House and our constituents outside with transparency and reassurance on our interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0902097000165">The code of conduct and the guide to the rules are essential components of the House&#146;s regulatory machinery. It is vital that hon. Members have a clear understanding of what the code states and what the rules mean, in order that they may comply with them. The reporting regime, which is one of the most demanding in the world, needs to be overhauled from time to time to ensure that it is both effective and proportionate. The Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended that such an overhaul should be carried out once in each Parliament, and today&#146;s package of proposals represents the overhaul in the present Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0902097000166">In addition to making changes that relate to the end of dual reporting, the revised guide clarifies existing rules, implements earlier decisions of the House&#151;for example, on the employment of family members&#151;and responds to developments outside this place, such as the  <br>

development of new forms of investment vehicles. The final section of the revised guide sets out in greater detail than before the procedure for considering and investigating complaints that a Member has breached the rules. Many of the changes, however, and most of the red print in the revised guide are there to end dual reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0902097000167">The requirement to report donations to both the Registrar of Members&#146; Interests and the Electoral Commission was, as my Committee&#146;s report points out, an unintended consequence of the legislation passed in 2000. Problems came to light in 2005&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The House may have heard the aside from the Lord Chancellor, admitting culpability for such dual reporting. The problems came to light in 2005 when my Committee considered a report from the Commissioner for Standards on the inadvertent failure of my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) to register donations in the Register of Members&#146; Interests, although he had fully reported those same donations to the Electoral Commission and they were in the public domain. The Committee concluded:</p>
<a name="90209-0004.htm_brev6"><a name="0902097000399"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It would in our view be better...if a single system, operating under the authority of the Commissioner, could be devised to replace the present arrangements, which would enable Members to discharge their obligations in relation to making donations public through a single declaration.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0902097000168">An attempt was made to achieve that during the passage of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, but the complexity of the subject was underestimated at the time. Much of the past two years has been taken up with lengthy and detailed discussions that have drilled deep into the substrata of electoral law. With the successful conclusion of those discussions&#151;I am grateful to the registrar, Alda Barry, and the Clerk of my Committee, Steve Priestley, for their work on this&#151;we have now reached the point where the end of dual reporting is in sight and the &#147;one-stop shop&#148; called for by the Committee in 2005 will soon be able to open for business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0902097000169">The main focus of the discussions over the last year or so has been the Electoral Commission&#146;s very proper concern to ensure that we do not create a fresh anomaly in relation to Members who stand against non-Members in elections outside this place&#151;for example, as Mayor of London or as a Member of a devolved Assembly. The end of dual reporting will mean that such Members are no longer subject to the same set of criminal sanctions as are other candidates. There are various legislative means of keeping the playing field level, but they are so complex and so convoluted that they resemble a steamroller being used to flatten a molehill. The Electoral Commission has agreed that such a legislative solution would be disproportionate, given the very few cases involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0902097000170">This agreement is important, because dual reporting cannot end until the Electoral Commission has indicated that it is satisfied it can get all the information it needs from the Register of Members&#146; Interests. I have been assured by Jenny Watson, who now chairs the Electoral Commission, that this revised guide will provide the assurances the commission seeks in order to sign off on dual reporting. It will then be for the Justice Secretary to lay a commencement order before Parliament. In its report, my Committee expresses the hope that this process will be completed by the end of June, and I rather hope that it may be completed well before then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0902097000171">Members may well ask, &#147;Well, what is the catch?&#148; I do not believe there is a catch, but there is certainly some give as well as some take. Members will need to provide more information to the registrar than they did previously. However, this will be offset by the removal of any need to report the same information to the commission, and a single form will be provided for this purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0902097000172">We considered whether to recommend alignment of the thresholds used by the House with those set down in statute. In several categories of the rules, the House requires interests with a value greater than 1 per cent. of parliamentary salary to be reported&#151;at present, that sum is &#163;633&#151;whereas the statutory threshold tends to be set at a more generous level, which is currently &#163;1,000. The 1 per cent. threshold was agreed by the House when the rules were last revised in 2002 and, in my view, it was set at an appropriate level. It provides a high degree of transparency in our reporting and, because it is indexed, it automatically rises in line with our pay. The Committee&#146;s view is that this remains the right way to set the majority of the thresholds and we have not, therefore, recommended any change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0902097000173">In relation to category 4, however&#151;which covers most political donations and is the main area of overlap between the House&#146;s requirements and those set down in statute&#151;the threshold has been fixed at &#163;1,000. Members will have seen that the motion provides for the threshold in category 4 to be tied to the level specified in the legislation, which, at the moment, happens to be &#163;1,000. The Committee had not considered proposing this change, but it is a sensible adjustment that will avoid creating a differential between the House&#146;s thresholds and the statutory ones, and I therefore support it. Any proposal to increase that threshold would come from the Government, but would be subject to parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0902097000174">Although hon. Members will no longer have to provide information on permissible donations and loans directly to the Electoral Commission, the commission will remain under a statutory obligation to publish all the relevant information as soon as is reasonably practicable. That means that the commission will publish information on its register within one month of receipt. In order to avoid a four-month gap opening up in the commission&#146;s register, it will be necessary to return to the previous practice of requiring Members to register their interests within one month of their election or re-election to the House, rather than within three months, as at present. Separate deadlines for information required under statute and for information required under resolutions of the House would create confusion and lead to error, and the Committee therefore considers it preferable to have a single deadline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0902097000175">In order for the Electoral Commission to obtain the information it needs to keep its register up to date, its officials will be granted controlled access to the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the sole purpose of gathering the information to which they are entitled. After a general election, the commission will need to publish some of this information in its register before the first edition of the House&#146;s register is published. A memorandum of understanding is being drawn up with the Electoral Commission, and it will specify the limited circumstances in which access may be granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0902097000176">Members will also need to continue to report impermissible donations, or donations from unidentified sources, directly to the commission, which will remain the sole authority on such matters. All the substantive changes are described in the Committee&#146;s report and are picked out in red. I shall not describe each of them, but I shall highlight just two aspects of the revised rules that are not related to the end of dual reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0902097000177">First, hon. Members need to keep full records of each benefit of a value greater than &#163;200. That is because a series of donations from the same source, each unregistrable in itself and even if spread across different registration categories, can give rise to a requirement to register if they accumulate to a value of &#163;1,000 or more. Secondly, the motion makes specific provision to rename the Register of Members&#146; Interests so that it is called the Register of Members&#146; Financial Interests, and to make a corresponding change to the title of the registrar. The change has been proposed because there is some confusion outside the House as to the purpose of the register. By renaming it the Register of Members&#146; Financial Interests, we will make it clear that all the entries in the register have a real or potential monetary value. It is a small change, but one that the Committee believes is worth making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0902097000178">When dual reporting ends, the Commissioner will write to every hon. Member, sending a copy of the new guide and details of the seminars arranged to explain the new rules to hon. Members. There will also be guidance about how to complete the new form. I strongly encourage any Member who may be in any doubt about how the new rules will apply to seek advice from the standards commissioner or the Registrar of Members&#146; Interests, who will be glad to help&#151;or from the Electoral Commission, in respect of impermissible donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0902097000179">I believe that the end of dual reporting will be welcomed on both sides of the House. Together with the other changes recently agreed by the House, the revised rules constitute an important step forward in this House&#146;s regulatory system and in the transparency and accountability that rightly apply to our financial interests as Members of Parliament. The Standards and Privileges Committee will keep all these changes actively under review, and I ask the House to support the motion that stands in the name of the Leader of the House.</p>

 I rise to support the motion. First, and most importantly, I must say that I am grateful to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), who is the Chair of the Standards and Privileges Committee, and his Committee for the work that they have done on this matter. He pointed out that although many Members of this House have wanted to make the change from a dual reporting system to a single reporting system, this has proved to be a rather knotty problem. I believe, as he touched on this, that he would also want to thank the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) and his officials, who have worked very hard. My right hon. Friend has a first-class degree in history from Cambridge, and that is clearly what one needs to be able to deliver reform in this area. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Lord Chancellor just pointed out to me that there are no thanks due to him for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0902097000181">We should also pay tribute to the work of the Electoral Commission&#151;in the last few months in particular, it has worked very swiftly and co-ordinated well with the officials of the House&#151;and of the Registrar for Members&#146; Interests and the Clerk of the Committee. They have all worked to bring forward this paper in timely fashion so that it can be considered in line with the Bill this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="st_o113"><a name="0902097000182"><a name="90209-0004.htm_spnew5"><a name="0902097000584"><b>Bob Spink (Castle Point) (Ind):</b>
 We all welcome the progress that has been made so far, but does the Deputy Leader of the House accept that we need more progress on the conduct of Members? For example, we should consider removing the 646 small businesses in the House and have Members&#146; staff employed by the Department of Resources centrally, so that we can remove that problem for the benefit of Members and our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="st_o114"><a name="0902097000183"><a name="90209-0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="0902097000585"><b>Chris Bryant:</b>
 I know that hon. Members feel aggrieved when newspapers report that we have claimed allowances of &#163;180,000 a year, so it looks as though the staffing budget has gone into our own pockets, whereas&#151;as all hon. Members know&#151;we are merely claiming the money to ensure that our constituents receive swift replies to letters and so on, as they would naturally expect. Various Committees have considered whether the appointing of staff should be done centrally by the House, and it seems to me that the House is of the settled opinion that that would be inappropriate, for the simple reason that each constituency is different and each Member of Parliament works differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0902097000184">There has been a problem with dual reporting since the 2000 Act. Although it was an unintended consequence, it has produced some considerable inconvenience for vast numbers of Members. The problem stems not only from having to report to two different organisations with two different systems, but from the variation in the rules. That has led to inconsistency and confusion. One example, from my personal experience, concerns the free car parking space provided to me by NCP at Cardiff railway station. Any Member from south Wales who wants such a space can have one. That means that I do not have to declare it in the Register of Members&#146; Interests&#151;I have asked on several occasions to ensure that that is the case. However, I do have to declare it to the Electoral Commission. There will be many such instances in which hon. Members are confused about whether they have to report various donations and benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0902097000185">I am grateful that today we will be able to end all that confusion. However, as the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire pointed out, the change will involve a cost to hon. Members. For a start, they will have to provide considerably more information to the House authorities under categories 4, 5 and 6 on sponsorship for their constituency associations or parties, and the benefits they receive in relation to overseas visits and gifts received on such visits. That information is laid out in the report, and it has been gone through with a fine-toothed comb by the Electoral Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90209-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0902097000186">In addition, we have had to extend the rules of the House so that they meet the commission&#146;s requirements. The requirement in section 43 now provides that if a</p>

It seems sensible, just in case the law were ever to change, that we should be aligned directly with the law rather than with the specific figure of &#163;1,000. That is why the motion refers to that. We might also want to consider whether the &#163;200 threshold at which one has to check whether a donation is from a permissible source, has to return it if it is not and has to register it with the Electoral Commission should be aligned with the legal situation rather than with the specific figure of &#163;200.

 If the Deputy Leader of the House would be so good as to press the rewind button, he will recall that a few minutes ago he referred, without evaluation, to the Electoral Commission&#146;s requirement for disclosure of the fact of participation in the armed forces parliamentary scheme and similar such schemes. That is in contrast to the non-requirement on the part of the House. Does he find that position satisfactory? I did not get a clear sense that he had a particular view.

 My feeling about the armed forces parliamentary scheme is that it is pretty difficult to evaluate, on a commercial basis, the cost of lying in a tent in Basra being shelled. It is pretty difficult to estimate whether that is worth &#163;1,000 or more. However, when Members are not sure what the value of such a thing is, but guess that it might be more than &#163;1,000, there is provision for them simply to attest to the fact that they have had that benefit. The honest truth is that it does no one a disservice to over-register; for instance, registering the fact that they have had the benefit of being involved in the armed forced parliamentary scheme would redound to their benefit, rather than to their discredit.</p>

 This is coming as a revelation to us. Let us take the example of a dinner that my constituency Labour party held in August. I was at the top table and said a few words, and there was then an address by Tony Benn. The dinner made just over &#163;1,000&#151;perhaps &#163;1,200&#151;for the party. Obviously, that money would be available for it to spend on any party function, including electioneering. Is the Deputy Leader of the House saying&#151;I am quite happy with this&#151;that in future, either my local party, which is clearly an accounting unit, or I should register that &#163;1,200, or whatever the sum, and say where it came from?</p>

 The regulations before us today do not affect the law. They do not change what one&#146;s local party has to declare. All that they change is what an hon. Member has to declare. An hon. Member is required to declare any donation above &#163;1,000 that is associated with them in some way, whether that is because it is for their re-election, because they sought the donation, or because they were a speaker at the event. Those are the tests that the Standards and Privileges Committee has set for us that decide whether we should declare such events. If an event makes more than &#163;1,000 profit, and it is tied to the candidacy of an individual, or the individual invited people or was the guest of honour, they would have to register it&#151;that is, if the threshold remains at &#163;1,000.</p>

 I was slightly concerned when the hon. Gentleman finished his remarks by saying that that passage was a &#147;pretty generous catch-all&#148;. It is precisely because it is a rather generous catch-all that there might be cause for concern. He refers to a guest of honour speaking at a dinner at which donations might be solicited. He will understand that a humble Back Bencher like me, or a Back Bencher who ought to be humble, is not regularly invited to speak at fundraising events that raise such sums, so I am not speaking self-interestedly, but is it not rather disturbing that there should be such a draconian requirement of which Members could quite innocently fall foul?</p>

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman mistook me. The Member who has to register is a Member who is benefiting. For instance, if there is a fundraising dinner in one&#146;s constituency to raise money for one&#146;s constituency association, and it is headed, &#147;The hon. Member for such-and-such a constituency invites you to a dinner and will be the guest speaker,&#148; and there is a general election coming up, there is clearly a direct benefit, and the benefit of &#163;1,000 is significant.</p>

 This is an important point. It involves all of us. The hon. Gentleman just referred to the possibility of a general election approaching. When an election has happened, there may be five years until the next one. All our constituency parties, whatever their political complexion, have events to raise money. People often pay extremely modest prices for tickets, such as &#163;5 or &#163;10. The cumulative effect of such an evening, perhaps because of a raffle, may well be that the &#163;1,000 barrier is crossed.

We are talking about whether &#163;1,000 is raised for their political organisation. The whole objective of that organisation is eventually&#151;whether in five years&#146; time or next month&#151;to return them as a Member of Parliament, so that money will be used to benefit the Member and further their return to this House.

Friend&#146;s case&#151;in my constituency they normally cost &#163;20&#151;but &#163;500, the order of magnitude would be rather different. The issue is whether there is a significant financial benefit to the individual; the key point is whether that benefit is more than &#163;1,000. If hon. Members are in doubt, they should consult the Registrar of Members&#146; Financial Interests so that they can have absolute clarity.

now some concern in the House about the precision with which the new system will work. Although what is proposed is billed as the abolition of dual reporting, a sentence on page 19 of the guide to the rules suggests that it is not entirely that:</p>
<a name="90209-0005.htm_brev10"><a name="0902097000413"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Registration by the Member is additional to any registration required of the local organisation.&#148;</p>

If I may, I shall come to that point in a moment.</p>

As we debated as recently as two weeks ago, openness and transparency are very important. Curiously, however, we have discovered over the past few years that that can be overdone, in the sense that duplication is unnecessary and adds nothing to the simple keeping of a central record, which should suffice. What has grown up is a process whereby, in addition to a thorough central record, a parallel institution has demanded that the same matters be recorded with it. That dual reporting has been an unintended consequence of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, and it is, to any sensible person, absurd. Once is enough; if it has to be done twice and moreover the requirements are not exactly parallel, there will be a minefield on which people falling foul of the rules can be tripped up and maligned in the press for not complying with those rules.</p>

I would like to thank, properly, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) for trying to clarify those rules and presenting this report to the House. However, as he said, the process of making them less complicated has itself proved rather complicated. It is a bit like when Nigel Lawson, now Lord Lawson, said that the process of simplifying taxation inevitably makes taxation more complicated.</p>

The underlying principle is that if any of us, as an individual Member of this House, appears to be benefiting from the raising or giving of money, we should declare it openly. However, two issues have given rise to concern in the 45 minutes of debate that we have had: the phrase &#147;linked to&#148; and the operation of our local constituency associations. I do things, as I am sure do the Minister and others in this House, to raise money for the Conservative party&#151;in the Minister&#146;s case, of course, it is not for the Conservative party&#151;and I would like to think that if I am speaking at a fundraising dinner I can raise more than a thousand quid for the party. [Hon. Members: &#147;No problem!&#148;] Indeed; we could add a nought&#151;we never know if people are queuing at the door. However, that is not for my benefit. I think that the Minister said, rightly, that I would not receive the benefit, but it is fair to say that in some of his answers he gave he gave a slightly different impression. Likewise, if I attend a meeting of my association&#151;a dinner at which I, as the local Member of Parliament, might be speaking&#151;and it raises more than &#163;1,000, we are in a grey area where it may or may not be declarable.

 I do not think that our local parties often organise dinners in our constituencies that raise more than &#163;1,000 in profit, but if a profit of more than &#163;1,000 is raised, given what has been said, it will obviously benefit the local Member. I know that the party is not just an electoral machine, but it is obviously a benefit to the local Member if the organisation makes a profit of more than &#163;1,000. What has been said during the debate so far indicates that that amount should be recorded somewhere.</p>

 Once again, the right hon. Gentleman perfectly illustrates the new cloudiness in the rules, which we would like to avoid.

If it were to raise &#163;1,000 specifically for my election, and I were not there, it would be clear&#151;if I knew that it had happened&#151;that I should declare it, too.

The question is: at what point does &#147;linked to&#148; become a direct benefit such that it is registrable? If &#147;linked to&#148; leads the registrar to say that it is better to declare, we will get &#147;obligation creep&#148;, if I can put it that way, where the rules are interpreted ever more widely, so that the declaration of almost anything becomes necessary.</p>

 I share the bewilderment of the hon. Gentleman and my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang). We seem to be going in a direction opposite to that set out in legislation passed by this House. We set up a complicated plethora of legislation in relation to political parties that placed a burden on them to disclose finances. In the Labour party, there are constituency agreements with trade unions where the burden of transparency is on the constituency, not the Member of Parliament. Why encumber a Member of Parliament who is diligently doing things and carrying out political activity? If there has to be a declaration, it surely should be the job of the constituency Labour party, Liberal association or whatever. I am not suggesting that that is the correct course, but there is a degree of logic to it because the constituency organisation is the recipient.

are giving large sums of money that could conceivably influence a Member of Parliament, it is quite right that that must be declared in the fullest possible way, that the donors should be identified, and that foreigners should be excluded&#151;all of that. If we are talking about people paying a modest price for a ticket, however, going down this road will discourage ordinary people from giving the modest sums that enable democracy to flourish in this country. That is a retrograde step. I believe that it is terribly important that a multitude of people give relatively modest sums to fuel our democracy. I am totally against more state participation in the funding of political parties, but I am worried that we are going down a slippery slope that could deter ordinary, decent people from forking out a fiver, a tenner or &#163;20 to go to function.</p>

The moral obligation on a Member to declare must surely rest on his having known what he needed to declare in the first place. If his local association does something, or something happens in connection with an event with which he was theoretically linked, and by failing to declare it a Member is made to appear guilty, that could lead to some injustice. The whole point of the changes is to tidy the system up and try to avoid that. However, I shall park that matter to one side.</p>

 Like the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), I rather assumed that this would be a brief and uncomplicated debate, but it has proved to be anything but. One difficulty is that whenever anyone refers to the obligations that are placed on political parties or Members in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, it comes as a huge revelation to Members that they have been required to act in a particular way.

 The more I listen, the more confused I become.

 They are not muddied. The hon. Gentleman has described what the political parties, not the Member, must register. The Member does not have to register anything that is not for his particular benefit. That is the distinction, which is not especially difficult. If in doubt, Members will have to consult the Registrar and ensure that they are doing things correctly. However, the provision should not come as a surprise to hon. Members because it is not new.

However, we need to consider that carefully at some stage. If we want to avoid the appearance of partiality, it is difficult to be a Member of Parliament, who is employed for the purposes of providing services associated with being a Member of Parliament, without the question of partiality arising.</p>

When I went to the Arctic with the Royal Marines, I did not feel that I got an enormous financial benefit from sitting in a tent in the Arctic circle, but I benefited enormously in terms of my personal development and my knowledge of the privations that the armed forces face. I was pleased to have that opportunity. I am not convinced that it ought to be a registrable interest, but on the other hand, what harm does it do me to say that that is what I have done?

Therefore, there was no personal advantage whatever; the advantage was to the House authorities in not having to pay for the parking, rather than to the Member concerned.

It reinforces what the press and the public think about this House, and it is a downright shame. The clear message going out to the public is that we do not want to register benefits and interests.</p>

The key election that political parties want to win is the election to get their members back into this House. Members will return to this House if their constituency associations are doing well, by winning local government elections, for instance, because that can be helpful to those Members.</p>

organisation of a political party&#151;its constituency organisations, its associations&#151;exists to return candidates; there are no grey areas, so I wonder why we feel that we have something to hide. We should be declaring the &#163;1,000 that is raised for our constituency association, and we should be happy to do so, so that the public can benefit from that transparency and we can be held to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90209-0006.htm_para17"><a name="0902097000269">I welcome this paper, as far as it goes, but we should go much further. We really should look at how our staff are employed and at the conditions and selection processes involved. Of course, Members should have control over which staff are selected, but our staff should be employed formally and professionally by the Department of Resources, not by 646 separate small businesses in the House. That is not what we come to Parliament to do. We are legislators; we are here to fight for our constituents, our associations and our country. We are not here to act as small businesses employing people. We should get away from that practice, which would save us a lot of problems and give the public more confidence about what we do here and how we are doing it. God knows, the public need to get some confidence in us; at the moment, they certainly do not have any.</p>

In this day and age, it is nonsense for Members to be moonlighting and doing other jobs that earn them more money than their main job here pays them. I spend between 60 and 80 hours a week doing my job. I could do more, and I could do a better job, if I had more time to do it. There is no way that I have time to go out and earn money on the side by being a barrister, writing articles for newspapers or going on the circuit giving after-dinner speeches. Those practices are a total nonsense in this day and age in a modern Parliament, and we should stop that abuse. Those Members are out there earning a good living doing something else while drawing their full salary here but failing to do the full job.</p>

 Surely the answer is to adopt the practice of many modern Parliaments and to introduce transparency. Under such a system, a person could moonlight&#151;to use the hon. Gentleman&#146;s word&#151;but that would have to be declared and an abatement would be made to the MP&#146;s salary. The MP&#146;s voters could also take his behaviour into account in their assessment of whether they wished to return him at the next general election.</p>

We say that we are going to come here and work for them and do our best for them. By taking a reduced salary, we would be doing a lesser job here. If Members are not prepared to do their job here, it is incumbent on them to resign and let someone else come in and do the job that the public want and require us to do. We all have constituency problems, and we need to be there to help our individual constituents. We need to fight for our communities, and for our country, and MPs ought to stop having second jobs.

 This legislation has been by far the most poorly structured moving beast of a Bill that I and, I think, many other hon. Members will have worked on in this place. Although the Secretary of State and the Minister have never been less than courteous to me and my right hon. and hon. Friends during the Bill&#146;s passage to date, the contents of the Bill have changed dramatically&#151;and, I have to say, thankfully&#151;from being initially overly partisan and technically deficient to something rather more acceptable.</p>

amendments, however, show that we still think that the Bill still has some way to go and that, despite the progress, it represents a missed opportunity to deal with the crisis in public confidence in the political system.</p>

It is clear that the Government have done some serious thinking on the Bill, as is clear from their amendments and the proposed timetable that we now debating. We note that the Government have provided a second day for Report, which, given the significant number of Government amendments, let alone ours, is appropriate. I note that, as with the lateness of everything else to do with this Bill, the amendments under discussion today were only tabled about a week ago. That is hardly timely, given that the Committee finished on 13 November last year. Moreover, the fact that the second day for Report is not scheduled until March is typical of how this Bill has progressed&#151;or not&#151;and is revealing of a Government who are struggling to deliver the legislation, which, it must be said, they originally intended to rush through this place in a very short time.

 I rather think that that was a churlish speech from the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), so I will start with the part of the programme motion with which I agree and appreciate&#151;that which states that the second day will start with a debate on amending provisions connected with restricting the donations that can be made to political parties. That is welcome and necessary because it goes back to something entirely reprehensible that happened in Committee&#151;the fact that the Committee never reached the new clauses and amendments that the Liberal Democrats tabled on the important matter of capping donations to political parties&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I hear some tutting on the Conservative Benches, but it was Conservative Members who were largely responsible for the fact that the Committee did not reach those provisions.</p>

We have always said that our proposals on capping donations to parties at the &#163;50,000 level are part of a package deal that was negotiated between the parties by Sir Hayden Phillips. What has happened in the programming is that that aspect of the package deal&#151;the donation cap&#151;has been separated from the other aspects of the deal, namely the global or all-parliament limit on spending. As a result, the debate has become slightly fragmented, yet Sir Hayden was clear that the proposals were combined, both on the spending side and the donation side, and that all the parties should unite around them.</p>

That is particularly the case because politically, if not technically within the Bill, our proposals for capping expenditure, particularly local expenditure of all types, are an alternative to what the Government&#146;s have tabled as their new and innovative suggestion for replacing  <br>

what has become known as the trigger. Our criticisms of the trigger and of what the Government are proposing today have to be seen in the light of what we are proposing as an alternative in terms of local spending caps.

 I hope that we can move rapidly to agreeing the programme motion so that we can get on to the substance of the Bill, but I want, I if I may, to pick up a couple of points. What the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) called a poorly structured approach to the Bill has actually been a painstaking search for consensus. Over and over again&#151;on Second Reading and throughout consideration in Committee&#151;we have made it clear that we think that when we are dealing with matters such as this, which are of such constitutional importance, it is crucial that we should do so on the basis of consensus.</p>

I notice that all the discussions initiated by the Liberal Democrats on that particular point somehow slide over the fact of that crucial link with state funding.</p>

Given, however, that in its present form it extends the power of the Electoral Commission, I think it timely to consider whether the commission has used its powers wisely in the past.</p>

Hundreds of late notifications&#151;most of them honest mistakes&#151;have been identified. Indeed, I understand that in the last six months of 2008 a total of some &#163;750,000 was identified, accounting for more than 150 late donations. On the other hand, it appears to have been very heavy-handed and, I would argue, incompetent in dealing with certain cases, most notably that of my right hon.

received. Up until the beginning of last year, no warning letters had been sent. I think the commission should have a duty to give clear guidelines and positive advice to Members who are genuinely trying to comply, but it has been quite evasive about providing full information on its performance in response to parliamentary questions, many of which I tabled myself. It appears from its answer to one of my questions that it inexplicably and, I would say, recklessly destroyed numerous original donation forms that were in its care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0902097000321">There have been a great many cases of non-compliance on the part of many Members, some of whom were high-profile figures on the Opposition Benches, but on a number of occasions the commission has simply issued a press statement to the effect that no further action will be taken, or that the law has not been broken. In the early part of 2008, however, it clearly wanted to make an example of someone as part of its campaign for new and more draconian legal powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0902097000322">That is where the case of my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath comes in. He himself informed the commission as soon as he discovered that his campaign had failed to meet the commission&#146;s notification requirement, but he was asked no questions whatsoever by commission officials about the reasons for the lateness. Incredibly, when he visited the commission&#146;s offices to discuss the late notifications, officials actually lobbied him for some of the new powers that are in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0902097000323">I believe that, up to now, the commission has been wholly unaccountable to Parliament and, indeed, to the general public. The present rules, fiercely defended by the commission, ensure that most staff, and indeed commissioners themselves, have no knowledge whatever of the world of politics, which seems rather bizarre when we consider the whole purpose of establishing the commission in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0902097000324">As we know, when the commission referred my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath to the police it destroyed his position in the Government, but it also destroyed its own credibility here in Parliament when, months later, the Crown Prosecution Service decided that there was absolutely no case to answer. It exposed the fact that the initial commission referral to the police was incompetent and, indeed, reckless, and that it was not even fully conversant with electoral law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0902097000325">Under the initial Bill, the commission could be judge, jury and executioner, breaking into MPs&#146; offices and compelling Members, their staff and anyone else to attend to them and answer questions. That was very worrying, because it exposed the fact that no one was regulating the regulator. That is why I tabled new clause 4.</p>

When asked in Parliament when it decides to refer a case to the police, a rather obscure answer was given, which was, &#147;When the commission decided the facts of the case merited it.&#148; I do not think we would tolerate such an answer from a Minister, so my question is this: is the Electoral Commission above Parliament? Of course it is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0902097000330">Members are generally happy to comply with reasonable requirements to register donations, even if the rules are not quite as clear as we might hope, and we had a very good debate on that earlier. The simpler the rules are, the better it is for all Members to ensure that they comply, and it is not unreasonable to expect positive support and guidance from the commission itself. If some Members refuse to comply with reasonable requests, commit serious crimes or seek to evade their responsibilities, no reasonable person would think that the commission should not have the power to act, with the appropriate checks and balances, of course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para9"><a name="0902097000331">Concern has been expressed that the Electoral Commission has in the past been biased against the party of Government. I hope that is not true, and I hope it never will be, but it will be for the new commission chair to demonstrate a number of principles that I believe will correct the imbalance and bring the commission more into public view. The principles are: the commission should devise new ways of being open and transparent to Parliament, and I hope that the new chair will ensure that is so. I also hope that it will swiftly unify procedures with the Register of Members&#146; Interests; we need to know precisely when that will happen, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us in his reply. Non-compliance should be decriminalised as much as possible where it is clear that mistakes have been made and there was no intent to undermine the legislation or to take in funds fraudulently and try to disguise them, and that is where new clause 3 comes in. The use of penalties and sanctions&#151;which the Electoral Commission has, and will be given more of&#151;will need to be monitored externally; new clause 4 addresses that. Finally, there must be more dialogue with Members of Parliament to ensure that the commission has more genuine political support from all parts of the House; only then can it do its job, both politically and in the public&#146;s view, to a standard we would expect and the public can trust.</p>

more effective and robust regulator, and that was identified by the Committee on Standards in Public Life report in January 2007, which picked up on the problems facing the commission. However, we are keen to ensure that any use of sanctions is valid&#151;the use of powers must be proportionate, risk based and fair, and a number of aspects require further review by us today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para11"><a name="0902097000334">New clause 3 would replace a number of criminal offences in the 2000 Act with a fixed penalty of &#163;1,000. The suggestion is interesting, but we are concerned that it could reduce the effectiveness of the Electoral Commission and weaken the strength of sanctions&#151;there could be a lack of a proper deterrent in many cases if the commission is limited to the use of a fixed monetary penalty for the offences implicated by the new clause. We are prepared to review this conceptually in later stages, and the points made by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton), particularly on the lack of guidance, were well put.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0902097000335">New clause 4 would create an independent panel responsible for producing a code of practice relating to the Electoral Commission&#146;s use of civil sanctions. The panel would also offer guidance to it. Although the new clause offers an interesting protection against the abuse by the commission of its powers, the 2000 Act contains an equivalent measure. Under that Act, the Parliamentary Parties Panel can make submissions to the commission on the use of sanctions, so this extra provision should be unnecessary. Again, I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s well made point about careful monitoring, and I hope that the panel is put to its full use in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0902097000336">Our amendments 59 to 62 relate, respectively, to paragraphs 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) to schedule 2. They would remove the commission&#146;s ability to impose a fixed monetary penalty on a person, registered party, recognised third party or permitted participant for a non-offence contravention of the Act. It is important to note that the commission would still have the power to issue a fixed penalty for the commission of a prescribed offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para14"><a name="0902097000337">The power to issue fines is one of the key new flexible powers that the commission is given by the Bill. We hope that they will enable it to deal with enforcement more flexibly and proportionately than it has been able to do in the past. Fixed penalty notices require the person, registered party, recognised third party or permitted participant to pay an amount specified in the notice to the commission. We tabled the amendments because we feel the need to err on the side of caution when dealing with non-offence infringements of the Act. Will the Minister explain the scope of what we could be dealing with here? Our concern is that, depending on the operation of future electoral commissions, things may be interpreted oppressively, resulting in large fines for relatively minor infringements. We must be sure that we clearly set out the parameters of these powers and the circumstances in which they may be used&#151;not necessarily for the current commission, which has been privy to much of this debate, but for the commissions of the future, which may not be so rational in the use of these powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0902097000338">At the grass-roots level of political engagement in particular, this is an extremely complex and difficult area of law, and the possibility for wide interpretation and the potential for abuse are correspondingly high.

individuals and smaller groups and associations to live in fear of reprisal for minor infringements. When a potentially hefty penalty is the punishment, the criteria of contravention of the prescribed restriction or requirement could be too opaque and broad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0902097000339">Amendments 74 and 82 would, respectively, amend paragraphs 2(6) and 9(3) to schedule 2. The paragraphs state which court is to be used for the appeal process in relation to a fixed monetary penalty and a non-compliance penalty for failure to satisfy discretionary requirements under part 2. The amendments would change the relevant court from a county court to the High Court. We remain concerned that the expertise of the county court could be insufficient to deal with a potentially complex case under the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0902097000340">The length of discussion on these technical points in Committee, and the debate so far today, show how complicated the various relevant provisions can be. For that reason, we suggest that the high level of judicial scrutiny that the High Court offers is to be favoured. Furthermore, the reputation of the High Court and the scrutiny it applies will serve as a useful check on the commission. Any case that reaches the High Court would become a useful precedent, and any guidance that the High Court gives would be useful in helping to avoid future court appearances. Furthermore, the need to satisfy the demands of the High Court would also encourage the commission to be thorough, if a case were to proceed to judicial scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0902097000341">I remind hon. Members that the use of such powers would be very limited. As such, relatively few cases would be expected to reach this stage and it is unlikely that this requirement would place too great a burden on the High Court. What is important is that cases are considered properly and the relevant level of scrutiny is applied. We consider amendment 74 an important enough issue to press to a Division at the appropriate moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0902097000342">Amendment 78 looks to remove the early payment discount provisions in schedule 2.3(3)(d). As the Bill stands, that and other similar sections provide that notice of a possible penalty must include information about any early payment discounts. That implies that the commission may provide discounts for the early payment of a proposed penalty, imposed under the 2000 Act. Our amendments delete reference to early payment and thereby prevent discounts from being issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para20"><a name="0902097000343">While we understand that the intention behind the provisions is to encourage swift settlement of penalty liabilities, we disagree that the discount mechanism currently in place is the best means of achieving the goal. A penalty is an important indication of wrongdoing. Allowing a discount for early payment could suggest that the seriousness of the offence had in some way been mitigated. That could send out the wrong message, and could trivialise the penalty regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para21"><a name="0902097000344">Amendments 63 to 67 would serve to remove monetary penalties from the discretionary requirement regime. Amendment 63 would specifically remove subsection (a), relating to monetary penalties, from sub-paragraph 8, which defines what may constitute a &#147;discretionary requirement&#148;. It would leave two remaining powers with the commission, which would be extremely flexible and could require a subject to take such steps as the commission sees fit to remedy an offence or contravention. Amendments 64 to 67 are consequential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para22"><a name="0902097000345">The power to issue fines is one of the key new powers that the Commission will be granted by the Bill. Fines can act as a crude penalty and disincentive when the 2000 Act has been breached. Conceptually, we support the penalty regime in certain circumstances, but we remain concerned at the potential for the Bill to encourage the over-zealous use of penalties when other avenues should be explored first. That is particularly so in the case of minor infringements of the legislation. The discretionary requirement regime, minus the penalty provision, is capable of remedying minor breaches, and we should not encourage a simple fine system that could fail to address the root of the problem. By removing the penalty, the commission would need to focus on imposing a discretionary requirement to take steps to stop or remedy a breach, under paragraph 5(b) and 5(c) respectively. We believe that that is a positive step, and would encourage understanding rather than retribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para23"><a name="0902097000346">I expect that there may be concern that the commission will be seen as a light touch without the penalty regime. However, the amendments would leave in place the power to fine when an offence had been committed under the 2000 Act. Thus, in serious cases there would be no need to use the part 2 &#147;discretionary requirements&#148; provision unless it would be useful to do so. Furthermore&#151;and this is a point that I would like to emphasise&#151;if a non-penalty &#147;discretionary requirement&#148; is not satisfied, paragraph 9 would allows the commission to then impose a monetary penalty as a final resort. By leaving it as a final resort in non-offence and less serious cases, it would encourage the commission to help remedy the breach rather than issue a draconian penalty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para24"><a name="0902097000347">The purpose of amendment 77 is the introduction of a time limit into the Bill. It relates to the period in which an individual can respond to the relevant civil sanction imposed on them by the commission. We contend that the provisions in place could be too vague. Clarity is preferred, especially when potentially innocent subjects are seeking to respond to the commission. The simple addition of specific predefined time limits into the schedule could tackle that problem. Amendment 77 would apply a 28-day limit to the making of representations and objections against a discretionary requirement to the commission. I would point out that part 2 of the schedule provides that in relation to a discretionary requirement the period for representations or objections</p>
<a name="90209-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="0902097000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;may not be less than 28 days&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para25"><a name="0902097000348">Does the Minister not agree that that inconsistency is revealing? Surely that shows that 28 days, as a minimum, should be a fair amount of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para26"><a name="0902097000349">Amendment 75 would insert the word &#147;promptly&#148; into paragraph 6(5) in part 2 of schedule 2, which relates to the notice of a discretionary requirement. The Minister dismissed the use of the word &#147;immediately&#148; in Committee, which is why we are now back with a slightly less prescriptive term. The amendment would require the Electoral Commission to notify the subject of its final decision to impose a discretionary requirement or fixed monetary penalty promptly because, as things stand, there is no time limit for serving the notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para27"><a name="0902097000350">Discretionary requirements, of course, are intended to provide the commission with a flexible means of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the 2000 Act.

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para28"><a name="0902097000351">That flexibility is welcome, but there should be a compensating certainty, particularly in the delivery of the notice informing the subject of the requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para29"><a name="0902097000352">If prompt compliance is expected of the person, the commission should be an example of good practice in terms of its own expediency. There is no time limit in the Bill for the service of either notice. As such, it is possible that the commission might delay in delivering the notice and delay on the part of the commission is also likely to be reciprocated by the person. Good practice should be a statutory requirement and we believe that the simple insertion of the word &#147;promptly&#148; will help achieve that goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para30"><a name="0902097000353">Government amendment 23 follows up on a number of amendments tabled in Committee by me and the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger) and relates to the requirement for the commission to publish guidance. In Committee on 13 November, concern was expressed about the frequency and timing of guidance published by the commission on the use of its powers. Questions were also posed regarding the content of any guidance. Our Committee amendments 61 and 62 and the Liberal Democrats&#146; Committee amendment 136 sought to address deficiencies in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para31"><a name="0902097000354">The consensus stemming from the debate was that annual guidance should be published and that it should be required to contain certain prescribed information, particularly on the use of investigatory powers. I am pleased to see that the Minister has taken those suggestions on board and we welcome Government amendment 23. It obliges the commission to publish annual information on the use of commission powers. It achieves that by attaching that requirement to the pre-existing annual financial reporting requirement contained in paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 2000 Act. The annual financial report will now include information in line with the newly introduced schedule 2 requirements. That seems to us a suitable way of going about that. We are pleased that the Government have included that positive amendment and we hope that the annual reporting requirement will reassure people that the commission is using its powers reasonably.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para32"><a name="0902097000355">Government amendment 28 relates to a report published by the commission in accordance with paragraph 27 of the schedule. It stipulates that any report may, pursuant to the paragraph, omit certain information if, in the opinion of the commission, the publication of the information would or might be unlawful or if it might adversely affect any proceedings or investigation. In essence, it qualifies the obligation introduced by the welcome Government amendment 23.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90209-0008.htm_para33"><a name="0902097000356">Although we agree that some flexibility is acceptable in terms of reporting requirements, the measure could go slightly too far, we believe. There is no requirement that the commission&#146;s opinion of the lawfulness or any adverse affects of publishing certain information should be reasonable. We feel that an opinion to that end should be reasonable, and our amendment (a) to Government amendment 28 addresses the deficiency. It would ensure that the commission does not become overly defensive with regard to the information that it holds. As things stand, the commission could have a very subjective and defensive set of opinions, which could prevent full and frank disclosure in its report. That would dampen considerably the positive potential of the reporting requirement.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para0"><a name="0902097000358">That goes further than the current wording of the Bill and, again, it could lead to over-cautiousness on the part of the commission. Our second amendment to Government amendment 28&#151;amendment (b)&#151;changes the wording from &#147;might&#148; to &#147;would&#148;. That would refocus the commission when it decided on whether the publication of information really would damage its investigation. In combination with the mere subjective opinion requirement that I have identified, schedule 2 would, if not amended, allow for a very cautious report that might not be fully informative, and that would not fully reflect the reality of the commission&#146;s work. I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s further thoughts on those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0902097000359">Finally, amendment 83 inserts a threshold test after paragraph 27(2) of schedule 2. The amendment aims to ensure that the commission excludes details of less serious offences in the reports that it is obliged to publish under paragraph 27(1). The measure would serve three purposes. First, it would excuse from further censure those who have fallen foul of the legislation to a minor extent. The threshold ensures that only the more serious offenders are named and shamed. Secondly, the removal of minor offences from the reports would mean a more intense focus on the major offenders. The threshold of &#163;5,000&#151;the amount is negotiable, as far as we are concerned&#151;catches the most serious cases and ensures that they are rightly named and shamed. Thirdly, the measure would act as an additional deterrent to the commission of offences and infringements. Again, I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on those proposals.</p>

 The House will be in no doubt about the importance of what we are debating. Clearly, we can talk in more detail about the investigative powers when we come to the next group of amendments, but any measure that allows a senior commission official or the police to enter premises to check on the income and expenditure of an individual or organisation should be looked into carefully. The House should be fully satisfied that the new framework that we are putting in place will serve Parliament and the country well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0902097000361">To pick up briefly on our earlier debate on the motion on the guide to the rules relating to the conduct of Members, I do not think that anyone in the House is resisting transparency. One of the contributors to that debate suggested that the discussion indicated that hon.

The position is that we want maximum transparency, but clearly we have to have a system that can be handled properly, and that does not put an unreasonable demand on the volunteers on whom we all depend for the operation of the political system, which, of course, is dependent on the political parties.</p>

The Minister said, perfectly fairly, that some of the Government&#146;s amendments reflect an aim on which there should be consensus. There is no doubt in my mind&#151;I have given evidence on such matters to the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;that when we try to enact legislation governing our electoral process and governing the very important issue of donations, we should do so in a way that achieves full and proper consensus.</p>

I hope that hon. Members will explain further in the course of debate. We should not, as politicians, give ourselves special treatment in the regulatory regime that we do not give to other people.

 I fully support that point. I had intended to deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause 3 later, but I may as well speak about it now. In principle, I am fully in favour of what he says, for precisely the reason that he gives. Over the past 10 or 11 years the Government have become far too fond of creating criminal offences.

I would be grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East in other examples when we on the Liberal Democrat Benches try to make sure that the criminal law is not used inappropriately. We do not have the opportunity to do that now, but it is important to bear in mind&#151;and on the whole I support his new clause&#151;that we should apply the same argument in other cases as they come up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para7"><a name="0902097000371">I am more concerned about some of the amendments tabled by the Conservatives. We should be wary of removing civil sanctions for contraventions that are short of criminal offences. Standard regulatory practice in the outside world applies that sort of idea to a range of other activities. Why, in this case, should political activity be treated differently? If we remove any sort of civil sanction for violations that fall short of criminal violations, we are left with no sanctions at all. It is pointless to pass statutory provisions that impose obligations on people and to have absolutely no sanctions to back up those obligations. The temptation for the Government will then be to make those obligations enforceable by the criminal law, so we will end up with yet more criminal offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para8"><a name="0902097000372">That applies even more in the case of removing the variable monetary penalties. Anyone looking at the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, for example, will see that those penalties are entirely standard. That is how regulation happens in general, and I cannot see any reason to remove such regulatory devices for the activity that we are discussing. There was an opportunity to object to them when the 2008 Act was going through Parliament; perhaps some Members did object. But given the fact that such devices represent the standard way in which regulation happens, I see no reason why what we do should get special treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para9"><a name="0902097000373">That brings me to amendment 74, which relates to the appeal to the High Court and on which the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) wants us to vote. Under the 2008 Act, the standard practice&#151;for everybody else, in every other regulatory field&#151;is that there is no appeal to any sort of court, only to the first level of the tribunal. In giving them an appeal to the county court, we are already giving people in the line of activity that we are discussing a degree of special treatment; they have access to the ordinary courts. To go further and give people involved in politics access to the High Court would go way beyond what we offer people in other fields of activity. The hon. Gentleman said that doing so would provide for precedent. I should say that, as a matter of technical law, one High Court cannot bind another, so the amendment would not even do that. I have yet to be convinced that amendment 74 is fair in its treatment of political activity in relation to other types of activity.</p>

Paying a fine early should not mean that people pay less; it is not a matter of civil debt, simply of when the obligation is fulfilled. However, the fact that that provision in the 2008 Act makes no sense is not a reason to give the activity that we are dealing with  <br>

It took 15 months, nothing happened at the end of it, and the police spent a great deal of money&#151;hundreds of thousands of pounds. The question of whether there was an issue in that case needed to be addressed by the political process&#151;the process of transparency and democratic accountability for which this Government deserve a lot of credit for introducing. We turned our back on the old system whereby a Hong Kong billionaire could give what he liked to a particular political party and nobody knew where it was coming from, who he was or what his motive was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para13"><a name="0902097000384">The other important point about the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East&#151;whether all its specifics are satisfactory to the House is a separate matter&#151;is that the Electoral Commission needs to be much more accountable and needs different leadership from what it has had in the first phase of its work. If I may say so&#151;I will not go into detail&#151;I found it to be incompetent, dysfunctional and politically unworldly. There have been some sensible changes, with commissioners with a political background coming in. I could not believe some of the things that I experienced. One of the things that I found out in the course of this story was that if one of us were taking part in an internal party election and a member of our campaign staff, perhaps a student volunteer, got us a return to Brighton that cost, let us say, &#163;12 or &#163;13 off-peak, and that individual had used a credit card with a credit rating of &#163;2,000 to &#163;3,000&#151;in other words, more than the &#163;1,000 that we have to declare in relation to any donations&#151;the commission&#146;s view was that we would have to declare that. A &#163;12 ticket counted as a donation in kind because of the credit card that happened to pay for it a couple of days before the money was reclaimed. I could quote countless examples&#151;but I will not burden the House&#151;about my own unhappy experience, which proved to me that the commission had very little idea of the political world that it was regulating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para14"><a name="0902097000385">This is not in any way intended to excuse or somehow sidestep the obligation to report on time, or the necessity for the law to be obeyed by regulated donees, which all of us are. I am simply saying that we need from the new leadership a more effective and competent commission, and one that will carry out the duties that the new legislation will enshrine. The changes that the Government have made to the Bill, which were in part provoked by the original amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East and spoken to by my hon. Friends the Members for Battersea (Martin Linton) and for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger) in Committee, have made it a much better Bill. I hope that the commission&#146;s leadership will take heed of it and start to act in a proportionate and more politically worldly fashion.</p>

We all have our obligations, but we do not want, for example, to criminalise the local party treasurer because he is in his 80s and has not studied the small print of something&#151;someone who could not be any further away from wanting to do something dishonest. We have to take the process forward in a sensible fashion, and that has not been the case before now.</p>

 I am a little puzzled by the insistence on a Division on the question of whether a final appeal under these procedures should go to the High Court rather than the county court. The question is not where the appeal ends up, but the time during which someone may be proto-criminalised while a procedure takes place. That may well result in an appeal being taken to a county court, or in the case of the final appeal, to the High Court. That was the thrust of an amendment suggested in Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton), to which I contributed, on the making of a defence prior to a proceeding taking place by application to a court about the nature of an omission or act that could invoke proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para16"><a name="0902097000388">The ability to obtain a certificate prior to those proceedings taking place relates to the argument about the defence of democracy, and the extent to which people undertaking acts that they consider to be part of their duties in representing the public in the political process can be criminalised by implication long before anything has been decided. As was suggested in Committee, people can end up camped outside people&#146;s doors, and a series of articles and comments can be published in the press and the media about something that has yet to be determined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0902097000389">Under the existing process for considering whether an offence has been committed, there is no provision for redress while the process is undertaken. The idea of being able to prevent that process from going any further through the application for a certificate seems to provide the way forward, given several of the discussions we have had this afternoon. My right hon. Friend the Minister suggested in Committee that further examination of those ideas might be undertaken before the Bill had run its course through this House and another place. It would be helpful to our considerations if he could indicate whether such considerations might be provided through further amendments, or other provisions, to introduce a more proportionate system before the Bill returns to this House from the other place and we make our final consideration of it.</p>

that direction. That is not to say that the commission must act harshly, and of course sometimes it should not act at all, as in the case of small-scale late reporting cases caused by an inadvertent mistake or an accident by a volunteer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09020919000005">It is worth remembering that the commission has discretion and is not compelled to impose a penalty in all cases. The new clause would force the commission to issue a fixed monetary penalty in all cases of the three offences to which it relates. That runs counter to the idea of a flexible sanctions regime, which underpins much of the Bill. It might even have the unwanted side effect of suggesting that fixed monetary penalties must be imposed for all such breaches, rather than enabling the commission to take the proportionate, case-by-case approach that I believe we all want. That is important, because the Bill will allow the commission to use its expertise to exercise discretion on the use of sanctions and apply them appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90209-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09020919000006">The commission may view a one-off breach as a minor infringement, but it may decide, on the evidence available, that behaviour such as persistent infringements indicates more serious activity such as evasion. It might also wish to take into account the scale of the late report or the amount of time involved, in deciding what penalty is appropriate, if any. It is important that we do not limit that flexibility from the outset.</p>

Equally, the commission&#146;s hands will not be tied by sanctions that do not sufficiently match the offence. As part of the new regime, we expect it to use sanctions proportionately.</p>

We expect the commission to act proportionately and it says that it intends to do so. Although it is for the commission to determine the matter, I anticipate that offences such as late reporting may be treated less severely than what could be considered a more serious offence in most instances, but not all circumstances are the same. I have given some indications of how what may at first appear to be a minor offence might appear more serious on closer inspection and investigation. We must leave the commission the flexibility and the range of instruments that it needs to deal with each case on its merits.</p>

 The Minister almost assumes that the commission will act proportionately. That may be the case with the existing commission, but we are legislating for the long term, and many amendments that Opposition Members and the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) tabled, and many comments from other hon. Members, reflect concerns that the commission may not always exercise proportionality. Will the Minister deal with our anxieties?</p>

 Of course, the hon. Gentleman is right; it goes without saying that we are not legislating for the current commission but for all commissions for the foreseeable future. As he knows, we have already tackled many of his concerns. I will address each amendment in turn, and I hope that when he considers how I have done so, he will realise that we are conscious of the need to legislate for the future&#151;and we believe that we are doing exactly that. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East sufficiently for him to feel able to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</p>

Of course, the commission must use its powers proportionately, after carefully considering the facts of each case. He asked whether I believed that the Electoral Commission was above Parliament. Of course it is not, but we must constantly remind ourselves&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) keeps reverting to the point&#151;that the Electoral Commission must be entirely independent of Parliament. It is not for Ministers to influence or try to influence how the Electoral Commission exercises its functions, still less the way in which it makes its decisions. That is why I said that the Electoral Commission would decide on the facts of the case whether to refer anything to the police.</p>

The Electoral Commission was established to be statutorily independent. As with other regulators of its kind, there is an arrangement whereby the electoral commissioners lead the commission&#146;s strategy and set its priorities, and the commission will consider what guidance is necessary to explain its role and the regulatory framework in which it operates. For precisely that reason&#151;its operational independence&#151;the commission reports directly to Parliament, including through the Speaker&#146;s Committee.</p>

I believe that it would result in less clarity. Who would be responsible for individual decisions&#151;the panel or the commission? If the commission disagreed with the panel&#146;s advice, would it be bound to adhere to the advice or could it disregard it? New clause 4 would unnecessarily complicate the picture, make regulation more difficult and possibly produce perverse consequences that no hon. Member would welcome. It is not practical for the commission to be required to seek advice from the panel routinely before making decisions that relate to its investigatory powers or sanctions. That might lead to all sorts of complexities and unnecessary delays. Decisions should be for the electoral commissioners and the commission staff, who are recruited because they have experience and expertise in the field.</p>

Members know, we have taken direct steps to assist the commission to become more aware of the political environment in which it operates. Everyone who has spoken during the various stages of the Bill&#146;s passage through Parliament has drawn attention to the need for the Electoral Commission to become more sensitised, if I may put it that way, to the democratic political environment. That is why we are introducing provisions in the Bill enabling the appointment of a minority of commissioners who have recent experience from across the political spectrum. That will be in addition to the parliamentary parties panel, which already exists for consultation with party administrators and practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09020919000018">The Bill already includes the requirement for the commission to publish guidance on how it intends to use its powers and sanctions, and to consult such persons as it considers appropriate before publishing or reviewing such guidance. In its evidence to the Public Bill Committee, the commission indicated that it intended to consult political parties and interested people in Parliament regarding the guidance on the use of those powers. It is open to the commission to establish and seek advice from an informal advisory group of individuals whom it believes can provide experience and guidance on any aspect of its functions. The commissioners previously established a small reference group in that way and there is no reason why they should not do so again. However, the establishment by statute of a formal panel to issue guidance or advice to which the commission would be required to have regard is something very different.</p>

 Would my right hon.

amendments were tabled in Committee which he said were probing amendments. They were not put to a vote, but I am happy to try to persuade him not to press them once again. Practically, amendments 59 to 62 would have the effect of preventing the Electoral Commission from applying a fixed monetary penalty to any of the regulated entities concerned for the contravention of a prescribed restriction or requirement. Amendments 59 to 62 go against the flexibility of the system that we are seeking to introduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09020919000028">It is worth putting it on record again that the Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended that civil sanctions should be made available in instances that could be considered more minor and where it said that administrative penalties would be more appropriate. Accepting amendments 59 to 62 would mean that this lightest-touch penalty, which is generally available to the commission under the relevant schedule, would not be available in those sorts of cases where it may be particularly appropriate. That would be illogical if we are serious about adopting a proportionate approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09020919000029">Finally, amendments 59 to 62 fail to take account of the existing provisions in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Acceptance of them would remove the commission&#146;s limited ability to impose civil penalties in relation to certain breaches of the 2000 Act. The fixed monetary penalties in schedule 2 of the Bill replicate the present system in section 147 of the 2000 Act. For example, where a party fails to inform the commission of a change of treasurer, as required by section 31(4), the Electoral Commission can currently impose a civil penalty. Should amendments 59 to 62 be accepted, the commission would still be able to apply a fixed monetary penalty, but only when a prescribed offence had been committed. In addition, the other civil sanctions would continue to be available in respect of prescribed restrictions and requirements, which would add inconsistency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09020919000030">By preventing the application of those new sanctions to prescribed restrictions and requirements, we would be in danger of binding the commission&#146;s hands. We believe that it must be for the independent Electoral Commission to determine when a fixed monetary penalty or any other appropriate civil sanction should be used where a prescribed restriction or requirement has been contravened. The commission must be allowed to use its expertise to determine what mitigating or aggravating factors might be taken into account. That is proportionate and allows each case to be approached on its merits. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will not press amendments 59 to 62.</p>

Member for Cambridge has pointed out, the provisions for early payment discounts and late payment penalties replicate the equivalent provisions in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, on which the civil sanctions regime is based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09020919000034">I believe it is right to encourage prompt payment of sanctions, and to reflect the procedural savings to the regulator&#151;in this case, the Electoral Commission. Of course, the commission&#146;s role is not purely administrative, but there are those, including the hon. Member for Huntingdon, who have argued that the measures will turn the commission&#146;s role into a that of a traffic warden issuing fixed penalty notices. With respect to him, however, that is not the point. These sanctions provisions are only part of a range of potential sanctions, and the whole point is that there should be flexibility in how they are applied. We are seeking to provide such a flexible approach to sanctions in line with other regulators who have benefited from the provisions in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, on which these provisions are modelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09020919000035">In providing for the possibility of early payment discounts and late payment penalties, the commission will have the option to offer the provisions if it deems that appropriate. I shall set that out in the final version of its guidance on enforcement. However, it may decide to offer the options in some instances and not in others. For example, it may decide that providing for an early payment discount is appropriate in some instances, and that a fixed monetary penalty might be appropriate for a relatively small breach and when speeding up the regulatory process is in the interests of the regulator and of the individual concerned. The commission may also decide that it is not appropriate to provide these discounts or penalties in some cases&#151;for example, when the individual is a serial offender or when the offence is of a more serious nature. I hope that that addresses the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Cambridge.</p>

 Will the Minister give the House one example of when an early payment discount would be likely to apply? These powers are not likely to be used frequently, and as he has said, in many people&#146;s minds, such practices are more relevant to parking tickets than to electoral offences.</p>

 Just to correct the hon. Gentleman, let me say that that was not my analogy. I was quoting him, and I am not sure that I share his view. The point is that it will be for the commission to determine the circumstances, and we have to allow it flexibility as a regulator.</p>

and Sanctions Act 2008, we must have a compelling reason for doing so, and I do not see any such reason here. I am sorry to pray in aid the hon. Member for Cambridge again, but as he said, we must be careful about suggesting to the people whom we all serve that we are somehow immune from the kind of sanctions and regulatory frameworks that apply to other people in public life. I hope that I have now said enough to convince the hon. Member for Huntingdon to ask leave to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09020919000039">Amendments 64, 65, 66 and 67 are all consequential on amendment 63, and they would remove variable monetary penalties from the range of discretionary requirements proposed for the commission by the Bill. Again, I am going to ask the House to resist those amendments if they are pressed to a vote, because to accept them would be to remove an important part of the Commission&#146;s range of civil sanctions and take away some of the flexibility that we believe to be desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09020919000040">The sanction of variable monetary penalties is closely modelled on those contained in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. The provisions are intended to allow the regulator to ensure that the financial penalty is appropriate to the offence. I come back to the fundamental point that, unless there is a compelling reason to do so, we should not depart from the principle that politicians should not be treated differently from those in the other regulated fields.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09020919000041">As well as that matter of principle, there is also a positive reason for including variable monetary penalties in the suite of powers that the Bill gives to the commission. They will provide greater flexibility, and enable the commission to adapt the penalty specifically to the facts of each case. The draft enforcement guidance issued by the commission indicates that it intends to use variable monetary penalties for the graver breaches of the Act, and to use fixed monetary penalties in cases of more minor, technical, breaches, where a penalty is still appropriate but where the breach is less grave or more routine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90209-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09020919000042">Having said that, variable monetary penalties, while flexible, must still be imposed proportionately and, in summary cases, they may not exceed the level of a fine available to a criminal court dealing with the same sort of breach. Currently, that is &#163;5,000 where a case would otherwise be tried in a magistrates court. In other words, the word &#147;variable&#148; does not mean &#147;unlimited&#148;. Factors that could be taken into account&#151;I am not saying that they would be, but they could be&#151;include the history of compliance of the individual or organisation concerned and also the gravity of the failure.

That is a high threshold. It is the criminal standard of proof, and it ensures that the commission must act responsibly in the use of these powers. The Bill proposes to ensure that regulations are properly enforced by an effective regulator, not to lower the required standard of evidence. The Bill also proposes an appeal mechanism against the imposition of a variable monetary penalty. Moreover, it also proposes to allow a person to make representations before the imposition of a variable monetary penalty. There is, therefore, a suite of safeguards. Amendments 64, 65, 66 and 67 are consequential, and I hope that the arguments I have already outlined against amendment 63 will also stand against those consequential amendments. I hope that I have said enough, therefore, to persuade the hon. Member for Huntingdon to withdraw his amendments.</p>

Gentleman had heard my reasons why amendments 74 and 82 were a bad idea, he said that he would press them to a vote. However, I hope that I can still persuade him to change his mind, although he said that they were very important to him. They provide that appeals against the imposition of fixed monetary penalties and non-compliance penalties should be heard by the High Court, rather than a county court as the Bill currently provides.</p>

The precedent for appeals in electoral law is to a county court, which will therefore have the appropriate expertise. Raising appeal to the High Court would inevitably place an unnecessary strain on the resources of the High Court, when the county court already provides an appropriate opportunity for appeal. It would also risk slowing down the appeals process, which could have a seriously negative impact on the person or organisation whose appeal was under consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09020919000049">I do not subscribe to the logic that the hon. Member for Huntingdon put forward, at least in Committee, that the Electoral Commission might act with more restraint, should an appeal against the imposition of a civil penalty be to the High Court, rather than the county court. Under all circumstances, the Electoral Commission is under a duty to act reasonably and it is required, as I have just said, to meet the criminal standard of proof for the imposition of most of its new civil sanctions. Cases must be&#151;and they will be, I am sure&#151;judged on the facts of the case, not on the processes.</p>

electoral law cases are currently heard there, and we believe that that is appropriate. More expertise exists in the county court than currently in the High Court and the point remains about the burden that the amendment would place on High Court resources. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal is unnecessary because we do not believe that, because the appeal would go to the High Court rather than a county court, the Electoral Commission would adapt its approach. It should not do so, and I do not think that it will do so. If we are to provide for an appeal to go to the High Court, I am afraid that we require a more convincing case for such a change, which would break with existing precedent and indeed with the precedent of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008.</p>

 I support the Minister&#146;s general case on this issue, but is there not another important point in that amendment 74 is about appeals for fixed penalty notices? Wasting the High Court&#146;s time on fixed penalty notices seems rather bizarre. There might, however, be a serious point&#151;there might be, so I merely ask the Minister to reflect on it&#151;when it comes to appeals about stop notices, which might have an effect on an election that is under way. That might be a different case, but amendment 74 seems to provide no case at all.</p>

 As always, I am happy to consider the argument; we can return to it at some future point. As I have said, I understand the instincts behind amendment 74 and I understand the importance that the hon. Member for Huntingdon attaches to it. I am sympathetic to the argument, but I just think that in this particular case, it would not be effective: it would be a break with precedents and it would not necessarily help in the way the hon. Gentleman imagines&#151;possibly because of the delays and the attendant impact on those subject to appeals.</p>

 With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, there is a precedent in respect of electoral law and there is certainly a break with the precedent established by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. Of course what is proposed is not identical, because as the hon. Gentleman says, we are dealing with new law, but in so far as there are precedents, the amendment would constitute a break with them. I hope that I have convinced the hon. Gentleman not to press amendment 74 to the vote and to withdraw it.</p>

As I said when we debated similar amendments in Committee, such a provision would reduce the clarity of the Bill for those regulated by the commission. The amendment would introduce a time period for appeals, but it is already contained in provisions devoted to appeals and representations procedures; that is the proper place for such a time period, where it sits most obviously with other provisions relating to appeals. I think that the amendment is an unhelpful step, which would not aid comprehension of the provisions, so I oppose it on that ground alone.</p>

Member for Huntingdon asked whether there was an inconsistency between references to 28 days for appealing against fixed monetary penalties and those for variable monetary penalties. The precise point is that the maximum period for making representations for fixed monetary penalties is 28 days, which reflects the fact that the breach being punished is less likely to be serious. Representations against the decision to impose such a penalty will need less time. Variable monetary penalties are, as I have already said, likely to be higher and will be imposed in more complex cases, so it is right that longer time be given to object. That is why there is a minimum period of 28 days in that case. Both the time scales are based on the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, from which we should depart only if there is a compelling reason to do so. In this case, we do not think that there is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09020919000058">The aim of amendment 75 is, I understand, to encourage the commission to demonstrate good practice to those it regulates by acting quickly. We do not believe that the amendment, particularly in the way it is structured, is desirable. As I explained to the hon. Member for Huntingdon when a very similar amendment was tabled in Committee, we do not want unnecessarily to limit the commission in its application of the new civil sanctions regime. We do not want to depart from the framework set up by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. I have already said that many times already this afternoon and I suspect that I will need to say it many times again before we are through today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09020919000060">Whatever the circumstances of the case, we expect the commission to act as promptly as it is able to do&#151;a point that will be covered in the final guidance on enforcement. We believe that the commission is well aware of the need for working in a timely fashion. Indeed, in its draft guidance, the commission notes in words that I hope will reassure the hon. Member for Huntingdon:</p>
<a name="90209-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="09020919000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We recognise that it is important to conclude investigations as quickly as possible, in the public interest and in the interests of natural justice for those involved&#148;,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09020919000062">If I may paraphrase, it is precisely those concerns with natural justice and the public interest that lie behind the amendment, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured. This is an important point. I understand that the amendment seeks to protect those subject to investigations, but it is precisely the references to natural justice and the public interest that should reassure the hon. Gentleman. In those circumstances, it is best not to put the commission under a legal obligation to act promptly; instead, of course, performance should be monitored and recorded in the annual report to ensure that decisions are taken expeditiously and on all the right evidence. I thus hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</p>

I believe that it is right for the receipt of a civil penalty to be public, which is an important part of the deterrent effect of the civil sanctions regime. The amendment would exclude a significant range of the potential sanctions available&#151;and most likely the majority&#151;from being reported publicly. For instance, for offences that are triable only in a magistrates court, fines are capped at &#163;5,000, so should this amendment be agreed, the commission&#146;s civil sanctions would not be reported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09020919000076">I want now to speak to Government amendments 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. This is a substantial group of amendments and I shall try to move through them in a logical order. The Government amendments will essentially result in a requirement for the Electoral Commission to include in its annual report details of its use of sanctions. Government amendment 23 will require the commission to include in its annual report details of its use of new civil sanctions. The Bill already contains the requirement for the commission to report on its use of sanctions from &#147;time to time&#148;. The amendment confirms that the report must be annual, in response to the constructive debate on the issue that we had in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09020919000077">The details that must be included in the report are cases where fixed monetary penalties, discretionary requirements or stop notices have been imposed, unless they have been overturned on appeal; cases where fixed monetary penalties have been paid and, therefore, liability accepted; and cases where enforcement undertakings are accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09020919000078">During consideration in the Public Bill Committee, I accepted that annual reporting was acceptable in principle. I have since consulted the commission to confirm that it is content with that approach. It has stated in its latest  <br>

briefing note on the Bill that it supports the amendment, saying that it recognises that transparency is an important part of regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09020919000079">That approach mirrors that which we have already taken in requiring the commission&#146;s annual report to contain details on its use of investigatory powers. The commission is already required by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to lay an annual report before the House and in the other place. The amendment will result in information relating to the exercise of the new civil sanctions being included in that report. I hope that that additional scrutiny and openness will be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09020919000080">Amendments 24, 25, 26 and 27 are all consequential and simply update the language of paragraph 27(1) of schedule 2 to bring it in line with that of paragraph 15(1), which also requires information on the use of investigatory powers to be included in the annual report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09020919000081">Amendment 28 will ensure that the commission is not required to include in its report information on sanctions where it believes that it would be unlawful to include that information or where to do so would adversely affect any continuing investigation or proceedings. This is complex, so, if I may, I will explain in some detail its effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09020919000082">The first part of the provision is intended to cover circumstances where publication of the commission&#146;s interest in a particular individual might breach that person&#146;s rights under the Data Protection Act 1998 or the Human Rights Act 1998. For example, that could apply to an individual who had been under investigation but had not ultimately been given a civil sanction. The commission has already indicated in its draft enforcement guidance that it will not publish details in those circumstances, stating:</p>
<a name="90209-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="09020919000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We do not think it would be reasonable to identify regulated entities that are not sanctioned following an investigation in our reports of investigatory activity.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09020919000083">However, we must be clear about the fact that where a sanction has been imposed, and the periods for representations and appeals have ended, it is consistent with article 6 of the European convention on human rights to make that public. Access to that information is also an important principle of transparent regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09020919000084">That does not mean that the commission is required to publish full details of individuals. Indeed, it has indicated that it intends to publish only information that is essential for transparent regulation. That may be a name and the details of the sanction. The commission&#146;s draft guidance invites views on the extent to which information should identify regulated bodies or individuals, and I am sure that it will take on board the views expressed by hon. Members in this debate and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90209-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09020919000085">The second part of the provision is designed to ensure that publication of the commission&#146;s interest in a person does not jeopardise that person&#146;s right to a fair determination of any proceedings that the commission might wish to bring against him or her. It should also help to prevent the commission from being obliged to publish details of an investigation in such a way that would risk undermining operational secrecy of the sort that is often necessary for an investigation to be effective.</p>

 The amendments deal with the investigatory powers of the Electoral Commission. Let me provide some of the background. The commission was created by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which gave it supervisory powers. Its functions are set out in section 145, which stipulates that its role is as a regulator, with attendant responsibility to monitor parts 3 and 4 of the Act. Those parts relate to</p>

authorised by the commission may enter the premises of a registered party, a recognised third party or a permitted participant to inspect financial records. We should therefore appreciate that potent powers are already available to the Commission, as the Minister confirmed in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09020919000111">We support the existence of effective powers and will not revisit the PPERA powers here, but it is important for political activity not to be discouraged for fear of a heavy-handed, over-zealous and excessively empowered Electoral Commission. Furthermore, as the Minister acknowledged in Committee, the extensive powers that already exist have been used very rarely. Indeed, on Second Reading the Secretary of State for Justice confirmed that</p>
<a name="90209-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="09020919000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the existing powers have been used only once since the Electoral Commission was established nearly eight years ago.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 20 October 2008; Vol. 481, c.50.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09020919000112">Above all, let us not forget that the Bill and the Electoral Commission&#146;s powers have a common aim: restoration of confidence in the political system through the eradication of unfair and underhand practices. It is against that backdrop that we cautiously welcome the Government amendments, which, in our view, represent a significant improvement on the Bill presented in Committee. In particular, the provisions that empowered the Commission to enter the premises of donees&#151;including MPs&#151;for the purpose of monitoring has been withdrawn, while the ability to apply for a search warrant for the purpose of investigating a suspected offence or legislative breach has been entirely removed. Nevertheless, a number of reservations remain, and there is more work to be done before we can be fully satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09020919000113">Schedule 1 contains the provisions of a new schedule 19A to the 2000 Act, which is inserted in the Act by clause 2(2). In respect of schedule 1, I reiterate our conceptual support for an enhanced role for the commission as a regulator, but that support is not unqualified, and attention is now required as we address the detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09020919000114">Amendments 46 and 47 are intended to inject clarity. In the light of the commission&#146;s wide-ranging powers, it is sensible to define the limits of the relevant provisions carefully. The amendments are linked, and introduce a specified time limit for the period in which a retired officer is subject to the disclosure notice provisions. We are keen to avoid a scenario in which long-retired ex-officers of political associations are subject to disclosure notices in relation to some long-forgotten donation or action: it is both unreasonable and impractical to extend this power to very historical actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09020919000115">From a more practical perspective, the likelihood of comprehensive records or documents being kept by an officer for more than five years after his tenure is small and the power would be difficult to enforce, especially in view of the limited physical space in which party officials often find themselves working. We must also be aware of the financial and administrative burdens that we place on such individuals and organisations, as well as the fact that many of the individuals concerned will have left such offices altogether and may even have left the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09020919000116">What concerned the Minister in Committee was that, given the wording of the amendment that we proposed then, long-standing officers of more than five years&#146; standing could be excluded even if they were still serving. That was clearly not our intention. We have taken this  <br>

opportunity to hone the earlier amendment, proposing amendments 46 and 47 to address its deficiencies. They address the point made by the Minister by removing the ability to serve a notice on an ex-officer who has been retired from the post for five years or more, while not limiting the ability to serve a notice on any current officer. An additional benefit would be the encouragement of expedient and efficient issuing of notices by the Electoral Commission. If the commission does not find grounds for investigation within five years of an officer&#146;s retiring from a post, it is normally the fault of the commission rather than the individual or group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09020919000117">Let me repeat that we are dealing with unpaid volunteers in our associations who involve themselves in politics because they want to give their time freely for what they hope will be the better of our society. We must, as far as possible, encourage them in that, and not put them off by unnecessary and burdensome liabilities. To that end, I intend to press amendment 47 to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09020919000118">The background to Government amendments 11 to 22 is contentious. Great concern has been expressed throughout the passage of the Bill about the excessiveness of the new &#147;powers of entry&#148; regime. Prior to the amendments, the Bill would have extended the Electoral Commission&#146;s existing powers of entry under section 146 of the Political Parties and Electoral Reform Act to include other bodies and individuals such as donors and MPs. Quite simply, hard-fought personal liberties&#151;specifically privacy&#151;were at stake. Moreover, we were greatly concerned about potential erosion of the willingness of law-abiding citizens to donate to political parties and engage with the political system. A single abuse of the entry powers&#151;perhaps the entering of a suspected but innocent person&#146;s home&#151;could have had grave consequences for donations generally, thus damaging the general aims of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09020919000119">The Government amendments remove from the Bill the commission&#146;s excessive power to enter the premises of regulated donees, regulated participants, candidates at an election and election agents. However, they replace the removed passage with a new paragraph 1A which retains the commission&#146;s ability to enter the premises of a registered party, a recognised third party, a permitted participant, a members&#146; association, or an organisation or individual formerly falling within any of those groups. The Bill will still permit the commission to enter premises other than those excluded by Government amendment 11 for the purpose of carrying out its functions, and it may then inspect documents relating to income and expenditure. Government amendments 12, 18 and 21 are consequential, and ensure that the remaining provisions of the schedule are consistent with the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09020919000120">On 11 November last year, in Committee, the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) expressed concern lest the wholesale removal of entry powers in relation to all donees, as proposed by what was then our amendment 102, would go too far and actually reduce the existing powers of the commission. In particular, the removal of &#147;donees&#148; from the paragraph would remove members&#146; associations&#151;along with MPs&#151;from the ambit of the provision. Government amendment 11 addresses that concern by including members&#146; associations in new paragraph 1A(l)(d). The commission itself has also confirmed that the power conferred in Committee was not essential for its purposes.</p>

Accordingly, we welcome this significant Government climbdown and the reduction in the commission&#146;s power, and we are pleased that the ability to invade the privacy of MPs and other individuals will be removed. Even with these amendments, the commission will still possess significant powers to ensure it is equipped to tackle offences and infringements of the 2000 Act. Indeed, the drafting essentially preserves the status quo under the Act while removing the contentious provisions. To that extent, these amendments represent a significant retreat from the menacing position proposed in the Bill presented in Committee and return a much-needed balance to the schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09020919000122">As amended by Government amendment 11, schedule 1 would make reference to those people &#147;authorised by the Commission&#148;. Such people are very important, and almost all the powers granted to the commission are available to these individuals. Unfortunately, there is no reference in the Bill to what constitutes a person &#147;authorised by the Commission&#148;. Considering the great powers placed in their hands, we consider that it would be better if they were a defined group of persons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para27"><a name="09020919000123">Amendment 52 proposes a solution, and defines</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para28"><a name="09020919000124">and who may be authorised by the commission to exercise its powers under the schedule. Who such a person can be has been intentionally restricted to high-level employees of the commission. In Committee on 11 November, the Minister expressed concern that this would be too &#147;restrictive and inflexible&#148;. However, the Minister went on to address this concern by confirming:</p>
<a name="90209-0012.htm_brev4"><a name="09020919000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The commission has no intention of using this power lightly&#148;.<i> &#151;&#151;</i>[<i> Official Report, Political Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>11 November 2008; c. 175.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para29"><a name="09020919000125">Reconciling these two statements, I ask this question: is it not sensible that a power that will be rarely used, and employed only to tackle serious cases, is exercised only by the more senior members of the commission? It seems entirely reasonable to expect the commission to send a senior individual, ensuring that both the commission and the subject of the search take the process seriously. As things stand, the commission could theoretically send the cleaner along. Any lack of flexibility caused by this amendment reflects the need to exercise caution when exercising commission powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para30"><a name="09020919000126">Government amendment 13 represents another progressive development in an area that was hotly disputed in Committee. First and foremost, it removes the power of entry by warrant introduced by paragraph 3 of schedule 1. This is significant, and shows the progress we have made in departing from the draconian provisions of the original Bill. Without this amendment, the Bill would permit entry, by force, on to the premises of MPs and other individuals. Given recent events, I hardly need to remind hon. Members how contentious that power was; it was excessive and had the potential to be used disproportionately. In addition, the amendment replaces the entry by warrant provision with a more acceptable measure: the ability for the commission to apply for a court order that documents be released. The commission may apply for a court order when it has exhausted the request by notice procedure in paragraph 2(2). We support this measure, and believe that it is a helpful last resort when the commission is confronted with a reluctant subject of a proper investigation. The hurdles  <br>

Despite our general support for the removal of the warrant system and the introduction of court orders, we have two concerns and have tabled amendments to Government amendment 13 accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para32"><a name="09020919000128">The first of our amendments has been introduced because we believe that the High Court is a more suitable venue for hearing an application than the county court. A higher judicial threshold places a greater obligation on the commission to ensure that the reasoning behind its application is legally sound. A judge in the High Court would subject any arguments to more thorough scrutiny than could be expected from the county court. It is important that a strong check is placed on the issuing of disclosure orders, ensuring that any such order is proportionate and justified. We remain hopeful that the use of orders will be infrequent, and that this higher threshold will therefore not place any excessive burden on the commission or the High Court. Nevertheless, when such an order is required, the superior scrutiny of the High Court will be beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90209-0012.htm_para33"><a name="09020919000129">Our second amendment to Government amendment 13 addresses our concern that no specific time limit is given for compliance with an order once it is served.

There should be a sufficient and clear period during which those served with a disclosure notice can locate the documents and information specified under the notice, and provide it to the commission. Effort should be made to ensure that individuals do not fall victim to the Bill&#146;s penalty regime because of unforeseen delays and an uncertain deadline. With a 28-day limit in place, subjects will know how long they have to comply, and can work to the deadline without fearing that the commission might place them under an unrealistic deadline.</p>

Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton), deal with the commission&#146;s power under the Bill to enter and search premises by warrant. The amendments are an alternative to amendments tabled by the Government, which remove the powers of entry and search by warrant, and I believe they have effectively been superseded.</p>

It is important that individuals or groups who are subject to this power of the commission have the full details of the search. A copy of the authorisation is important for them to decide whether they wish to access avenues of appeal and redress. The amendment fortifies vital safeguards, and helps to prevent the abuse of powers by the commission. Providing copies of the authorisation documentation ensures that the propriety  <br>

of the search is asserted, and that the subject can confirm the details of the search. Further, leaving a copy allows for cool and considered review of the warrant away from the heat of the moment, and it prevents a simple flash of paper when the recipient is in shock from the entry process. In the heat of the moment, it is possible that the shock of the entrance could counteract any explanation of the search, however thorough and clear the commission believes it to be. Further still, there is no guarantee that a relevant person will be at the premises when it is searched. For example, the cleaner or an office junior might be the only person present, and as such not be qualified to fully comprehend the explanation, let alone communicate it to someone more senior. In Committee on 13 November, the Minister considered this issue and promised to return to it on Report if necessary, so I would be pleased if he were now to give us his views on it.</p>

 The whole House supports the principle of proper entry and inspection, and, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said, there is a desire for that to be proportionate. The discussion among all the parties currently represented in the Chamber reflects that aim, and it is interesting that the commission itself in its briefing supports the line being taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09020919000134">It is right to go down the court order procedure route. I have been a Member of this House for a long time, and I well remember the days before we had the Electoral Commission. Whatever view one takes of the record of the commission&#151;I do not feel qualified to make a judgment on that&#151;the fact is that there is a consensus that we need a commission. It must be an independent body, but it also works within a framework laid down by the House of Commons.</p>

 I, too, welcome the Government amendments in this group. As the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said, there was widespread concern in the House not only about the extent of the powers being granted to the commission, but about the way in which those powers were to be exercised by a warrant process that did not contain much accountability. From the start of the debate on this matter, the commission has conceded the point; in evidence to us, it said that it would prefer a different sort of procedure. The way in which the Government have introduced the procedure in the amendments reflects well on what the commission asked them to do: to move to a different process whereby an application is made to a court for an order, the court checks that the order has been properly applied for and the circumstances are such that an order should be made, and the sanction is basically the one for contempt of court&#151;rightly, anyone who defies a court order to act in the way that the commission wants is asking for trouble. That is a far more proportionate, accountable and open way of proceeding.</p>

would end up with less regulatory coverage than there is now. I am entirely satisfied with the Government&#146;s response on that matter, for precisely the reason that he mentioned&#151;the new drafting covers the cases I had in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09020929000009">I can offer the hon. Gentleman some comfort in that, compared with the previous debate, I agree with the Conservatives&#146; amendments 46 and 47. He rightly says that there is a need for some sort of statutory limitations on this sort of regulation; we cannot have people who are long retired still facing the prospect of having action taken against them under these powers. For the sake of certainty and clarity, it is right to have a cut-off point, so I am with him in his principle, which is right, and I will support him in the Lobby if he manages to secure a vote on this particular point. However, I would prefer a time limit of six years, rather than five, simply because&#151;this goes back to the previous debate&#151;that would be more in line with the normal limitation times used in law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09020929000010">On amendment 52, the hon. Gentleman is also right to say that there ought to be a specific list of people of a specific degree of seniority who can act on the behalf of the commission. Simply making provision in respect of anyone to whom the commission might delegate gives too broad a discretion. This ought to be controlled by not only the commission&#146;s views as to what is right, but by statute, and I am perfectly happy to support what he said on that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09020929000011">As for what the hon. Gentleman said about the High Court, I do not wish to repeat what was said in a previous debate. His proposal might be putting too much of a burden on High Court judges, but this is a different case from the one in the previous debate; there might be a case for saying that instances of sensitivity would be involved where someone defies a court order and the appeal might, thus, be more appropriately heard at a higher level than a simple fixed penalty notice matter would be.</p>

it, because I wish to deal first with the two sets of Government amendments. As hon. Members have said, they significantly overhaul the commission&#146;s powers of entry in schedule 1, and I believe they will be universally welcomed by the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09020929000016">Government amendment 11 replaces paragraph 1(5) to new schedule 19A to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000&#151;that new schedule is contained in schedule 1 to this Bill&#151;with new paragraph 1A. The new paragraph differs from paragraph 1(5) by specifying a more restricted list of organisations and individuals to whom the commission&#146;s powers of entry and inspection for the purposes of carrying out its functions will apply&#151;the list includes registered political parties, recognised third parties, permitted participants in a referendum, members associations and any former member of any of those categories. The power can be exercised by the commission for the purposes of carrying out its functions, but it does not authorise the use of force to enter premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09020929000017">As hon. Members have said, the effect of the amendment is that the commission will not have the power to enter the premises of the following: candidates at an election; election agents; permitted participants; and regulated donees, including MPs&#151;with the exception of members associations. The financial affairs of members&#146; associations are likely to be more complex than those of regulated individuals, so retaining the extension to the existing power in section 146(3) of PPERA in relation to this group will help the commission to ensure transparency in supervising its activity. The provision has been amended to remove Members of Parliament from the scope of the power, but I must make it clear that this does not create any specific exclusion for House of Commons offices, and that reflects the approach towards this power taken by the 2000 Act and the approach taken towards powers of entry more widely in legislation. Should the commission require entry to a parliamentary office&#151;for example, where a party has chosen to keep its records in a Member&#146;s office or a member&#146;s association has been run from a Member&#146;s parliamentary office&#151;it advises that it would seek access only through the appropriate channels, and in the House of Commons, that would be through the Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09020929000018">We believe that it is important to retain this limited power of entry for the commission to enter premises and inspect documents for the purposes of carrying out its functions. Although the commission has generally relied on voluntary disclosure and consensual meetings to discuss and review financial information, having this supervisory power, in itself, may have been an effective backstop in helping to ensure that supervised individuals comply with regulatory requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, may I emphasise that the commission&#146;s power in schedule 1 to the Bill to require the disclosure of documents relating to income and expenditure from all supervised individuals, including regulated donees, will remain?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09020929000019">The amendment will largely restore this power to the equivalent provision in the 2000 Act, although there are two sensible and limited changes to the existing powers. First, the power will be available in relation to members&#146; associations, as I have explained. Secondly, it will be available in relation to organisations or individuals who formerly used to fall within any of the categories that I have mentioned&#151;those listed in new paragraphs 1A(a) to (d). This latter change brings the power into line with  <br>

the existing power under the 2000 Act to request documents that applies to former members of the appropriate categories. We see no sensible reason for the existing anomaly between the two powers to seek information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09020929000020">Our approach will also help to prevent a situation in which the commission has to cease to examine an organisation&#146;s affairs midway through a compliance check simply because the organisation has taken steps to remove itself from one of the categories subject to the power. Hon. Members will recall that we took steps in Committee to help to ensure that this power would be exercised reasonably by tabling a Government amendment to prevent the commission from using its routine monitoring powers of entry in connection with an investigation, and that safeguard remains in place. The commission have provided assurances that they expect to use the power very rarely.</p>

I believe that they do so without compromising the commission&#146;s essential ability to carry out its work effectively, and I hope that they will be welcomed by the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09020929000023">Government amendments 13 to 15, 17, 19, 20 and 22 make changes to the provisions on the commission&#146;s powers of entry by warrant. These amendments are also intended to address concerns that were widely expressed on Second Reading and in Committee, and I hope that they will also be welcomed by the House. The commission has indicated that it would be content to consider an alternative approach to the provision in the Bill that would enable them to apply for a warrant to enter premises provided that it met its objective of being empowered to investigate more effectively. We believe that the proposals contained in Government amendment 13 will meet that objective, but will also meet all the concerns that have been expressed about the existing provisions at various stages of the Bill&#146;s progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09020929000024">The proposals have been discussed with the commission at all stages of their development. Government amendment 13 would remove the power set out in paragraph 3 of new schedule 19(a), which enables the commission to apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant to authorise entry and search of premises in connection with an investigation. It would replace that power with a power enabling the commission, in cases in which a person has already refused to provide documents, to apply to the court for an order to require disclosure of the previously requested documents in order to enforce the commission&#146;s original notice. The court which issues an order may not, when making an order or dealing with any failure to comply with that order, use this power to authorise the commission to enter premises to obtain the documents. This is the key difference between the warrant power and this new proposal, and I want to be as clear as I can about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09020929000025">The court order is intended to add an extra and very important layer of compulsion to the commission&#146;s power to request documents. It is vitally important that  <br>

the initial request from the commission is not the end of the story for someone who has documents that are relevant to an investigation. Equally, as Members on both sides of the House have made clear, it is important that we do not go too far in the opposite direction. We have listened very carefully to the concerns that have been expressed about the warrant power, and that is why, on reflection, we have decided to remove the court&#146;s ability to issue a warrant to authorise entry of premises by the commission. It is important that the new power is subject to suitable and appropriate safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09020929000026">A court order would not be issued automatically on an application being made by the commission. The commission&#146;s representative must first demonstrate on oath that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been an offence or a contravention under the Act; that there are documents referred to in the disclosure notice that have not been produced; that these documents are reasonably required by the commission for the purposes of investigating the suspected offence or contravention; and that the documents are in the custody or under the control of the person against whom the order is issued. Those are extensive safeguards. When seeking an order, the commission will serve notice on the individual or organisation against whom the order is sought in order to ensure that they are represented at the hearing of the application for the order, and the court will consider the application under ordinary court rules governing applications for court orders, and it will be able to decide whether oral or written evidence is most appropriate in each case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09020929000027">Failure to comply with a court order would constitute contempt of court. It may be a criminal offence under paragraph 13, but the same breach cannot be penalised by proceedings brought both for contempt and for the paragraph 13 offence. If someone refused to comply with the court order and the commission took the view that it was necessary to obtain the documents for an investigation to continue, it would have no power to seek entry on its own account in order to obtain documents. Instead, in practice, the commission would, if it felt it appropriate to do so, bring the matter to the attention of the police who would consider whether they were willing to use their power under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to apply to obtain a warrant. That would be a matter for the police to consider in individual cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09020929000028">As now, the commission would not be able to rely on the police to obtain a warrant to search premises in connection with offences that are triable summarily only, as the power to apply for a warrant under PACE does not apply to such offences. Offences under the 2000 Act that are triable summarily only are set out in schedule 20 of that Act. Examples include section 146 offences of intentional obstruction of a person seeking to enter premises on behalf of the commission, and section 148 offences of failing, without reasonable excuse, to provide information reasonably required by the commission.</p>

corollary of that is that the Electoral Commission must use the investigatory powers at its disposal responsibly. It is for that reason that we tabled several amendments in Committee to require the commission to issue guidance on its use of its investigatory powers and to provide information in its annual report on that usage. Those safeguards remain in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09020929000030">Amendments 14, 15, 17, 19 and 22 are consequential, arising from amendment 13. Amendments 14 and 15 replace references to documents taken possession of, as under a warrant, with a reference to documents delivered in compliance with a court order. Amendments 17, 19 and 22 replace references to a warrant with references to an order. Amendment 20 removes the requirement for the commission to provide information about its use of warrants in the guidance that it is required to issue on the use of its investigatory powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09020929000031">I will now turn to amendments (a) and (b) to Government amendment 13. Government amendment 13 would remove the powers of search and entry by warrant and replace it with a power for the commission to seek a court order requiring enforcement of its disclosure notice. The effect of amendment (a) would be that consideration of the commission&#146;s application seeking a court order to enforce its disclosure notice would rest with the High Court rather than with a county court as Government amendment 13 provides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09020929000032">I appreciate the reasoning behind this amendment, which is to ensure that applications for court orders are subject to thorough scrutiny at the appropriate level of jurisdiction. As we have discussed, it is standard practice for orders to enforce disclosure notices in civil cases to be issued by a county court, which is why the clauses have been drafted in this way. Although now overtaken by Government amendment 13, I appreciate that in Committee the Government committed to amending the Bill so that the power to issue a warrant to authorise entry and search of premises would rest with High Court rather than with a justice of the peace. However, orders for disclosure of documents by their nature are more likely to be sought than warrants for entry of premises, and so any changes to standard practice may have an unnecessary impact on the work load of the High Court unnecessarily. If the result of that were to be to prolong the time period between the date on which an application is made and that on which it is considered, I can see two obvious disadvantages. One, it might slow down commission investigations, which could impact on the effectiveness of those investigations. Secondly, there might also be adverse consequences for those under investigation. The longer it takes for an order to be issued, the longer the investigation is likely to be and the greater the uncertainty for the individuals or organisations concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90209-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09020929000033">There could be other unforeseen consequences in providing for orders in these cases to be issued by the High Court. I will want to look into that. But, as I say, I understand the reasoning behind this amendment and I am prepared to consider further whether it would be helpful and practicable to accept it. We would need to consult interested parties, including the Lord Chief Justice, before we can make an informed decision whether it would be appropriate for consideration of these applications to rest with the High Court. I agree therefore to consider the amendments, but I cannot at this stage make any firm commitment one way or the other about whether we will be able to take them forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09020929000034">I want to resist amendment (b) to Government amendment 13, which would require those served with a disclosure notice made by a county court under the power set out in paragraph 3 of new schedule 19A to comply with the terms of that order within 28 days. I notice that the intent is very similar to that of amendment 50. Of course, I agree that those who are subject to a disclosure order need to be given time to comply with it and that they need to know how long that period is, but that is why Government amendment 13 provides for a disclosure order to specify a reasonable period of time within which the person to whom the notice is given must comply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09020929000035">I believe that when making a disclosure order, it is appropriate to give the court the flexibility to vary the period of compliance depending on the individual facts of each particular case and the nature of the application made by the commission. For example, the court might need to allow a longer period for the production of documents or the provision of information in some instances than in others. However, when a request is time-critical&#151;particularly when there is concern that the success of an investigation might be prejudiced if it is not obtained speedily&#151;a period of less than 28 days might be appropriate. A longer period might be appropriate when a large amount of documentation is sought. Given the range of documents and information that could be covered by a disclosure notice, I do not think that a one-size-fits all approach is suitable and therefore I do not think that we should tie the court&#146;s hands in the way that the amendment proposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09020929000036">I do not think that there should be any concern that failing to accept the amendment will cause uncertainty about the time periods within which a person served with an order must comply. The Government amendment requires that the order itself must stipulate the time for compliance. That will be a specific date and it will be clear to the person served with the order. I hope, for those reasons, that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will withdraw amendment (b).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09020929000037">I now turn to Opposition amendment 57, which is now redundant as we have removed from the Bill the provision that would have allowed the commission to apply to a court for a warrant to search premises in connection with an investigation. Amendment 52 would require a person entering premises under the power of entry set out in paragraph 1 of schedule 1 to be either an employee at managerial level at the Electoral Commission or a police officer. As I said in Committee, authorisation of the use of the power by a manager at the commission would in practice be embedded in the commission&#146;s operation of the power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09020929000038">I would expect entry under the power of entry that the commission is granted in the Bill&#151;it is largely the same as its existing power of entry, which, incidentally, it has never used&#151;to take place very rarely. For that reason alone, I expect that senior management would be fully involved in any decision to use the power. However, to set out in statute that an entry could be carried out only by a senior manager would be unnecessarily restrictive and inflexible. In order to fulfil its duties effectively, the commission must have the ability to delegate entry and inspection duties to staff below managerial level, where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09020929000039">The commission, we are assured, has absolutely no intention of using the power lightly. We know that it is aware that entering premises is a significant step and it  <br>

will operate the power responsibly, as it has done with the existing power to date. We can be confident, I think, of that. In addition, we must keep in mind that the commission will have to exercise its powers in a way that is compatible with rights under the European convention on human rights&#151;including article 8, which is the right to respect for private life&#151;and that is compatible with general principles of public law.</p>

<p><a name="st_o222"><a name="09020929000040"><a name="90209-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="09020929000579"><b>Mr. Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b>
 I have been listening to the Minister&#146;s argument very carefully. He says that the power will be used only in exceptional circumstances, that it will be a senior management decision and that he expects it not to be delegated down. Surely it will be much simpler just to put a provision in the Bill that it will not be delegated down.</p>

<p><a name="st_o223"><a name="09020929000041"><a name="90209-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="09020929000580"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 It might be simpler, but it still might not be the right thing to do. That is the point. The point that I am trying to develop is that we need, as far as we possibly can, to give the commission the flexibility to exercise its powers proportionately. We do not want to fix in statute something that would tie its hands unnecessarily in all circumstances for the foreseeable future. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleague, the hon. Member for Huntingdon made it quite clear&#151;I agree with him&#151;that we are not legislating just for the commission. We are legislating for the future and we think that it is wrong to proceed on the principle of trying to tie the commission&#146;s hands at every point, for the reasons that I already set out at great length when the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) was not in his place. I am happy to discuss them with him outside the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09020929000042">The commission is aware that inappropriate use of the power would leave it open to possible judicial review. It has taken steps to employ suitably skilled staff in the fields of enforcement and compliance to ensure that they are all equipped adequately to carry out their functions within the confines of the law. I have confidence, and I hope that the House will have confidence, that the commission will only authorise staff with the appropriate skills and expertise if it feels, on those rare occasions, that there is a justification to use this power of entry. I hope that hon. Members will feel sufficiently reassured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09020929000043">I now turn, finally, to amendments 46 and 47, which seek to amend paragraph 1(2) of proposed new schedule 19A, which sets out the commission&#146;s power to issue disclosure notices. I shall deal with them together. They are largely identical to amendments tabled in Committee. Together, they seek to place a time limit on the commission&#146;s powers to issue a disclosure notice. The hon. Member for Huntingdon set out his concerns very cogently and in Committee I agreed to consider the issue further. We have now done so in close and careful consultation with the Electoral Commission, which has confirmed that a time restriction on the power to issue a disclosure notice under paragraph 1 of proposed new schedule 19A is not likely to be a problem in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09020929000044">The paragraph 1(2) power to issue a disclosure notice relates to the commission&#146;s supervisory role so it is very unlikely that it would need to issue a disclosure notice to a person who more than five years previously had been a person to whom paragraph 1(2) applied. I resisted the amendment in Committee on the basis that it was  <br>

unlikely that the commission would need to go back further than five years, but we could not rule out the possibility and we were reliant on the commission&#146;s exercising its powers reasonably and having regard to the general principles of public law before issuing disclosure notices. I still believe that there is not a real problem to be solved and that as a matter of principle we should not place unnecessary constraints on the commission&#146;s powers. However, I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said and I take his point that keeping audit trails for more than five years might be unduly onerous on people who are often volunteers and who might have moved on from the period of their life in which they took part in such voluntary activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09020929000045">We have received a reassurance from the commission that placing a restriction on the paragraph 1(2) powers such as that suggested by the hon. Gentleman is unlikely to be a problem in practice, and so I am happy to consider with parliamentary counsel what amendments could and should be made to the Bill properly to reflect the intention of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman will understand that because of the significant number of Government amendments, we have not been a position to do that job of work just yet. However, we will do so at the next available opportunity. I hope that he will understand that we felt it necessary to seek and secure the commission&#146;s views before proceeding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90209-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09020929000046">For the avoidance of doubt, I am only agreeing to consider an amendment to the power under paragraph 1(2) that enables the commission to issue a disclosure notice in relation to its supervisory role. I think that that is what the amendments seek. The commission has emphasised&#151;I want to make this clear&#151;that any such time bar on requests for information under paragraph 2 in relation to a suspected offence or contravention could cause difficulty, so we are not considering any changes to that power. I hope that on that basis and with those assurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendments 46 and 47.</p>

 We welcome the Government&#146;s significant shift on many of the provisions to a position that we basically support. I appreciate the Minister&#146;s agreement this evening to review the role of the High Court.</p>

The Minister has just addressed the main one; we are pleased that he now sees that there is a case for offering protections to non-serving association officers, who normally will have served on a voluntary basis. We had great concerns that ongoing liability would be unfair to such people. Having heard the Minister&#146;s explanation, and his promise to table an amendment in the other place, I will not press amendment 47 to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 The new clause will be of interest to Members because it is designed to make their lives a little easier. After the discussions about whether a compliance officer should be able to be appointed, we do not think the new clause will allow a holder of elective office to appoint a person to act as a compliance officer for the purpose of ensuring compliance with controls in the 2000 Act. There is nothing in that Act to prevent the appointment of an individual to help with compliance, but the clause ensures that such appointments can be made on a statutory basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90209-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09020929000566">We do not consider it appropriate to compel holders of elective office to appoint a compliance officer. That would be an unnecessary burden on Members, where there may have been no need in the first place. However, as I said in Committee, we recognise that some will wish to make such appointment. The clause as drafted is permissive and allows a holder of elective office to notify the Electoral Commission that they have appointed a compliance officer.</p>

when I tell him that the clause adopts a common-sense approach. It does not absolve office-holders from responsibility for compliance with their obligations under schedule 7 of PPERA. The question of who will be liable for a breach of the requirements for reporting on and handling donations will depend, as so often, on the facts of the case, but both the office-holder and the compliance officer may be subject to criminal sanction where there has been a failure to comply with their reporting requirements. The only exception&#151;</p>

 The amendment, which unites all the minority parties in this House, stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) and other colleagues across the House, and it should also include signatures from the Democratic Unionist party. We, the minority parties of this House, are in effect and in fact the Governments of the different legislatures across the United Kingdom. The amendment is self-explanatory. We want the Electoral Commission, in regulating across the United Kingdom, to recognise the new reality of the UK in 2009: the multi-party, multi-legislature UK that we currently experience. It is no good for it simply to reflect this House&#151;the old tired Westminster solution of the two main parties, with the Liberals acting as a sop for all the other minority parties. The amendments try to define that new system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90209-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09020936000500">Let us take a cursory look around the United Kingdom. In this House, we have a majority Labour Government; in Scotland, we have a minority SNP Government and in Wales and Northern Ireland, we have coalitions of different parties. Different parties are in power throughout the United Kingdom. In fact, the only two parties involved in this debate who are not in power anywhere in the UK are the Conservative and Liberal parties, yet they will have a political commissioner nominee for the new commission. That is totally unacceptable to us.</p>

If it were just about this House, having one political commissioner between the four parties would seem to be fair and reasonable, but the Electoral Commission has a remit beyond these green Benches. It serves all the legislatures, Parliaments and Assemblies throughout the United Kingdom, and the appointment of those political commissioners should adequately reflect and represent that.</p>

of 646, that is the case. However, it is not the case in Scotland. We are the largest party in Scotland by seats and by votes. We are the Government of Scotland. If we look at the last two by-elections in Scotland, we find that Labour party won one&#151;I see that the hon. Member for Glenrothes (Lindsay Roy) is in his place&#151;and the SNP won one. The Conservatives narrowly held on to their deposit in one seat but lost it in the other. The Liberals lost both their deposits. Those parties are quickly becoming minority parties in Scotland, yet they will have a nominated political commissioner, who will be involved in regulating electoral law for the Scottish Parliament, while the party of Government in Scotland will not have such an appointee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90209-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09020936000503">That is clearly absurd, unfair and bizarre, and it is totally unacceptable to us. It is as if we were to say to the Labour party, &#147;Let&#146;s have politically nominated commissioners, but you can&#146;t have one.&#148; That would be totally unacceptable to the Minister and his colleagues. I would wager that it would be unacceptable to the Conservatives were they to be told, &#147;We&#146;re going to have politically nominated commissioners. The Labour party can have one, but sorry, Conservative party, you can&#146;t have one.&#148; I am sure that had the Labour and the Conservative parties been allowed to have politically nominated commissioners and the Liberal party had not, that would be totally unacceptable to the Liberals. They would be standing with me, full of indignation about what had been suggested. This debate is about fairness and what is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90209-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09020936000504">I want to dispel the notion&#151;we debated this in Committee at some length; I remember discussing it with the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), who I am sure is paying attention to everything that I am saying&#151;that these politically nominated commissioners have nothing to do with the parties that are nominating them. What a lot of nonsense to suggest that they are somehow above politics and will be nominated by political parties only to give us the benefit of their experience and of their years in this House&#151;&#147;Aye, right&#148;, as we say in Scotland. They are there as political nominees from those political parties, and they will have a role to play for those parties.</p>

 I am indeed paying close attention to every word that the hon. Gentleman is saying, many of which he said when we considered the matter in Committee. He is right to reiterate his argument now, but that does not make it any more correct than it was then. The fact is that if people of seniority, experience and wisdom are appointed to a body such as the Electoral Commission, they are not there to serve narrow party political interests, and to suggest that they are is to suggest that the entire political class is incapable of rising above party politics and acting for the common good and for the sake of democracy, which is what we really want.</p>

sure that Labour Members will say, &#147;If it&#146;s just a bit of experience they want, we&#146;ll not bother nominating anybody&#148;, and the Liberals will do the same. I offered them that opportunity in Committee, and&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;they were not prepared to take up my generous offer, because they know, as I do, that we are talking about party political representatives on the Electoral Commission.

There is a fourth place reserved for all of the minority parties. How on earth the Social Democratic and Labour party and the SNP&#151;Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionists cannot be with us tonight&#151;can decide about how we should nominate one commissioner for the Electoral Commission is beyond me.</p>

If a former Member from Northern Ireland, for example, was to be a political commissioner, what on earth would they know about the Scottish parliamentary system and Scottish politics? I would have very little knowledge of what happens in Northern Ireland if that task were ever to fall on me, so I look forward to learning how the matter will be determined.

 As my right hon. Friend knows, I was my predecessor&#146;s election agent from 1983. I was astonished by the lack of knowledge of electoral law at the Electoral Commission. Not one of its representatives had stood as a candidate, been an agent or understood the basics of local funding of political parties. Not one of them understood how returns were filled in or the need to complete them within 28 days. I saw a shambles in Bathgate on the night of the electoral count, when we had to abandon the count at 5.30 am and recommence it at 12 o&#146;clock. That was totally under the control of the Electoral Commission. Surely it is time that we got some real political knowledge and insight on the commission.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. We could go over the history of the matter, and as I said earlier, if we go back far enough it was all under the auspices of the Home Office. As has been said, we now have a hotchpotch of electoral systems in Scotland and elsewhere, with different ways of voting in different elections. There is considerable merit in being prepared to consider the matter constructively. As we know, power devolved is power retained, and this is not just about the House of Commons. As my hon.

 The point made by the hon.

Likewise, the Scottish Parliament counterpart of the hon. Member for Glenrothes (Lindsay Roy) is Tricia Marwick of the SNP, and that of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang) is Kenny McAskill of the SNP. That is all the more reason to back up the suggestion of the hon.

 I do agree that that is necessary, and that the Electoral Commission&#146;s credibility in carrying out its task, which covers elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly, depends on its having a spread of people with intimate knowledge of what is going on in those elections. Not only fairness but effectiveness is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90209-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09020936000542">The point about electoral systems has been well made. The systems used in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland are entirely different from those used for this House&#151;more&#146;s the pity, in the case of the Northern Ireland system. That shows the variety of problems that the commission faces. More than that, we are dealing with different political cultures. It is not just how people are elected that is different in this House from the Scottish Parliament, Wales or Northern Ireland. The multi-party nature of those assemblies makes politics different. We cannot understand a place&#146;s electoral politics unless we understand the culture of its politics. That point is fundamental.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90209-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09020936000543">We must therefore consider how to deal with the current situation, which I hope is temporary. The principle suggested by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire is right: the law must recognise the existence of the other parliamentary assemblies. We in this House are not the only relevant people. I am absolutely with him on that, and I am glad that he wishes to press to a Division the amendment that makes precisely that point, but I am afraid that I am with my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) on the exact mechanism and numbers that the hon. Gentleman has chosen. If we were to require an unweighted number of 15 parliamentarians for a party to be represented, we would end up with nine political commissioners, four of whom would represent Northern Irish parties. One of those would be Sinn Fein, and it would be interesting to see whether it took up its position.</p>

 I wish to speak about amendments 31, 32 and 33, which I tabled as the hon. Member who speaks on behalf of the Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Electoral Commission.

Secondly, the choice between two candidates might prove to be a false choice, with the dice deliberately loaded in favour of one candidate. If a party leader wishes to nominate more than one person, nothing in the amendments would prevent that, but the Speaker&#146;s Committee sees no reason for requiring multiple nominations. The Speaker&#146;s Committee takes the view that its role should be to assess a nominee&#146;s suitability to be an electoral commissioner and, on that basis, to approve or reject him or her.</p>

 The Speaker&#146;s Committee agrees. That is why it has concurred with the Government&#146;s proposals to have electoral commissioners with political experience. It believes that the best way of appointing such people is for party leaders to nominate a person who would be approved or not by the Electoral Commission. The hon.

 First, the Chairman of the Speaker&#146;s Committee is technically the Speaker. He is not always present, but he is technically the Chairman of the committee. The Electoral Commission was created with the intention of its being independent, but it has to be responsible for pay and rations to somebody. The House decided that the &#147;somebody&#148; would be the Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Electoral Commission, and that it would seek to carry out its duties fairly and responsibly. To date, I have heard no criticism that the Speaker&#146;s Committee is partial or unfair.

As far as I understand it, the whole idea behind putting political nominees on to the Electoral Commission is to do with the nature of the democratic process and all that goes with it, which includes how the Electoral Commission responds, and the idea that that body should have serving on it a number of people with political experience in general who can relate that experience to how it works.</p>

all part of the process. The Electoral Commission should be concerned to ensure that those processes, as well as everything that happens between those elections, are undertaken in a fair, non-partisan, clean and transparent way.

 I actually agree with the hon. Gentleman. I have the same hope and aspiration that the political nominees will serve the commission in that way.

To take the example of Scotland, the Scottish election will be determined by the Electoral Commission, on which the Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties will be represented, but there will be no Scottish National party representation.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern. However, all of us, both in this House and in the Parliaments and Assemblies in the UK, are in the difficult position between, on the one hand, being perceived as perhaps acting unfairly in respect of how those people are placed on the Electoral Commission in the first place and, on the other hand, being perceived as simply pursuing party, partisan advantage, by placing people on the Electoral Commission in order to fight the corner of our parties.

Under those circumstances, if it so happened that the outcome was that there were no Labour representatives from among those who had been nominated, I for one would not be unhappy, because they would have been nominated by the Parliaments and Assemblies of the UK. As matters stand, it appears that we are nowhere near what I would consider to be an ideal outcome, which relates to what the job to be done should be and how it ought to be perceived as being done.

 Surely the case for representation from Northern Ireland, by way of an example, is demonstrated by the Bill itself, because as you will have noticed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it amends the system of elections to the European Parliament in Northern Ireland, which is contrary to the Electoral Commission&#146;s proposals. Rightly or wrongly, the Government have been persuaded by Northern Ireland politicians to discard the commission&#146;s advice. In a sense, that is a compelling case for Northern Ireland politicians to be represented on the commission, because their view prevailed.

Members have pointed out, lead to what would broadly be perceived as an unfair outcome. That seems to be the way we are going. My suggestion is that we either seek nominations from all the Parliaments and Assemblies or go with the proposal from the Speaker&#146;s Commission to find a system whereby the fairness of the nomination can be underpinned by the way in which the nominations are made.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s hopes are laudable, and we can all follow his arguments. He is right to look for fairness, but that ain&#146;t what we have got on the amendment paper tonight. Instead, we have a Scottish amendment that is not perfect&#151;it is not what I would want&#151;but that is fairer than the alternative that would pertain if we do not accept it. We should therefore support it and vote for it, and force the Government to look again at this matter. This electoral system&#151;our democracy&#151;does not belong to us; it belongs to the public. The important thing is how the public perceive these things. The people in Scotland, just like the people in Castle Point, are not going to see this as fair.

 I am listening very carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who is making some very good points. He is presenting his own personal utopia, and I do not disagree with him. However, I want to echo the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and say that we have a choice tonight between the Government&#146;s proposal and that of the Scottish National party. Which of those options is closer to the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman puts forward two options. One would result in about four out of nine commissioners being from parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The alternative does not appear to go down that route, and would not necessarily involve the membership of the Electoral Commission reflecting an exact replica of the party membership of the Assemblies and Parliaments across the UK. I accept that this is a conundrum and a continuing problem. I also accept that it is not easy to resolve. My personal view is that something like what we have had before, as now, is probably the best way to proceed. My desired outcome would allow the Assemblies and Parliaments of the United Kingdom collectively to choose who the nominees would be, but that proposal is not on the table tonight. We need to choose between a proposal that looks fair and representative but whose outcome would not be, and one that does not look so fair or representative but whose outcome might be workable for the next stage of the Electoral Commission.</p>

Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) have decried proportional representation, but that system is in operation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;and even, I believe, in London&#151;so it is an important part of the electoral system in the UK. However, that is being dismissed in the carve-up, at least between the two main parties. It is important that, as things stand, no one on the commission will be representing these important systems.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, because it was this Government who brought in that pluralism in our electoral arrangements. If he has not already read it, I commend to the hon. Gentleman the review of voting systems published by this Department under the able stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary, which sets out a detailed examination of how these different electoral systems operate. We think that pluralism is desirable; that is why we introduced it. The fact is that the three largest parties in the Westminster Parliament have the largest collective pool of experience to draw upon in bringing knowledge of all these different electoral systems to bear on the work of the Electoral Commission. That is precisely the point. Far from dismissing this pluralism, we brought it in and we intend to draw on it to the best effect in the Electoral Commission.</p>

 But does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that proportional representation has delivered different forms of government? The SNP is in government in Edinburgh; Plaid Cymru is in coalition in Wales; and the Democratic Unionist party is in government in Northern Ireland. Should not those Governments of three of the nations of the United Kingdom have an input into the Electoral Commission, because of the differences in the nations of the United Kingdom?</p>

 Of course not; the hon. Lady is right. What lies behind her comments is a point that has been made over and again, and which the hon. Members who tabled the amendments seem incapable of understanding: politicians serving on public bodies are capable of operating in the public interest, rather than merely in their own narrow, tribal, party political interests. I am sorry that the tablers of the amendments seem incapable of believing that, but all practical experience tells us that it is so. Unfortunately, we are unlikely to agree on this issue, and we will resist the amendments.</p>

 This has been a good and interesting debate, containing some valuable contributions&#151;until we reached those from the Government and Opposition Front-Benchers, when it started to get disappointing. We have a situation in which the largest party in Scotland, by votes and seats awarded, will have no input on electoral regulations for elections in Scotland, and that is totally unacceptable to our party.</p>

 To be fair to the Minister, I should say that that is not how it seems from our Benches. This arrangement is all right for him, because he has his political commissioner and he will be able to nominate somebody to serve on the Electoral Commission, and it is all right for the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) and for the Liberals, because they will be able to nominate somebody to serve on it. The provisions are not all right and acceptable for us, because we will not be able to nominate someone to serve on the Electoral Commission to run and regulate elections in our nation. That is the heart of the matter; this is about fairness, democracy and ensuring that people are properly represented in this House.</p>

come close to defining the criteria on which this fourth commissioner will be determined, because he does not know what they will be&#151;he has no clue as to how this will be determined. I, too, have no idea, and neither does the Minister or the hon. Member for Epping Forest. What will be the arrangements for the fourth commissioner? How will the decision be made? The Minister does not seem to know. If he does know, will he please get up and tell me?</p>

 The Minister will know that that was not an answer and that he does not know how the fourth commissioner will be determined&#151;nobody knows. This is a total mess, but I propose a solution. I get the sense from the rest of the House that a threshold of 15 parliamentarians will not be acceptable, so I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment containing that proposal. However, I hope that other hon. Members will support the principle that the other legislatures in the United Kingdom are important and must be taken into account. That is a challenge to hon. Members here this evening. I know about the support of the Liberals, who believe that the other Parliaments are important, that we live in a multiparty democracy and that we are now in a different type of United Kingdom. The challenge is for other hon. Members: do they recognise that or do they not? Are we to have the stable, closed-door Westminster wheelings and dealings? Is it all about the green Benches here or is it all about the new reality of the United Kingdom?</p>

 My hon.

 This group of amendments will overhaul and refine the provisions in the Bill relating to candidate expenditure. I think that it is true to say that the provisions have attracted a great deal of comment, not to mention controversy and criticism. We have listened to those criticisms, as we always do. The group of amendments are intended to address the various concerns raised by hon. Members. I shall begin by setting out the points on which I think that we are on common ground. I believe that we can all agree that changes to the legislation on party funding should, as far as possible, be made on the basis of a broad consensus of support between the political parties. We cannot allow party funding to become&#151;or, just as importantly, to be perceived to have become&#151;a partisan issue. That would be hugely destabilising to our democracy. All of us on both sides of the House have a duty to ensure that legislation on party funding supports a strong, fair and open democracy that commands the trust and respect of the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09020937000479">Inevitably, election campaigning requires money to be spent, but it is a long-established and, I believe, well-supported principle that first and foremost, elections are a contest of ideas and policies.

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1217</b><br>
spending devalues the integrity of our democratic system. I hope we can all agree on that. It is for this reason that the law on party funding has, since the late 19th century, set strict limits on the amount of money that can be spent in pursuing election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09020937000480">In the first instance, the law limited only the amount that a candidate could spend on election campaigning. However, in recognition of the increasingly important role of national campaigning conducted by political parties, the law has, since the passage of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, also limited the amount that can be spent nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09020937000481">Both the candidate and the national campaign spending limits must operate in recognition of the fact that we do not have fixed-term Parliaments. I do not wish to enter into that debate today&#151;indeed, Mr. Deputy Speaker probably would not let me do so. I mention it merely because a consequence of that is the uncertainty over whether and when an election will be held. That is a difficulty when we try to specify the length of any regulated period for election expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09020937000482">In the case of the national spending limit, the starting point for the regulated period is counted back 365 days from the date of the election. This means that parties can face some uncertainty in accurately planning their campaigning expenditure. In practice, however, most parties will closely monitor their campaigning expenditure at all times, and employ staff to ensure compliance with legislative requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09020937000483">The same cannot be said of campaigning expenditure that specifically seeks to advance the electoral prospects of a candidate. Campaigning at the local level is often sustained by volunteers. We can all agree that those dedicated people are the lifeblood of our political system, and whatever we do to make sure the system is open and transparent and commands the trust of the electorate, we must also take great care to ensure that legislation does not impose undue burdens on those volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09020937000484">For many years, the law on candidate spending deliberately did not impose a fixed point from which the limit on election expenditure would apply. Rather, the limit applied from the point when an individual began behaving and campaigning as a candidate&#151;a system that is often referred to as &#147;triggering&#148;. This led some to seek to avoid the limits by referring to themselves as only prospective candidates. The 2000 Act sought to reduce uncertainty for candidates and agents by setting a clearly defined point in legislation from when an individual could be regarded as a candidate. In the majority of cases, this is the date of the Dissolution of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09020937000485">Candidates have thus had certainty about the point from which to begin counting their election expenses. However, the wholly undesired, and to some extent unforeseen, effect of this has been the potential for significant levels of unregulated candidate expenditure to take place prior to Dissolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09020937000486">We have sought to address the issue before. The Electoral Administration Bill of 2005 contained proposals recommended by the Electoral Commission for a regulated period for candidate expenditure counted back four months from the date of the election. The measure was criticised on all sides of the House, however, in view of the uncertainty that it would create for candidates and the volunteers who work to help them. The proposal  <br>

was consequently removed from that Bill. But the potential for high levels of unregulated spending before Dissolution remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09020937000487">We said in the White Paper that we would consider a return to the principle of candidate spending regulation that existed before 2000, whereby the purpose for which expenditure is used would determine whether it is counted against the spending limit.</p>

 In general, I support the new clause. However, if a national political party were to deluge a constituency with target mail urging people to vote for that party in that constituency without mentioning the candidate, surely that should count as expenditure against the candidate of that registered party. That is surely a loophole in the clause.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="09020937000489"><a name="90209-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="09020937000966"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 I will come to that point later. This is an extremely complex area. It is highly contentious, as we discovered yet again during the passage of the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, it is important that I go through the sequence of arguments about how we ended up where we have now ended up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09020937000490">Before I go any further, I should say that no one would regard the measure as the end of the story. We always search for perfection, but sometimes we have to recognise that is somewhat further out of reach in some cases, such as this, than in others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09020937000491">As I said, we said in the White Paper that we would consider returning to the principle of candidate spending regulation that existed before 2000&#151;that is, the purpose for which expenditure is used determines whether it is counted against the spending limit. Colloquially, that is called &#147;triggering&#148;. It is worth noting that that principle was specifically and clearly endorsed by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in its far-reaching report of 1998. In this Bill we have therefore proposed a spending limit that would regulate all spending for the purposes of a candidate&#146;s election, including that used before he or she is formally defined as a candidate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09020937000492">Unfortunately, debate on that point was curtailed in Committee; however, I am clear that the measure does not enjoy the support of Opposition parties. I am disappointed that we have not been able to secure agreement to the proposal. Nevertheless, in our characteristic spirit of openness and co-operation, we have listened to the views put forward by hon. Members and tabled this group of amendments, which will retain the existing consideration of the purpose for which expenditure is used and, additionally, introduce a fixed point in time from which that expenditure is regulated for certain elections. I believe that that will achieve more effective regulation of spending and minimise uncertainty for candidates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09020937000493">Although there is usually uncertainty about whether a general election will be called at any particular point, the one point of absolute certainty is the last possible point by which a Parliament must be dissolved; when a Parliament enters its final months, we can be certain that a general election is imminent. In those circumstances, those intending to stand as candidates will have formed their intention and many prospective or already declared candidates will be likely to begin campaigning well in advance of Dissolution. We believe that in those circumstances it is possible and desirable to provide for a longer regulated period for candidate expenses.</p>

 I congratulate the parliamentary draftsmen on how they have tackled this complex area, and I am delighted that this is not necessarily the final word on the issue. The Minister will agree that elections in this country have often been held six months before the final date at which an election must be called; that is the aim of any Prime Minister and generally the sensible thing to do. Why can the restricted period not be longer than the five months? If it were a 10-month period, it would take account of the real period during which candidates would be expected to start to push, particularly in marginal seats?</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="09020937000495"><a name="90209-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="09020937000968"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman has tabled an amendment to that effect, and no doubt we will get on to it in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09020937000496">We have come to our position because we think that the current situation, in which in effect spending is regulated only for the month or so after Dissolution, is not desirable. It is an unintended consequence of previous legislation and we need to improve on it; we believe that the amendments would do that. Under current legislation, an individual generally becomes formally regarded as a candidate only on the date of the Dissolution of Parliament, the result being that campaigning expenditure is limited only from that period onwards. The amendments introduce a second regulated limit for candidate expenses. It would only regulate candidate expenditure between the point at which 55 months of a Parliament had elapsed and the date at which an individual formally became a candidate. As that is generally the date of Dissolution, in most cases we refer to it as the &#147;pre-Dissolution limit&#148;. At that point, the existing candidate spending limit will come into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09020937000497">The new proposal contains a key aspect of the previous triggering proposal, in that it is capable of applying to what people do before they are formally regarded as candidates. The proposed new limit would apply only if a Parliament ran for more than 55 months. When that happens, there is no doubt that an election will take place shortly, so any uncertainty about whether an expense is really an election expense is greatly reduced. The proposed new limit would not apply for shorter Parliaments. In those cases, the uncertainty about when an election will take place makes specifying a longer regulated period more difficult. In those circumstances, only the current post-Dissolution limit would apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09020937000498">It is our intention that the new limit will regulate the same types of expenditure as the current limit. As with the current limit, it will regulate all spending on specified matters which are used</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90209-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09020937000499">As with the current limit, the new limit will regulate all expenditure that is used during the regulated period, even where that expenditure is incurred beforehand. That means that it will not be possible for an individual to seek to avoid the limit by stockpiling campaign material shortly before the regulated period begins for use afterwards. However, the new limit will not have retrospective effect; that is to say, it will not apply to any expenses that are incurred before commencement of the clause and then used at a time when the new limit applies. As with the current limit, the level of the spending limit will vary from constituency to constituency according to the number of electors and the nature of the constituency.</p>

 I am truly trying to follow this, but I am a little bewildered. In a situation such as that in 1964 or February 1974, what is the regime as regards expenses in the period where it is unlikely that a Parliament is going to run for the duration? If there were a hung Parliament, surely all the big battalions would have been trying to pour money into what was an uncertain period of a few months.</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s concern, and as a matter of common sense I can see the force of what he says. However, this measure is predicated on the one thing that we can be absolutely certain about. Of course he is right that as in 1964, with a very small majority, or 1974, with, essentially, a hung Parliament, the likelihood is that there would be an imminent general election. However, we do not know&#151;that is the difference. We know, because of statute, when a Parliament must end, but in those circumstances, although it is likely that there would be an imminent general election, we do not know that. We do not know what deals will be cobbled together; ingenuity and hunger for power are extraordinary things. The whole basis of this proposal is that it is predicated on what we know for a fact, taking into account all the concerns that people have raised about uncertainty.

The specified sum may in future be increased by order because of inflation or following a recommendation from the Electoral Commission. It may be that a Parliament runs for over 55 months but does not run to its full term. In that event, the amendments provide for a pro-rating of the limit. We are open to views on the appropriate fraction of the limit that should apply in those circumstances. We have made our best guess of what would be a sensible and reasonable approach, and we are open to representations on that.

 Will the Minister be a little more specific about the proposal that the Government plan to bring before the House on the use of Members&#146; allowances during this equivalent period? He will know from previous discussions that we are concerned about symmetry in this case. Members of Parliament have large allowances available that can be used for pro-active communication with their electors. When candidates are affected by this measure, which we support, to control spending during the last few months of the Parliament, the House must put in place rock-solid arrangements regarding the use of allowances, whether for communications or for incidental expenses, to do stuff that promotes Members of Parliament in a way that is equivalent to a candidate&#146;s campaigning.

 In view of the complete absence of Conservative Back Benchers during this debate&#151;I cannot think why&#151;would my right hon.

It would be more valuable to have these commendable controls in place, not from the 55th month, but from the 50th, in order to give a good six-month run, thus preventing the distortion to the result of the election that could be caused by the fact that very rich candidates are able to put huge amounts of their own money into their election campaigns.</p>

 That is the bit that I did not hear clearly.

It is crucial&#151;the Minister must understand that. I believe that he does understand it, and I know that the Justice Secretary understands how unfettered&#151;or any&#151;use of taxpayers&#146; money to promote a Member of Parliament&#146;s activities when statutory constraints, with criminal penalties, were placed on candidates&#146; ability to promote themselves would be unfair, and would be seen to be unfair.

That is even more than the $2 billion spent by all the candidates in the recent US election, which was the most expensive election in recent history. Britain was even worse than that before we had controls on candidates&#146; spending. If we want to return to having candidates being able to buy their way into Parliament, all we have to do is to have no laws on candidates&#146; spending at all.

Interestingly, the Electoral Commission has clearly stated its support for a start point of 55 months. It does not support amendments proposing a start point of 50 months because it, too, believes that that would increase uncertainty to an intolerably high level.</p>

 I am delighted to have secured this debate on neighbourhood renewal funding in the Millfield and New England areas of Peterborough. These older city residential areas existed before Peterborough was designated as a new town and before the Peterborough development corporation was established in 1968, and they have a proud working class heritage, having been home to many families working on the railways or at Perkins Engines&#151;skilled craftsmen, artisans, practical people and their kith and kin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09020939000070">It was the 1850 opening of the Great Northern railway&#146;s main line from London to York that transformed Peterborough from a market town to an industrial centre. Relatively little urban development took place to the west of the railway, but the marshalling yards and other installations were labour-intensive and housing for railway workers and their families spread from the vicinity of the North station almost to Walton. The Great Northern built an entire community here, which provided much of the labour for the enormous marshalling yard and associated engine sheds close by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09020939000071">For almost 55 years the North ward on Peterborough city council has been represented by the indefatigable Charles Swift, OBE, who lives in Scotney street in New England and was once the Labour leader of the city council, but is now robustly independent, and his colleague, Councillor Keith Sharp. Only two weeks ago, Charles featured in the Peterborough <i> Evening Telegraph</i> bemoaning the state of his home area, under the headline &#147;Peterborough is decaying in front of our eyes.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09020939000072">My constituents living in the Millfield and New England areas of Peterborough have been witness to the steady decline of their neighbourhood for a number of years, but the increased pressures of the current economic climate&#151;in particular, the recent spate of job losses in the city, business closures, crime and, among other things, the increased pressures of immigration&#151;have highlighted the very real difficulties these communities are facing. In particular, the huge and unprecedented influx of EU migrants into the city since May 2004, estimated by the East of England regional assembly two years ago at more than 16,000 individuals, most of whom have congregated in this area, has put significant strain on the delivery of public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09020939000073">The situation has been exacerbated by heavy job losses across Peterborough over the last 12 months in good-quality, blue-chip companies&#151;400 jobs at Hotpoint, 450 jobs at Perkins Engines and 500 at Freemans Catalogues. In particular, in the area east of the north-south Lincoln road&#151;from the junction with Dogsthorpe road up to the A47 Soke parkway, and including the northern third of the Central ward&#151;the environmental deterioration of what were once pleasant streets of owner-occupied properties, well tended and demonstrating an obvious element of neighbourhood pride, has unfortunately given rise to an increasing number of often scruffy, unkempt properties in multiple occupation with neglected gardens at front and back, physical deterioration and environmental  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09020939000074">I understand that last Thursday the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for community cohesion, was due to visit the New Link centre in Lincoln road, at the heart of the area. Had it not been for the inclement weather, he would have seen at first hand what I have described. When Charles Swift and I undertook a comprehensive walkabout across the North ward before Christmas, he showed me what he has labelled &#147;grot spots&#148;. He has described the area and its ambience as &#147;bedraggled and worn&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09020939000076">It is appropriate to set these two specific localities within a wider economic and social context in the Peterborough sub-region. The Peterborough city council area has the highest unemployment among the nine sub-regions in the eastern region. The unemployment rates are, respectively, 7.3 per cent., with 1,847 male claimants, and 3 per cent., with 588 female claimants. The overall rate in the Peterborough constituency was 5.4 per cent. in December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09020939000077">A lower proportion of people than across the other sub-regions have five GCSE passes at grades A to C, 11 per cent. lack basic literacy skills, 56 per cent. lack basic numeracy skills and 57 per cent. lack basic information and communications technology skills. The sub-region contains 10 &#147;super output areas&#148; that are among the most deprived in the region, suffering from education deprivation and low adult skills. We have the third highest proportion in the region of adults with no qualifications, and the third lowest proportion with degree-level qualifications. Our NEETs count&#151;the number of young people not in work, education or training&#151;is above the county and regional average. Our sub-region contains the greatest number of individuals receiving incapacity benefit, and half of them have been claimants for more than five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09020939000078">The city ranks high when it comes to health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and asthma, and has the highest incidence in East Anglia of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Life expectancy in Peterborough is four years less than in Cambridge, just 31 miles away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09020939000080">Before I deal with the specific issues in the wards that make up Millfield and New England, it would be wise for me to record the efforts made by community-minded people locally to improve their own community.

Greater Dogsthorpe Partnership has done excellent work under the leadership of Adrian Chapman and, subsequently, Graeme Clark to empower local residents to improve the quality of their lives through active participation and engagement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09020939000081">Last year the city council established the Millfield and New England task force. It is now developing an action plan geared towards housing and environmental issues, involving the use of legislation to improve problematic properties, issuing penalty notices for littering, investigation of fly-tipping, and proactive work regarding houses in multiple occupation. The urban regeneration company Opportunity Peterborough is taking the lead in trying to ensure the viability and long-term future of the Millfield local district shopping centre.</p>

I pay tribute to Carol Bailey and Des Davis and all the staff, helpers and volunteers at the Salvation Army citadel at Bourges boulevard for their hard work and dedication in helping vulnerable people, particularly the large number of elderly people in New England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para19"><a name="09020939000083">The Millfield and New England economic regeneration partnership&#151;MANERP&#151;under the chairmanship of Hema Patel is a grassroots organisation that fights hard to ensure that the area is not overlooked, by campaigning for city council days of action and appointing street leaders, and by monitoring houses in multiple occupation, the problems of unscrupulous landlords exploiting newcomers to the area and the challenges of living in a diverse population, as well as serious crime-related issues such as the growth of brothels and cannabis factories in the locality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para20"><a name="09020939000084">Why is this area so deserving of attention? Not only does the area&#151;the North ward west of Fulbridge road and the west of Park ward&#151;suffer from endemic social problems as a result of the decline in manufacturing and manual trades and the growing culture of benefit dependency, but it has the feel of a community expiring on its feet. In the last year, HSBC has announced the closure of its branch in Millfield, the New England post office has been earmarked for closure and even St. Paul&#146;s church at the junction with St. Paul&#146;s road has been downgraded and will soon be forced to share a minister with St. Mark&#146;s church, which is much nearer the city centre, despite the sterling work of its stand-in priest in charge, Rev. Ron Watkinson, who provides both spiritual leadership and pastoral care to the parish.</p>

residents, and has, regrettably, caused welfare dependency to become even further entrenched. The number of working-age claimants on benefit across the city council area remained static at 15 per cent. between 2002 and 2007, and in the same period&#151;a period of economic growth&#151;the proportion of those in employment has declined from 77 per cent. to 74 per cent. For those in work, median gross weekly wages are falling, and they fell between 2006 and 2008. One in four of those living in the North ward suffers from a long-term illness, almost a quarter of residents are pensioners and one in 10 residents are unpaid carers for others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para23"><a name="09020939000087">Let me now turn to the issue of crime, which is often linked to economic downturns and recessions. The most recent figures provided on a ward-by-ward basis by the northern division of Cambridgeshire constabulary&#151;those for January 2009&#151;show that in the North ward serious acquisitive crime is up 23 per cent. compared with the same period last year, and is up 10 per cent. in Park ward; violent crime is up 12 per cent. and 16 per cent. respectively and antisocial behaviour is up 11 per cent. and 6 per cent. respectively, while alcohol-related incidences are up by a staggering 156 per cent. in North ward and 159 per cent. in Park ward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para24"><a name="09020939000088">I hope that the Minister understands the picture I reluctantly paint of a part&#151;not, I hasten to add, a majority&#151;of my constituency. I believe that owing to its unique set of circumstances&#151;low skills, low educational attainment, worklessness, unprecedented mass immigration, struggling public services, declining housing stock and deprivation, poor health outcomes and welfare dependency&#151;local agencies such as the East of England Development Agency, the primary care trust, the urban regeneration company and the local authority are, through lack of capacity, simply not able to deploy the financial and other resources they would like in order to tackle the intractable problems to which I have alluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para25"><a name="09020939000089">For that reason, New England and Millfield merit the Minister&#146;s serious consideration for funding under the auspices of the working neighbourhoods fund. In their November 2007 report, which was unimaginatively entitled &#147;The Working Neighbourhoods Fund&#148;, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Work and Pensions made the point that the fund</p>
<a name="90209-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="09020939000125"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is not just about money. It is about new ways of working...targeting areas of high worklessness by devolving and empowering communities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para26"><a name="09020939000090">Peterborough&#146;s new and developing neighbourhood management model would complement that approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para27"><a name="09020939000091">I contend that Peterborough will now meet the WNF funding criteria&#151;particularly those relating to the benefit claim rate and employment rate&#151;in a way that it may not have done under the previous criteria attached to neighbourhood renewal funding prior to April 2008, which focused on district-wide measures of deprivation indices. It was never equitable or sensible to exclude many authorities, such as Peterborough&#146;s, that have pockets of very severe deprivation at super output area level but fell short of the criteria. Peterborough&#146;s eligibility will be enhanced by the decision to include both jobseeker&#146;s allowance and incapacity benefit in the funding criteria. I think those on both sides of the House welcome the greater devolution of this funding programme to local councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para29"><a name="09020939000093">The Minister has had to take in an awful lot of information. Clearly, he would have had the opportunity to make a visit last week to see things for himself&#151;that might have assisted my case. The situation has become ever more pressing recently as a result of the redundancies that I mentioned. They have certainly had a considerable impact on the already difficult circumstances facing many of my constituents in these difficult economic times.</p>

Such a situation is both unfair and economically wasteful. It is socially destructive but it is not inevitable. I concede that this Government have done the right thing in refocusing regeneration moneys at the most local level, and I ask the Minister to do all he can to make sure that in my constituency the funds are directed where they are so desperately needed.</p>

 I thank the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) for raising this important issue. The debate provides an opportunity to discuss not only the issues and the real challenges facing his constituents in the Millfield and New England areas of Peterborough, but the work under way to address those as part of a more coherent approach by local partners in the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90209-0022.htm_para32"><a name="09020939000097">The hon. Gentleman talked about the working neighbourhoods fund and made a plea for its money to be provided to those two areas. The WNF is targeted at 65 local authorities, all of which score more highly than Peterborough on the indices of multiple deprivation. The Government decided to focus these funds more tightly in light of the recommendations of the sub-national review of economic development and regeneration. There are no plans to revise the eligibility criteria or to increase the number of eligible authorities.</p>

funding in 2008-09 and will receive more than generous inflation increases in 2009-10 and 2010-11. If one examines all the grants that Peterborough will receive in 2009-10, one will discover that an additional &#163;11.5 million is being provided. The point is that, as important as the working neighbourhoods fund is to those deprived parts of the country&#151;the 65 authorities that receive it&#151;it is a fraction of the funding that Peterborough receives in the generous payments from the Government to the council and other key agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09020939000099">Peterborough is benefiting from a range of other Government policies, related interventions and funding to support the delivery of local ambitions. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for having the generosity to mention some of the work going on locally as a consequence of the Government providing local authorities with the tools and funding, all of which play a significant part in supporting the regeneration of neighbourhoods, through greater collaboration between local partners. Some important examples include &#163;21.5 million growth area funding over the three years to 2010-11. There is &#163;1.6million funding as part of the neighbourhood element of the safer and stronger communities fund. In Peterborough this will help Welland, Old Dogsthorpe, Bluebell, and part of the New England areas&#151;about which the hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned. An additional &#163;21 million from the East of England Development Agency for regeneration projects in Peterborough will contribute to projects worth &#163;100 million in total since 1999.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09020939000100">The sum of &#163;16.6 million from the region&#146;s Urban II programme is focused on nine wards in Peterborough city centre with high levels of unemployment linked to a lack of skills. On the Labour Benches, we appreciate the contributions made by Europe, and the European regional development fund finance has provided just over &#163;7.8 million to help the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents. In addition, there have been funds for cohesion and preventing violent extremism for the period 2008-10, the latter totalling almost &#163;765,000.</p>

<p><a name="st_o365"><a name="09020939000101"><a name="90209-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="09020939000156"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson:</b>
 The Minister will concede that there are difficulties in measuring the robustness and veracity of population statistics. He will also know that the transitional arrangements between neighbourhood renewal funding and working neighbourhood funding have thrown up some difficulties. Unless we get the population data right and make them topical, deserving authorities will lose out, even under the new programme.</p>

<p><a name="st_o366"><a name="09020939000102"><a name="90209-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="09020939000157"><b>Mr. Khan:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise the issue of the robustness of the statistics. A combination of migration and growth has affected Peterborough recently, and we simply cannot wait for a census every 10 years. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the excellent work that is being done to improve the robustness of the figures and ensure that they reflect the real situation, rather than lagging behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09020939000103">The issue is not only money, as important as that is. The new local area agreement has already benefited Peterborough by bringing about a more co-ordinated and collaborative approach to tackling the challenges facing the city, from delivering growth to reducing inequalities&#151;and a wider ambition to be the UK&#146;s environment capital. Tools provided by a Labour Government are being used by a Conservative local authority to benefit the residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09020939000104">The planned growth of the city will bring significant opportunities for Peterborough to help bring about transformation, including within neighbourhoods. The city is blossoming, despite the tough economic climate. Considering the circumstances&#151;including the recession&#151;things are going well. The leader of Peterborough city council since 2003, John Peach, says that there is more going on now than ever. He should know as he has been on the council ever since the unitary council came under Conservative control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09020939000105">It was not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention&#151;and he was careful to emphasise that he was talking about part of Peterborough, not the whole city&#151;to talk down Peterborough. The regional spatial strategy for the east of England identifies Peterborough as a key centre for development and change. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the successful growth of the city is an important factor in tackling deprivation and regenerating areas like Millfield and New England. Knitting together those two important agendas requires a strong partnership between all sectors and we believe that that can happen in Peterborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09020939000106">I do not want to pretend that there are no challenges, and the hon. Gentleman was right to stress some that face Peterborough, which is growing faster now than at any time in the past 50 years. It faces two significant challenges: first, to close the gaps between the worst and best neighbourhoods; and, secondly, to deliver its ambitious plans for growth. The debate today, in my opinion, should be about how we collectively maximise the resources already available in the city to deliver an ambitious agenda for the future. By pooling intelligence and capacity between partners, engaging and empowering local communities and providing real opportunities for them to be a part of the future plans for transforming the city, we can make a difference. It is happening on the ground. Peterborough city council and its partners, including the business community and the public, through the Greater Peterborough partnership, drew up the sustainable community strategy with the vision of</p>
<a name="90209-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="09020939000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A bigger and better Peterborough that grows the right way&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para7"><a name="09020939000107">through substantial and &#147;truly sustainable&#148; growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para8"><a name="09020939000108">We need to strengthen the capability within Peterborough to secure additional funding, whether by attracting private sector investments through growth or improving its potential bidding credentials for competitive funding. It is right to focus on Millfield and New England. Many Labour Members entered politics to help those who were the most deprived in communities, and that is what social justice is about. The hon. Gentleman was right to draw attention to the ongoing challenges in Millfield and New England. I firmly believe that greater collaboration between service providers to tackle the underlying social and economic issues, continued education and awareness raising, ongoing enforcement and investigation work to deal with unscrupulous landlords and linking the growth plans with those for regeneration are more likely to secure a sustainable solution for the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para9"><a name="09020939000109">I am pleased to say that such an approach is already being used in Millfield and New England by Conservative Peterborough city council, through its neighbourhood approach across the city. I understand that that city council has led with a restructure of its services and that the new neighbourhood management model that is being implemented includes multi-agency delivery teams, which will be tasked with responding to local priorities identified by neighbourhood partnerships. That is an example of Government devolving power with additional funding devolved to communities, turning subjects into citizens and citizens into active citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para10"><a name="09020939000110">Millfield and New England will form part of the central and east neighbourhood management area of Peterborough, which I think is a good thing. I would not want you to think, Mr. Speaker, that it has become a habit of mine to defend Conservative councils, but Peterborough city council is using the tools that we have given it and is working with appropriate partners to try to help neighbourhoods such as those identified by the hon. Gentleman, including Millfield. The scope of the work is also being expanded to cover New England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para11"><a name="09020939000111">I am afraid that there is no time left for me to deal with all the housing issues referred to by the hon. Gentleman, but there are now city-wide grants available for assistance with repairs and to disabled residents. We are working to address the issues about houses in multiple occupation. The council has a city-wide tenancy relations officer and a private landlord accreditation scheme. The city council has submitted an application for additional licensing for houses in multiple occupation, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para12"><a name="09020939000112">The council is using the tools provided by the Government, and it is using the extremely generous record levels of investment that the Government have given it. I look forward to a bright future for Peterborough. Legislation based on the community empowerment White Paper will soon be considered in this House, after leaving the other place. There will soon be a joint inspectorate comprehensive area assessment, which will hold local authorities and, more widely, public sector partners to account on the delivery of local priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90209-0023.htm_para13"><a name="09020939000113">To summarise, let me reiterate the benefits of collaboration, alignment, and the targeting of resources by key partners in a way that engages local residents in making a difference to their areas. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to join me in congratulating the local authority and the many other partners and people who are working hard to improve the quality of life for those who live in Peterborough. I am sure that you, Mr. Speaker, will agree that the Government are supporting partners with a range of policies and initiatives geared towards greater flexibility, which will enhance delivery and enable Peterborough to realise its ambitions. Never in the history of this country have a Government done more during a recession or economic downturn than this Government. I hope that the people of Millfield and New England will see the fruit of that soon.</p>
