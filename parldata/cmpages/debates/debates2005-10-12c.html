 (LD): If he will make a statement on the humanitarian situation in Darfur, Sudan. [16762]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51012-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 Some 1.8&nbsp;million people have been forced to flee their homes in Darfur and just under 3.5&nbsp;million are now dependent on humanitarian assistance. Although the latest United Nations mortality survey shows that the number of deaths has decreased significantly since last year, banditry and the recent increase in violence are a cause of considerable concern. In southern Sudan, malnutrition levels are, in places, as bad as in Darfur. The situation should improve after the anticipated good harvest, but there will still be areas where food is insufficient. People are now returning home to the south, but the humanitarian and development needs there are enormous.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51012-01_spnew0"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for his response. He will be aware that African Union troops will be key to ensuring that humanitarian aid arrives. He will also know that two soldiers were recently killed and 36&nbsp;were kidnapped, most of whom have recently been released. On 22&nbsp;October, 7,700&nbsp;AU troops should be there on the ground. Does the Secretary of State believe that they will be, does he consider that a sufficient number, and what does he think the UK can do to help?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51012-01_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the incidents that occurred over the weekend. There are currently 6,300&nbsp;AU troops in the region, and the AU is still working to get 7,700&nbsp;there by the end-of-October deadline. What happens depends very much on whether the recent upsurge in violence continues. We have to be very clear in identifying the perpetrators, and then passing their names to the sanctions committee and the International Criminal Court. We are pressing for the arms embargo to be extended to the whole of Sudan, and there is also the very practical issue of armoured personnel carriers. When I visited Sudan in June, the AU said that it wanted APCs to enable it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 276</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to protect its troops. The Government of Sudan are currently putting obstacles in the way of those APCs getting in&#151;an issue that my noble Friend Lord Triesman raised when he was there last week. They must now remove those obstacles, so that the AU troops have the equipment and the support that they need to carry on the good job that they have been doing in protecting people in Darfur since they arrived about a year ago.

<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51012-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bill Olner  (Nuneaton)</b> 
 (Lab): Food is being used as a weapon against ordinary people in Darfur. Are we going to be a little more robust in ensuring that it gets to the people who really need it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51012-01_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 There is indeed a huge humanitarian challenge. The humanitarian situation has improved for those in the camps, and my principal concern is the situation in southern Sudan. Between 250,000&nbsp;and 500,000&nbsp;people have already come home, and now that the dry season is arriving we expect a further 500,000&nbsp;to move south. My visit to Rumbek in June made it clear that there is very little there to receive them. That is why we have given funding to the UN specifically for the south, and we are also running water, health and nutrition projects through non-governmental organisations. Moreover, we have put &#163;10&nbsp;million into a fund to enable the new Government of southern Sudan to start providing for the people, who are going home now that there is peace between the north and the south.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51012-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Tobias Ellwood  (Bournemouth, East)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State has spoken about the military commitment in Darfur, and in discussing Africa after the G8&nbsp;summit, Sudan clearly comes very high on the list of priorities. Our current military commitment consists of only 17&nbsp;personnel, 15&nbsp;of whom are in a NATO camp helping the NGOs, and two of whom are in a rival European Union camp. Will the Secretary of State work more closely with the Defence Secretary to co-ordinate our efforts? There is no point in the NGOs and our relief workers going out there if they do not have protection, or&#151;worse still&#151;if our military operations are actually working against each other.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51012-01_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 While the hon. Gentleman is right about the number of personnel in the region, the UK has so far committed, as he will doubtless be the first to recognise, &#163;32&nbsp;million in support of the AU operation. That shows just how serious we are about ensuring that it has the resources and technical assistance that it needs, and I pay tribute to the British service personnel there. The practical concerns that the AU faces are ensuring that it has the right equipment, the right number of troops and the means to protect them. I will of course continue to talk to my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary about this issue, but the AU troops have undoubtedly been making a real difference on the ground, as was pointed out to me when I was in the region in June. However, we are very worried about what has happened in the past month.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51012-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Chris Mullin  (Sunderland, South)</b> 
 (Lab): Is it my right hon. Friend&#039;s impression that the situation in Darfur is getting better, or deteriorating? Does he believe that the AU force is as effective as it should be, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 277</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should we be thinking of making the mandate tougher, and is he satisfied that the Sudanese Liberation Army and the other groups in rebellion against the Khartoum regime are pulling their weight in trying to achieve peace in Darfur?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51012-01_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 On my hon. Friend&#039;s last point, no, I do not think that they are pulling their weight. Indeed, until relatively recently, those principally responsible for the deterioration in the security situation have been the SLA and JEM&#151;the Sudanese Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement&#151;which, it is thought, were behind the kidnap of the African Union troops that have now been released. I think that there is a certain amount of jockeying for position going on while the Abuja peace talks are restarting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">As far as the mandate is concerned, it is currently somewhere between a chapter 6&nbsp;and a chapter 7 mandate, and it is for the AU itself to determine what the mandate will be. When I spoke to the AU commanders there in June, it was clear that they were prepared to be flexible about how they worked, but they wanted to ensure that they had adequate protection.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51012-01_spnew8"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b> 
 (LD): The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s Department is contributing &#163;100&nbsp;million to the Darfur region, but when he compares that with the &#163;5&nbsp;billion&#151;&#163;1.5&nbsp;billion a year&#151;that the Government are committing to the military operation in Iraq, and the $10.5&nbsp;billion spent on reconstruction there, does he believe that sufficient priority is being given to the needs of the displaced, murdered people of Darfur?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51012-01_spnew9"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK has been the second largest contributor, after the United States of America, to humanitarian assistance in Darfur, so the US and the UK are leading the rest of the world in that respect. Secondly, one also has to recognise the political effort that has been made. As the House knows, the truth is that the crisis in Darfur will be brought to an end only when the people who are currently fighting each other are prepared to use the Abuja peace talks to reach a peace agreement. If they can do that, peace can be brought to Darfur in the same way as the comprehensive peace agreement brought peace to the north and south of Sudan, where more than 2&nbsp;million people were killed in a civil war that lasted a generation.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51012-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 DFID is supporting the overall UK effort to combat poppy cultivation through providing alternative livelihoods. Working with others, we are putting in &#163;50&nbsp;million this year to support agriculture. Recent provisional UN figures suggest that there has been a 21&nbsp;per cent. decline in poppy cultivation acreage 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 278</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in 2005. The challenge will be to sustain that reduction next year. Long-term development and the creation of a stable and secure state governed by the rule of law will be the key factors in achieving that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51012-01_spnew10"><b> Tony Baldry: </b> 
 I am grateful for that answer, but fatwas against farmers in Afghanistan do not seem to be making much progress, largely because of the lack of alternative livelihoods. Is it not time to consider the possibility of licensing some opium production in Afghanistan? There is a shortage of morphine and codeine, particularly in the developing world, and the benefits to Afghan farmers and the Afghan treasury of some licensed, tightly regulated opium production could be considerable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51012-01_spnew11"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I have seen the recently published report, which made precisely that suggestion. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Ministry of Counter Narcotics&#151;this is the Afghan Government&#039;s response&#151;said that while it welcomed the study, because of poor security and the risk of diversion, now is not the right time for licit poppy cultivation. I have to say that I share that view, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we are funding an applied research programme to look at ways of earning an alternative living, which is what farmers require if they are not to plant poppy any more.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51012-01_spnew12"><b> Linda Gilroy: </b> 
 I welcome the fall in opium production to which my right hon. Friend referred, but in order to sustain it, has he looked at the potential role that higher-added-value crops might play, particularly crops that might have a role in reducing environmental emissions or result in the production of ethanol?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51012-01_spnew13"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 We have not looked specifically at ethanol, but the research programme to which I referred in answering the previous question will examine all the available options. So far, we have provided 30,000&nbsp;farmers with seeds, fertilisers and samplings and there are alternatives such as apricot drying, keeping poultry, fruit trees and vegetable production, which farmers could enter into. The House needs to recognise that the opium economy in Afghanistan is estimated to be worth $2.8&nbsp;billion a year&#151;60&nbsp;per cent. of the legal gross domestic product.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">Experience from elsewhere tells us that it will take time, effective interdiction, enforcement of the law, the establishment of economic development and success in giving people alternative ways of earning a living to really crack this problem. That is a long-term challenge.

<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51012-01_spnew14"><b> Robert Key  (Salisbury)</b> 
 (Con): When the Secretary of State and his colleagues are faced with long-term humanitarian crises such as have arisen in Afghanistan and Darfur, as well as short-term crises such as the one following the earthquake in south Asia, who in the Government co-ordinates and prioritises the efforts made by different Departments? I get the impression that the Ministry of Defence is taking on quite a lot of the work that used to be done by the Foreign Office.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 279</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51012-01_spnew15"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 There is very close co-ordination between those ministerial colleagues, especially in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my Department and the Ministry of Defence, who have responsibility for the work that we are doing in Afghanistan. We see the product of that in the effort that we are making across the piece in Afghanistan, Darfur and Pakistan. We are doing a great deal to help in Pakistan, and will do more.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51012-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend is right about the scale of the problem posed to this country by Afghanistan. What measures is he taking to bring about an enormous step change in our efforts, and is there a role for co-operatives in Afghanistan? Those organisations could bring together many farmers to work in a collective rather than an individual way to achieve diversification.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51012-01_spnew17"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion about co-operatives is extremely good. One practical example of the significant increase in the effort being made by this Government is our support for the alternative livelihoods that we have just been discussing. Two years ago, we gave &#163;6&nbsp;million a year to support that diversification, but this year we are giving &#163;50&nbsp;million. That very significant increase recognises the importance of alternative livelihoods in improving the lot of farmers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51012-01_spnew18"><b> Mark Simmonds  (Boston and Skegness)</b> 
 (Con): Since the Government became responsible for reducing opium production, the levels of cultivation in Afghanistan have escalated dramatically. Finding solutions to arrest that country&#039;s decline into a narco state is essential, as 90&nbsp;per cent. of the heroin in the UK originates there. As the Secretary of State rightly pointed out, the solution is multifaceted, but little progress has been made on the matter of informal credit. Farmers are burdened by loans with extortionate interest, and daughters are often used to pay creditors when debts become unserviceable. What strategies is the Department implementing to assist with credit repayment, debt relief and access to microfinance schemes?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51012-01_spnew19"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. So far, we have supported making microfinance available to 20,000&nbsp;clients. We have taken the lead in the establishment of a counter-narcotics trust fund, to which we are contributing &#163;20&nbsp;million. The hon. Gentleman draws attention to a very significant problem faced by farmers, which is that, when they get into debt, they are bound to the drug traders. I have given some examples of what we are doing already, but we have to find ways to ensure that they can get out of that bind and begin planting alternative crops. However, that must be combined with effective enforcement of the law, and the 21&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the acreage planted is principally the result of the efforts made by the Afghans themselves. President Karzai and the governors have told farmers that they should not plant heroin, and I hope that we can sustain that initiative.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51012-01_spnew21"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The most practical contribution is to improve security. With improved security and an increased capacity on the part of the Afghanistan Government to deliver for their poor will come a better chance to deal with the problems of what is, indeed, a narco state. Everyone recognises that. When I visited Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan earlier this year, I had the chance to see the work of the provincial teams. That work is undoubtedly making a difference, but the effort has to be a joint one. In the end, the Government of Afghanistan must lead that effort, and we will continue to help them.

 Over 10&nbsp;million people could face food shortages in the next six months in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland. The most serious problems are in Zimbabwe and Malawi. In Zimbabwe, between 3&nbsp;million and 5&nbsp;million people are affected by the food crisis as well as the forced clearance of homes by the Government. In Malawi, more than 4&nbsp;million people face food shortages as a result of a drought and poor harvest. The UK has responded quickly and already provided &#163;57&nbsp;million pounds through the UN, other agencies and some of the Governments in the region.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51012-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Crabb </b>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s words and I can assure him that we will do so. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has just returned from a visit to Malawi and Zambia to see for himself the work that we are doing. In Malawi, there has been a lot of recent attention on the emergence of the food crisis. We have been working since earlier this year and because of the strong relationship between Britain, as the leading donor in the country, and the Government of Malawi, arrangements are reasonably in hand to ensure that people do not starve. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will do more as required to save people&#039;s lives.

What is the Department doing to help meet those particular needs, especially the needs of HIV/AIDS orphans? How are we making sure that money provided to that group reaches community-based groups that provide feeding schemes for those vulnerable children?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="51012-02_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 We are currently working up a programme with UNICEF to provide support in the fight against HIV/AIDS across the region. The crisis is the consequence of climatic change&#151;we now seem to have one severe drought every 10&nbsp;years&#151;AIDS, which means that people are less able to cope, rising unemployment and population growth. My hon. Friend will be aware that we have recently doubled our contribution to the global fund and we have done a great deal of work this year to make sure that, having put the money in to fight AIDS, it actually works effectively on the ground to bring help, including treatment to those who need it. There are now a number of people in Malawi, for example, who are getting antiretrovirals, which was not the case when I last visited there four years ago.

<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="51012-02_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The governance of Robert Mugabe over the last 25&nbsp;years has turned Zimbabwe from the food basket of Africa into a country that is no longer able to feed its own population. We are providing support through the world food programme and we are running an HIV/AIDS programme in Zimbabwe to help those who are affected. That is not helped when countries send in tents to house the people who have had their homes demolished and the Government of Zimbabwe then rip down those tents and say that they will not accept any more tents for people who have nowhere to live.

 I can assure my right hon. Friend that that is what we will do. In the long term, fairer trade and opening up our markets to give African farmers the chance to earn and trade their way out of poverty is the key to their having a better life. The current world trade rules make it difficult for them to do that, but there are also other issues such as infrastructure. A number of the countries concerned are landlocked, and improving the infrastructure would bring down the costs of transport and of fertiliser for poor farmers and would help people earn a better living.

<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="51012-02_spnew9"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I do indeed agree. We need a UN system that has the capacity to respond straight away, which is why I have been a strong advocate of a humanitarian fund. We now have six countries prepared to contribute $150&nbsp;million next year to give the UN that capacity. In relation to the food crisis in southern Africa, early warning has helped us to prepare, but the other issue that we must address is dealing with the problem in the long term. Repeated food aid does not break the cycle of destitution, so we are also exploring safety net schemes. We will give people a bit of money, most of which they will spend on food, but if they can save a bit to buy assets&#151;such as the plough that they had to sell because they were so poor&#151;we may be able to help people out of the pit in which they find themselves.

 (Lab): What recent assessment his Department has made of the incidence of HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea; and if he will make a statement.[16769]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="51012-03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas): </b> 
 The UN estimates that HIV prevalence in Papua New Guinea is at 0.6&nbsp;per cent. of the population. Australia is the major supporter of Papua New Guinea&#039;s national AIDS plan. We are working with the Government of Australia to help develop their 2005&#150;10&nbsp;strategy for Papua New Guinea in this area. We have not undertaken a separate assessment ourselves.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="51012-03_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Williams: </b> 
 Given that there is no DFID programme for Papua New Guinea, and that the situation is so serious there&#151;as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association witnessed two weeks ago&#151;can my hon. Friend ensure that the global fund is able to prioritise assistance to that country, which seems to have been forgotten by the rest of the world? What can he do to ensure that the global fund has sufficient funds to meet those needs?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="51012-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 We will continue to encourage the global fund to engage with the issue of HIV/AIDS, in particular in Papua New Guinea. Currently, the fund has a $15&nbsp;million programme in the country, so it is clearly engaging already. On my hon. Friend&#039;s broader question about the replenishment needs of the global fund, we hosted the replenishment conference for the fund in September, when about 29&nbsp;donors pledged about $3.7&nbsp;billion for the global fund&#151;a substantial increase on the resources available until now. More needs to be done and there will be a follow-up conference next year to raise more funds.

 Before listing my engagements, I know that the whole House will want to join me in sending our sympathy and support to all the countries and people affected by the earthquake in south Asia. The greatest loss of life and damage appears to be in Pakistan, where tens of thousands are feared dead and millions are homeless. At the moment, we know of no British citizens among the casualties, but there will of course be many families in this country who have lost relatives or friends, and they are in our thoughts. The House will want to know that Britain is playing its full part in the international aid effort, and I am able to announce that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development will commit a further &#163;10&nbsp;million today in response to the United Nations Flash appeal and to support the wider relief effort. We will continue to respond as needs unfold.

<a name="51012-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_o2">This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others in addition to my duties in the House. I will have further such meetings later today.

<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="51012-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Baron: </b> 
 The Prime Minister will be aware that there is growing concern about the Government&#039;s proposed offence of inciting religious hatred, in that it could, and will, stifle our freedom of expression and is unnecessary. Will the Prime Minister allay those fears by doing something that his entire Front Bench has been unable to do so far&#151;define the term &quot;religion&quot; and provide just one example of an act that would be caught by that legislation that could not be caught by existing legislation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="51012-03_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Obviously, incitement to racial hatred is already a crime. The reason for this legislation is that the problem with incitement to religious hatred not being a crime is that there can be people against whom hatred is incited who may be of one religion but not of one ethnic grouping. That is the reason for it. If, for example, people incite hatred against Muslims, that may not be against an ethnic grouping but it is against a religious grouping. That is the reason for the introduction of the measure. I understand the concerns and it is important that we take account of them, but I emphasise to the hon. Gentleman that before any prosecution is launched there will have to be the consent of the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. What this is aimed at, as with incitement to racial hatred, is not people making jokes about race, religion or anything else; it is against those who are going out to stir up divisions in our community in a way that is deeply unhelpful to community relations. Just as we obviously must take careful account of the objections that have been made, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also take account of the opposing point of view.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="51012-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I think that I can give the right hon. and learned Gentleman that assurance. There is close co-operation now between the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence and, indeed, the Foreign Office. We sent a team of people to co-ordinate our effort almost immediately the earthquake happened&#151;and, by all accounts, they are doing a superb job. In addition, of course, what is important is that we give the maximum help to the UN effort. Part of our help is obviously in cash or in the provision of the tents, blankets and so on that we are sending, but part of it is also to boost their own capability on the ground. Our people have very good experience of that, and I understand, certainly from all

 As the Prime Ministers knows, we fully support the Secretary of State for International Development&#039;s proposals for an enlarged central emergency fund, but the fund already exists, although apparently it is not being used. The Secretary of State said this morning that the reason for that is that people are worried that it might not be replenished. Well, with great respect to the Secretary of State, that is not the most compelling answer. Can the Prime Minister tell us why that fund has not been used and what representations the British Government are making to ensure that it is used without delay?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="51012-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 My right hon. Friend has just said to me that the reason that the fund has not been used is that it has been too small. That is not because of a lack of British contribution or British effort, incidentally&#151;we are putting an immense amount of effort into UN relief around the world. However, this is obviously something that is being looked at by the UN and other Governments. I have to say that, in this instance, my understanding is that the UN is doing everything that it possibly can to help. When I spoke to the President of Pakistan over the weekend, I did not simply express our condolences&#151;I said that we would give any additional help that we could. I think that the Pakistani Government know that all they have to do is ask and we will deliver whatever we possibly can.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-03_para3">
<a name="stpa_o5">Returning to the Prime Minister&#039;s present legislative proposals, which involve imprisonment without charge for 90&nbsp;days, it seems to be absolutely clear that there is no consensus within the Government on this measure. What exactly is the view of the Attorney-General about it? Are the reports that we have read that he remains unpersuaded correct, or is this just going to be another occasion when the Attorney-General&#039;s internal views go unreported to the House?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="51012-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 No&#151;those views appear to have been quite extensively reported at least. There will be different views on this issue in political parties and across the House. What I have to try to do&#151;and I am going to try to do it, if I can, in a spirit of reaching consensus on the issue&#151;is to take the proposals that have been made by the police, lay them out before people and then have a debate about whether they are a sensible way to proceed. I have to say that, for the reasons that the police have given, I have found that their request for this power is absolutely compelling. I have to try to do my best to protect people in this country and to make sure that their safety and their civil liberty to life come first. That is what I am going to try to do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="51012-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Kennedy: </b> 
 If the Prime Minister is serious about looking at sensible alternatives, surely he should look at the rest of his proposed legislation. The Terrorism Bill, as published, will create serious new offences and, for example, offences that we have argued for and that the Government are now supporting, such as that on acts preparatory to terrorism. That will enable suspects to be detained for the existing 14&nbsp;days. In such circumstances, why does the Prime Minister remain so wedded to the proposal for 90&nbsp;days? Surely it is wrong; surely he is going to have to back down.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="51012-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The reason that I remain wedded to that proposal is that the people who are in charge of fighting terrorism in this country&#151;in particular, the senior police officer in charge&#151;say, for reasons that I find personally absolutely compelling, that it is necessary to have that power to protect the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_o6">It is not a matter of mystery why we are putting the proposal forward. It was originally put forward by the Association of Chief Police Officers, and it is now being backed by the chief police officer in charge of fighting terrorism in this country. He set out his views in a memorandum, with examples, last week. I have said that I found them compelling. Let us have a debate about the strength or otherwise of the proposals, but I believe that the case is convincing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_o7">The reason that the chief police officer gives is also very clear. The particular nature of this type of terrorism means that very often the police will have to arrest people relatively early in the conspiracy to cause terrorist offences. Therefore, the police will need a longer period of detention to get the evidence necessary to charge those people properly. That is the reason the police give. Rather than allegations of whether we are backing down or standing firm, we should debate the substance of the proposals, consistent, I hope, with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 288</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the understanding right across the House in the aftermath of 7&nbsp;July, when more than 50&nbsp;people lost their lives in the terrorist attacks and consistent with our obligation to do our level best to protect the citizens of this country.

(Luton, North) (Lab): Last Friday, Balfour Beatty was fined &#163;10&nbsp;million for sustained industrial negligence leading up to the Hatfield rail crash that killed four people, injured 102&nbsp;and, according to Mr. Justice Mackay, had put 750,000&nbsp;lives at risk. Afterwards, one of those who had suffered as a result of Hatfield said that the company had been driven by greed and profit margins, not by concern for people&#039;s lives. My right hon.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="51012-03_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is right that we should do everything we can to reduce waiting lists and waiting times, and we have done so with immense success. Let us remember that before the Government came to power, waiting lists rose by about 400,000; they have now fallen by more than 300,000. That is a result, in part, of the reforms and changes that we have put through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-03_para6">
<a name="stpa_o8">I also have to say to my hon. Friend that we have used the private sector for generations in the construction of hospitals. What we are trying to do is make sure that we get proper value for money, and that when we deliver new hospital projects they are on time and on budget. Actually, with the private finance initiative we have found that they have been.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="51012-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Michael Howard  (Folkestone and Hythe)</b> 
 (Con): The Prime Minister will not be surprised to hear that I agree with him about the use of the private sector in public services. He said a fortnight ago that every time that he had ever introduced a reform, he wished, in retrospect, that he had gone further. Who stopped him?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="51012-03_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is always important, with any reform, that we test it very carefully, and that is what we have been doing. As a result of the reforms, I am pleased to say that we have the best school results that we have ever had. Hospital waiting lists and hospital waiting times are falling. We are reducing crime and antisocial behaviour. All that is a result of the investment and reform that were put through by this Government and opposed by the Conservative party.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="51012-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I asked the Prime Minister a very simple question: who stopped him from going further in his reforms? I will give him a clue&#151;two words; three syllables. I will give him another clue. Who said that when it comes to the public services, the user of the service is &quot;not sovereign&quot;? So, who was it that stopped him from going further in his reforms? Why does he not come clean and tell us?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="51012-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The very reason we are going further is because the experiments that we have put through and the tests that we have implemented have shown that reform works. As a result, there is not merely extra money going in. For example, when we came to power, people used to wait two years for their cataracts 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>treatment; now, they wait three months. When we came to power, barely 50&nbsp;per cent. of children got the right test results at 11; now, the figure is 75&nbsp;per cent. We used to have a situation in which most of the stock in the national health service&#151;the actual buildings&#151;was built before the health service was started, but over the next few years, as a result of reform, the private finance initiative and also investment, we are going to renew the national health service stock. Yes, we are going to take these reforms further&#151;that is because they work. They work in good combination with the investment produced by the strongest economy that this country has seen.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="51012-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Two questions asked, none answered. Let me ask the Prime Minister about a specific example. Yesterday, he talked about extending reform in education. Will he now guarantee to offer all parents the choice and freedom that his city academies offer only a few?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="51012-03_spmin12"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We will certainly be extending choice and opportunity for parents in the education White Paper, although the right hon. and learned Gentleman will have to watch for the details when the White Paper is introduced. Let me make this point to him: there can be no choice unless we also put in the investment to create better schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-03_para7">
<a name="stpa_o9">When we came to power again&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is important because of the change that has happened in our education system. There were significant numbers of London boroughs in which, on average, fewer than 25&nbsp;per cent. of children were getting five good GCSEs. Today, no authority has a figure below 40&nbsp;per cent. We used to have a situation in which only 30&nbsp;schools in the whole of London got more than 70&nbsp;per cent. good GCSEs, but now almost 100&nbsp;schools achieve that. That is the difference that we are making. Choice cannot be introduced simply by a choice mechanism&#151;it must go alongside investment, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman opposed every penny piece of that investment. If he wants to lecture me about reform, perhaps he will come to the Dispatch Box to say that he was wrong to oppose the investment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="51012-03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Yet a third question not answered. We agree with the need for investment, but have always said that investment has to be accompanied by reform. The Prime Minister has not engaged in real reform. Is not his tragedy this: when he had the authority, he did not use it? In the past eight years he has been timid; now, he is just weak.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="51012-03_spmin13"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>

It is worth pointing out that over the past 10&nbsp;years long-term survival from breast cancer has improved dramatically in this country, which is the tremendous result both of the good work by doctors and nurses and of investment and earlier screening. My hon. Friend is right that we must consider how we can take this further. We must do so according to advice given to us about its appropriateness and how we best use resources for the health service. There is no doubt, however, that as a result of screening earlier we have saved lives. That is a testament not just to the good work of people in the national health service, but to the programme of investment and reform.

Will the Prime Minister give the Assets Recovery Agency the necessary resources to recover all the IRA&#039;s criminal assets, including the &#163;26&nbsp;million that it stole from the Northern bank, and will he ensure that every step is taken to bring an end to IRA criminal activity?

<a name="stpa_0">Those hon. Members who are currently scuttling towards the exit are, perhaps, on their way to talk to constituents, to take advice from their Whips or to listen to their secretaries. They are off to indulge in what everybody describes as &quot;consultation&quot;. I wish that they would stay, because consultation is precisely what my little Bill is all about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">To consult is a laudable democratic principle. Every weekend, I consult my constituents: I consult my office, my family, the butcher, the baker and even the candlestick-maker&#151;when he is not up to his wick in wax! I do not have to take a blind bit of notice of any of them, but we like to consult, do we not? We like to go through the motions of seeking opinion; we may not be convinced by all that we hear, but at least we have bothered to ask. As a matter of fact, I am a committed advocate of consultation, but I want it to mean something. I want the people who give us their views to know that we have taken notice and, perhaps, have even adopted some of their ideas. I want consultation that works, which is what this Bill is about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Consultation has become a ludicrous buzzword. The Government swear by it&#151;205&nbsp;different consultations on new Government plans are currently under way, to which those of us with strong opinions and ample time are free to contribute our thoughts. There is, however, one small drawback: consultation does not involve any debate at all. The public are invited to pour in their opinion, which may be plagiarised, twisted or ignored.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The scale of the consultation industry reminds me of the old maxim, &quot;divide and rule&quot;. There are now so many official consultations that it is well nigh impossible to keep abreast of them, let alone to contribute. In addition to the Government&#039;s 205&nbsp;open consultations, all of which are listed on a website that is expensively devoted to that purpose, there is an even bigger list of the Government&#039;s closed consultations. For example, the Health and Safety Executive is consulting on regulations concerning vibration at work. My office in this building is underneath Big Ben, so I consider myself an expert on vibration at work. Under the rules that govern closed consultations, however, I am not expert enough, so, although my entire body shakes uncontrollably whenever the clock strikes the hour, as far as the Health and Safety Executive is concerned, I can get knotted.

<a name="51012-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Such are the small complications of consultation, but the big complications are much more serious. Consultations are voluntary, are not binding, and sad to say, are sometimes unworthy of the very paper that they end up being printed on. Making sure that consultation takes place at all is left to a toothless instrument of political persuasion&#151;the vague, woolly and completely unenforceable code of conduct.

<a name="stpa_13">Before the general election&#151;the only bit of recent genuine national consultation in this country&#151;I argued in my constituency that we could do with some proper consultation whenever controversial schemes are proposed by local authorities.

<a name="stpa_15">I am sure that every planner and politician in the land would endorse such sentiments and vow that consultation is a splendid part of the process&#151;it is like motherhood and apple pie; one could not possibly disagree with the general idea&#151;but with such a woolly meaning, consultation can be as good or as bad as planners and politicians prefer. The trouble is that too many planners and politicians are prepared to settle for the barest minimum when it comes to standards of consulting people.

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">I am sorry to say that the blame lies here in Westminster. This House has always fought shy of spelling out what consultation should be&#151;how local people are canvassed, how local views are assessed, what account is taken of opinion, and how many meetings will be held. The remit to consult is written into all local government legislation, but the dotted i&#039;s and crossed t&#039;s have always been left to the locals and their codes of conduct. Basically, this House has copped out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">My private Member&#039;s Bill is designed effectively to put such procedures in front of Parliament. It will no longer be good enough for the transport authority to insert a tiny notice on page 103&nbsp;of the classified ads in the local paper telling everybody what road is about to be closed, widened, re-rerouted or subjected to a half-baked new traffic management scheme. Under this Bill, the nature of the proposals would have to be crystal clear and they would have to be advertised so that people can see them. Local authorities would have to go out of their way to let people know what they are doing, and the Bill would specify how far out of their way they had to go. On the coastline in my constituency is a place called Hinkley Point, which is probably more famous for its nuclear power station than its landscape. Rumours abound that there might be a new power plant there&#151;one day, perhaps soon. The need for a new and comprehensive consultation system is therefore urgent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">Critics may say that consultation costs money. In the short term, yes, there will be costs. However, paying for sensible minimum standards&#151;specified high- profile newspaper advertisements, intelligible letters to householders, public meetings and the like&#151;will surely save money in the long term. If planners and politicians listen to local opinion first and take action based on what people really want rather than on what the town hall thinks that they want, it can only lead to better decision making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">The inspiration for the idea was not merely born out of the confusion in West Somerset. I can cite hundreds of examples from up and down the country, where local authorities have paid lip service to the concept of consultation and reaped the consequences of unpopularity thereafter. Let me give one current example. Devon county council&#151;my next-door council&#151;decided, without the merest hint of asking anybody, to sell one of its most valuable assets, Exeter airport. One can picture the scene at Devon county hall: &quot;I say old fruit, wouldn&#039;t it be spiffing if we flogged off the airport?&quot; Did the council consult? No. Instead, it called in some expensive City types to offload the airport. No consultation whatever took place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-04_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">Guess what&#151;the Government have rightly called in the decision to have it reviewed by the Competition Commission. The council could have avoided that. The tragedy is that local authorities are not doing anything wrong. They are obeying the law as it stands. However, the law as it stands is legless legislation. The law leaves interpretation of the word &quot;consultation&quot; purely to the town halls.

That this House notes the overwhelming rejection of regional government in the referendum held in the North East in November 2004; regrets the ongoing transfer of powers to unelected regional quangos since the result, taking power away from democratically accountable local councils; rejects the proposals for the regionalisation of the fire service and the imposition of distant Regional Fire Control Rooms; expresses concern at the possibility of police forces being structured on a Government Office Region level, making the police less responsive to local people, and voices similar concerns over the restructuring of NHS ambulance trusts; disagrees with the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s proposals for the regionalisation of emergency services as being a desirable, legitimate or necessary tier of governance; and demands that the Government dismantles the unwanted and unaccountable regional administration of emergency services.
<br>







<p><a name="st_4">The House may recall that, almost a year ago, on 4&nbsp;November 2004, a referendum was held in the north-east on elected regional assemblies. The result was an emphatic no to regionalisation. Twelve months on, I am sure that colleagues are as surprised as me that the people of the north-east are still paying for a regional assembly, which 80&nbsp;per cent. of them said that they did not want. Then again, everybody is paying for the roll-out of the Government&#039;s regional agenda. The difference is that in other parts of the country, people were not given the opportunity to reject assembles.</p>













<p><a name="st_5">However, regional assemblies, the unelected and unaccountable quangos that have leeched power from local people, are merely the most obvious manifestation of a tide of regionalism, which is fundamentally changing the way that we are governed. The most recent and disturbing example is the regionalisation of emergency services.</p>













<p><a name="st_6">The manner in which the regionalisation of emergency services was slipped out in the press during the summer recess shows just how sheepish the Government are about the announcement. I am sure that colleagues from all parties will, like me, have received many letters from people who are rightly concerned about the implications of the latest experiment in restructuring. From the signatures to early-day motion 229, it appears that at least 219&nbsp;colleagues agree with those concerns.</p>













<p><a name="st_7">It started with the regionalisation of fire control rooms. Now ambulance trusts and police forces are to be morphed into an unwieldy regional structure. Regionalism is such an abstract concept&#151;even the word &quot;regionalisation&quot; smacks of bureaucracy and administrative jargon. The Government&#039;s concept of regions pays scant regard to the geography of our country and people&#039;s sense of identity. It fails the Simon Jenkins test&#151;the Marbella test. When we bump into someone walking along the beach in, say, Marbella, and

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51012-05_spnew2"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury) (Con):</b> 
 What people in Banbury will say is that this regionalisation has practical implications. The emergency fire control rooms have to be kept going until 2009. When I went to the control centre the other day and met the staff, they said that over the next four or five years they were going to go and find other jobs. How are these things going to work? That is what people in Banbury are concerned about, not this daft regional experiment. They want to know what is going to happen when they dial 999&nbsp;over the next few years.

In regard to emergency services, the measures will be hugely damaging. As no statement has been made to the House on these changes, I have had to rely on press reports. They seem to suggest that the number of fire control rooms is to be cut from 46&nbsp;to nine, the number of ambulance trusts from 31&nbsp;to 11, and the number of police forces from 43&nbsp;to 23. There is not even any consistency across Whitehall on how to structure the regions.

 Before my hon. Friend moves off the point about local knowledge, which my hon.

Recent surveys by Kent police have shown that the single biggest complaint of my constituents and others in Kent was that they were dialling 999&nbsp;and getting people who clearly had no knowledge of the area in which they lived. That significantly reduced confidence in the police. If we get regional call centres, in which people will not even have heard of the town in which the emergency is taking place, public confidence in our police will be reduced. Along with the many other reasons that she has advanced, that ought to give the Government pause and get them to reverse this wretched policy.

 I agree totally with my hon.

<a name="stpa_32">In my constituency, police resources have been diverted into Birmingham, which has left outlying areas very exposed. When I asked my local chief constable why response times were so long in my constituency, he replied, &quot;It&#039;s simple, Mrs. Spelman, as a police force we have 98&nbsp;hot spots to focus on and none of those is in your constituency.&quot; With people forking out for way above inflation increases in council tax, they are entitled to ask why the Government can no longer afford to maintain local services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_33">That issue of resource allocation is part and parcel of accountability. Once the regional framework for such services has been established, they will no longer be answerable to the communities that they serve. By determining targets and priorities at a regional level, accountability is being eroded, and in the long term that can only make life more difficult for front-line staff. Historically, the strength of our emergency services has been partly derived from the support of the society that they serve, but by adopting a regional structure that crucial relationship is broken. How can a single body serving a region of up to 8&nbsp;million people possibly be more responsive than a locally-based, locally-accountable service?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_34">Over and above the advantages that we know we will lose by moving to a regional structure, what about all the risks that go with such a radical upheaval? I am not a natural pessimist, but the track record of this Government on delivering grand IT projects is not great. The tax credits and the Passport Agency fiasco bear witness to how badly things can go wrong, and the consequences of such a breakdown when it comes to providing rescue services is unimaginable. Obviously, the worst case scenario is loss of life arising from an IT breakdown, but even risks such as project over-run in terms of both time and budget will end up impacting on council tax bills. Yet again people will be forced to dip into their pockets and pay for the costs of regionalisation, which they never even wanted&#151;costs that some estimate could run as high as &#163;988&nbsp;million for the restructuring of fire services alone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_35">What is the driver behind this headlong rush into regionalisation? Certainly, it is not that local people want it. As a project, it seems fraught with risks that are simply not outweighed by the benefits. I am no military tactician, but it would seem elementary that in the current climate of heightened security, consolidating multiple emergency services into just one location makes the overall structure even more vulnerable to attack. If a regional centre is knocked out, I presume that the fallback would be another regional centre even further away. That smacks of putting all our eggs in one basket.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_36">No one is going to be fooled by the packaging of these proposals. People can see that reorganisation is a cost-cutting exercise, not least because of the 1,300&nbsp;or so jobs that will be lost in local fire control rooms. Although these changes will not be complete until 2009, as the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) pointed out, the reality is that jobs will start leaching away from now, undermining the quality of the service in the interim. That will happen with all emergency services as regionalisation gathers pace. Attractive headlines such as &quot;A New Era for NHS Ambulance Services&quot;, cannot mask the inevitable decline that will follow. Certainly, that will not satisfy an efficient ambulance trust such as

Everyone knows that rural ambulances have to carry more kit because of the greater distances over which they have to travel, but will that get overlooked under regional procurement? I am not even convinced that regionalisation delivers cost benefits. It is rare for reorganisation to save money. It is not that we believe that no scope exists for amalgamating services; scope does exist, if doing so is practical and people want it. That is why we have set out an alternative &quot;clustering&quot; of local authorities, as and when they see fit. Such an arrangement will be more responsive to local demands and will better reflect considerations such as population, geography and infrastructure. It is a far more practical solution than a one-size-fits-all jacket of regionalisation. Above all, it ensures proper accountability.

No matter how hard the Government try to speak the language of localism, they still behave as if central Government know best. That is why regionalisation, in whatever form, is not a way of delivering localism; it is just a way of enforcing centralism. The evidence is there. The Government have created a plethora of unelected regional bodies in what amounts to a &quot;quangocracy&quot;.

On the back of the 2002&#150;03&nbsp;fire dispute, we had the Bain inquiry&#151;an independent review that recommended what Professor Bain called &quot;supra-brigade co-ordination&quot;. He argued that local fire services could improve their effectiveness in saving lives by working together at regional level in key areas such as command and control.

 Yes, I shall deal with the issue later in my speech, but to anticipate, nothing that we are going to deploy in the new regional control centres has to be invented.

The problem is that only a minority of fire services have and enjoy the benefits, which we are going to roll out to all 46&nbsp;English fire brigades so that the latest technology will be available to all.

To respond more fully to the hon.

The new national network will make it possible to respond effectively to all incidents, however big, whether natural disasters or terrorist attack, and allow the service to deal with surges in demand that can currently overwhelm local resources. Should one centre be out of action because of loss of power or telecommunications, it will allow immediate fallback arrangements. It will underpin dynamic mobilising of appliances to help cut incident response times, resulting in saving lives and reducing property damage, as well as allowing data transfer from control rooms to the cab or fire appliances on the way to incidents.

<a name="stpa_53">All that makes the Opposition motion particularly baffling, as we have freed the fire and rescue services from centralised state control. We have repealed section 19&nbsp;of the Fire Services Act 1947, which meant that almost any change in local operational delivery required ministerial approval, and removed the outdated national standards for fire cover that forced local professional chief fire officers into a Whitehall-imposed straitjacket. We have thus moved the emphasis of protection for the fire and rescue service from buildings to people, and put the service under local control.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which is being addressed by local fire authorities, chief fire officers and human resources managers. My Department is also looking at its ability to assist in the transfer arrangements between now and 2009. We know that the majority of posts will be maintained, and we are confident that most control room staff will want to avail themselves of the new opportunities for better career paths in the new control rooms. There will be better facilities, and greater demands will be placed on the professionalism of staff, many of whom are under-utilised at present. However, not everyone will adopt the same approach, and it is clear that management will have to deal with that.

 My question may be hypothetical, but it is all too possible. A person who reports a fire in my area might not know the locality and so may not be able to describe the address. An operator in a regional fire control centre is far less likely to be able to fill in the gaps in that report than would be the case with a local fire control operator.

<a name="stpa_55">Naturally, there is a regional dimension to this matter.

 The Government offices for the regions were set up originally to act as a one-stop-shop interface between Whitehall Departments, especially for people a long way from London. They were never conceived as an accountable body to which emergency services should be responsible. Does the Minister accept that the Government&#039;s policy of establishing elected regional assemblies has failed, and that the proposed regionalisation of the emergency services is not democratically accountable?
</p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51012-08_spnew13"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 The world has moved on, and indirectly elected regional assemblies now exist. In the fire service, for example, there are regional resilience forums, through which the fire and rescue service can co-ordinate with other organisations how best to respond to natural disasters and emergencies. The London resilience forum has been working since September 2001. I respectfully suggest to the hon. Lady that its existence was what helped London respond so effectively to the bombings in July. It served as a clearing house for all the major organisations in business, emergency services, the voluntary sector and local authorities. It allowed those bodies to plan for such an incident, and we all know how well London responded when the time came. We need to establish the same structures at regional level in all parts of England, to ensure that the country is protected. That is a question not of ideology, but of basic common sense.

<a name="stpa_56">I turn now to the restructuring of the police force. At present there are 43&nbsp;police forces in England and Wales, and for some time people have questioned whether that is the right structure.

 I will in a moment. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is confident that the proposals for strategic forces will improve our capacity to tackle the most serious crimes, and therefore strengthen local policing. The bedrock for the delivery of neighbourhood policing is the basic command unit. That will not change. Local policing will continue to be delivered from local police stations, by locally based police officers, special constables and community support responding to locally determined policies.
</p>

<a name="51012-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_58">In fact, far from putting local policing at risk, the creation of strategic forces will help safeguard neighbourhood policing. If a police force has the capacity and resilience to staff major crime teams or respond to public order incidents, it will not need to call on neighbourhood policing teams. If such capacity is not in place, local policing will suffer from abstractions to meet other demands.

 We should begin by scotching the first myth of this debate: that Labour started the process of quangocratisation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is a long word, is it not? It is a good way to start. In 1994, the Conservatives invented a system whereby the Home Office appointed independent members to police authorities, thereby separating the relationship with county councils and, in effect, quangocratising it.
</p>

<a name="stpa_65">Let us not pretend that the Conservatives oppose regional quangos. In London, they abolished elected regional government and replaced it with a host of regional quangos, such as the London planning advisory committee, the London research centre and the London ecology unit. They did not oppose that then and they do not oppose it now. They are going through a phase of claiming to champion local government&#151;probably because they have lost faith in their ability to get into government nationally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_66">In office, the Conservatives were responsible for some of the worst crimes of centralised tyranny and affronts to local democracy&#151;for example, universal and arbitrary rate capping and the nationalisation of business rates. Despite their high moral tone today&#151;it sticks in my throat even more than my October cold, which, forgive me, has made me cough throughout the debate so far&#151;there is little substantive detail in their policies on localising power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_67">The Conservatives&#039; polices to abolish quangos leave a lot to be desired. Before the election they promised to abolish 168&nbsp;quangos&#151;a swathe of quangos, particularly in the Department of Health, that the Government were already abolishing. Another group of quangos on the list had not met for 15&nbsp;or 20&nbsp;years. Of the others, the majority had been proposed for privatisation or renationalisation. I do not call that an expansion of local democracy. The only quangos whose powers would be returned to local government were regional assemblies, regional observatories and regional housing boards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_68">If the Conservatives want to defend local accountability, why on earth are they so opposed to regions? The main reasons are some kind of strange conspiracy theory about Europe, concern about the committee of regions and a perceived threat to county councils, when instead they should be making proposals to devolve power from central Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_69">Let us have a look at Labour. Regions were already a fait accompli when it came to power because the Conservatives had developed the regional offices. Labour, however, did have a good idea that we supported, although we disagreed on some of the details, which was to make regional government accountable. We supported the proposals to establish elected regional assemblies across the country because they would deal with the democratic deficit of regional government, which at present is unaccountable. We did not think that the proposed devolution went far enough and we disagreed with the compulsory link with local government reorganisation. That is history: the question now is how we move beyond the north-east referendum.

<a name="stpa_70">Perhaps Labour has achieved what it wanted all along, because the regional quangos are still in place. Unelected bodies with a membership largely appointed by ministerial fiat tend to do what they are told. If they do not, they can be overruled with impunity. However, if the Labour Government were true to the democratic traditions of this country, they would seek to reform those bodies to make them more accountable, not less accountable, and more in touch with their local communities, not less. Instead, vital services will become even more remote from the people they serve.

<a name="stpa_71">What of the pragmatic details of regionalising emergency services? Hon. Members would expect me not to subscribe to the view that big is beautiful, but the existing 43&nbsp;police authorities vary considerably in size and capacity. I accept the scope for reviewing relationships across forces, but why will the process be so top-down? The Minister suggested that it would be led by police from the bottom up, but will he give us an assurance today that if police authorities oppose the proposals to merge, they will be allowed to retain the forces that they believe to be best for local people? Perhaps that question could be answered in the wind-up. At a time when everybody says that they want more community policing, the priority should be to make the police more local, not more distant.

 My hon. Friend makes a good point, and the Minister failed to respond to hon. Members who made similar points earlier. If a police force is organised to be more efficient for a small number of rare but serious crimes, police authorities will focus on those crimes to the detriment of local community policing. I do not see how that can fit with the Department&#039;s emphasis on communities and neighbourhoods.
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51012-10_spnew4"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valuable point about the danger of skewing police operations towards rare incidents. I understand that responding to such incidents eats up the resources of small forces, but there must be other ways of addressing that problem. For example, we could have a national resources unit, with senior officers and experts who could provide back-up in complex cases. That would be better than proposing to run rural policing in Cornwall from Exeter or, even worse, Bristol, which would feel a long way from people who live in rural Cornwall.

The contract would specify the level of funding for the police authority and set out the minimum deployment of police and community support officers in each district or borough.

<a name="51012-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_74">We must also abolish the byzantine system of appointment for independent members of police authorities. We would remove the role of the Home Secretary and have a more transparent, locally controlled process that would be far more in the hands of local people. The Government are quiet on such issues, but why are they not thinking more boldly about how to make police authorities and other structures more accountable?

 I invite the hon. Lady to visit the west midlands, which has the largest police force outside London. We have neighbourhood policing, with operational command units&#151;as we call them, although other forces call them basic command units&#151;that work well and provide the local focus. She might need more information about the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, because the police are intimately involved in local area network arrangements&#151;which we have pioneered in Wolverhampton&#151;and I think that ultimately there will be more accountability in policing budgets. The devolving of power is already working well in our large police force, so amalgamations in the greater west midlands are driven by the needs of forces such as Warwickshire for the specialist services to which she refers.

<a name="stpa_76">As the Minister said, the impetus for fire service reform came from the Bain review, but it focused on the need for more fire prevention, rather than just firefighting, and that can be achieved only by a community-based force. Bain specifically advised against regional reorganisation and instead proposed regional co-operation. He suggested that co-operation could achieve all the benefits without major organisational structure change. However, the Government&#039;s response ignored Bain&#039;s advice and set out to establish regional fire authorities as part of regional assemblies. Once the wheels came off the plan for elected regional assemblies, the Government ploughed ahead regardless. Had fire services been accountable to elected regional assemblies, that would have dealt with the democratic deficit created by an unelected tax-levying body, but without the democratisation of regional government the major structural reorganisation has little genuine benefit for local people.

 I commiserate with the hon. Lady on her present ill health. I have listened carefully to her argument about the breakdown in the logic behind reorganisation.

 We are consulting on what we should do following the north-east referendum. We accept that the proposals on offer were rejected, but many other options are possible. Some form of regional government is necessary to democratise the present systems. That could be achieved in many different ways and I do not wish to prejudge our review by discussing it in detail now. I would be happy to discus the issue in detail with the hon. Lady at some other point.

<a name="51012-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_77">The Minister mentioned national resilience, but serious emergencies require serious contingency planning that would, by its very nature, require co-operation between services. Where would the process stop? Does the Minister suggest that it would be worth consolidating all functions into one giant structure, just in case it needs to be run from Downing street? That cannot be the way forward, although I recognise the Government&#039;s tendency towards it. Is it necessarily any more resilient to have nine large control centres instead of 46&nbsp;smaller ones? The impact of taking one centre off-line would be huge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_78">There is no perfect solution, but compulsory regional fire control rules out the possibility of co-operation between emergency services. The hon.

Would that have to be broken up under the current proposals? It looks as though it would.

<a name="51012-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_79">The regionalisation of fire services would break the links with local communities, and the same would be true of policing.

 Does the hon. Lady agree that the Minister&#039;s example of the way in which regional planning works was drawn from London? London is one place, unlike the south-east, as the Department of Health recognises. The Department has offered the Isle of Wight the opportunity to continue to have its own ambulance service, because it realises that the south-east is not simply one place.
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51012-11_spnew5"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. There is a tendency to view structures that work in one area as easily transplantable elsewhere. We see that with many of the Government&#039;s ideas about city regions in the north. Their ideas might work perfectly well in some areas of the north of England, but they will not transfer well to the south-east or east of the country where the relationship between cities and rural areas is not the same. We have to accept that the one-size-fits-all approach will not deliver the improvements in service delivery that we want. It will certainly not improve democratic accountability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_80">There seems to be no obvious logic to the structural reorganisation proposed for ambulance services. The Government seem to have picked a random size for new ambulance trusts that ties in with none of the other tiers of administration in the national health service. Instead of reforming ambulance services into arbitrarily sized organisations, the Government should consider integrating services with hospitals and emergency care. How will it be possible to do anything sensible if trusts are not coterminous with anything already in the system? A modern ambulance service is not just about driving injured people to hospital; it is staffed by highly trained paramedics who increasingly treat casualties at the scene.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_81">The proposed move will tear a hole in any attempt to connect the ambulance service to the rest of the NHS. Why move to larger authorities? There is no evidence to suggest that it would be more efficient or would save more lives. We have already heard quotes from the chief executive of the Staffordshire ambulance trust, who is extremely concerned. We should listen carefully to people on the ground with experience of running such services who say that a move to larger structures will not help to improve the service to patients.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51012-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 I can give the hon. Lady an excellent example from the north-east, where the North East ambulance service has been in existence for nearly 10&nbsp;years. It cuts across two strategic health authorities and numerous trusts. In the summer, I had the honour of spending a night shift with the paramedics, who found none of the problems that the hon. Lady is outlining. Furthermore, more money was coming in for new technology, which helped them to do their job.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51012-11_spnew7"><b> Sarah Teather: </b>

<a name="stpa_87">I want to say a little about the fire service. As the Government amendment rightly highlights, the fire service has been making important progress in achieving reductions in fire deaths and improving safety. That is the overriding objective. The new legislation, which I had the privilege of taking through the House during my time as a Minister, established a new priority of saving lives, as one of the service&#039;s key objectives, as my hon. Friend the Minister rightly said. Fire prevention is now absolutely on the agenda as a prime responsibility, something that had not been conceived of when the 1947&nbsp;legislation was introduced.

 Is my right hon.

 I wholeheartedly concur with my hon. Friend, who rightly highlights the good work that is being done in a number of fire authorities. Such work is being accelerated as a result of the White Paper, the legislation and the additional funds, to which my hon.

I have accepted the removal of one appliance from a station in my constituency, having looked carefully at the figures, which show, as the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority demonstrated, that there would be a better prospect of saving lives by moving an appliance from one of the Greenwich stations to Sidcup because today&#039;s threats are different from those that existed in the 1940s, when a lot of the provisions were initially put in place. Any good service must seriously consider the need for change to take account of today&#039;s pressures and threats. We cannot ossify arrangements based on past patterns.

<a name="stpa_91">Those who have any doubt about the technology should visit fire brigades such as Norfolk or Merseyside, where it is already used successfully.

It also allows the automatic mobilisation of the appliances that are closest placed to

<a name="51012-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_92">It has been suggested that local knowledge will be lost. Such knowledge has not been a major factor for fire control operations for many years since computerised gazetteering was introduced. Even in the existing authorities, it is unrealistic to expect a fire control operator to know the location of every village and town in a county, or every street in London, which already has a region-wide fire control operation. That is not possible. The new technology obviates that need because it presents the operator with a screen showing exactly where the call is coming from and where the appliance best placed to respond is. The red herring about local knowledge should be set aside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_93">The other factor, which cannot be set aside, is the huge savings that are possible by introducing the new system across the country, with a smaller number of much more efficient control centres, thus allowing the savings to be ploughed back into fire prevention&#151;exactly the thing that we know will save lives.

<a name="stpa_94">The hon.

However good they are&#151;they are very good at responding to incidents&#151;and however quickly they get to the site, they cannot save those lives. Prevention is critical if those lives are to be saved. If, as a result of making savings on fire control, some of those resources can be used to put more smoke alarms into vulnerable people&#039;s homes and to carry out more fire prevention work in the first place, more lives will saved. This is a sensible policy that is designed to give the best results.

<a name="stpa_97">By contrast, London is already organised on a regional basis and the fire control centre covers a much larger number of calls, so it is operating on a far more cost-effective basis. It gives as good a service, if not a better one, and does so with significant savings that then allow more focus on fire safety. I talk to the chief of the London fire brigade from time to time and he strongly emphasises his service&#039;s real commitment to driving down the number of lives lost unnecessarily in fires. That commitment is the result of the Government&#039;s policy and of the potential for making savings through an intelligent approach towards facing today&#039;s risks.

They show no willingness to engage in the serious debate&#151;not the token debate with Opposition motions that are not worth the paper they are written on&#151;about how to improve the fire service, save lives and ensure that we have the best and most effective service.

Indeed, I pursued that strategy as a Minister in relation to some educational components in the process and later, as an Agriculture Minister, I worked closely with a regional structure. Although such a strategy is not unthinkable, I take odds with it when it brings in large elements of additional bureaucracy and further structures that may not be appropriate and that may dilute the democratic structures in place. My interest is in sensible co-operation to achieve the right technical result, not in fitting the services to a regional template irrespective of the benefit or otherwise. That is what motivated me to participate in the debate, and I wish to make several points to support my view.

<a name="stpa_106">I wish to make a specific point. I know a little about resilience, because as an 18-year-old I wrote a paper on the subject that was sent to the Home Office in 1961. I suffer gravely from not having a BBC service that is particularly relevant to where I live. I live in Northamptonshire, but receive the service from Oxford and the regional service is from the south, so I see a lot about shipping in the Solent. If I am to be put into an east midlands mould, I will need an east midlands service if there is a difficulty or an emergency. That must be integrated right up to the borders of the services that operate in the area. I mention the point, because I think it is a consideration that the Minister is nodding at.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_107">The final point of the general considerations that I put to Ministers is my worry at the frenetic pace of change. I am conscious that others wish to speak and that we do not want to extend the debate to cover the whole field of public services, but I will say two words about health provision more generally in a moment. As the Government mature, I notice that they are going through a second or even third cycle of change. In these respects, they now seem to be quickening the pace, because they want to produce solutions or to save money, as colleagues have said. In other cases, the second or third reorganisation merely adds to the confusion of staff and service users alike. I think that it was Petronius who said nearly 2,000&nbsp;years ago, &quot;Every time that we were just about to get somewhere, they reorganised us and then we had to start the process all over again.&quot;

 I would like to add a little depth to this point. I am concerned about how dismissive Ministers and Labour Members have been about the concerns of the Fire Brigades Union. I recently received a delegation from the Hampshire FBU and heard its concerns about regional control rooms in our area and particularly about the effects that they would have on my constituency. It would affect rural areas and lead to the loss of staff between now and when the regional control rooms are introduced. Does my hon. Friend agree that such concerns should not be so readily dismissed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_109"><a name="51012-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 That is precisely the point. Many of us listen to FBU members and talk to watches in fire stations, and we can always learn from that process. I am sure that Ministers will want to pick up the concerns that are being vigorously expressed to my hon. Friend and me. All I am really saying to Ministers is, &quot;Don&#039;t push your luck; don&#039;t take it too far; and don&#039;t rush it. Consult and think about it.&quot;

<a name="stpa_112">I can translate my point to a consideration of ambulances. There was a difficult case recently involving a person who was injured in a ploughing match that was taking place in a field on the Warwickshire-Northamptonshire county boundary. Of course the judge who went to the assistance of the person who had fallen did not know the postcode of the location, although he did have a mobile phone&#151;that is relevant to our consideration. He telephoned for assistance, but the terrestrial ambulances of both counties failed to get there and the air ambulance had to be brought in. However, the air ambulance is already served co-operatively by the counties of Warwickshire and Northamptonshire.

A strong functional primary care trust covers most of my area and I have been engaged for some time in fairly delicate negotiations to insert the other part of my area, which is brigaded with Oxfordshire&#151;across the county boundary&#151;into that trust, so it is extraordinary that after we appeared to be getting somewhere and consultation was offered, the whole thing is now up in the air.

It is a three-star trust of long standing that is run extremely well. It is almost the one service in my constituency for which we are not on the edge of things, as it is headquartered in the village of Deanshanger.

It is actually quite a long way from the village to Nottingham. My village is 60&nbsp;miles from the House, but 100&nbsp;miles from Nottingham. I am not sure that I would wish to substitute control from Northampton&#151;or even London&#151;with control from Nottingham.

There are four postal regions in my constituency: first, Northampton, which is in the east midlands; secondly, Coventry, which is in the west midlands; thirdly, Milton Keynes&#151;we have had real problems with BT employees not being able to recognise the post codes of people from there who ring in, because they go through to the wrong control room; and, fourthly, Oxfordshire. I live 300&nbsp;yd within my constituency and have an Oxfordshire postcode, as have about 20&nbsp;per cent. of my constituents. Oxfordshire is in the south-east, as is Milton Keynes. There are huge operational difficulties, including those that relate to the focus of operations. I touched on some of those. My area is not Greater London, a unitary or the west midlands.

We have held the line of having an element of county control and involvement, although even that is sometimes distant. However, the situation is uneasy.

 My constituency is in the south of Northumberland and bridges on to the conurbations of Tyneside. At least 80,000&nbsp;people live there.

The proposal is to close two fire stations in my area that have been in existence for years. The Cramlington station covers the new town, which is a big area. It is on the edge of the town for the people to call on its services at any time. The old town of Blyth has a population of at least 39,000, and its fire station is also to close. There will be no retained fire pumps in those areas. Instead, they will be five miles upland in Wansbeck.

It is on the edge of the town, which has about 26,000&nbsp;people, if Newbiggin by the Sea and Bedlington are included. However, the chief fire officer, Mr. Hessler, says that he will build two state-of-the-art fire stations by the private finance initiative. We need to do our sums on PFI to see whether we save money or not. What we have come up with is that we will not save money and that the scheme will cost the council tax payers big time.

At times, they could not get through the traffic to the stations and response times were extended. Years later, instead of billeting ambulances somewhere on a roadside, which the ambulance service did for a long time&#151;the ambulances were told where to wait for a call&#151;it decided to put them in the fire stations in Blyth, Cramlington and so on. It served a purpose because we got a fire station back, but that is all up in the air now. Where will the ambulance service go in Northumberland? It is a big worry.

However, a member of the Fire Brigades Union told me last week that they have retained firemen in Ponteland, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). An incident happened, but the retained firemen could not get to it because they were off working somewhere else. The fire engine from Blyth had to go all the way up to Ponteland to fight the incident. We are closing stations, removing pumps and getting rid of full-time firefighters. We are expected to rely on retained firemen, but we cannot because they do other jobs. We must look at that problem.

Not so long ago it put a sprinkler into my mother&#039;s house. That is good and should be encouraged.

When he digs out my letter&#151;it has been in his office for three weeks&#151;he should investigate the situation. He should not rely on the chief fire officer, who will produce a biased report, as he did at the recent public meeting, but should seek the opinion of the Fire Brigades Union. I attended that public debate in New Hartley, and the chief fire officer lost hands-down. If I was not convinced before I went to the meeting I was when I left, because the FBU made a good case. Northumberland county council is making a grave mistake, and I urge Hessler to go back to where he came from&#151;Noddyland, where he produced his Noddy policy.

<br>&nbsp;<br>supporting Members. I listened to the Minister with great care but without surprise. He made a fluent defence of a policy that I believe is indefensible. He sought to be constructive, and explained why he genuinely believes that the Government are doing the right thing to improve the services.

<a name="stpa_135">It is a pity that I cannot say the same of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather). In the two years since she has become a Member of Parliament I have not had the experience&#151;I choose my words carefully&#151;of having to listen to one of her speeches.I certainly hope that I do not have to listen to another one in the next two years. With all the arrogance of immaturity, she typified the problems that the Liberal Democrats have experienced since the general election. They do not have a clue about who they are going to attack&#151;the Conservatives or the Government&#151;so they try dishonestly to grub up votes to enhance their political position. In typical Liberal Democrat fashion, therefore, the hon. Lady compromised&#151;

<a name="51012-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_136">The hon. Lady compromised by deciding to disagree with the motion and the Government amendment. She sought, in an extremely cheap way, to attack the Conservative decision to support the FBU, to which the motion refers, for trying to stop regionalisation of control centres. I have to tell the hon. Lady that in the grown-up world real people with depth and maturity support the point of view they believe in, whoever expresses it. We will support the FBU if we believe that its cause is right. We will support an improved service of fire protection for our constituents if that means opposing regionalisation. We do not blow in the wind and we do not take a view because we think that it might enhance our popularity. We take a view because we believe that it is right and is in the best interests of the people who send us here every four or five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_137">I have grave concerns about the Government proposals. I am not convinced by the Minister&#039;s argument that they will save money that can be reinvested in the service to improve it for our constituents. I believe that the proposals are crude, and are part of an overall agenda for regionalisation. The money that will be saved will not necessarily be reinvested pound for pound in the fire services or the ambulance service. It will go into the Chancellor&#039;s depleted coffers to help tackle the growing economic crisis in the public finances. My county of Essex has a population of 1.5&nbsp;million, and is one of the most densely populated areas in the country. We are extremely fortunate, as we have an excellent fire service, and I pay tribute to the dedicated men and women who work day in, day out to protect us and provide the security and safety that all citizens deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_138">The system works. The control centre is located in Essex, and the people who work in it are extremely familiar with the county. They can do their job to the highest standard, and that is what the service 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 335</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should offer. If it is to be submerged into an eastern region including Suffolk, Norfolk and perhaps Northamptonshire and Hertfordshire, that quality of service, local knowledge and the ability to respond effectively and efficiently to calls for help will be diminished because the area covered will be too great. My motto has always been &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t try to fix it.&quot; I urge the Government to follow that motto, even at this late stage. They should display a little more humility. The Minister knows what he is talking about, as he has intimate knowledge of the fire services, having worked for them. That is unusual, however, and I believe that the policy was dreamed up and imposed by civil servants in Whitehall to fit a wider agenda of regionalisation and to try to save money on the side.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_139">Essex ambulance service, which is first-rate, is experiencing similar problems. It has an extremely good chief executive who is sensitive to the county&#039;s changing needs and demands, and who will make sure that the service and its resources are used to maximum effect so that ambulances are available to respond to accidents, to perform other functions and to offer an excellent service to the people of Essex, including my constituents. However, it faces the melting pot, because there are proposals to regionalise it. If the argument is that there are other ambulance services in the eastern region that are not as efficient and effective as that service, it is not right that all the services should be merged and brought down to the lowest common denominator. They should all be brought up to the highest standard. However, it is not clear that that will be achieved by putting them all together in a single mammoth organisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_140">I am not making a party political point, because there have been local government reorganisations under Governments of all persuasions. Some of those reorganisations were motivated by the tenet that bigger is better but after the ensuing problems and upheavals, and given the grievances of people who felt detached from the services they were using, it was recognised that that was not the right approach. As a result, the clock was turned back, and people sought to return to the original arrangements. If the Government are determined to pursue their proposals to the bitter end, I fear that they will destroy an efficient, effective service. They will not be here in a few years&#039; time to make the decisions, but we will have to pick up the pieces and reverse the process by trying to return to the original service that met people&#039;s needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_141">In conclusion, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden for securing today&#039;s debate, which is our only meaningful opportunity to debate the issue on behalf of our constituents on the Floor of the House. Both Ministers on the Front Bench are eminently reasonable, and when they are on their own and are not being bullied or pressurised by their political peers and civil servants, they should think again about this debate and be man and woman enough to admit that maybe they have not got it completely right and that maybe the policy is not necessarily the right way forward. They should be prepared to be magisterial and think again, and my constituents would be extremely grateful if they were to do so.

One could phone into it for the fire service, police and ambulance and they would all turn up in good time. There are strong arguments for that. I personally was rather opposed, because it meant job losses in my constituency, in Chippenham, but I was persuaded none the less that it was the state of the art. The Government told us that the system was to be spread out across the nation. It cost &#163;2.5&nbsp;million to set up this beautiful new building, and there were significant difficulties in getting it going, but after much fighting the Government finally forced it through.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced the other day that it is going to do away with the fire control centre in Devizes and replace it with a remote, and, no doubt, much bigger one in Taunton&#151;presumably at enormous cost. The Minister might like to respond to a detailed point, namely, that the lease on the building in Devizes runs until 2014, and the first escape date in the contract is 2012. If the contract is broken through the removal of the fire service from the control centre, the Government will face a substantial penalty clause. Will the Minister confirm whether the &#163;988&nbsp;million cost that we heard about includes the gigantic cost that will be involved in breaching that contract? I imagine that the same will apply to Gloucestershire, where a similar centre is being set up.

I seem to recall that my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) abolished Avon some 10&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;years ago.

The Wiltshire health authority was to be done away with, to be replaced with primary care groups, which became primary care trusts. Then a thing called the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority was established, although I cannot imagine what the heck it is supposed to be for.

For example, in Dorset, surely it would be reasonable for the police services of Bournemouth and Poole, which effectively constitute one built-up area, to co-operate. The one thing that the Government have laid out plainly is that the borders of the pre-set regions must be adhered to. There must be no cross-border co-operation. If the police in Bournemouth are caught co-operating with the police in Poole, my goodness, there would be all sorts of trouble. The Home Secretary would be down on them like a ton of bricks. However, if the police in Bournemouth co-operate with the police in the Scilly Isles, that counts as a good scheme according to the new Labour notion.

<a name="stpa_189">My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) made a point about computer systems and postcoding. In my constituency, several postcodes cross borders, especially the Welsh border. Several organisations, including Government organisations such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, are sloppy about their use of postcode information. Many of my constituents who live on the Gloucestershire side of the border and have Newport postcodes find that Government organisations assume that an NP postcode means that they are in Wales and they get bilingual documents. That is not a heartening example. If Government organisations are sloppy about their use of data, it is not a serious problem when someone who does not want one gets a bilingual driving licence, but it is tremendously serious if a fire response takes a long time and lives are consequently lost. I ask the Minister to ensure that, whatever happens with technology, some of the problems that affect borders are tackled and that the technology can cope with that and does not make assumptions about postcoding and geographical locations.

It was to save money. The service stayed there for a while, where it worked pretty well, although not as well as it had in the stations. Guess what? To save money, we then moved it from the divisional control centres to the brigade control centres, which is where it operates from today. That has worked, because a lot of the local knowledge went to the control centres. It was possible for people who lived in the county and worked in those control centres to move up in that way. Most of the people who work in the control centres in Hertfordshire and in Essex&#151;where I was a full-time firemen&#151;moved in that way, and some of them had put in 20&nbsp;or 30&nbsp;years&#039; service.

<p><a name="st_142"><a name="51012-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 This has been an excellent debate and I share in the gratitude expressed by others to my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) for introducing it. It is both timely and necessary, given that, in the past three months, we have been unable to engage with the changes to our emergency services affecting our constituents. The debate has shown that Members in all parts of the House are concerned about these changes and it is right that we use our first week back at Westminster to bring our concerns to the Government&#039;s attention. I hope that Ministers have listened to those concerns, which are reflected in the motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_210">My hon. Friend explained excellently and effectively the essence of the case: there is no basis in evidence for such regionalisation; in many cases, it will run risks; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 349</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there is good evidence from within the service that it might hinder effectiveness; and there will be an essential loss of accountability or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) put it, certainly a loss of access to those responsible for these vital services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_211">The Minister, whom I like&#151;he often speaks a great deal of sense&#151;appears to have lost his grip. Perhaps he has been a Minister for too long and read too many briefs, instead of getting out there and seeing what is going on. He failed to answer the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden. She asked him to show us the evidential basis for having fire control centres and asked whether a cost-benefit analysis had been undertaken. He said, &quot;Oh yes, there is a cost-benefit analysis&quot;, but he has not published it and he did not show it to us. We had to wait for the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) to tell us about the plain speaking of the regional management boards concerning the outline business case. They did not accept the case made to them: they did not believe that the claimed benefits would be delivered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_212">Nor did the Minister answer the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), who said that it is a question of the fire service&#039;s resilience not just after 2009, but during the intervening period. Indeed, that is true of many emergency services. We must remember the human dimension. It is all very well writing these ideas down in Whitehall, creating organograms and dealing with the maps and geography; it is when we try to put the ideas into practice and understand how the system is to be managed effectively in the intervening period by organisations&#151;organisations consisting of people&#151;that serious problems emerge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_213">The hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) introduced us to the concept of &quot;quangocratisation&quot;&#151;whatever that is. She argued on the one hand that voters had rejected elected regional assemblies, and on the other that the Liberal Democrats therefore think that we should move to elected regional government. That is a bizarre approach from the Liberal Democrats, as usual. I am afraid that, once the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) stopped digging himself into a hole, he rather confused me. He appeared to argue that big is better, and that the London fire control system is the biggest and therefore the best. He left to one side the relative resources deployed in London in comparison with the rest of the country, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) rightly referred. When choosing examples of where the best technology was located, the right hon. Gentleman did not mention London, but Norfolk and Merseyside. If those two areas can lead the way in the application of new technologies, why cannot a smaller service be relied on to deliver the appropriate technology?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_214">The fact is that the Government do not want to support more accessible and accountable services that mesh attention to local need and local partnerships with the application of best technology. Rather, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) said, they want to make substantial 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 350</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>savings, which they probably erroneously believe can be realised from economies of scale in the regionalisation of control centres.
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="51012-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman tell the House whether, in delivering public services, his party believes that it is right to look for the most cost-effective means while at the same time maintaining the highest standards of service to the public? If he does not accept that, will he explain why not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="51012-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Of course we believe in cost-effectiveness and value for money, but two points need to be made. First, the Minister has not presented any evidence to demonstrate cost-effectiveness. Secondly, as I was arguing, the Government are prepared to cut costs in order to redirect money elsewhere. That is not wrong in itself. Spending money on fire prevention will indeed save lives. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead rightly pointed out, those who work in the fire service today want to be able to respond to 999&nbsp;calls effectively and they want to develop and structure their service in a way that is responsive to local needs. If regionalisation cuts costs but reduces effectiveness, it does not provide value for money. That is the key point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_215">My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry provided an almost impossibly large amount of information about the geography of his constituency and where he lives, but we entirely understood his point that it is all very well being at the centre of England, but it does not necessarily prevent one from being at everyone&#039;s boundary. The idea that by having fewer bodies we have fewer boundaries has been mentioned several times. Let us go to the absurd length of considering a service that is fully national in all respects. That might be said to mean that there were no boundaries, that everything was seamless and that all services would run at maximum effectiveness&#151;but we know that that is nonsense. The real issue is determining the proper degree of rationalisation necessary to deliver effectiveness.

</p>








<p><a name="st_146"><a name="51012-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 If my hon. Friend will forgive me, many important issues were raised and I want to say a few words about the ambulance service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_216">Only a few hon. Members referred to the ambulance service, but it is a key issue. The Minister who is to reply to the debate knows that the Peter Bradley review was published earlier this year. She also knows that it suggested that some rationalisation was necessary to deliver a degree of strategic capacity for some ambulance services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_217">Let us consider the Avon, Gloucester and Wiltshire ambulance services, for example. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) mentioned that the Wiltshire ambulance service was felt to be too small to be able to deliver the necessary strategic capacity. My hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) made a similar point about the Royal Berkshire ambulance service. Notwithstanding its three-star status, it was felt that it needed to be run on a Thames valley basis to deliver the requisite strategic capacity. In 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 351</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>neither of those instances and not at all in the Bradley review, was there any argument that the rationalisation of ambulance services needed to reduce them to as few as 11&nbsp;trusts. On the basis of the Bradley review, we would be looking at about 25&nbsp;trusts. Many of the relevant trusts are at the top of the star ratings, to which the Government attach so much importance: they are three-star trusts serving relatively small populations of about 1&nbsp;million to 2&nbsp;million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_218">A good argument can be made in some cases, but the problem arises if we move away from ambulance service trusts of about that size. What do we move to? The hon. Member for Brent, East mentioned the key point about ambulance services: they will be much less capable of integrating with emergency care networks. There is a whole agenda within the NHS of turning ambulance services into emergency care trusts that are capable&#151;if the local emergency care networks or the primary care trusts wish to commission them&#151;of delivering out-of-hours services. They are certainly capable of being first-response organisations. Ambulance services may even take over provider functions if PCTs are required to give them up. Any regional ambulance service would resemble the London service, which is not moving towards such innovations. It would be much less able to create the local partnerships that are so necessary and could not be managed in a way that would ensure integrated emergency care, because its standards would be set centrally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_219">If big were beautiful, the London ambulance service would be the best in the country. I have the greatest respect for its personnel, who responded magnificently on 7&nbsp;July. However, they know, as do we, that the London service does not attain the same high standards achieved by other services. The question of how a service responds to calls was at the centre of the Bradley review, which showed that the London service was substantially less rigorous than many others. Moreover, its control centre does not have the computer-aided despatch process that other services enjoy. There is therefore no basis for the Government&#039;s proposals for the ambulance services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_220">In addition, the Minister failed to recognise an especially glaring anomaly. He said that the police service proposals were not set in stone and that any change would be service-led and based on open consultation. In contrast, with the ambulance service, we have not even got as far as public consultation on regional control centres, yet the Government have already decided that there will be 11&nbsp;ambulance trusts. No evidence has been offered to show why that would be desirable and I know of no public support for the proposals. The people in the service to whom I have spoken believe that the proposals are driven entirely by the Government&#039;s cost-saving agenda. They do not believe that that is justified, nor expect the savings to be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_221">I do not wish to embarrass the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington, but he was able to answer a question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden that the Minister avoided. He said that the outline business case in respect of fire control centres was not supported by the available evidence and that documentation in his possession showed that the proposal was not supported by the regional management boards of the fire service.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 352</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_222">It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he will write to the hon. Gentleman and place his letter in the Library of the House. He should have published months ago the cost-benefit analysis and outline business case that underlie the Government&#039;s proposals so that they could be subject to public scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_223">This has been a vital debate and I am glad that we have had it. It equips all of us with the ability to tell our constituents that we have challenged the Government but, more importantly, it has exposed the Government&#039;s failure to explain why they want to go down the path of regionalisation. The Government have been frustrated by the result of the assembly elections in the north-east, but nevertheless wish to proceed with the regionalisation of government. However, that regional government will remain under the control of the ODPM and central Government.

<p><a name="st_147"><a name="51012-21_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 Naturally, I do not agree with the motion, but I am pleased that the debate has given us the opportunity to pay tribute once again to the work of our emergency services, whose dedication and commitment are second to none. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said&#151;his words were echoed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) and by several Opposition Members&#151;the events of 7&nbsp;July gave us a tragic reminder of the invaluable work performed by the people who staff our emergency services. I am sure that the whole House wants to pay tribute to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_225">This debate has also allowed us to discuss how to shape our emergency services for the 21st century, and for all the new demands and challenges that we face. It is true that our police, fire and ambulance services are all undergoing change. That is not only because we want high-quality local services, but because we need to have emergency services that can deal with major incidents, whether terrorist attacks, chemical incidents, major transport accidents or natural disasters such as the floods that we have seen all too often in recent years. All the evidence and lessons learned over the past few years point to the fact that major incidents require a co-ordinated response across local boundaries. Specialist equipment is often required and personnel from a wider geographical area may need to be called upon. It has to be possible to mobilise at short notice resources from outside the immediate area. Disasters do not respect local authority boundaries and we have to have emergency services that respond to that fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said about the fire service, we need to upgrade our communication and control centres so that they can deal as effectively as possible with major incidents. He also said that, in July, the London fire brigade showed the importance of being able to respond at a regional level. It is generally accepted that a similar strategic approach is necessary throughout the country.

<a name="stpa_227">I felt that the debate was slightly like a branch meeting of the Fire Brigades Union, not only because of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary&#039;s background but because of the contribution of the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), who started well but deteriorated when he criticised some of those working in the service. In terms of the local changes to the fire service, my hon. Friend has heard the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell). I understand that the Under-Secretary wrote back to my hon. Friend two days ago and he will respond, as he said he would, to my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) to his points about finance. We will look into the points about the contract made by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray). I hope that my hon. Friend also reassured the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) on the new technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_228">With regard to the police, my hon. Friend said that the independent inspectorate was clear that a move to larger strategic forces across England and Wales would provide the best business solution to ensure that every force had sufficient capability and capacity to provide the full range of protective services, including preparedness for response to large-scale incidents, alongside effective neighbourhood policing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_229">The hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) spoke about further consultation and the police themselves have made proposals, but we will pass on her point and that of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) about future consultation to follow on from the proposals, which are to received at the end of December. As the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) pointed out, the ambulance services review was carried out by the chief executive of the London ambulance service. The review concluded that we need fewer and bigger ambulance trusts if they are to be able to respond to major incidents, as well as to invest in the people and resources needed to increase the range of services that they provide for patients and the public. Our proposals will ensure that resources are targeted at where they are needed most and that they improve patient care and support front-line services.

<a name="stpa_230">We propose that there should be 11&nbsp;trusts that will align with the Government Offices for the Regions, the fire service control rooms and the proposed strategic health authorities and be set up within boundaries that enable closer co-operation with police forces. For the

 If I may anticipate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, a particular example of a gain from our proposals is the training of emergency care practitioners. If that is done on a more strategic level, the training will be improved and skills and potential enhanced.
</p>








<p><a name="st_152"><a name="51012-21_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 One of the best ambulance trusts in the country&#151;its standards are reflected in its star ratings&#151;is the Staffordshire ambulance trust. We have heard from hon. Members across Staffordshire that the trust delivers an effective service and that it is innovative and at the leading edge of ambulance trust delivery. Why does the Minister think that regionalisation would improve that trust? The implication of what she has just said is regional control centres for ambulance services, but the Government have not said that they propose such centres.
</p>








<p><a name="st_153"><a name="51012-21_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 No, that is not the case. We will consult on the proposals for 11&nbsp;trusts, but we have also made it clear that decisions about control rooms will be taken at local level. There are some very good ambulance trusts and the idea is not that their standards should be brought down by merging. The idea is that they will help to improve other ambulance trusts&#151;an idea that has worked time and again in the NHS. We will have services that can respond properly and strategically at regional level and also reflect needs at local level.

 The effectiveness of the Staffordshire ambulance trust has already been pointed out and my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) raised it with the Prime Minister. Will my hon.

 If my hon. Friend had been in his place earlier, he would know that my hon.

They are not about changes to front-line ambulance service provision. Local innovations and successes would be not only preserved, but shared to benefit all.

<p><a name="st_160"><a name="51012-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 The right hon. Lady asks how I can possibly have any interests. I am not sure that I do have any interests, as a matter of fact, but I always try to follow the path of greatest assurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_241">The problem of climate change is manifestly global. I do not think that anyone on either side of the House is in any doubt that the problem requires global solutions. It is also clear that the Prime Minister has grasped the global nature of the problem. It would be fair to pay him the tribute of saying that since Lady Thatcher&#039;s speech many years ago, he is probably the person in British politics who has most signally grasped that fact. What is more&#151;this might not necessarily give some of my colleagues great satisfaction&#151;I must say that I think that the Prime Minister is right that we will not make significant global progress until and unless we realise what the Americans, Chinese, Indians and Russians are clearly now recognising: the solution to the problem of increasing carbon emissions does not lie in trying to persuade the entirety of the inhabitants of the globe to live like monks in the middle ages, or in trying to pretend away the serious problems of competitive advantage if some economies engage in certain activities, while others engage in others. In short, there is no doubt at all that the United States will not participate unless and until China, India, Russia, Brazil&#151;probably&#151;and possibly Japan are fully locked into a process. So far, I agree with the Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_242">I must say, however, that I read with some dismay the Prime Minister&#039;s remarks&#151;made not here in the UK, of course, but in the States&#151;suggesting that he had abandoned the hope of some years hence moving from a stage at which there was a joint and laudable effort to introduce new technologies to one at which there could be a wider second Kyoto&#151;although I care not whether it would be called that&#151;that would represent a much wider binding agreement across the great majority of the economies of the world that targets would be achieved for carbon reduction. We still need to strive towards that goal, so I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to relieve my anxiety and let us know that the Prime Minister&#039;s remarks have been misinterpreted and that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 361</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>although he does not believe&#151;as I do not&#151;that there will be a second Kyoto agreement in short order, he nevertheless hopes to negotiate such a universal binding agreement in due course. If that is the Prime Minister&#039;s view, we share it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51012-23_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman makes typically delphic opening remarks, but says that he agrees with the Government and the Prime Minister about the importance placed on global warming. He also makes positive remarks about Lady Thatcher and others. Bearing in mind that the Conservative party has decided to take the time to debate climate change and global warming, is it not odd that it barely mentioned it in the general election? To what extent was it referred to in the manifesto?
</p>








<p><a name="st_162"><a name="51012-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 As a matter of fact, I think it was odd that both the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party and mine&#151;I exempt the Liberal Democrats from this&#151;did not spend nearly as much of the general election campaign discussing the issues as we collectively should have done. It is a just accusation that the manifesto should have included some things more than it did. I am not going to pretend otherwise. I do not specialise in delphic utterances. That is about as clear as one can get. It is time for our parties to put the subject higher up the political agenda. When he has heard the rest of my remarks, he will see how I intend, and hope, to persuade British politics as a whole to move in that direction.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51012-23_spnew4"><b> Ed Balls  (Normanton) (Lab):</b> 
 I take the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s commitment to tackling climate change at face value. Does he regret that his party opposed the climate change levy, which was introduced to pursue climate change? Will he unequivocally tell the House that he has changed his party&#039;s mind and that it now supports the levy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51012-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 No, and I shall explain why. The climate change levy is an extraordinarily inept tool. It has one very good aspect&#151;the climate change agreements that have been reached with big industry&#151;but it has one very bad effect, which the hon. Gentleman and his erstwhile, and perhaps future, master in the Treasury intended it to have. It raises a large amount of money for the Treasury from a large number of small firms, but the effect on their performance in relation to climate change is precisely nil. That is not a well targeted or well designed environmental levy. Our solutions are superior. I hope that, in due course, the Labour party will come round to them.

 (Sherwood) (Lab) <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_166"><a name="51012-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, not least because of his distinguished role in yesterday&#039;s proceedings on the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill. I then intend to make progress.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51012-23_spnew8"><b> Paddy Tipping: </b> 
 I shall try to be helpful again. The right hon. Gentleman referred to pushing climate change up the political agenda and in particular to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>role of the Prime Minister. Let us be clear on this. Does he accept that the Prime Minister got it on the G8&nbsp;agenda, that it will be discussed at the G8&nbsp;summit in St. Petersburg next year, and that he has met China, India and Russia? How much more should we do in an international setting? Is not that a good record?
</p>








<p><a name="st_168"><a name="51012-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 I am coming on to what more should be done, but I accept that the Prime Minister has done noble work in putting the subject higher up the international agenda. However, discussions between China, India and the United States went on largely without his involvement. That is no discredit to him. He has since taken a leading role in furthering those discussions. That is to his credit. We are not in disagreement about that. My problems relate to the fact that apart from having apparently given up the idea of a second Kyoto&#151;I hope that the Secretary of State tells us that that is not the case&#151;the rhetoric domestically has not been matched by delivery domestically.

 My right hon. Friend started in a consensual manner, but a slightly partisan note has crept in from Labour Members. In that case, is it not worth pointing out that the record of the previous Conservative Government, who dramatically reduced CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, looks far more impressive than anything that this Government have done since coming into office?

 I shall perhaps make a political mistake by making an admission to my hon. Friend. Factually he is right that under the Conservative Administrations in the 1990s there was a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide. However, having been personally involved in the restructuring of the electricity supply industry, that was a serendipitous effect of the dash for gas. We cannot claim that it was part of a well co-ordinated plan to reduce carbon emissions. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Before Government Members giggle too much, they should recognise that that is symptomatic of the position of this Government. I fear that there is no sign of a well co-ordinated plan to reduce carbon emissions, and that is the germ of my argument. Governments of both political persuasions have failed to develop a well co-ordinated plan. In one case, the dash for gas led to carbon reductions but in the other, apart from a change in the production of adipic acid, there has been hardly any movement at all except for recent adverse results. That is the main thrust of the arguments that the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) and I shall make today.

<a name="stpa_243">It is hardly worth looking at the year-by-year carbon emission figures because they dart around. The most honest and compelling way to look at the figures is to consider three-year rolling averages. I cannot recall such a clear pattern. In 1992, the three-year rolling average for CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions in terms of millions of tonnes of carbon equivalent was 165. It dropped in 1993&nbsp;to 163; in 1994, to 159; and in 1995, to 157. It remained at 157&nbsp;in 1996, and dropped in 1997&nbsp;to 156&#151;the point made by my hon.

If we are to have sustained economic growth, as we both want, and if we are serious, which I am and which I suppose he is&#151;certainly the Secretary of State is&#151;about trying to achieve carbon reduction we must find a means of allying it to economic growth, not explaining away carbon increases in terms of economic growth.

<a name="stpa_244">There is an empirical fact of the matter. I do not wish to attribute blame to anyone, and am merely stating the facts. We are moving remorselessly in the wrong direction domestically. It is true that that has been masked by a particular change in 1999, when the production method of adipic acid altered and nitrous oxide was reduced serendipitously. That will not happen again, and I know of no other industrial process that will make a similar contribution. We are now on a track which, without a significant change of course, will lead to an increase not a reduction in carbon emissions in this country.

 The sad demise of combined heat is only one element of many contributing to this sorry tale.

: I am interested in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s analogy about independent advice. Back in 1998, the Government went to the president of the CBI&#151;who, I am sure you would agree, is not at all a partisan political figure&#151;and asked him to look at the issue of climate change. He recommended, independently of Government, that we move towards emissions trading in the long term, but in the short to medium term we should have the climate change levy, with negotiated agreements, and supported by the CBI. For partisan political reasons, the right hon. Gentleman and his party opposed it. How can he now, with any credibility, lecture us about not being partisan?

 The tone of voice that I was attempting to adopt was one not of lecturing the hon. Gentleman but of making a positive proposal about a way in which the three parties might go forward. If he wants to persist in the rather paltry business of continually defending a partly defensible and partly indefensible position in relation to a tax that has had some desirable effects but others that are unfortunately not so desirable, that is a pity. Rather than worrying about all that, we have an opportunity to do something that is of extraordinary significance not only for the way in which this country behaves but in giving us the ability to engage in moral leadership globally. Unless we make serious strides, not backwards but forwards, in reducing carbon, we cannot lead globally to anything like the extent that the Prime Minister rightly wants.

In fact, we have the opportunity to engage in leadership of the sort that he demonstrated in his leaflet; and we can go further.

<a name="stpa_252">I do not know whether the Secretary of State will admit it, but I suspect that she does not greatly disagree with most of my comments. I also suspect that she, through no fault of her own, is in a position in Whitehall that often makes it difficult to pull levers and find something at the other end. I suspect that she often pulls levers only to find that there is not much at the other end. The reason for that is the way in which the power structures of Whitehall operate. Many powerful forces are at work in Whitehall&#151;the Treasury, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department for Transport, energy and the Department for Trade and Industry, which sponsors it. Each is a power base. It is difficult to corral a whole Government into a joined-up policy&#151;to adopt one of the Government&#039;s favourite phrases &#151;that delivers a serious reduction in carbon while keeping the lights on and the economy growing.

That would be true of not only the current regime but subsequent Governments of different hues.

We must not suggest that every appalling event that occurs is the direct consequence of climate change, when many of them are not. That is a difficult balance to strike.

However, it has been widely observed that our Prime Minister has made more forceful and more constructive use of the G8&nbsp;mechanism than anyone can remember. It was as a result of his efforts that the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January&#151;for the first time, I think&#151;had the impact and opportunities of climate change as a major item on its agenda. At that meeting, he not only made a keynote speech but hosted a breakfast with 30&nbsp;senior players, each from a different sector of global business, to ask them to stimulate discussion in their sector on the challenges of climate change and report back before Gleneagles, as they did.

<a name="stpa_261">In February, we hosted a scientific meeting in Exeter, and the consensus of that expert group was greater certainty about global warming, which was the bad news, but that tackling it should cost less than predicted if done early enough, which was the good news. In March, we organised a round table discussion of Energy and Environment Ministers from some 20&nbsp;countries with major and growing energy needs&#151;another first&#151;at a meeting which also drew in major players from industry and finance, as well as countries such as India, China, Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea and so on. Then, in July, at Gleneagles, the Prime Minister brokered agreement not only that all the G8&nbsp;accepted that there was a consensus on the science but that global emissions should slow, stop and reverse, and that there should be an action plan to help to deliver on that agreement&#151;a plan that engaged not only the G8&nbsp;but the World Bank and International Energy Agency. I am genuinely uncertain as to whether this part of the agreement&#151;on the outcome needed and the steps that might deliver that outcome&#151;was the most significant achievement from Gleneagles, or whether it was the equally unprecedented agreement to a follow-up dialogue to explore what might be done to move forward on tackling climate change.

<p><a name="st_193"><a name="51012-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Ainsworth  (East Surrey) (Con):</b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="51012-26_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 As I said, there has been a certain amount of over-interpretation. The Prime Minister has not changed his mind about the need for future international action in any way, shape or form.
</p>








<p><a name="st_195"><a name="51012-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 We may be making significant progress here, and perhaps I have misinterpreted the Prime Minister. Is the Secretary of State saying that the Government still believe that it is necessary to reach, after whatever technological investment programme might take place, a series of national and binding targets across a wide range of nations, including the United States, China and India?

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="51012-26_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 If I may, I will deal later in my speech with the shape of how international discussions might go forward, as I think that people are getting several steps ahead of themselves. I will say two things that might reassure both the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman. First, in the discussions referred to in New York, the Prime Minister said specifically:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;I don&#039;t think all the answers lie in just developing the science and technology.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_263">He then talked about how we move forward post-Kyoto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_264">We can all, I hope, sign up&#151;albeit with varying degrees of commitment&#151;to the need to tackle the impact of climate change. As was said in an intervention, that is the easy bit, but there is not much point in reaching a consensus on the problem if, the minute difficult decisions on what to do about it come along, the would-be consensus rats and runs away. So let us rise above such silliness in the motion&#151;I accept the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about misinterpretation and hoping to be proved wrong&#151;and consider what this consensus might consist of, apart from agreement that there is a problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_265">The Conservatives seem at last to agree&#151;the right hon. Gentleman said that this has been his party&#039;s position for some time&#151;with the Government&#039;s major target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 60&nbsp;per cent. by about 2050, as set out in our energy White Paper. He is being unjust to himself in suggesting that this is a longstanding Conservative commitment; but however recent it is, it is certainly welcome. But what else is there? I looked for clues in the motion, which talks about an independent body to monitor emissions. Indeed, that was the tenor of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks, but it is not entirely clear to me why he thinks that such a body would be a major help.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 371</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_266">Our emissions data are already compiled according to international guidelines, and they are scrutinised by&#151;among others&#151;the National Audit Office and are subject to international peer review, under guidelines agreed by the United Nations framework convention on climate change. Far from there being concern about the UK&#039;s work on emissions monitoring, it has an outstanding international reputation.

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_267">So is there something more for which the right hon. Gentleman is calling?

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;an independent body, like the Bank of England&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_268">this takes us back to a point made in an earlier intervention on the right hon. Gentleman&#151;

</ul>

<a name="51012-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_269">which should be achieved through a 3&nbsp;per cent. per year cut in emissions. But although the Bank of England&#039;s independent role in the economy is crucial, it is specific and limited. It sets the level of interest rates, so what would this new body control and how would it control it? If the intention is to influence the price of carbon, would such a body control fuel prices under the next Conservative Government? Would that include controlling the price of oil, gas and coal?
</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51012-26_spnew6"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 I have undoubtedly made myself insufficiently clear, given that I failed earlier to persuade the right hon. Lady of my point. What I meant to say is that there needs to be a body that predicts&#151;in the way that the Bank of England predicts, through its probabilistic analyses&#151;the chance of the Government of the day&#039;s meeting a set of year-by-year targets relating to the policies of the time. That is a very specific and extraordinarily important role which is not based on current monitoring, but which looks forward to 2050.
</p>








<p><a name="st_198"><a name="51012-26_spnew7"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 If I may return to the analogy that the right hon. Gentleman himself drew, such a role forms a small part of any comparison with the role of the Bank of England, which, as I said, does not merely comment but holds some of the levers of power. I am slightly disappointed in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s response, and I am inclined to turn back on him an observation that he made to me. Perhaps it would have been better to secure agreement among his own Front Benchers&#151;I take his point about policy entirely, and I do not criticise the Conservatives for reviewing their policies&#151;and to have established a more detailed proposition that is genuinely in keeping with how the Bank of England operates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_270">I did wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman had it in mind that such a body would advise on building standards, so as to ensure greater energy efficiency. I take his point that he was confining his remarks to the question of monitoring. However, listening to this exchange&#151;I look forward with great interest to hearing the supporting comments of the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)&#151;I wonder whether, when we next hear from the spokesmen for the fuel protests, both parties will urge the Government not to be flexible. That would certainly be interesting.

<a name="stpa_271">Let me make it plain, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I would welcome a real cross-party consensus on climate change. We would probably never reach the stage of total agreement on every policy, but a recognition of the need for harsh choices and a willingness to face up to them would definitely be steps in the right direction. I accept&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) may be less keen&#151;that the Opposition include those who dislike the climate change levy. For the sake of this debate, let us say fair enough, but what would they do instead that might deliver the same results? Let us not forget that, for all the criticism&#151;some of it unjustified&#151;of the Government&#039;s record, our technical advice is that, without the totality of the measures in our climate change programme or something of equal magnitude to replace them, our carbon dioxide emissions will be 5&nbsp;per cent. up on 1990, instead of more than 5&nbsp;per cent. down.

The water authority told me that the problem was not unique to Newcastle, but probably applied around the country. Has my right hon.

 I cannot honestly say whether a specific assessment of the problems arising in Newcastle has been made. I am sorry to learn about how my hon.

We are seeing signs that the nature of our rainfall is changing. The way in which we handle it, the nature of our infrastructure and water storage, as well as our water use, must be kept under review. I can assure my hon.

<p><a name="st_202"><a name="51012-27_spnew1"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I do not intend to get drawn into that argument today, but I am very conscious that China is building about one new power plant per week. It is not concentrating on nuclear power, but is drawing on every possible technology. China has vast coal reserves, and will continue to use them. It is looking at renewables, but the Chinese Government are so seized of the need for energy supply that they are looking at every alternative, including nuclear.

They are also proud and independent states, but they are only two among the 189&nbsp;countries sending delegations to the Montreal meeting of the UN convention on climate change. I shall be frank with the House: to attempt to lecture or instruct those 189&nbsp;countries about what they should do in respect of climate change&#151;let alone to prescribe how they should go about doing it&#151; would be grossly impertinent and probably utterly counterproductive.

That alone makes it a truly historic event. The most important and urgent business at Montreal will be to reach agreement on the final legal underpinnings of the protocol&#151;something that could not be done until it came into force.

<a name="stpa_292">I am not making party points about the UK position. The Government have introduced strategies to try to deal with climate change and have, in many senses, given leadership, but we are missing our targets for carbon emissions, which have gone up over the past three years. There are problems with aviation to which no one has found a solution. The evidence is that if aviation emissions continue at their present rate the increase will wipe out all the gains that would have been made if the Government&#039;s other targets had been met. That is how serious the problem is. These are really big issues and no

 I remind the hon. Gentleman that in fact we have proposals for tackling aviation. We believe that we should try to integrate aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme. Only a few days ago, the Commission published a communication that suggests that it too thinks that is the way forward. The approach of the Environment Council is not wholly clear, but if we can make a start on such proposals in the EU it could have a huge impact.

 No, because it is unrealistic to expect that as a consequence of discussing such matters and trying to find a common base all three parties will produce identical policies. That is impossible and it would be pointless to try to achieve it. However, we can reach agreement on some essentials; for example, on the science, on the 60&nbsp;per cent. cut in carbon emissions, on aviation and the emissions trading scheme and on more money for energy efficiency. There are many things on which we can agree. I want a solid foundation to be laid and for us to communicate that to the public. We could even build a couple of storeys on that foundation and each of the three parties could build their own different structures on those storeys. Some will include nuclear power; others will include something else. It does not matter. What matters is that we stress our common agreement rather than always picking on differences and reducing the debate to saying, &quot;You&#039;re wrong about nuclear power or you&#039;re right about something else.&quot; That is not productive. Let us try to find out what we have in common.

Such decisions are sometimes necessary for the long term, but they may also have short-term political consequences.

<a name="stpa_298">The Secretary of State&#039;s letter includes a number of reasons why she was not prepared to join us at this juncture. In one paragraph, she refers to uncertainties in the two Opposition parties: first, the Conservative leadership election; secondly, that party&#039;s position on a number of key issues; and, thirdly, the Liberal Democrats&#039; policy review. As for the latter two reasons, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I reiterate that we should seek out the many areas of agreement, rather than trying to identify one or two issues that she would use as a veto on any agreement. We do not need to have everything agreed. So, with respect, I do not think that those are very good reasons. As for the Conservative leadership campaign, I sincerely hope that the right hon.

<a name="51012-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_299">The Secretary of State&#039;s letter also refers to the position of India and China, and I know that she takes that seriously. We have exchanged views on this before and I recognise and accept how sensitive the issue is. I recognise absolutely that we cannot start to dictate what those countries should have. I spent some time over the summer in India meeting Indian politicians and business leaders on the very issue of climate change. I came away with a strong view of how they feel. Of course, the issue is to guide all the different ships into harbour, and that is not necessarily easy to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_300">The Indian politicians whom I met said that they were potentially very responsive to what the EU was doing. They recognised that we in Europe were giving a lead, and they were also quite happy with the idea of contraction and convergence, which they regard as a fair and equitable way forward. I am sure that the Secretary of State has heard the same response. However, they were vociferous&#151;that is a fair word to use&#151;about the attitude of the American Administration. The Indians take the view that they do not see why they should make sacrifices when the American Administration are not doing the same. That seems to be a perfectly fair position to take.

<a name="stpa_301">I want to digress slightly to pick up what the Secretary of State said about the Prime Minister. I, for one, am perfectly happy to accept that he has been going out of his way to deal with the issue internationally. I am happy to accept that he has got this on the agenda and that he has made some progress. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to say that. I wish he could make even more progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_302">I made the point, however, in the last Liberal Democrat Opposition day debate before the election that I am genuinely worried. The Prime Minister is playing a difficult game diplomatically to try to get everyone corralled in one place and then get them going in the same direction at the same time. I do not underestimate the difficulties of that. On the one hand, he has countries such as India and China and, on the other, he has the United States, which takes an unhelpful view. My genuine fear is that, to try to bring the US Administration on board, he will be prepared to sacrifice the idea of mandatory targets in some shape or form to make sure that they can sign a piece of paper. I understand why he would want to do that, but it would not be a satisfactory outcome.

<p><a name="st_222"><a name="51012-29_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I understand the anxiety that the hon. Gentleman voices, and considerable anxiety was expressed in the run-up to the Gleneagles summit by, for example, campaigners in America. In the summit&#039;s aftermath, they greatly welcomed the fact that the Prime Minister had not taken the path that the hon. Gentleman had identified as the one that had concerned him and those campaigners. The Prime Minister had, indeed, maintained his push for the kind of forward look

<p><a name="st_223"><a name="51012-29_spnew4"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 I accept that we are nowhere near that conclusion, but I remain to be convinced that it is not the right mechanism. There are mandatory targets for countries that signed up to Kyoto, very few of which are meeting them. I fear what the effect will be if there are no mandatory targets at all.
</p>








<p><a name="st_224"><a name="51012-29_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I do not want to nit-pick, but there are mandatory targets for the developed countries that signed up to Kyoto. A great many countries signed the Kyoto protocol, under which there are not mandatory targets. If the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_225"><a name="51012-29_spnew6"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 I accept that. Such targets are sensitive, not least because of the US position. The point that I was trying to make is that, even where there are mandatory targets for the developed countries, including this country and those in the EU, very few countries will meet them. If mandatory targets cannot even bring the ship into harbour, it is not clear what other mechanism will achieve that end. However, I am willing to be convinced and to see what comes out of negotiations. Like the Secretary of State, I am looking for results that end up with significant carbon cuts across the world in an attempt to stave off a growing crisis. That is our common objective.

I sometimes wonder whether the &quot;Today&quot; programme is entirely independent of the Government, but that might be unduly cynical of me.

 There is a range of ways in which the public need to be brought on board, so I shall try to cover that wide topic briefly. Education of course has a role.

I would like the Government to produce leaflets to put through doors to educate the public, in the same way as they do

Gentleman and his Conservative colleagues agree that if we made it cheaper to do the right thing and more expensive to do the wrong thing even members of the public who had not bought the science would nevertheless respond in a way that would generate the right result. By the way, that would not involve increasing taxation. My party has suggested creating a section of the Treasury that is designed to examine exactly how taxation influences environmental behaviour, with a view to reorganising such taxation to ensure that it is revenue neutral and achieves such ends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_304">A third way in which the public can be educated is through not what we can do, but what the media can do. The media do not always approach the matter as they should&#151;I have made that point before and do not hesitate to make it again. They either do not cover the subject at all, or cover it in a way that does not make connections. The increased risk of floods has been widely reported in the past 24&nbsp;hours, but none of the news media has made much of a connection between that and climate change. Alternatively, the media report climate change as a straight science story with two pages on how the polar ice caps are disappearing, but without any indication of what politicians of any party should do about that. The media thus have a role in educating the public.

We are making a genuine attempt and, as politicians, we owe it to the public to do that. A policy of business as usual will not deliver action on the environment to tackle climate change effectively. We are convinced that our approach is the way forward and we genuinely want the Government to join us.

<br>&nbsp;<br>what I believe to be climate change. Those hon. Members who can remember past the general election know that Carlisle experienced horrendous flooding on 8&nbsp;January. About 3,000&nbsp;houses were flooded and two elderly constituents died a dreadful death by drowning in their homes. Some &#163;500&nbsp;million of damage was caused. Jobs were lost. It was a staggering blow.
</p>

<a name="stpa_308">The Government responded well. My hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, who is responsible for dealing with floods, came to the constituency before it had stopped raining and &#163;30&nbsp;million was made available for flood defences. Six Ministers, four of them Secretaries of State, visited us. We dealt with the flood well. We also received an extra &#163;30&nbsp;million for our schools.
</p>

<a name="51012-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_309">We thought that it was a flood that took place once every 150&nbsp;years. It had happened and we could put it behind us. The Deputy Prime Minister came to the city and said that it should have a renaissance. We were to have a new fire station, new police station, new commercial centre and new civic centre, because they were all flooded. We were looking forward to that, but yesterday the rain started again. The storm clouds came over Carlisle, settled over Cumbria and we had 4&nbsp;in of rain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_310">Those facts do not bear any resemblance to what really happens to people when they are flooded. I arrived home from London and someone said, &quot;Do you want a boat trip round your house?&quot; After the flooding went away, we went into the houses, took our personal possessions, which we had had for many years, and threw them into a big skip. But that was just the start. The builders then came in. They tore the house to pieces, ripped up floorboards and took down the walls. Massive heaters were put in the house to dry it out before it could be reconstructed. It was horrendous. Some 66&nbsp;per cent. of the people flooded in my constituency in January are still not back in their homes. That is the reality of a massive flood&#151;and of global warming.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_311">It is global warming because the same thing has happened again. Fortunately, when I came to the Chamber, the rain had stopped, but last night my constituents lived in fear. I am not exaggerating&#151;I am not prone to exaggeration&#151;but they would not have slept. I was in London and I did not sleep. The curtains would have been open and they would have gone to the window every half hour to check whether it was still raining. The local bus company moved its &#163;3&nbsp;million-worth of new buses out of the area. I talked to senior managers at United Utilities today who said that the climate has changed and Carlisle is no worse than many other areas. My tale could well be repeated in other constituencies if we do not do something about the problem.

<a name="stpa_312">As I said, I am not a great visionary, but a practical politician. Some things we can do quickly. Although tackling emissions will take great debate by statesmen and wise counsel, we have to be ready for more floods. There is a commitment to provide flood defences, but they will not be up for a while. However, yesterday&#039;s problem was not with the rivers. The Environment Agency is in charge of those and they did not flood. The problem lay with the run-off of surface water, the drains and the sewers.

United Utilities said that we must spend &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion in the next five years to improve environmental water quality in the north-west, but we have only &#163;100&nbsp;million to spend on improvements to the sewerage system. I live in the centre of Carlisle and when I look out of my windows I can see otters and kingfishers, which is tremendous. It may be necessary, however to reduce the &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion that we spend on water quality and put more money into improving the sewerage system. We need to reconstruct the drainage and the sewerage systems in most of our cities, as they were built at a time when people did not experience flash floods or intense rainfall. Another option is to increase costs to pay for those improvements, because United Utilities and the other privatised utilities will always seek a profit.

I think that that was the right decision. Having had nuclear power in Cumbria for many years, I believe that we should keep an open mind about it. Environmentalists who say that we should have nothing to do with it are probably wrong, and might think differently if they shared my experiences.

If we want to live in a climate like that of Labrador, that is the way to do it. The disappearing Arctic ice cap also reduces the Earth&#039;s ability to reflect light back to the sun, which creates a vicious circle whereby the ocean warms up, the capacity to absorb CO <sub>2</sub>  is reduced, more ice is lost and the ocean warms up again. If the cycle continues until 2060, there is likely to be no ice at all.

By itself, the Kyoto protocol will make only a minimal impression, but it proves that the world can more and less come together and achieve agreement on what needs to be done. It is therefore an important milestone in making progress on climate change. It is essential that work continue on developing an effective post-Kyoto international agreement and I was somewhat comforted by the Secretary of State&#039;s remarks on that point.

If all those coal-fired power stations are built with conventional coal technology, we might as well give up our weekly trip to the recycling bin and forget about energy-efficient light bulbs. The plain truth is that the United Kingdom is responsible for only 2&nbsp;per cent. of global climate change emissions.

If he had listened to the advice that Professor Sir Dave King gave the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs only a year ago, he would realise that Professor King said that we are currently in the middle of a revolution of small changes. Climate change is not a future scenario; we are in it now. We must consider urgently what we do about short-term, traumatic upheavals in what we used to perceive as our seasons and our climate. Those changes can result in flash flooding and drought in the same month, and we have never been politically or constitutionally prepared for this.

DEFRA has consistently tried to push that programme despite the fact that its budget has been cut and that it has been undermined by contradictory decisions by other Departments. For example, the decision to build a range of &#163;60,000&nbsp;houses that will be exempt from thermal insulation standards is nonsense.

<br>&nbsp;<br>some outside Parliament and outside this country. I have spoken on other occasions about the work that is being carried out internationally on food security. Over the past 10&nbsp;years or more, there have been phenomenal achievements, particularly by the European Slow Food movement, on internationalising the case for reinvesting in local and sustainable food systems, strengthening food accountability, shortening food miles, reducing the congestion and pollution that result from the long-distance trans-shipment of goods, and reconnecting with the sustainability of the land itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_339">Having registered that point, I want to focus on energy and housing. I have been doing quite a lot to address the questions of how we can recycle water and generate energy for ourselves in our own living situations. However, the more work that I have done on this, the more I have discovered that other people are already way ahead of me. In Berlin, for instance, 75&nbsp;per cent. of all new buildings have solar panels built into their design. Toronto is dealing with the problems of summer heat by removing the air conditioning systems from buildings and replacing them with water cooling systems using water drawn from Lake Ontario. There are some fantastically imaginative schemes building renewable and sustainable energy systems into the way in which people think about how they live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_340">This country has two grounds for claiming to be a global leader. One&#151;perversely for me, as a northerner&#151;is to be found in Woking. Over the past 13&nbsp;years, Woking has moved quietly towards being energy self-sufficient. It now produces 135&nbsp;per cent. of its own energy needs, entirely&#151;I think&#151;from sustainable and renewable sources. Within the next couple of years, it is going out of the national grid because it found that every &#163;1&nbsp;worth of energy that it was putting into the grid was costing &#163;7&nbsp;to &#163;10&nbsp;to claim back out. To understand why that was happening, we have only to look at the national system of energy production. There we discover that 70&nbsp;per cent. of the energy inputs into our energy industry go up in smoke. If we look at any power station, we can see this happening. The national grid transmission system leaks like a sieve. That is not the model that we need for the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_341">In Denmark, 40&nbsp;per cent. of energy supply already comes from local energy systems, and in the Netherlands, the figure is 50&nbsp;per cent. However, world leadership in this regard is to be found here in merry old London, where the Labour loyalist, Ken Livingstone, has pinched the borough engineer from Woking and appointed him as his new climate change adviser, and accepted the challenge to make London energy self-sufficient within a decade. Production will probably come from biodigesters or bioreactors, rather than incinerators, but it will not require a jot of nuclear power. Not one jot. That is because local energy systems can already cope with the energy gap that we fear. We could power this country on the energy that we throw away.

Fourthly, we should make building constructors and developers responsible for 50&nbsp;per cent. of the energy of the buildings that they throw up. I proposed that to a conference of the building supply industry a week ago, and everyone looked at me in horror. However, I pointed out that they were probably smart enough to realise that, if they put in their own energy systems, they could probably meet the whole supply, charge more, and earn more as a result.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), who showed where we can go with a bit of energy, imagination and political leadership in terms of driving forward the sustainable energy agenda. I enjoyed his speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">I want to focus my remarks on the international effort and strategy on this global issue. The question seems to be: where do we invest the finite source of political energy available to tackle this most complex issue, riddled as it is with uncertainties? I detect a change in the wind. I detect it in the remarks of the Prime Minister, and in the initiatives taken by countries in Asia Pacific, Australia and America after the Gleneagles summit. This change reflects a growing realisation that we are on the wrong course&#151;a course to failure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_344">The fruit of the past 15&nbsp;years of political endeavour has been the Kyoto treaty. My hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) said that it is an important milestone, but the closer we look at it, the more limited it appears. It will make a marginal impact on carbon concentration, and its value lies only in demonstrating international co-operation. It was holed below the waterline by the absence of the United States and the emerging giants. It creates no serious incentives for new technology. In the process of negotiation and implementation, the political machine has failed to carry the public with it. Under those circumstances, in the short term, focusing the political machine on trying to follow up that agreement with a new universal agreement on a bigger scale but on the same premise for a greener set of absolute CO <sub>2</sub>  reductions seems highly questionable. It looks very hard to achieve&#151;I do not know what other colleagues felt, but the remarks of the Secretary of State left me with no confidence that an international agreement would be in place by 2012. Were we to pursue that course for another agreement to negotiate absolute CO <sub>2</sub>  reductions, it would be of limited value. Those targets will necessarily be arbitrary, as there is still too much scientific uncertainty as to what a safe level of carbon concentration is, and if they are negotiated on the same basis as Kyoto 1, the targets would be effectively unenforceable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_345">Those who push for this course argue in the cause of taking out an insurance policy against catastrophic risk. It is an attractive theory, but ultimately, who buys an insurance policy that will not give certainty of covering the risk? That uncertainty is undermining the effectiveness of the political process. In terms of international strategy, I would prefer the political machine to focus on creating the conditions that will make universal agreement much more plausible. The priority must be to generate the momentum that has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 391</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been lacking over the past 15&nbsp;years in making a difference to the scenario of emissions, which are growing. The requirement to reduce the uncertainty of the science and economics of climate change has been absent from this debate. A huge amount has been done in the past 15&nbsp;years, but ultimately what comes through to the layman is how little we know. Greater certainty is therefore an absolute priority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_346">The second priority must be to accelerate the deployment and development of low-carbon technology. The good news is that the technology exists that can make a difference, but it is too expensive today. Not only is it right to focus political energy on making this technology cheaper, but it is clearly in the interests of many countries, particularly Britain. As we become an energy importer, energy security becomes increasingly important to this country. A superb and massive commercial opportunity also exists for those countries, and companies in those countries, who can see the potential in renewable technology. President Clinton&#039;s comments in the much-discussed summit in New York were bang-on the money: we will only make a difference when people smell a buck. Those conditions are not sufficiently in place at the moment. The acceleration of low-carbon technology is clearly a win-win for Britain and must be at the heart of any new international initiative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_347">Talking of win-wins, surely it is time for Governments across the world to start picking the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency. It has been sitting on the branches for 20&nbsp;years and every Government during that period have talked about it, yet none have delivered on it. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South mentioned the example of Woking&#039;s Conservative-led council becoming self-sufficient in energy. I encourage the Government to look at what is happening in Braintree, where another Conservative-led council has negotiated an agreement with British Gas, whereby it will offer council tax payers real money for taking on board an energy efficiency package. The early data suggest that the public are responding, and there are signs of a real breakthrough. Consumer apathy towards such a proposition is breaking down, and I hope that the Government will look closely at that example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_348">As my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey pointed out, the short-term priority is the industrialisation of China, Brazil and India. The carbon intensity of that process must be minimised. Doing so is in our interests not least because of the need to deal with carbon concentrations and to reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. However, there is also a superb commercial opportunity for those companies that can seize that initiative in all our interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">European Governments in particular should seize the opportunity to develop the emissions trading mechanism by giving it serious teeth. In looking at the first round of negotiations, most commentators see all the mechanism&#039;s failings. It is diluted and weak, has no teeth, does not deal with aviation and operates within very restricted sectors. There is an opportunity in Europe to develop an emissions trading scheme with teeth that can be pointed to as a global template. That is where political energy should be focused.

<br>&nbsp;<br>interesting and constructive speech. Does he agree that the European Union has a good record, in that it is among the leaders in trying to address climate change through specific, Europe-wide policies? Does he further agree that there is a lot of merit in the proposed mandatory Europe-wide renewable energy targets, which would encourage a Europe-wide growth of renewable energy?

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="51012-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hurd: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and it is undoubtedly true that Europe&#039;s achievements in progressing environmental regulation are impressive. In fact, the linchpin for Europe in terms the challenge and the opportunity that it faces in redefining its relevance to the new generation&#151;the generation who must pay for such things&#151;is greater co-operation on environmental policy. I also agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comment about the need for greater co-operation in developing renewable energy policy across Europe. I have mentioned the need to accelerate technology, and Governments can help in that regard by increasing the size of the markets available to those developing such technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">On the question of where political energy should be focused in the short term, there is an urgent need for one country to stand up, to promote itself as a role model and to show that emissions can be significantly reduced at an acceptable cost. Britain had that opportunity, and I say &quot;had&quot; because I believe that it is in danger of losing it. We can argue in an utterly useless way about the motivation behind the &quot;dash for gas&quot;, but the reality is that it created the platform for a developed economy that is capable of reducing emissions at a very low economic cost. My charge against the Government is that they are in danger of failing that test. That is why I support the proposition of my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) that at the heart of such failure is a lack of accountability and the distant nature of the targets. I therefore wholly endorse the introduction of an independent voice into this process, so that teeth can be given to such accountability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">Finally, I am conscious in focusing the political machine away from Kyoto 2&nbsp;that it would be better if all such activity took place within the framework of a set of targets. The imperative here is for Governments to send long-term signals to the market, but we have to face the fact that pushing this global meeting towards agreement on absolute CO <sub>2</sub>  reductions will be extremely hard. As an alternative to &quot;contract and converge&quot; and the various other scenarios that, in essence, still push the debate down that channel, I suggest that we investigate the feasibility and attractiveness of viewing carbon intensity as a proportion of GDP. That might be a more acceptable benchmark for the United States and the emerging giants. Many who are pressing for absolute CO <sub>2</sub>  reductions will view that as a cop-out, but I would argue that the priority is to get some momentum behind the process of lowering the carbon intensity of economic development. In that context, focusing all our energy on pressing for absolute CO <sub>2</sub>  reductions and for replications of Kyoto seem to me to carry huge opportunity costs.

We are entitled to expect some more positive proposals when he next speaks on the issue, and I am sure that he will introduce some specific proposals then.

Members as well as me will welcome the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, which has brought together development, climate and environmental non-governmental organisations in a campaign to develop the sort of public pressure on climate change that was so effective in the run-up to the G8. The coalition is important because it allows the possibility of bringing international pressure on Governments across the world. If we saw such an international coalition developing, we might be surprised at what could be achieved at an international level. We should certainly set the highest possible targets for international agreement on action to tackle climate change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_356">I want to make three specific points about the sort of steps that we can take here and now in the UK in order to play our part both in bringing about an international response and in responding to public demand for action on these issues.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_357">First, the immense programme of house building resulting from Government policy and market demand presents opportunities in the near future. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) that we must use that programme to ensure that new properties have the highest standards of energy efficiency. We must also enable them to generate energy, rather than just consume it; otherwise, we will miss an opportunity to kick-start the market for renewable energy, and particularly for those micro-renewables that have such major potential to contribute to this country&#039;s energy mix.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_358">I hope that we will take that opportunity, which may be unique. It makes sense to do so, regardless of what international agreements may be achieved. People who take advantage of these technologies can save money, as long as the market is grown and bulk demand secured. For people on low income in particular, it makes economic sense to have energy-efficient properties which, where possible, generate their own energy rather than just consume it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_359">Secondly, when the climate change programme review results are known, we must ensure that decisions are taken that set a long-term agenda. Industry and consumers need to have confidence that renewable opportunities both locally and nationally will find a response in Government policy. That must happen, whatever we feel about nuclear power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_360">There is a danger that the current debate could cause uncertainty about the prospects for renewable energy and energy conservation. It is a field with great potential, and we must make sure that clear targets are set for micro-generation, and for the use of renewables at the UK level more generally. In that way, the market and consumers can have confidence that renewable energy production will remain important in the future, and that its role will not diminish. The UK has immense potential when it comes to renewables: we have made a good start, but a lot more needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_361">My final point is relevant to the Government, to Back-Bench Members of all parties, and to the general public, and it is that we must be consistent. There is no point in having the best policies in the world to encourage renewables, energy conservation, recycling, and a more efficient use of energy by business and consumers if they are undermined by policies in other areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South spoke about aviation, and it is clear that the Government must reconsider their policy on airports. However, hon. Members of all parties, as well as local authorities around the country, are always calling for more airports, flights and air travel. That is not consistent with a policy that tries to address the problems of climate change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_362">There is a similar problem with road travel. Today, the call is for policies to tackle climate change and control carbon emissions. Yesterday, there was a call from some Conservative Members&#151;although it could just as easily have come from hon. Members of other parties&#151;for more roads to be built in their particular localities. We must accept that we cannot allow ourselves to be accused of double-talk: we cannot call for tough measures to tackle climate change and carbon emissions and at the same time promote policies in our own areas that offer short-term political advantage, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 395</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when in our heart of hearts we know that such policies will have an opposite effect on carbon emissions and climate change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_363">As politicians, it is our duty to act and speak consistently on this matter. I am not making a party-political point, but as I said at the start of my contribution, the public expect more of us now. They will not accept a failure on our part to follow through on our commitments on these issues. It is time for us to take practical action on specific policies and respond to growing public demand. I therefore hope that we can secure consensus on the need for appropriate policies, and on action as well.

 I am delighted to follow some eloquent speakers whose knowledge and expertise so far outweigh my own. I am also delighted that the Opposition chose to debate this issue because, unlike some of the more pessimistic Members in the Chamber this evening, I can say that many of my constituents are highly concerned about the issue, which was raised with me during the election campaign by a number of people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_364">I am also delighted that the Opposition chose to debate climate change because, as we have heard, the environment is not an issue traditionally associated with the Conservative party. Regardless, for example, of whether the dash for gas had only a serendipitous effect on carbon emissions or whether it was deliberate, it has always been true that the Conservative party has been extremely effective at a local level in conserving the environment. Any campaign to preserve a local wood or green space tends to be packed with Conservative activists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_365">The environment is not and never should be the exclusive territory of the left, and a striking feature of today&#039;s debate is the call for all parties to make this a priority. Clearly we will have significant distinctions on the way we address the issue, most notably on nuclear energy, but one thing that must unite us is that we cannot go on like this; something has to change and we must work together to drive the issue up the political agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_366">I believe that Conservative and centre right parties have demonstrated that they have always had the knack for working with the grain of human nature and for achieving policy goals in a way that is in tune with how people think and live, rather than forcing top-down centralised plans on an unwilling public. We need that kind of inventiveness in this area as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_367">In line with other speakers, I should like to see the Government subjected to more control, scrutiny and accountability on reducing carbon emissions. By contrast, I should like to see consumers given more incentives and encouragement to reduce carbon emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_368">At the heart of what the Opposition are arguing for this evening are institutional changes to deal with a key problem, in that effective measures to tackle climate change yield rewards only in the very long term, yet the pain caused by such changes and effective measures is immediate. The way the political system operates militates against effective action on climate change for precisely that reason.

<a name="stpa_369">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) advocates the idea that, essentially, Government action on climate change that is effective should be recognised and rewarded and that Government failure on climate change should be exposed and punished, to build genuine accountability into the system. We have heard a number of ways in which this can be done, in particular the establishment of an independent body, which is crucial. I am surprised that so many Labour Members who spoke at length about the lack of progress and their concerns on climate change cannot support such an obviously positive goal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_370">Driving energy issues up the agenda in every single Department of State is also crucial. There is no point in having an environmental policy that comes solely from DEFRA; we have to strengthen the hand of the environmental departments so that environmental issues are covered right across the Government, particularly transport and industry. We must encourage consumers to take action, bring consumers with us in tackling climate change, and encourage consumers to reduce their carbon emissions, in particular by focusing on energy efficiency.

Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker). I hope that the Government will take that initiative seriously, not only in their response to the debate tonight, but in the months and weeks ahead. At best, it provides the opportunity for the Government&#151;and opposition parties&#151;to be more courageous in some of the more difficult decisions needed.

<a name="stpa_372">Although we talk about how the public are beginning to understand better the imperative to tackle climate change, we are still a long way from getting the message across about the priority of taking effective action.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_373">When I talk to climate experts at the University of East Anglia, they tell of their fear that we are already too late to take effective action, but that is no reason for not trying. I want the political parties to lead public opinion on the issue. It is difficult to establish a link in the public&#039;s mind between what they hear about global warming and the actual effects on their lives. We hear of extreme events, such as Boscastle a couple of years ago and the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, but there is no irrefutable proof that they were caused by global warming, although they probably were. However, we have examples in this country of real proof of the impact that global warming will have on us&#151;the impact will of course be much greater in countries such as Bangladesh, where the potential loss of life is horrific&#151;and evidence is building in my county of Norfolk of real potential damage. Experts say that sea levels could rise by 1&nbsp;ft&#151;with apologies for using the old currency&#151;in the next

<p>
<a name="51012-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_374">In 1953, 300&nbsp;people lost their lives in the east of England, but 8,100&nbsp;people drowned in Holland. At that time, global warming had not had an impact, but rises in the sea level of 1&nbsp;ft and an increased incidence of extreme events, such as storm surges, could lead to a devastating impact on the broads area, causing loss of lives, homes and livelihoods. We are on the front line of the impact of global warming and it is therefore essential for the Government to address the issue of sea defences, so that we can prepare for the future, and essential for us all to tackle the imperative of climate change.

 I recognise the hon.

<a name="stpa_375">Finally, I wish to mention a worthwhile initiative by Greenpeace. Hon. Members have mentioned the horrendous inefficiency of the national power grid system. Greenpeace is advocating a much stronger focus on localised power generation, such as the initiatives in Braintree, Woking and other places. A move towards much more efficient power generation locally is one element of a new system of energy generation that will start to tackle this really serious problem.

In June, the Government announced that they would invest &#163;25&nbsp;million in carbon capture and storage schemes. The cost of creating carbon capture and storage models in the North sea could be as low as &#163;40&nbsp;million, so why cannot the Government add an extra &#163;15&nbsp;million from their &#163;800&nbsp;million to achieve that?

CO <sub>2</sub>  reduction target by 2010&nbsp;in their manifestos. The Labour party was the only party to do so. That is fine; I welcome the conversion. I accept that the right hon. Gentleman is sincere in taking the issue seriously. My fear, however&#151;I hope that I am wrong&#151;is that he has not achieved a consensus in his own party. He may seek a consensus across parties, but the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said in an interview recently:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;The fashionable media have decided that climate change is one of the biggest challenges to mankind. But they ignore the fact that the earth has lived through hotter times than today.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_399">I therefore ask whether the right hon. Member for West Dorset has a job in his own party to reach the consensus that he needs to accomplish before he tries to achieve a consensus on both sides of the House. We would feel easier about his admirable desire if he could achieve that first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_400">The hon. Member for Lewes was also generous in his tributes to what the Government have achieved. I think that he would agree that our policies have a lot in common, although it is important to highlight a couple of issues on which we do not agree, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did in reply to his letter. We do not think that talking about imposing emissions reductions on developing countries, especially India and China, is a sensible negotiating position, so we can be honest in disagreeing with him about that. Additionally, advocating a specific proposal for the shape of a future 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 402</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>climate change agreement after Kyoto would not be a sensible negotiating position at this stage, as my right hon. Friend said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_401">Apart from the independent body, which my right hon. Friend talked about in her speech, the one thing on which the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats seemed to be able to agree was the annual obligation or target&#151;whatever one wants to call it. The problem with an annual obligation, apart from the fact that it is suggested by two parties that until recently did not want to commit even to an obligation by 2010, is that it would leave no room to take account of the effect of short-term fluctuations in the global economy or the price of certain fuels. For example, what would happen in the event of the situation that occurred over the past two years when more coal was burned because of the price of gas, which created a problem with our short-term CO <sub>2</sub>  targets? The hon. Member for Lewes and the right hon. Member for West Dorset do not explain how an annual obligation would help us to cope with such situations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_402">I am slightly confused about the consensus that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats envisage. I did not think that the hon. Member for Lewes was clear about whether he was advocating an agreement, or an exchange of views. If he was advocating an agreement, it would be incredibly difficult to achieve. For example, I look forward to the day when the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will be able to agree on the future of nuclear energy. If he was advocating an exchange of views, we can have that. We have been having such an exchange for the past three and a half hours and it has been an extremely interesting, instructive and educative experience.

<p><a name="st_250"><a name="51012-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to clarify his position.
</p>








<p><a name="st_251"><a name="51012-34_spnew4"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 I am happy to do so. I want an agreement, but I said that we should have a solid foundation on which we could agree, and perhaps even an additional couple of storeys, but that we could each have our individual structures above that&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> No, this is serious. Let us maximise what we can agree on, rather than picking out differences.
</p>








<p><a name="st_252"><a name="51012-34_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The right hon. Member for West Dorset was slightly more candid when he acknowledged&#151;I think&#151;that he did not really expect us to accept his offer at least until he was ready to come up with proposals, after he was frank enough to admit that he did not actually have any proposals at this stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_403">Although I am a natural consensualist, I am slightly cautious of the prospect of trying to reach consensus while the Conservative party is in the throes of a leadership election, the outcome of which we do not know. We do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman will still be in charge of its climate change policy after that election, although I hope that he will be for the reasons that I outlined earlier. I certainly hope that his man and wing of the party wins the election so that we might maintain the consensus that we have built over the past few weeks. The hon. Member for Lewes said that we needed to reach out in a fog, but I assumed that the fog to which he was referring was the Liberal Democrat policy review.

<a name="51012-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_404">It is not realistic for us to achieve the sort of consensus that the hon. Member for Lewes and the right hon. Member for West Dorset envisage until both the Liberal Democrat policy review and the Conservative leadership election are out of the way. At that time, we might be able to do so. The door is open for this great idea, so I hope that we will be able to make progress when both those issues are resolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_405">I take the offer at face value and think that it is an interesting and constructive idea. I welcome both it and the fact that the House is debating one of the most important issues that face mankind in such a constructive and consensual way. However, if the Opposition parties are serious about a consensus, they should take up the constructive suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle and not press the motion to a vote.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="51012-36_spnew0"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore) (Lab):</b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his time today in a series of coal-related debates&#151;not for nothing is he called the Energy Minister, given all his running around. I also pay tribute to other coal-mining MPs who this morning responded to the call by my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) for a good one-and-a-half-hour debate on the future of the coal industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_411">The names Wyndham, Deep Navigation, Abernant, Garw Ffaldau, Marine, Merthyr Vale, Britannia and Six Bells are all ghosts from the very recent past in Wales&#151;they are some of our most famous deep pits. For many people it is like reading the obituary column in the local paper and seeing the names of friends who have gone. Only one of all the deep mines in Wales is now left. That is to the credit of a singular group of people in Tower colliery who, against the odds&#151;against the Government and the management of the day&#151;defied advice and literally carved a success story out of the Welsh hills. I applaud my hon. Friend the Minister for announcing this morning the additional phase 2&nbsp;funding of &#163;832,000, which will go down very well in the constituency of Cynon Valley. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) has campaigned long and hard on behalf of the Tower colliers and their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_412">What if the rumours of the death of deep mining in Wales and the UK are greatly exaggerated? As the Minister knows, the long list of defunct pits that I read out have a common feature in that they are also a list of the workable coal reserves in south Wales&#151;250&nbsp;million tonnes of potentially workable coal reserves. Add to that the current energy challenges faced in the UK, mix in the proven and still developing capabilities of clean coal technology, and all of a sudden we have the ingredients for a future for coal. The same ingredients could be mixed throughout the United Kingdom&#039;s coalfields. Wyndham-Western, Deep Navigation, Abernant, Garw-Ffaldau, Britannia, Six Bells&#151;that is not an obituary. Those pits can be used to revitalise UK energy policy. High-quality coal reserves can help our energy needs and our energy security and help UK plc to develop a leading edge in clean-coal technology.
</p>








<p><a name="st_256"><a name="51012-36_spnew1"><b> John Robertson  (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that we should support companies such as Babcock and Wilcox, which are at the leading edge of new technology for clean coal?
</p>








<p><a name="st_257"><a name="51012-36_spnew2"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I agree entirely. I will deal with Babcock and other technologies shortly, because they point the way forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_413">In south Wales, 250&nbsp;million tonnes of reserves were identified back in 1979. The rapid and brutal pit closure programme meant that only 20&nbsp;million tonnes have been mined. Modern mining techniques and global energy changes make the reserves more viable and they could provide power for more than 50&nbsp;years.

 I empathise with my hon. Friend but I hope that, especially after this morning&#039;s debate and the Minister&#039;s comments this evening, we will be more optimistic about the way forward for UK Coal. I believe that the challenge exists and that the Government are rising to it. My hon. Friend the Minister will excuse me if I push a little harder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_414">In his speech in Brighton, the Prime Minister talked about nuclear power being back on the agenda. The argument for coal is more clear-cut, compelling and categorical. If only the Prime Minister had asked me to help write his conference speech&#151;I am still available for a small fee&#151;I could have finessed it with a touch of black gold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_415">It is said that surely nobody wants to continue mining nowadays. Yet modern mining methods, including improved ventilation underground, mean that the work and environment are greatly improved. That is essential if we are to avoid or minimise the legacy of respiratory disease and other occupational illnesses.
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51012-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Hamilton  (Midlothian) (Lab):</b> 
 Would that enable the Scottish coal industry, which is non-existent apart from open cast, to consider the possibility of drift mines? I agree wholeheartedly about the new technology but when we talk about UK Coal, we mean English coal and Welsh coal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_261"><a name="51012-36_spnew6"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I agree. The feasibility of all the reserves needs to be considered without favour.
</p>








<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51012-36_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend mentioned Tower in Wales. Its existence is a credit to the mining industry. He also mentioned UK Coal, which is little more than a property company. Does he agree that, when the Government launch their new energy policy, based on opening drift mines in whatever part of Britain, it should be based on an alternative similar to Tower, or perhaps comparable to Network Rail, and that they should not simply hand out money to a property company to shut pits and develop the land?
</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="51012-36_spnew8"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I agree. That point was powerfully and repeatedly made this morning. There is a case for an alternative way forward that is not based on the existing UK Coal because of all its disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_416">What about the ugly tips that have disfigured our valleys and hills? The land is recovering and regaining its natural beauty. Surely no one wants to recreate the industrial wasteland and the scars of industry. Yet, again, with modern mining technology of various types, one can return the waste underground. Advanced landscaping techniques mean that the impact on the environment is minimised and can even be better when the mines have reached the end of their life. The discharge pipes for methane gas are a characteristic feature of many coalfield areas. Yet now methane gas can be harnessed for electricity generation.

 Does my hon. Friend recall that, in the early 1980s, this country led the world in clean coal technology, through the fluidised bed plant at Grimethorpe colliery power station in my constituency? That plant was funded by more than 20&nbsp;countries, including America and Japan. Unfortunately, the facility was closed down by Mrs. Thatcher. Does he agree that this country continues to regret that decision to this day?
</p>








<p><a name="st_265"><a name="51012-36_spnew10"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 Indeed, and I am sure that all Members here will agree that we want to regain that lead in clean coal technology to take us forward through not only the next few years but the next few decades. The export potential is massive, but it will not happen without investment and prioritising clean coal and carbon abatement technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_418">We know that, by 2015, at least half the UK&#039;s coal-fired generation plants will close because they have failed to meet EU emission targets. These older technology plants generate 32&nbsp;per cent. of our electricity needs and as much as 45&nbsp;per cent. at peak times. We talk about nuclear power, but the closures are going to coincide with the decommissioning of the existing old nuclear power stations, which themselves provide one fifth of UK electricity. With the best will in the world, renewable energy and even a resurgence of modern nuclear power will not fill that energy gap. Clean coal technology, based on securely sourced UK coal, is not just desirable but essential if we are to meet our energy needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_419">Energy security is becoming a greater issue in the UK every day, especially as our reliance on overseas supplies grows. The Government&#039;s own figures show that 70&nbsp;per cent. of the UK&#039;s energy needs will be supplied by gas by 2020, and that 90&nbsp;per cent. of that will be imported. That will make the UK extremely vulnerable to disruption of supply and it is vital that we have an indigenous capacity for energy creation from a variety of sources, including renewables, clean coal technology and&#151;well, who knows? I think nuclear power deserves a separate debate all of its own. Let us wait and see.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that short-termism is the biggest enemy of indigenous coal production?

 I entirely agree. We need a portfolio approach and the ability to make long-term decisions, based on the fiscal measures that are in place not just for five years but for 10&nbsp;or 20. The energy suppliers and generators&#151;the people who will invest in this technology&#151;need the security of knowing that they can make those long-term decisions.

<a name="51012-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_420">I am pleased that the DTI has recognised that clean coal and related technologies have a role to play, as have the Welsh Assembly Government. But the Minister must recognise the concern from the National Union of Mineworkers, Amicus, Tower and others that the investment in clean coal technology is less than it should be. There should be more. The USA has led the way in this regard, investing significantly in gasification technology and, to a lesser extent, carbon capture. China has undertaken retrofit programmes on several power plants and is experimenting with gasification. My argument to the Minster is that we have a golden opportunity to develop a UK lead in this market and to export our technology worldwide&#151;I know that he realises this&#151;but it could so easily be missed through under-investment.

<a name="stpa_426">On other aspects of technology, one prime example is conversion or pre-combustion technologies such as gasification&#151;turning coal into a gas or liquid that can be cleaned and used as fuel. That is the cleanest of all coal-based electric power technologies, with lower air emissions, solid wastes and waste water. Moreover, it has far higher efficiency, using less coal to produce the same amount of energy, thereby leading to lower CO <sub>2</sub>  production. Clearly, that is the way forward.

The technology exists. In the US, oil producers are paying electricity producers for their CO <sub>2</sub>  for that very reason, because it helps them pump out more oil from their oilfields. It is a win-win situation, and BP estimates that reservoirs in the North sea have the capacity to store more than 60&nbsp;years of the CO <sub>2</sub>  produced by all the power stations in Europe.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on securing this debate tonight. It is encouraging to have so many hon. Friends behind me, but also slightly scary. It might be an accident of parliamentary timetabling that we have had three debates on energy&#151;two in Westminster Hall and one in the Chamber&#151;as well as the climate change debate today. It is not entirely a coincidence, however, that there is a growing interest in energy policy and futures in the United Kingdom. I note that although the Labour Benches are packed, the new alliance on climate change between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats is clearly taking place elsewhere.

<br>&nbsp;<br>industry. I want first to address his concern about the present and immediate future of the UK coal industry, and then to look further ahead to the exciting potential role that new technologies can play in making coal a part of a low carbon future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_432">Currently, there are three deep mines in south Wales. My hon. Friend spoke about the Tower colliery, which employs 375&nbsp;people and produces some 600,000&nbsp;tonnes of coal per year. I hope to visit that colliery next week. Work is in progress to re-access viable reserves at Energybuild&#039;s Aberpergwm colliery. If this project is successful, the mine should employ some 178&nbsp;people and produce about 300,000&nbsp;tonnes of coal per year by 2008. There is also one surviving micro-mine, which is a two-man operation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_433">Both Tower and Aberpergwm have benefited from coal investment aid. Tower was awarded &#163;2.22&nbsp;million in application period 1, and as my hon. Friend noted, I announced today that it has been awarded a further &#163;842,000&nbsp;in application period 2, making a total of more than &#163;3&nbsp;million. That is a significant sum, and Aberpergwm has also been awarded a total of &#163;3.5&nbsp;million. These awards will help both mines to meet the cost of investing in projects that are supposed to be completed by the end of next March. However, if progress is slower than expected, payments will continue until the award is exhausted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_434">The aim of coal investment aid has been to support investment projects in order to maintain access to viable reserves, and to protect mining employment to 2008. Regrettably, at that point Tower is expected to reach the end of its working life, but we hope that the new mining project will progress according to plan. I am advised that it should continue to produce coal and to contribute to local energy needs until at least 2015.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_435">In addition to these deep mines, south Wales currently has seven working surface mines. They employ some 390&nbsp;people and produced 1.6&nbsp;million tonnes of coal in 2004. Continuing supplies of coal from both deep and surface mines will be essential in maintaining security of energy supply in south Wales for the foreseeable future. They are particularly important to Aberthaw power station, which remains a vital source of electricity for local domestic and industrial consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_436">My hon. Friend listed a number of locations where coal has been worked in the past, and which may still hold viable reserves, whether for deep or surface mining. Recent changes in the international coal market may help to make them more commercially attractive to potential operators, and it would be good to hear of un-worked reserves being brought into production. For that to happen, they would of course need to meet the terms of planning legislation provisions, in order to ensure that the potential environmental impact of coal working can be managed, or offset, to meet the reasonable concerns of local communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_437">I turn now to the future. I share my hon. Friend&#039;s enthusiasm for the opportunities that clean coal technologies could provide in respect of the UK&#039;s energy mix. Of course, this issue is of wider international note. At the recent EU-China summit, an announcement was made about clean coal technology in China. As colleagues know, given the number of coal stations that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 414</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_438">It is clear that if these technologies can become competitive in the UK in the next 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;years, they can contribute successfully to our energy White Paper target of reducing carbon emissions by 60&nbsp;per cent. by 2050. But of course, we must recognise that even if we successfully develop cleaner coal technologies, it does not necessarily follow that we will use British coal exclusively. Today, coal is an internationally traded commodity, and good quality, competitively priced coal is available from abroad. Thus clean coal technologies are not necessarily the saviour of the British, or indeed the Welsh, coal industry, although I would hope that they would be a significant factor in helping our industry. The key is that British coals need to compete effectively with other sources from abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51012-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_439">That said, the key challenge is to develop the technology to deal with the fact that at the moment coal is about twice as polluting as natural gas. How should we go about that? While it should be industry rather than the Government that identifies and brings the most appropriate technologies to market, we also recognise that the Government have an active role to play to stimulate that. That is why I announced back in June the publication of our carbon abatement technology strategy for fossil fuel use. As my hon. Friend mentioned, I also announced a package of some &#163;40&nbsp;million in capital grants for demonstration projects covering carbon abatement technologies, hydrogen and fuel cells. About &#163;25&nbsp;million of that has been specifically allocated to demonstrating carbon abatement technologies.

<a name="stpa_440">Officials in the Department are currently working up this scheme and we expect to be able to announce more details early next year. In the meanwhile, they are taking forward the other activities identified in the carbon abatement technology strategy, such as the development of a technology road map so that we can focus on those technologies that we need to develop for coal and other hydrocarbons to have a sustainable future.

<a name="51012-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_441">It is already clear that a number of technologies can be developed to reduce carbon emissions. The most radical solution is carbon dioxide capture and storage, which can reduce emissions by about 85&nbsp;per cent. For it to be commercially viable, the impact of capture on plant efficiency has to be reduced&#151;as do the costs&#151;we estimate that it will be some 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;years before we reach the point at which they will be commercially viable. That is why we are placing short-term emphasis on improving the efficiency of plant.

<a name="51012-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_442">As well as providing development and demonstration funding, we are also tackling the other barriers blocking the route to market for these technologies. The Chancellor recognised in his Budget statement that CO <sub>2</sub>  capture and storage has the potential to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. As part of the climate change programme review, we are investigating what can be done further to incentivise the take-up of those technologies. We are also working with our European

<br>&nbsp;<br>partners on how to enable CCS to qualify for carbon credits under the emissions trading scheme. All those activities and many more form a work programme that was set out in the carbon abatement technologies strategy&#151;work that I expect to lead to an environment that will enable the technology to become a reality.

<a name="stpa_443">In the North sea, colleagues will note the BP project in the Miller oil field where it is planned to return carbon dioxide back to the North sea fields, enabling more oil to be produced. In addition, there is the BP work in the Salah gas field in Algeria. Around the world, there are bits of technology and good practice that we can draw on. We are very supportive of all those projects, as their success will provide encouragement for similar projects and lay the foundation for the take-up of new, cleaner fossil technologies.

<a name="stpa_444">We have had debates today on coal and energy policy. On a wider note, the House will know that we will shortly be announcing the details of our energy review, as highlighted by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in his speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton. My right hon. Friend has said that he wants energy policy recommendations to be made by next year. That shows his emphasis on energy policy, and the

<br>&nbsp;<br>urgency that he attaches to a range of issues to do with climate change, geopolitical developments, energy supply and other matters.

<a name="51012-37_para25">
<a name="stpa_445">In addition, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has announced a review of fiscal measures relating to climate change, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also initiated a climate change review that will report by the end of the year. That shows that we have in place&#151;or will have in place very soon&#151;the necessary analysis and research that will enable us to think through a variety of difficult issues. That will help us to fulfil our aim of relating our concerns about the planet and climate change&#151;surely the ultimate public good&#151;to our concerns about energy supply, and to the social policy aspects of matters such as fuel poverty.

<a name="51012-37_para26">
<a name="stpa_446">Within that review process, we must of course look at the future of coal. Therefore, the House will have every opportunity to debate issues that are vital to the people of Wales, Scotland and England, and to the future of energy policy in the UK.
