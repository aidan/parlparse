In the new package, the rules requiring that the qualifications that people get must be both full and their first will be relaxed, so SMEs will be able to get the bite-sized chunks of training that are proven to increase productivity.

 I make two points. First, on adult skills, the transition from the Learning and Skills Council to the skills funding agency will result in greater freedom and responsibility for the professional leadership of colleges in the delivery of adult skills. On the 16-to-19 group, colleges are not coming under the administration of local authorities, but they are expected, and will be encouraged, to work strategically with schools and other providers to make sure that 14 to 19-year-olds get a proper range of choices in qualifications through the education system. That is particularly important as we move towards the raising of the participation age. We also want to tackle that group of young people who currently come through education without getting qualifications that enable them to succeed in work.</p>

 Last Saturday, I went to the annual higher education awards ceremony at Bristol cathedral for students who have obtained foundation degrees or completed other degree programmes at the City of Bristol FE college. A great cross-section of the entire Greater Bristol community was present; all social groups and ethnicities were represented. However, unlike those students&#146; counterparts just 500 m up the hill who study full-time at Bristol university, the students who attended will not have had access to maintenance or fee loans, and would have had a paltry student grant. When will the Government finally act to remove all those absurd anomalies, so that we can make sure that we widen participation in higher education and get more people trained in a fast-changing economy?</p>

 The ability of young people, particularly those who have gained vocational qualifications, to continue to a higher level with foundation degrees is an important part of our education system, and one that I would like to see expanded in future, because it is a route to higher-level skills that we need to develop. As I have previously acknowledged at this Dispatch Box, there are issues to do with the funding of part-time and full-time students in higher education, and we have said that we will look into them when we consider the financing of higher education next year.</p>

 We have rescued and expanded apprenticeships. Apprenticeships are now well on the way to taking their rightful place as a mainstream option for young people. On Tuesday, I published our spending plans for 2009-10, and I am pleased to say that total Government investment for apprenticeships will increase to more than &#163;1 billion. We are introducing a new entitlement to an apprenticeship place for all suitably qualified young people who wish to take up an apprenticeship, and we are working with employers to expand the number of places on offer.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely correct: progress is being made. If we look at the local authority in my constituency, we see that in the past three years there has been a nearly 200 per cent. increase in the number of young people taking up apprenticeships. However, that hides a problem relating to employers&#146; willingness to undertake apprenticeships, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises. What more can my right hon. Friend do to encourage employers, particularly in that sector, to take up apprenticeships as a way of improving the productivity of their businesses?</p>

 I should say that we are continuing to increase the number of apprenticeship starts, including starts among smaller employers, so many small employers do find apprenticeships valuable and are willing to support and advocate them. However, we are also keen to see support for group training associations, whereby employers come together to undertake the central administration and development of apprenticeship schemes. It can take some of the responsibility for administration off the individual smaller employer, and we wish to see more of it.</p>

 The Secretary of State will agree that the target of 400,000 apprenticeships by 2020 is very ambitious. As the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) suggested, at present only one in 10 companies has become involved in the apprenticeship scheme&#151;and did so when the country was in a boom. What is the Secretary of State doing specifically to encourage companies, which are going into a recession, to engage with apprenticeships? What will he do if he cannot maintain the offer of two apprenticeship places for every 16 to 18-year-old, which he believes will be possible by 2012 to 2015?</p>

 First, we are maintaining our investment in the apprenticeship system. That is absolutely essential; it is one of the ways in which we as a Government can show that we are on the side of hard-working families and businesses in these difficult times. The more that we do that, and the more that we take the necessary measures, the more quickly we will come through the current problems.</p>

Gentleman mentioned, I should say that I am confident that we will have the number of apprenticeships across our economy to meet our targets. We will work with private sector employers, but we must also expand significantly the number of public-sector traineeships, and we will do so. At the moment, the public sector employs disproportionately few apprentices, given its size in the economy.</p>

The apprentice in my office is already proving himself a great deal better than a novice, and I am not talking about my hon.

 As my right hon. Friend knows, it will be small companies in particular that get us out of this recession. Last week, I was pleased to visit Preci-Spark Ltd, a large engineering company in my constituency which has always invested in apprenticeships. It will continue to do so. Building on what he has said, what can my right hon. Friend do further to encourage the sector to continue to invest? The company realises that it will probably lose its employees to other people, but a philanthropic attitude is involved and it knows that it will also gain from elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="81120-0002.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000075">Will my right hon. Friend go further and ensure that, unlike during the Tory recessions&#151;when I worked in the sector and apprenticeships were the first thing to go&#151;we invest more in apprenticeships at this crucial time? In that way, when we come out of recession, we will have a skilled work force ready to build on the success that will come when the economy grows again.</p>

 It is essential that we maintain the investment in apprenticeships; indeed, we are increasing it to more than &#163;1 billion. We must also continue to push the message that we have stripped out a great deal of the bureaucracy and other difficulties that have put people off in the past. Another key thing is to make sure that the message gets across clearly to employers in two ways. The first is contrary to what some employers feel: companies that invest in apprentices are more likely to keep their staff, because people repay the investment made in them by a good employer. Secondly, the evidence from the last recession was that companies that invested in training were two and a half times more likely to come through successfully. We are working with major national employers, smaller employers and organisations such as the Federation of Small Businesses to get the message across that this is the time to maintain investment in skills.</p>

 I am tempted to say that the Secretary of State&#146;s apprentice is scrubbing up very nicely. Does the Secretary of State agree that the word &#147;apprentice&#148; covers a multitude of things? How many of the young people who will receive apprenticeships will have the rigorous training of true craft apprenticeships?</p>

 At the heart of the apprenticeship model is the fact that a key part of the person&#146;s training takes place while they are employed and at work. That is the central, defining aspect of an apprenticeship. We have made it clear that we are taking out of the system anything that does not fit that crucial employment relationship during the apprenticeship.</p>

For many years, large supermarkets have offered craft apprenticeships in the bakery section, and apprentices learn the full range of skills to level 3 and beyond. However, the apprenticeship model can work just as well for somebody studying to level 2 in retail management. My commitment is to offer support to employers to ensure that they have the right apprenticeships for their company, trade and training needs. That will produce a mixture of those that are at an advanced and a craft level and those that are at a lower level but none the less provide a crucial stepping stone for the young person involved and a valuable skill for the employer.</p>

She is right, too, that the direction in which we need to take further education, and the way in which we need to develop it, is to make it more responsive to the demands and requirements of employers and business.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is absolutely right. He is a great champion of apprenticeships and further education in his constituency, and he is right to say that the Government have introduced measures, such as the construction matching service, which helps to find new places quickly for construction industry apprentices who lose their jobs. When the national apprenticeship service comes in, we will look at developing such services more broadly across the whole economy. However, I counsel him not to despair about the situation too quickly. All the early evidence shows that large numbers of apprenticeships have not gone by the board so far because, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said earlier, high-quality businesses that are running high-quality apprenticeship schemes understand how important they are to their future.

Two thirds of students will get a full or partial grant. More students will get a full grant than I anticipated a year and a half ago.

There is a bit of a flip-flop by those on the Liberal Democrat Benches, as indeed there is by those on the Conservative Benches.

How the bursary system has operated will be looked at in the independent review of the way in which the fee system operates. I am reluctant at this stage to say that we should go from a system of locally determined bursaries to a national bursary system, which would simply be an extension of student financial support.

 I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business. This morning, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier), issued a written statement saying that the Home Office will tomorrow publish a consultation paper on draft secondary legislation under the Identity cards Act 2006. That will include a draft code of practice on civil penalties; in other words, enforcement measures. This is a significant document, but it will not be available in the Library of the House for Members until tomorrow when the House will not be sitting.

The firm had been appointed despite a track record of failure in America. Now, three months into the academic year, thousands of students are still waiting for their education maintenance allowance, and yesterday the Children&#146;s Secretary was forced to sack Liberata, the company responsible for the delays, yet that firm was also appointed despite a well-publicised record of failure and having been described by the Financial Services Authority as reckless and inadequate. May we have a debate in Government time on the inept failure of this Department in handling major contracts? May we also have a Government statement on why the Department refused to put a Minister on &#147;Newsnight&#148; last night to discuss this issue? In fact, there was a Cabinet Minister on the programme last night&#151;the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government&#151;but what was she discussing? The exit of John Sergeant from &#147;Strictly Come Dancing&#148;. Does that not say a lot about this Government?

Fewer than half of violent crimes committed each year are solved by the police, partly because officers are tied up with bureaucracy and are pressured to solve minor crimes to achieve targets. Today, the Public Accounts Committee has said that victims of violent crime are not claiming compensation because of excessive bureaucracy and complex forms, so not only do victims fail to see perpetrators being caught, but they also miss out on the compensation to which they are entitled.</p>

Lady mentioned the importance of ensuring that finance is made available through the financial services industry to home owners and small businesses. She is absolutely right that the focus of our priorities is to back-up the economy with Government action, and I hope she will back what is necessary, which is fiscal action to make sure we do not simply stand by and say, &#147;We&#146;re not going to do anything about this. We&#146;re not going to take any action. We&#146;re not going to capitalise the banks. We&#146;re not going to ensure credit lines to small businesses.&#148; We think that is unacceptable. We have already taken action: we have recapitalised the banks; we have seen interest rates fall; we have taken co-ordinated international action; and, as I have just announced, we will have the pre-Budget report on Monday.

I hope that she will also back the Government on the increased support that we are putting into the EMA to help young people continue their studies and not be deterred by financial means. I hope that she will also back the additional support that we are offering to students across the board in higher and further education and to young people in general, so that all young people under the age of 18 are in continuing education or training.</p>

However, I cannot help noticing that sometimes the people who complain&#151;rightly, as I would see it&#151;about failures in the compensation of victims of crime are also those who sometimes complain about the compensation culture. Let us hope that they are on our side on this matter.

May I support that specifically by asking that we have the opportunity, in that context, to debate national housing issues? The recent figures show that the number of planning applications for housing has fallen by 68 per cent. on a year ago and that almost half of the 21,000 low-cost homes built in the past year by housing associations remain unsold. We all understand the huge pressures on many families and on other constituents.

Secondly, of the last recommendations that were made, 15 were accepted by the Treasury, but only a third have been implemented. That really is not good enough. We all agree that we are concerned about victims of crime, so can we please ensure that we address how victims&#151;the majority of whom do not apply for compensation&#151;can be told about the system?

The key point is that instead of everyone, including Members of Parliament, knowing the contents of the legislative programme only when it is announced in the Queen&#146;s Speech, it is published in draft form so that voluntary organisations, interest groups, MPs and the public can see what is planned. That is the main reason for the consultation. Obviously, reporting back on the specific responses to the draft legislative programme is important. That will happen around the time of the Queen&#146;s Speech or shortly afterwards. Of course, that is in addition to the specific consultation in which Departments will have engaged in respect of particular Bills. There is no attempt to sweep responses from the public under the carpet, but as the hon. Gentleman is interested in the matter, I will find out when those responses will be published.</p>

May we have that early debate?</p>

 I am sure that everybody will have taken note of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. As one hon. Member said earlier this week, it is an important time for everyone, including different countries, to pull together, to ensure that the impact of the global economic downturn in this country is as short and as shallow as we would all wish.</p>

 May we have a debate on the future of the British manufacturing industry? My right hon. and learned Friend will be aware that Rolls-Royce has today announced 2,000 redundancies worldwide, including a significant number in this country. I must tell her, in the nicest possible way, that there is a school of thought among those in the manufacturing industry, including both employers and employees, that the House does not give priority to manufacturing when compared with other things. That has been crystallised today by the Leader of the Opposition, who is more interested in John Sergeant and who is drinking cups of coffee.</p>

 My hon. Friend is a long-standing champion of manufacturing industry, in Scotland and throughout this country. He has raised the question of Rolls-Royce job losses, which are very worrying indeed. This is an important British company, and 4 per cent. of its work force in this country will be affected. Once again, this shows the importance of Government action to support investment, apprenticeships and training, and of Government action through the regional development agencies. This is not the moment to stand back and say that there is nothing we can do. This is the moment for us to step forward and to recognise the importance not only of small businesses but of our big manufacturing companies, and for the Government to back them up.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081124/corrtext/81124c0001.htm#column_7MC"><i> [Official Report, 24 November 2008, Vol. 483, c. 7MC.]</i></a></p>

 I seek the assistance of the Leader of the House regarding the efficiency of ministerial correspondence and response rates. I say this following the remarks made by the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), on local radio on 14 October. When talking about upper gastro-intestinal cancer surgery at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust, he said that &#147;twice as many people&#148; were &#147;dying unnecessarily&#148; at the hospital. That has caused deep offence to the clinicians and staff there. Patient groups, the trust and I wrote immediately to the Minister asking him either to provide evidence for his claim or to apologise, but we have received no response whatever. Will the Leader of the House use whatever influence she has to expedite a response?</p>

 I will look into the question of ministerial correspondence that the hon. Gentleman has raised, but I would also say, in respect of the stance taken by my hon. Friend the Minister, that he was making what I think is a very important point. That is that the outcomes for those suffering from gastro-intestinal problems are very much dependent on specialisation and expertise, and we obviously want services to be accessible to people as locally as possible. However, we must also keep a close eye on what is the best outcome for patients, especially those who are suffering from cancer. My hon. Friend the Minister was engaging in a big  <br>

 Twice in the past 18 years&#151;in Bosnia and in Rwanda&#151;western Governments have been reluctant to intervene in ethnic conflicts that subsequently escalated into genocide. This month, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is on the brink of another civil war, only two years after its presidential election, following 10 years of civil war and 35 years of dictatorship. The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence will shortly have to decide on our Government&#146;s position regarding providing further assistance to the Government in the DRC. May I suggest that we have a debate on this matter, so that the whole House can consider the arguments for and against increasing our involvement, and that of our European partners, in the eastern DRC, to ensure that the present conflict does not escalate into total civil war and genocide?</p>

 Can the Leader of the House tell us whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government will accept the strongly worded recommendation from the European Parliament earlier this year that piracy be treated as a criminal offence rather than an act of war? The effect of doing that would be to require our armed forces to risk their lives trying to capture pirates&#151;who might then, in some circumstances, be able to claim asylum&#151;rather than simply blowing them out of the water, as the Indian navy has just done.</p>

 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the actions that I have taken over the past week, since I received last Wednesday morning the serious case review of the tragic death of baby P.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08112042000213">As I said to the House on Monday, the whole nation has been deeply shocked, appalled and angered by the terrible suffering that this little boy endured. Since the jury reached its decision on 11 November, we have all read of the abuse that he suffered at the hands of adults that he lived with. That is something that I think we all struggle to comprehend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000214">The case has also raised serious questions of public concern about how such a thing could have happened again, despite numerous contacts with social workers, police and health professionals&#151;and in Haringey, too, the same borough where Victoria Climbi&#233; died eight years ago. We need to know what actions are urgently needed in Haringey to ensure the safety of other vulnerable children in that borough and proper accountability for what went wrong, and what further steps are needed to ensure that all children are safe across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08112042000215">It is our collective duty to do what we can to prevent such a tragedy happening again, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) and to other Opposition Members for the support that they have given me over the past eight days for the actions that we have so far taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08112042000216">Let me start by setting out the background. Following the death of baby P on 3 August 2007, and consistent with the statutory requirements set out in &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148;, a serious case review started immediately to discover what happened and why. Serious case reviews are carried out whenever a child dies and abuse or neglect is known or suspected to have been a factor. They are instigated by the local safeguarding children board, which is independent of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para6"><a name="08112042000217">The report should be independently authored. Local agencies should implement any interim lessons immediately, while the serious case review is still in progress, and working drafts of serious case reviews may be shared with Government officials. Since April last year, Ofsted has evaluated each serious case review to help to strengthen the system. However, in all cases, Ministers are not involved in any part of the process of undertaking and completing the serious case review and do not see draft reports. In this case, the executive summary of the serious case review was published on the afternoon of 11 November, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families and I received the full confidential report on the morning of 12 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08112042000218">Having studied it, we concluded that there was clear evidence that agencies had failed, singly and collectively, to adhere to the statutory procedures for the proper management of child protection cases. This raised serious concerns about the wider systems and management of services for safeguarding children in the borough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08112042000219">Our immediate priority was to ensure the safety of children in Haringey, so, that afternoon, we arranged for the director of children's services in Hampshire,  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000220">At the same time, I decided that Ofsted, the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection and the chief inspector of constabulary should carry out an urgent inspection in Haringey under section 20(1)(b) of the Children Act 2004. In particular, I asked the inspectors to look closely at the quality of practice and management of all services that contribute to the effective safeguarding of children in Haringey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000221">The work of the national inspectors is under way, and I will receive a first report by 1 December. As soon as I have studied their findings, I will publish their report and the actions that we will then take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000222">This tragic case also raises wider issues about child safety. It is now just over five years since we published Every Child Matters in response to the Victoria Climbi&#233; inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming. Both the joint chief inspectors earlier this year and Lord Laming himself have said that these reforms have significantly strengthened the framework for safeguarding children, and in local areas across the country there is much good work being done that is keeping children safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000223">However, as the joint chief inspectors also said in their July report, there is still much work to do to ensure that the reforms are being implemented systematically by all local agencies, so that children in every part of the country receive the protection that they need&#151;a view that was repeated and reinforced yesterday in Ofsted&#146;s annual report. That was why we began a stocktake of local safeguarding children boards last month, including their governance and accountability arrangements, the independence of local safeguarding children board chairs and whether the statutory guidance needs to be revised. At the same time, we also started work to establish what more can be done to improve the quality, consistency and impact of serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para13"><a name="08112042000224">As I explained to the House on Monday, and immediately following the legal verdict on 11 November, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families and I asked Lord Laming to provide us with an urgent report of progress made across the country in implementing effective arrangements for keeping children safe. In parallel, we have also set out legislative proposals to improve children&#146;s trusts that will provide stronger area-wide accountability for the well-being and safety of children across all children&#146;s services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para14"><a name="08112042000225">I met Lord Laming on Monday to agree the scope of his report, which will be ready early in the new year. He will report on the key features of good safeguarding practice and whether they are being universally applied across the country, including the development of the professional work force, inter-agency working and effective systems of public accountability. He will also look at the key barriers, including in the legal process, that may be impeding children&#146;s professionals in their work and stopping good practice becoming common practice&#151;including whether the right balance is being struck between the correct application of processes when taking a child into care and the needs of the child.

Indeed, I thank him for so speedily ordering an independent inquiry into Haringey council. But would he now acknowledge that the inspection regime that was supposed to monitor child protection in Haringey was flawed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="81120-0005.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000233">We know that when a former social worker rang the alarm bell six months before baby P died, her concerns were passed on, in accordance with the procedures in place, to the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The commission met representatives from Haringey in March 2007 and asked for improvements to be made. Two weeks later, responsibility for inspecting Haringey&#146;s children&#146;s services passed from the commission to Ofsted, and there is no evidence yet that Ofsted or anyone else pursued the demand that Haringey improve its child protection. Does the Secretary of State agree with me that that was wrong, and does he share my concern that other child protection cases may have slipped through the cracks in that handover?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08112042000234">We know that Ofsted inspected Haringey&#146;s children&#146;s services department in October 2007 and gave it a three-star rating, saying that it provided a good service for children. We also know that that report was based on desk research and was conducted by an inspector who had served as an official under Haringey&#146;s director of children&#146;s services. The inspector was, in fact, a former head of school standards in Haringey. Does the Secretary of State agree with me that that was wrong? Given the importance of getting child protection right in Haringey, should not a totally independent person have been appointed to conduct that inspection?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08112042000235">The Secretary of State has rightly insisted on urgency in the current inquiry into Haringey, and one of the principal issues at question is the threshold for taking a child at risk into care. We know that medical professionals believed in December 2006 that baby P had suffered non-accidental harm, and we know that in June 2007, medical professionals warned that baby P had probably been physically abused. The police were anxious that he should be removed from an abusive environment, but the council&#146;s lawyers refused to apply for a care order. Will the Secretary of State ensure that the legal advice given by Haringey&#146;s lawyers is published in full when the inquiry reports, so that we can all see just what went wrong?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08112042000236">I agree with the Secretary of State that it is crucial that we ensure that in future there is clarity on when and how children can be taken into care. Does he agree with me that there is an absolute need to ensure that the child&#146;s interests are paramount, and does he also agree that the increase in the costs of taking a child into care imposed by the Ministry of Justice this year now need to be reviewed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000237">Looking at current systems will be at the heart of Lord Laming&#146;s inquiry, which we welcome. The Secretary of State will be aware that when social workers deal with new child protection cases, current targets monitor how quickly they fill in the common assessment form; they do not monitor child protection outcomes in the same way. Will he specifically ask Lord Laming whether we should consider changing the system to ensure that it is child protection, not bureaucratic compliance, that the system prioritises?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08112042000238">The Secretary of State knows that the hon. Members for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), and for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone), and I have asked to see the serious case review of the handling of baby P&#146;s case. Regrettably, the Secretary of State&#146;s hands are tied, because the Information Commissioner has ruled that serious case reviews cannot be released to Opposition politicians because of the risk of identifying the professionals involved, and the fear that the professionals who made a mistake may not therefore co-operate with reviews. Does he not agree with me that it is quite wrong to put the interests of a bureaucracy that has failed ahead of proper scrutiny? Is it not wrong that the law as it stands prevents the constituency Member from finding out what happened in the case? Does he agree with me that the law needs to change?</p>

 Let me start by saying that I appreciate that support and co-operation. It is important that, together, we do everything we can, where possible. It has been the case since Every Child Matters and Climbi&#233; that, where possible, we make such issues cross-party matters. That is certainly my commitment, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08112042000242">The hon. Gentleman will know, as I wrote to him and to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) this morning, that yesterday I endeavoured to see whether I was able to release the full, confidential, serious case review to parliamentarians, but the clear professional advice given to me was that that would be the wrong thing to do, given the ruling of the Information Commissioner and the importance of making sure that in future, serious case reviews are done properly. I absolutely want them to be done better in future. However, I am happy to continue to reflect on that. What I can do is ensure that when I receive the inspectors&#146; report on 1 December, both the Opposition spokesmen and the local MP get a chance to study it before I make it public, so there will be an opportunity, at least at that point, to make sure that everybody is properly and fully informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08112042000243">The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) is quite right: in the end, it was the deception and the evil of the adults involved in the family that was to blame, and it was they who inflicted that cruelty on the child. That is very clear in the serious case review executive summary, which is public, and it is even clearer in the fuller report. At the same time, when these issues come to light and to the attention of professionals, there is a responsibility for us to act. Our judgment, having read the detail, is that actions were not taken when they should have been taken. It is that collective and singular failure that we are asking the inspectors to look at as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000244">On the particular points that the hon. Gentleman raises, I do not think that the case of Ms Kemal suggests that the inspection regime is flawed. I agree with him entirely that this is not about procedures, but about making sure that proper investigations were carried out. There was a legal case between Haringey and that individual, which had been settled, and it was about cases that happened three years previously&#151;there was no connection at all to the case that we are considering. When the letter came to the then Department for Education and Skills, it was not seen by Ministers in the Department. On the advice of experts in the Department, the complaint was referred to the inspectors who, in law, were the right people to carry out the investigation. I am reassured that they had a meeting with Haringey representatives and satisfied themselves, independently of Ministers, that the matter had been dealt with properly. Of course, that was in the minds of Ofsted inspectors when they completed their investigation in autumn last year, but  <br>

that was not a full joint area review. They did not go in on the ground in the way that the inspectors whom I am now sending in will. I do not think that there was evidence that the inspection regime was flawed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000245">Nor do I think that there was evidence on the supposed relationship between the inspector who signed off the annual performance assessment last autumn and Mrs. Shoesmith. I have looked into the matter in detail. She signs off all those reviews, but the review was not done by her. I see no evidence that there was a conflict of interest in this case, and it is very important to me that the Ofsted inspectors now go and do their job in Haringey independently, thoroughly and in a very professional way, which is what they currently do. I hope that we can all support and have confidence in the integrity of the processes that they are following as we speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000246">The legal advice will be examined by the inspectors as part of their work. At this stage, I do not know whether there was clear and definitive legal advice not to make an application, or whether more information was needed. The executive summary and the full report make it clear that it took far too long to get information from health experts. When the information was provided, it became clear that some of the consultations were not thorough. The paediatrician in the case has been suspended. It is true that clear signs of non-accidental injury were not acted on. Those matters will be examined, and we will get the report in a week or so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000247">I carefully considered the issue of legal costs at the end of last year. The Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services has expressed the view that the fall in case numbers since April is due not to the increase in fees but to wider changes in the system. We provided &#163;40 million for councils to make applications, and it would be appalling if any council were not to proceed with an application for a care order because of the financial cost of the legal process. I have asked Lord Laming in the terms of reference to examine that issue in particular. If that is happening, it is a gross error, and that issue is explicitly part of Lord Laming&#146;s work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08112042000248">We will ensure that Lord Laming looks at all other barriers, too. If there are bureaucratic obstacles to social workers doing their jobs effectively, those barriers need to be looked at, but we must be careful. It is important that social workers ensure that information is properly recorded in every case and that they write down their judgments, which is the only way to obtain proper accountability after the fact and ensure that things are done properly. If those records did not exist, the inspectors who are trying to identify what went wrong would find nothing. When social workers have meetings and conversations, those judgments must be recorded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08112042000249">The important point is that we are discussing judgments. In the end, whatever processes or procedures are followed, the question is whether social workers, with the police and health professionals, are making the right judgments. That is what social workers do every day. In my view, wrong judgments were made in this case. If the inspectors find that in their report, we will hold people to account and act to make sure that such mistakes cannot happen again.</p>

 My right hon. Friend may know that the Children, Schools and Families Committee has been examining looked-after children for some time. We are extending our inquiry to cover the most vulnerable children&#151;those on the at-risk register. When such a tragedy occurs, nobody wants, at one extreme, a whitewash or, at the other, a witch hunt. If we really care about vulnerable young children, we must do everything that we can to ensure that such things never happen again. However, will my right hon. Friend remember that to raise the expectation that vulnerable children will never be murdered again is to go against human experience? Today, we are discussing not only baby P but the 35 to 50 children who are murdered every year in our country. We must learn from not only this case, but all the other cases, and we should bear it in mind that the improvement in the past few years has been quite good.</p>

However, thousands of children die every year, and too many of those deaths are preventable. Our job is to do everything that we can to prevent those deaths. Our society does not seem able to stop adults who conceal despicable acts perpetrated against children, which seems to happen in every society in every generation. Where such cases come to the attention of GPs or social workers, we should be able to ensure that those children are protected. As the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) said, we should see things from the child&#146;s perspective and always make sure that the child&#146;s needs are paramount.

hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) has been informed by people within the council that some local managers in Haringey are selecting the staff to whom the investigators can talk. If that is true, it is a matter of great concern. Will the Secretary of State confirm whether that is true? If not, will he investigate as a matter of urgency? Given that he cannot publish the serious case review and that he has been left with a very short inquiry of a couple of weeks, which will not get to the bottom of the issue, particularly in relation to baby P, is it not now obvious that we need a full, independent public inquiry?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="81120-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08112042000256">The Secretary of State has indicated that the nub of the case is not a lack of contact but a wrong judgment on taking the child into care.

Will the Secretary of State tell us what has been done, because, given yesterday&#146;s report, it seems that not enough has been done? Will he tell us whether he is concerned that the number of children on the child protection register and its successors has fallen by about one third since the early 1990s?</p>

 I will not repeat why I could not hand over the full serious case review, although, again, I looked very hard to see whether I was able to do so. Alongside the Information Commissioner&#146;s view, the clear advice that I received was that, if we were to set such a precedent, it would make it much harder in future to go through the full independent process. Although I accept that the executive summary is just that, a summary for public consumption of a much longer, more detailed and, I have to say, more harrowing account, the evidence of the problem and the failure to act is clear to see in it. Our concerns when we read the summary last Tuesday were confirmed by the full and more lengthy confidential report. I spoke to Christine Gilbert from Ofsted this morning to confirm that the inspectors are looking at safeguarding in Haringey, including management practices, and they will do so on the basis of an investigation of individual cases and their wider implications. The issues about the handling of the baby P case and the case file will be looked at by Ofsted, the Healthcare Commission and Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary, as they prepare the wider report. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman some assurance.</p>

Gentleman that there is no question of local managers making the decisions about who the inspectors interview&#151;there is no question of that at all. The Ofsted professionals, and those from the other inspectorates, are highly experienced and highly professional, and I hope that I have reassured him that the report will be thorough and based on the highest standards. It does not do any of us any good at this stage to pre-judge the quality and professionalism of the report, because we may have to make some very difficult decisions on the basis of it, and I want to do so on the basis of the best report.</p>

I could have decided to act in advance of the report and to allocate the blame to particular individuals in a particular way. That was not my responsibility. I judged that it would have been the wrong thing for me to do. The right thing for me to do is to send the inspectors in, to get the detail and then to make the decision, and that is how I have proceeded in this case.</p>

We may need to reform and change, and that is why Lord Laming is doing his work, but my judgment was that to have waited for a public inquiry before acting, which would have meant waiting many months, or to have thrown the whole system into pause while we waited for the inquiry, would have been the wrong thing to do. It would not have been the right way to ensure that children in Haringey and throughout the country were safe. I do not rule anything out, but people want action, and they want it in the fastest possible time. That is the action that I shall take.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State agree that the Government should focus not just on the specifics of this single appalling case and safeguarding? Lord Laming&#146;s inquiry, or a further one, should also be empowered to examine how we can break the inter-generational cycle of poor parenting and the poverty of social and emotional capabilities, which is the breeding ground for such abuse. The inquiry should be allowed the time to explore and propose early intervention policies that can command a social and political consensus and build out, over a generation, further dysfunction and abuse. Should not Government and Parliament now be clear about our strategic responsibilities, as well as those on this specific case? Without such clarity, the baby P case will just be the latest in a series of tragedies, no long-term cultural shifts will be made and baby P will have died in vain.</p>

 It is important that we focus on the specifics of the baby P case and take the action that is needed, because it is a particular tragedy that should have been prevented. On the issue of safeguarding, it is also important that we look more widely throughout the country, and that is what we are doing through the work of Lord Laming more generally. On the specific case of baby P, it is clear that there was no sufficient early intervention to prevent that harm. I know that in Nottingham, my hon. Friend has campaigned, researched and led on these issues. Early intervention and prevention, and a culture that priorities early intervention and joint working between the police, GPs, social workers and schools, is at the heart of the cultural change that we have been driving locally, since the Every Child Matters report and nationally with our new Department; the children&#146;s plan was introduced a year ago.

trusts on a statutory basis, with all those agencies, including schools, properly signed up to the children and young person&#146;s plan, was so that we could entrench that long-term early intervention culture that is necessary to keep children safe and to ensure that every child can fulfil their potential and that every barrier to their happiness, well-being and learning is addressed early on. That is the cultural change that we are trying to lead, but this particular case is an example where early intervention should have worked more effectively.</p>

First, the atmosphere and the morale of everyone in Haringey has been shot to pieces, but, for there to be a new start, there must be accountability, because if the same faces remain after the report, we will not have that fresh start. Secondly, when the report comes in, I believe that the Secretary of State will take action, but I very much hope that he will put Haringey into special measures to hold the department safe while action is taken. Finally, a public inquiry will be needed, because the Haringey case has raised many issues that are wider than the investigation can possibly examine.

 It is absolutely imperative that the supervision of children on child protection registers who live at home is improved. The Government have made a significant investment in children&#146;s centres, which provide a range of services to parents, including parenting orders and good-quality care. However, it is often difficult to get families whose children are on child protection registers into children&#146;s centres. A lot of them hide from the authorities; they do not want the authorities to see what goes on in their homes. Will the Secretary of State consider how children&#146;s centres can be used better to provide early intervention, better monitoring, better supervision and better protection of children at risk?

The death of children obviously hits the headlines, but we know that hundreds, if not thousands, of children are living in very dysfunctional families that most of us would not survive in.

In addition, there is another layer of the profession&#151;they are known as pedagogues&#151;that we do not have.

 The Secretary of State will be aware that I have been concerned for some time that judgment in such cases has been wrong, and that the wrong children have been taken into care. In Haringey, at the important time for baby P, the authority was trying to reduce the number of children in care to a target figure of 365 by March 2007. That was a consequence of a revenue budget problem, which was why fewer care proceedings were initiated. I have identified a case in Haringey where two children were wrongly in care at the same time. The effect of having the wrong two children in care was that there was no space in care for baby P.</p>

As far as I am concerned, if a child&#146;s safety is at risk and the thresholds are passed, the child should go into care&#151;but only in such cases. In this case, it is clear that the home environment was chaotic and the family concerned did not take its responsibilities seriously in any way, but the idea that that is the only kind of family in which children are at risk or subject to abuse is completely wrong. I am afraid that in every area, at every level of income and in every walk of life, children are, at times, abused and maltreated, sometimes without that abuse having come to the attention of the authorities. Where there is evidence of abuse, action should be taken, whether they are the right or wrong kind of child in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view.</p>

My local law society raised the issue with me, and I suspect the same is true for a number of other hon. Members. The &#163;40 million that has been allocated to local authorities is not ring-fenced, and it may not go very far when there is increased and heightened interest in the matter.

 I should have explained earlier that a serious case review in a case such as this is finalised and published only at the end of the criminal legal case.

Since 2006, UK landings of cod have declined by 7 per cent., those of haddock by 16 per cent. and those of herring by 17 per cent. However, landings of mackerel have increased by 30 per cent., those of nephrops by 8 per cent. and those of crabs by 11 per cent. The total value of landings of fish from UK vessels in 2007 was &#163;645 million&#151;an increase of 6 per cent. on 2006. That is largely a result of a rise in the value of shellfish landed, which is up by 15 per cent. on 2006. Exports of fish and fish products had a value of &#163;922.7 million in 2007. The industry provides employment for 12,700 fishermen, and sea angling&#151;an important sector&#151;makes a significant contribution to the UK economy.</p>

The issue of quotas is slightly different, however, and is tied up with the longer-term reform of quota management and the common fisheries policy. However, in respect of the marine Bill, a key part of local decision making on sustainable fishing in local areas is having the buy-in and the engagement of the sea fishing community. However, I will return to the issue of quota management and make some wider comments later.</p>

 In view of the Minister&#146;s plans for the management of inshore fisheries, can he reassure me and my constituents that the current geographical arrangements for sea fisheries committees will be respected? The boundaries are working well and do not need to be tampered with. Can he also reassure the House that the plans for the future management of inshore fisheries that he has described will chime in with the negotiations, which he is no doubt already engaged in, on the future of the CFP beyond 2012?</p>

 Yes on both counts. As the hon. Gentleman will know, there has already been a great deal of discussion and debate about the number and geographic spread of the new bodies and how they tie in with the existing bodies. I hear what he says. We have not reached a conclusion yet, but we are cognisant of the representations being made. We want to ensure that the way in which we localise the system means that we have the most effective structure. His comments about how that fits in with the wider reforms and the wider forward programme are absolutely right.</p>

I believe that the proposals will deliver strengthened inshore fisheries and environmental management, so that more effective action can be taken to conserve our marine ecosystems and achieve profitable and sustainable fisheries in the sector, which I know hon.

Our current proposals focus on targeted decommissioning to release quota back into the fleet, combined with proposals to cap effort and quota stocks at current levels.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point, which has also been made to us by stakeholders in the under-10-metre fleets and others, including hon. Members. We are cognisant of the issue. However, I stress again that some of the challenges that lie ahead in putting the inshore fleet on a sustainable footing&#151;not only for the next 12 months, but the next two, five and 10 years, and longer hence&#151;will need not only a considered view, but a definitive view on the shape, structure and size, in order to make things work. We all share the aspiration of providing the fleets around the entire UK coast&#151;in Wales, where I live, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland&#151;with an assurance that what we will put forward will ensure a profitable and sustainable livelihood for them and their families and also effect our commitment to a sustainable use of the seas.</p>

 I have been a consultee to the document that the Minister has cited, as have many of my constituents. There is enormous concern that he is proposing to apply the 300 kg limit on quota species in a very short reference period. Does he not recognise that the fact that many inshore fishermen target non-quota species when there are obvious difficulties with the prosecution of quota species has created a period for which the track record is not accurate? It will be very unfair on those fishermen if the Minister proceeds with his proposal.</p>

We need a more stable regulatory framework, with more emphasis on long-term management planning and better stakeholder involvement.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. As he will know, we are among the most supportive of the role and the potential role of the RACs. I recently spoke at the meeting of the North Sea RAC. The contribution that RACs can make to the sort of reforms that are taking forward is singularly impressive. I also know that they are aware of our support, among that of other EU nations, and of the growing strength of bodies such as the North Sea RAC, which I single out at the moment. As the hon. Gentleman says, we think that there is immense potential for them to play a major part in a regionalised strategy. We have some way to go, but we are making inroads into persuading fellow Europeans of the same approach. I welcome the support of the hon. Gentleman and others in following that trajectory.</p>

The European fisheries fund is a key tool that is available now to secure a sustainable and profitable future for the UK fishing industry. I am very pleased that the Commission has approved the UK operational programme and that the scheme is up and running. The EFF now provides more than &#163;100 million for UK fisheries to improve sustainability and provide marketing and technology to help the fleet adapt.

 Some of the negotiations with Commissioner Joe Borg and others have reflected what is sometimes described by our stakeholders as a gap between the scientific evidence and what they observe. There are always at least two sides to the story&#151;and sometimes more. We are sometimes told that we could walk across the North sea on cod, but cod stocks are still very fragile. Our arguments are based on the evidence from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, but they reflect not only the science, but what we are told by our own fishermen as well.</p>

 I caution the Minister about paying too close attention to people who think they can walk across the North sea&#151;whether it be on cod or otherwise&#151;as they may not provide the most reliable source of advice. I want to press the Minister on the question of science. His predecessor, to whom I would like to pay tribute, visited Shetland in the summer and acknowledged that it was unacceptable to be relying on science that is effectively two years old. That is how old the raw data are before they come before the Commission or the Council for decision. Will the Minister carry on the work that his predecessor undertook to start in finding a quick and dirty analysis of the scientific evidence so that it more accurately reflects the position as it stands today?</p>

 Yes, indeed. Because of this time lag that affects even the most accurate and comprehensive scientific data, we certainly need to find ways to work on the evidence that we know exists out there in the fisheries; we need a quick and dirty method of achieving that. Officials are engaged in that process. The UK is very advanced in its scientific evidence: England has its Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and Scottish colleagues also have a very good scientific base. As to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about walking across the North sea on cod, I was recently reading a fantastic history book on fisheries, in which it was said that back in the 15th century, it was possible to go into the rivers of Newfoundland, pitch an axe into the sea and it would stand upright because of the density of fish. We sometimes take that as the fishermen&#146;s tale. As I said to the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill), our actions will be based not only on the best scientific evidence, but also on what we are seeing.</p>

 I will try to provide an accurate answer later rather than mislead the hon. Gentleman now. I am seeking some inspiration, but I will come back to him on that. Discards is an important issue and the people most concerned about the problem are actually the fishermen themselves, who absolutely abhor the idea of having to throw dead fish back into the sea.

As soon as we emerged from the negotiations, I spoke to fishermen&#146;s representatives from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Shifting the focus away from Brussels and towards local solutions to reduce cod mortality by 25 per cent. is good for the industry and the environment. We have seen in Scotland the progress that can be made by taking a more flexible approach that rewards fishermen. I urge the Minister, when he returns to Brussels in four weeks&#146; time, to set the 2009 quotas for our fishing fleet and to press for more flexibility in the common fisheries policy and for quota levels and days at sea that reflect that.</p>

These will remain unresolved until some progress is made on understanding what is in our seas. The Commission is calling for a 25 per cent. cut to cod quota, but over the past three years, vast quantities of cod have been discarded. According to the Government&#146;s own figures, between 2005 and 2007 almost 5 million cod were discarded by English and Welsh vessels in the North sea and a further 10 million from Scottish vessels. Annual discard rates have ranged from 40.6 per cent. to 83.6 per cent.&#151;that is over four times more fish thrown back dead than landed. I will comment more on discards later if I may, but it is difficult for the Commission and the Government to tell our fishermen to take further cuts in quota while, at the same time, the crazy rules that they have laid down are forcing fishermen to discard thousands of tonnes of fish each year.</p>

Everybody needs that sustainable future. I do not believe for a second that we will be able to deliver a sustainable future if we throw vast quantities of valuable fish back into the sea. That is why I urge the Minister to think carefully about the quality of the science, because it cannot be right to disagree with the fishermen and with the scientists.

He went on to say that subsequent years were still &#147;subject to approval.&#148; Perhaps the new Minister would like to intervene to let us know if there has been a further change in CEFAS funding.

By last year, the number had increased to 18. It is difficult for Ministers and the EU to make policies affecting fishermen, whose livelihoods depend on these fish stocks, when the science is so uncertain. The same assessments have also concluded that between 2006 and 2007, the number of stocks outside the safe biological limits increased from 13 to 14 and that the number of stocks within safe biological limits has fallen by one third, from 12 in 2006 to nine in 2007 and eight in 2008.

Millions of tonnes of healthy fish&#151;much of it edible and the remainder suitable for fishmeal&#151;are being thrown back into the sea dead. Fish that could have ended up on a plate, contributing to achieving the recommendation to eat two fish portions a week, are of no economic or environmental value when discarded; and, if not caught by commercial fishermen, that fish could have helped to repopulate stocks or have been caught by recreational sea anglers. The effects of discarding and high-grading severely restrict our knowledge of the state of fish stocks, catch compositions, the presence of spawning grounds and the numbers of juvenile fish. The EU estimates that in the North sea, 40 to 60 per cent. of all fish caught by trawlers is discarded.</p>

For haddock, the figures were 72.9 per cent. discarded from Scottish-registered vessels and 38 per cent. from English and Welsh vessels&#151;more than 50 million fish. For west of Scotland cod, the discard rate from Scottish-registered vessels was 89.8 per cent.&#151;up from 62.3 per cent. from 2005, just a couple of years earlier.</p>

That was revealed in the summary of responses to the consultation on the marine fisheries 2027 vision document and requests that action be taken to end discarding. The view of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is clear:</p>

 Absolutely. The eliminator net has recently been rechristened the Ruhl net after the fisherman who invented it. However, constructive incentives and encouragement are needed to enable fishermen to change their gear. At present, that does not happen. Fishermen must have incentives to upgrade to fishing gears that are more sustainable and catch target species more effectively. Scientists and decision makers must have the knowledge and understanding to set realistic quotas, and catch composition and by-catch limits that are representative of the state of stocks in our seas.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman rightly raises the important subject of the under-10 metres fleet, which I shall return to in my closing remarks.

 The hon. Gentleman will have to wait until the end of my speech to get the full answer to that, but let me tell him this&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I am coming to it. There are opportunities to reallocate quota that do not necessarily cost the Government, such as the Hague convention quota, which last year we saw allocated to the over-10 metres fleet. If I were part of the under-10 metres fleet, I would want any quota addition.</p>

If we are going to deal with this problem, we must make sure we recognise the value of quota to the people who own it, but we must also recognise that a lot of quota is not used. More can be done, therefore, and every time we ask about what more the Government can do on alternative quota allocation, the first thing they say is, &#147;We&#146;re doing a lot already.&#148; It is not working.</p>

It is not right at this stage to say to anyone owning any property that a Government will take it away, but it is right that the Government look at what can be done to make sure that the under-10 metres fleet get a fairer chance. For instance, we would like the discard pilot policies to be applied to the under-10 metres fleet. This would allow it to land more of the catch, and potentially go over quota, but with EU permission. That would make it wealthier, because it would be able to get more money for what it caught and it would mean there was less discarding.</p>

the under-10 metres fleet, but it may also be applicable to other parts of our fisheries that are under pressure. He is representing the views of that fleet, and I have recently met both that fleet and Members of Parliament who advocate its views. One of their key arguments is that it is disadvantaged because it has lost out historically to the over-10 metres fleet, and it wants that to be redressed by quota being pulled back from the over-10 metres fleet. Will he make it clear whether he sees pulling quota away from that fleet and giving it to the under-10 metres fleet as an option? I would be interested to hear his answer.</p>

 Unless there is an increase in quota, the distribution of quota must be a financially agreed decision. One of the problems that the under-10 metres fleet faces is that it simply cannot afford to buy or rent the quota that it needs. I do not see how that can be solved with a magic wand, so the Minister will need to negotiate on it. This depends on the price of fuel and the price of fish, and on what quota is available, but plenty of under-10 metres fleet fishermen feel aggrieved when what they call &#147;slipper skippers&#148; sit at home renting out their quota while they are throwing perfectly valuable and commercially useful fish back into the sea. My plea to the Minister is to take this matter seriously. I am delighted that he has already met the New Under Ten Fishermen&#146;s Association and that he continues to work on the issue, because it will not go away and it is extremely important.</p>

<p><a name="st_o237"><a name="08112042000454"><a name="81120-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="08112042001069"><b>Michael Jabez Foster:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that quota is property in the ownership of the over-10 metres fleet. I understand from my constituents that it was always given to them. It may have acquired a value since, rather like carbon credits have, but is not the answer that this belongs to the nation? Thus, there is no reason why we should not take the nation&#146;s property and distribute it in the fairest and most reasonable way possible. Why does he insist that it is property and, therefore, should not be subject to appropriation?</p>

 That is not a particularly difficult question. When people live off a set of rules, which a quota essentially is, if one takes away their ability to earn a living, one should compensate them. There is a question as to whether or not that is feasible, and the Minister must deliver on that challenge. That partly relates to what we are allowed to do with the money within the fishing industry. The challenge is a difficult one for him, which is why I am pressing him to do what he can for the under-10 metres fleet. Obviously, as things change, we hope that the opportunity to do more for the under-10 metres fleet will increase. A lot could be done, and I have touched on one or two suggestions. This is by no means an easy thing to solve, but it is important, because the arrangements are disproportionately skewed against the smaller fishermen, who are largely constrained by the weather rather than by the size of their vessels&#146; engines or the type of fishing that they do.</p>

 There is an important lesson to be learned from Scotland. The Scottish Executive tried to change the rules on quota, but, overnight, they took away from fishermen the value that they could borrow against to run their fleet. It is very important that no damage is done to the industry by undermining the value of quota.</p>

Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), who promised action and a set of proposals by this time last year. Those were supposed to be part of the Government&#146;s quota management change programme&#151;QMCP&#151;which has since been abandoned after the Scottish Executive pulled out. Nothing of substance was forthcoming. The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford, when he was Minister, went further, producing a paper of proposals early last year and a consultation document late in the summer. The consultation closed last month, but we still await a timetable from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on when any implementation of the proposals will take place. DEFRA&#146;s marine programme for 2008-09 mentions the consultation on the short-term package for the under-10 metres fleet, but gives no indication of when the measures are to be implemented.</p>

We know that they are planning to spend &#163;5 million on decommissioning, but we do not know what the level of interest is from the larger vessels that take up a substantial amount of the pool allocation. It is also unclear what will happen if the scheme is over-subscribed or under-subscribed. Although DEFRA has indicated that from 1 January 2009 it intends to split the licences for under-10 metres vessels into full-quota licences for those fishing more than 300 kg in a twelve-month period and limited-quota licences for those fishing less than 300 kg in a twelve-month period, it is unclear whether that will happen on that date. Under 10-m fleet fishermen and their families have been left with an uncertain future for far too long. I am delighted that the Minister has met NUTFA&#151;a great group of people&#151;especially in view of the fact that his two predecessors promised action that is yet to materialise.</p>

Although fuel prices have reduced since then, relieving some of the pressure on our fishing industry, we need to ensure that the fleet is better prepared in the event of future increases, especially in view of the fact that fishermen from other member states were receiving direct help with their fuel costs through the de minimis aid payment, putting our industry at a competitive disadvantage.</p>

Sea anglers have a vital role to play in managing our marine resources in a sustainable manner. I hope that the Minister will join me in paying tribute to those involved in promoting sea angling and merging together with other angling groups to form the Angling Trust. I also hope that he will be listening very closely to the Angling Trust. His predecessor ignored the views of anglers when he authorised a one-third increase in the rod licence fees for disabled and elderly anglers&#151;hitting some of the most vulnerable in our society hardest. Now, with the marine Bill coming forward and the reform of the sea fisheries committees, their contributions will matter and must be valued.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman obviously missed the comments on the sea angling strategy that I made in my opening remarks. His comments are so shot full of inconsistencies that I hesitate to pick just one.

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08112042000484">Many organisations have pinned their hopes on the Government delivering the marine Bill in the forthcoming Session. I pay tribute to the Wildlife and Countryside Link, the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts and others for their endeavours in keeping this issue high on the political agenda and reminding us all of the importance of that legislation. I also welcome the many contributions received from marine-based industries, including those involved in the fishing industry, angling, marine aggregates, shipping and submarine cables. They all want to do their part to ensure that our marine environment is utilised in a sustainable and productive manner. It is imperative that all interested groups are constructively involved as the marine Bill is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get things right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08112042000485">We all expect the Bill to be in the Queen&#146;s Speech and the Government to make the necessary amount of parliamentary time available for us to debate the legislation. The former Minister, the hon. Member for Exeter, promised that we would have a &#147;real&#148; Bill in this current Session and we hope that DEFRA will manage to deliver this time. It would be an absolute travesty if the Government once again failed to give us the marine Bill, which they have spent the last four years promising. I look forward to working with the Minister on the Bill, as it is much needed legislation which we all support in principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08112042000486">We all want to see a more integrated system of marine spatial planning. A streamlined licensing system is long overdue. Reform of the sea fisheries committees is needed, and there must be provisions in place to safeguard and protect the marine environment from harmful practices. More than 44,000 plant and animal species depend on the marine environment and, when it comes to protecting these species, we must not have years of dither and delay, as we saw with Lyme bay and the pink sea fans. It is easy to make the case for more effective measures to protect marine life. Take for example, the inshore bottlenose dolphin, whose numbers are estimated to be as low as 500 to 600. It would be a tragedy if those numbers declined further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08112042000487">Although we are supportive of the Bill, the Minister will face some tough questions over the next year about the legislation and Conservative Members will scrutinise the proposals very closely. DEFRA has already failed to live up to its promises to protect the marine environment and to develop marine-protected areas. Two years ago, in its 2007 marine and fisheries business plan, it promised to identify potential, multi-purpose MPAs but, earlier this year, the then Minister confirmed that no such sites have yet been formally identified. If DEFRA simply missed its target to identify some multi-purpose MPAs in two years, how long will it take to introduce plans for all our seas and measures to protect them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000488">There are also question marks about the Government&#146;s commitment to funding the identification of areas that need protection. We all appreciate the present financial situation, but the minutes of the September board meeting of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee were worrying. The JNCC is responsible for identifying a set of marine conservation zones by Easter 2011, but it is still awaiting a decision on its funding for 2009-10 and 2010-11. Until the Minister sorts out the JNCC funding arrangements, it will be left to work with its  <br>

hands tied behind its back. We would all like to see in the marine Bill a commitment from the Government to a time scale on measures such as a marine conservation zones, policy statements and plans. Well intended measures are one thing, but delivering them is another. As we have seen with the Animal Welfare Act 2006, ministerial promises about secondary legislation are easy to break when there is no commitment in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000489">We will also need greater information on the proposed marine conservation zones, the areas likely to be affected and the impact that they will have on marine-based industries. Many fishermen are concerned that no-take zones will be introduced with little consultation with them, and that they could be introduced in areas where it might be more practicable to restrict activities and practices rather than bring in blanket bans. There are also anxieties that the introduction of marine conservation zones, and other measures, beyond the six nautical mile limit will be of limited benefit due to the current CFP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000490">Under the present regulatory system, foreign fishing vessels with historic rights between the six and 12 nautical mile zone are subject to controls that the UK Government introduce only if the European Commission approves. That is why the Government were able to ban UK vessels from pair trawling, but not those from other EU countries, thereby weakening any benefits to dolphins and porpoises that the UK ban would bring. In view of that, we would like to be reassured that any measures introduced by the Government or the proposed inshore fisheries and conservation authorities that go beyond the six nautical mile limit will apply to foreign vessels, and that the Government will press the EU to recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000491">The Joint Committee on the Draft Marine Bill suggested that</p>
<a name="81120-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="08112042000788"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Government should negotiate the removal of historic fishing rights in UK waters with EU Member States to ensure that enforcement of nature conservation regulations are universally applied to UK national and other Member State fishing vessels in the six to 12 nautical mile zone.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08112042000492">The Minister should certainly consider that in relation to the post-2012 CFP reforms, because there is little point in introducing measures that foreign fishermen can ignore that leave UK fishermen at a disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08112042000493">The relationship between the provisions in the marine Bill and two other flagship pieces of legislation&#151;the Planning Bill and the Energy Bill&#151;is also unclear. When it comes to marine planning on certain developments, including harbour facilities and those connected to energy, the infrastructure planning commission could override the views expressed by the proposed marine management organisation. According to the draft marine Bill:</p>
<a name="81120-0012.htm_brev4"><a name="08112042000789"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The MMO is to carry out its functions with the objective of making a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08112042000494">However, it will be impossible for the MMO to fulfil its role as the champion of the marine environment when decisions are made outside of its remit and before it has even been established. We have already seen in the last few days the Department for Energy and Climate Change announce the outcome of the 25th round of offshore oil and gas licensing applications. Many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House who signed up to support the marine Bill will be disappointed to see the measures weakened before they even get on to the statute book or come into force.</p>

We must see real progress on quota reform and help for the 10 metres-and-under fleet, and steps must be taken to end discarding.

I wish the Minister luck in his post, but in the past year the Government have stumbled from one blunder to another, with the fishing industry paying the price and the marine environment suffering.

 I welcome the Minister to his first fisheries debate. While the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin), was speaking, I was counting how many annual fisheries debate I have attended&#151;I think that this is my 16th, so I am one of the grizzled regulars. I congratulate my hon. Friend on the fact that his was the possibly the shortest Front-Bench speech from the Government side. At the same time, I think that we heard the longest speech from the Opposition Front Bench. Although the Minister took about half an hour and the Opposition spokesman 46 minutes, I must say that the Minister had a lot more to say, and he took more interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000498">I also congratulate the Minister on the commitment that he has already shown to the industry, and in particular on the fact that, although he is in his early days in the post, he is grasping the nettle and recognising the need for a sustainable industry. That lesson has been hard to learn for many of the people involved in the industry, but we are now making substantial progress, and I wish my hon. Friend well in the December Council meeting and in the meetings with Norway over the next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08112042000499">What the Minister said about his objectives for the December Council meeting highlights the need for the fundamental changes to the common fisheries policy that we all want to see. I and other colleagues have attended these debates for many years, but the pork barrel discussions that we used to have are old hat and unacceptable in the modern day, particularly in the light of the importance of the industry not only to the economy but to the well-being of our people. Fish is a fundamental and valuable food product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08112042000500">The Minister mentioned the cod recovery plan, and we welcome the progress that has been made on that this week.

Organisation, from England and Wales. It was clear that the leaders in the industry wanted the Government to succeed in their negotiations, and it is important that they should do so. Everyone recognises that we need flexibility, and many colleagues have raised the issue of the science, and the time lag involved in the application of the science to the discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000501">It must be recorded strongly by those of us with Scottish constituencies that the Scottish industry has made a remarkable amount of progress in the past few years. There have been fundamental changes from the days when fishermen were regarded by all of us as the last hunter-gatherer species on these islands. Now, we see them as pragmatic, able professionals who regard the sustainability of the industry into the long term as much more important than today&#146;s catch. That represents a huge culture change, and it is one that must be recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08112042000502">Many changes have been introduced and accepted&#151;and pioneered, in many cases&#151;by the industry. They include changes in the way the industry operates, especially relating to the real-time closures of fishing grounds, and to the reporting processes that have been introduced and accepted throughout the industry, which I hope will now be rolled out to the rest of the fishing industry in Europe beyond the UK. The industry has also been prepared to accept technical and gear changes, and it has been experimenting with all kinds of different ways of catching fish, and with new methods of allowing the fish that we do not want to catch to escape from the nets. The industry must be commended for all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08112042000503">As colleagues have said, it is important to recognise the importance of local management. Unless the people who work in the fishing industry feel that they have a real stake in the process, we shall not make the progress that we need to make, and we shall not make it fast enough. One of the handicaps of the way in which the common fisheries policy has operated over the years is illustrated by its bureaucratic, centralised approach. This has alienated people and led to many of the problems experienced by the industry. Thankfully, we do not see so much black fish now, for example. That was a particular by-product of the lack of local control. If everyone has a stake in the industry, we can make genuine progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08112042000504">These debates on fisheries are usually a lot shorter than this one, and many people try to get their interventions in, just in case there is not enough time for them to make a speech. That has happened many times in the past, but today we have a decent amount of time, which is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08112042000505">The issue of discards has been raised already. In our discussions with the Scottish Fishermen&#146;s Federation, we heard some fairly shocking figures. Most of the evidence is anecdotal, but the representative from the SFF said that he had spoken to the skipper of one boat who had thrown overboard 300 boxes of perfectly marketable cod. That is disgraceful and unacceptable. I am a little disappointed at what I understand to be the Government&#146;s position on this. They are prepared to look at ways of minimising discards, but they are not going to change their policy on discards&#151;or, at least, on the landing of non-quota fish. That seems to work well in Norwegian waters, and I urge the Minister not to exclude any option while we are looking for a solution to the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08112042000506">My biggest concern in my constituency is not to do with the catching side, as one of the sad changes over the past 30 years or so is that boats registered in Aberdeen now tend to operate out of other ports. My main interest is in the processing side of the industry, for which the discard problem also creates a massive difficulty. Processors feel a huge amount of frustration because discarded fish are lost, with the result that obtaining sufficient raw material is their biggest problem. Over the past few years that has led to fish being imported from other parts of the world such as Canada and the Baltic. The ditching of our own fish is causing real distress and concern to the processing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08112042000507">I want to say something about employment in the processing side of the industry, and then add a little about employment in the catching side. All of us with processing facilities in our constituencies know that the industry would be in difficulties without the influx of migrant labour&#151;certainly, there has been a considerable flow of people from eastern Europe into Aberdeen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08112042000508">Skilled labour is more important in the smaller companies because they do their own filleting and so on, whereas the larger companies use machinery for filleting and more of their labour is unskilled. Rough estimates suggest that the influx accounts for between a fifth and a quarter of the smaller companies&#146; work force, with the proportion being slightly higher in the larger companies. Even so, the total number of people employed in Aberdeen has fallen from between 2,000 or 2,500 to around 1,000: about a quarter of them are from eastern Europe, although some Chinese workers are also employed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para29"><a name="08112042000509">There are many problems with recruitment in Aberdeen, especially of local labour. In years gone by, many young people in my constituency and the neighbouring constituency of Aberdeen, South would have done training and apprenticeships and then pursued a career in the industry. Nowadays, however, the industry is not attractive, and the young people who would have gone into it prefer to work in Tesco or Sainsbury. The jobs are cleaner and the people who do them do not smell when they meet their girlfriends at night. In some cases, the wages are better as well, with the result that the industry faces major problems with training and recruitment in the future. It cannot continue to depend on migrant labour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="81120-0012.htm_para30"><a name="08112042000510">A constant grievance in the industry is that, whenever there is a crisis, the catching side gets funding that is not so readily available to the processing side. There was a massive decommissioning of vessels a few years ago to sharpen up the industry and help it to make progress towards its present sustainability, but at the time processors were also going through a number of transitions. There were new water regulations, certainly in our area, because of European directives and local requirements, and new food standards regulations also impacted really heavily. However, there was no sign of support, even though the processing industry supports a huge number of jobs throughout the country. These are important issues for us.</p>

concern and some difficulties. I hope that I have sufficiently praised the Scottish industry for the way it has adapted to become sustainable, but I am not patting it on the back in this particular case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08112042000512">Historically, the fishing industry in Scotland&#151;and, I am sure, the rest of the country&#151;has recruited from the towns and villages where the boats were based. Recruitment was local but fishing vessels travelled far and wide in their search for fish. Nowadays things are slightly different. I mentioned the influx of migrant labour into the processing industry. In my area, the north-east of Scotland, the oil and gas industry has been with us since the mid-1970s. In fact, since the mid-1960s people have searched for the oil. Those industries offered Scottish fishermen alternative employment, some directly in the industry, others on supply or stand-by vessels, which are mandatory for every offshore platform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08112042000513">As I say, in the past few years, there has been a significant influx of immigrant labour, particularly from eastern Europe, in the processing side of the industry. All those workers are subject to British employment laws. They are entitled to the minimum wage and the same health and safety and other protections. They pay tax and national insurance on their earnings. However, in more recent years, there is strong evidence of an influx of immigrants who are being exploited by the fishing industry and who may be operating in this country illegally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000514">The International Transport Workers Federation, a body that represents trade unions in the transport industry around the world, recently published a report entitled &#147;Migrant Workers in the Scottish and Irish Fishing Industry&#148;. If the Minister does not have a copy, I will send him one. The report charts the growing number of workers from countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia who are now working in the Scottish and Irish&#151;mainly Northern Irish, although some are in southern Ireland&#151;industry. It gives a number of examples from the past two years of how the trade operates. I will not go through those examples, but they include cases from Fraserburgh and Peterhead on the east coast of Scotland, Ullapool and Mallaig on the west coast, and Irish examples, particularly around the port of Killeen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08112042000515">Workers sign contracts in their home countries, and those contracts are used by the agents with whom the workers sign up to obtain transit visas. My understanding is that transit visas are issued to allow people to travel through a country. The ITF has found that in the fishing industry, it is normal for the applicant&#151;in most cases, the employment agent&#151;to claim that the individual will be operating out of the UK port, and will be fishing in foreign waters, usually in Norway. In most cases, only UK waters are fished, so there are inadequate checks on how the transit visas are used. No money changes hands between the vessel operators and the foreign worker. Money is usually paid by the agents in the home country. In one example, a group of workers were paid &#8364;241 a month, although they had been promised &#8364;800 in the contract that they signed. They were required to work a 20-hour day, and the ITF calculated that that meant that in some cases they were receiving as little as 20p an hour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08112042000516">In many cases, no accommodation is provided. The fishing trips could last as long as three months, with very few days of rest in port. The ITF found that no record of hours of work and rest were kept in most of  <br>

the cases that it examined. In most instances, no safety training was given and health and safety requirements were generally ignored. In addition to facing poor working conditions, the foreign workers were afterwards left to find their own way back to their home country, whether they had come to the end of their contract, or whether there was an ill-health issue.</p>

In one recent case&#151;it is still going through the legal processes, so I will be careful what I say about it&#151;two Filipino crew members and a Latvian died in a fire on a vessel. I understand that some of the lessons learned are quite serious for the way such migrants will be treated; however, I shall not go into that here. I understand that so little information was held on the individuals who died that it took more than a week to identify the bodies. The owners of the vessel did not have information on who those people were.</p>

The bulk of them are in Scotland. He has had frequent meetings with Filipino workers in Fraserburgh, particularly following the fire and the deaths. He estimates that there are about 400 such workers in Fraserburgh alone.</p>

Many of the migrant workers are not used to the Scottish climate, and some arrived in Aberdeen, Inverness or other points of entry dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, because that is what they are used to wearing in their home country. They just were not prepared for the Scottish climate. Because of their low wages, they have no money to buy more suitable clothing. I pay tribute to the people of Fraserburgh for their continued compassion for migrant workers in their town and to the Fishermen&#146;s Mission.</p>

The ITF has been in touch with the local immigration authorities in Scotland, and I have sent a copy of the ITF report to the Home Secretary and asked her to look into the matter. The ITF has a good track record on dealing with such issues around the world, and it has procedures to assist fishermen and other seafarers to get compensation for the non-payment of wages. The report makes it clear that it has been successful in some cases, even in the Scottish fishing industry.</p>

I have asked local minimum wage enforcement officers to investigate that situation and particularly the nature of contracts between vessel owners in Scotland and employment agents. It is difficult to understand why, when there are so many unemployed people in the north of Scotland, particularly around the coastal villages, and a ready supply of workers, including fishermen, from the EU, it is necessary to bring workers  <br>

In that case, employers would be paying national insurance and be subject to minimum wage regulations, and the workers themselves would be paying NI contributions and tax on their earnings.</p>

Most of those workers never complain and simply accept their lot. It is important to say that the majority of fishing boat owners do not employ immigrant fishermen, but those who do are exploiting the vulnerable, breaking the law&#151;certainly in relation to immigration requirements and possibly in relation to health and safety and the minimum wage&#151;and failing to comply with international human rights treaties. Their behaviour is a stain not only on the fishing industry but on our whole country.</p>

detail, with talk of quota, total allowable catches, transferable quota and the rest of it, but that the decisions that he makes as a Minister, and of which he will be a part next month when he goes to Brussels, can be, in a very real sense for many men working in the industry, life and death decisions.</p>

I hope that the Minister will take on what I am about to say and make representations to the Department for Transport on behalf of those fishermen, because last Friday afternoon, it was announced that the back-up helicopter that is stationed as part of the search and rescue service at Sumburgh airport is to be withdrawn, so that cover can be provided by CHC Helicopter Corporation, which has the contract on the south coast of England. We, here, have the luxury of debating in the relative comfort and safety of the Chamber, but I am told that at home in Orkney, a fierce wind is beginning to blow from the north. That is by no means unusual in the northern isles in November. Although CHC&#146;s attitude towards the provision of its services and the removal of the back-up may not be in breach of its contract, it certainly is in breach of the spirit in which CHC was intended to perform its functions. I very much hope that all arms of government will be employed to bring that point home to it most forcefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000532">As ever, the fishing industry has had an eventful year. Earlier this year, the Minister&#146;s predecessor acquired a fair degree of unwelcome attention and some heat in respect of fuel costs. The fishing industry will always employ a particular argument about those costs, and I hope that, given that some of the political heat has been taken out of the issue because fuel prices are now lower, work will now be done on the role of fishermen as market takers rather than as market makers. It is always easy to say that some should receive special consideration, but, when an industry is in a particular position, as the fishing industry is because it cannot pick and choose where and when it sells its fish, or the price, special considerations must apply. Such work must be done now while the fuel issue is not as contentious as it has been.</p>

attention to those negotiations, because they seem to be the absolutely crucial ones, and the December Fisheries Council is simply left to carve up what is agreed. The EU-Norway negotiations are particularly important this year, not least because of the attitude of the Norwegian Minister with responsibility for fishing and the Norwegian Government in general. I hope that there is an element of grandstanding in some of what the Norwegian Government are saying. They talk about a total discard ban and a land-all policy for fish caught in Norwegian waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08112042000534">I suspect that there is an element of grandstanding. The Norwegian Government say that herring are their first priority in respect of banning discards; that may be grandstanding because those who know about these things tell me that there is very little, if any, discard of herring, so achieving that total ban should not be as challenging as it first sounds. However, it is clear that this year Norway is giving discards a political importance that they have not had in the past. Ultimately, I hope that that will help, although I also hope that we will not be left having to sweep up bureaucratic and unhelpful measures as a consequence of grandstanding. I would like there to be direct political&#151;rather than official&#151;input into the EU-Norway talks. I know that, in principle, the talks are conducted by the Commission on behalf of the EU, but talks of such importance should involve politicians rather than officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000535">Others have spoken about discards. We have to get on the record the fact that the fishermen are those who hate the level of discards most. Discarding is not a consequence of naked greed; fishermen do not go out and hoover up everything that they can lay their nets on. It is a consequence of the disparity between the quota level set and the fish to be found in the sea. In summer this year, the Minister&#146;s predecessor visited Shetland. Josie Simpson of Whalsay, who has a long history and pedigree in the fishing industry and fishing politics, told the Minister that he had never known a time in his life as a fisherman when the gap between the quota and the reality had been so wide. That fact is behind the significant discards that we are seeing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08112042000536">At the heart of the problem is the fact that the science does not reflect what is in the water today; it might reflect what was there a couple of years ago, but life has moved on significantly. That is why I keep coming back to this plea to the Minister: whatever is given to ICES to inform its advice, the decision making must be based also on information from the industry itself&#151;after all, people who work in the industry see what is in the sea&#151;and on scientific advice at an earlier stage that has been analysed rather more crudely. There is always the opportunity for that &#147;quick and dirty approach&#148;, as I call it, to be quality-controlled through measurement against the refined product, which is all we get at the moment. If that shows a broadly consistent position, we should know that the initial analysis has been reliable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08112042000537">I want to say something about specific issues that the Council will face when it meets next month. The Minister spoke at length about west coast whitefish. It is pretty clear that there are significant issues about some of the stocks on the west coast; that is accepted by the industry itself. I would, however, suggest that the blunt instruments to which the Minister referred&#151;the draconian closures that are currently up for discussion&#151;are no sort of solution. They will simply take a bad position and make  <br>

it worse. If we are going to look to the recovery of threatened stocks to the west of Scotland, we must be prepared to take a longer-term perspective than has so far been suggested as appropriate. If we learn the lessons of the past seven years from the cod recovery programme, we must see that the situation will not improve overnight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08112042000538">The Minister was absolutely right to say that there must be buy-in to any proposals that offer the eventual solution. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) referred to the scepticism about the Swedish grid, particularly among white fish and nephrops fishermen. I emphasise the importance of ensuring that those concerns are listened to and taken seriously so that we do not end up with a solution that is imposed merely because officials take it as the best view. Will the Minister also bear in mind that if we have a closure programme of the sort that is suggested, it will affect fisheries in every area? These grounds are fished principally by the handful of white fish boats that remain in Orkney and by boats on the north-east coast around Banff, Macduff and Fraserburgh. They will not stop fishing just because of closures on the west of Scotland&#151;they will take their effort elsewhere and the impact will be felt by others in different parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08112042000539">People working in the Celtic sea area are particularly concerned about the application of a days-at-sea solution, and we can all understand why that is the case. I urge the Minister to do all that he can to resist that and to preserve the position, as far as is possible, in fisheries such as monkfish, megrim and hake. In respect of the Irish sea, we are, yet again, hearing this year about the urgent need for a review of the cod recovery measures. Until we have that review, those in the industry and scientists are fairly clear that what is needed is the preservation of the current level of cod total allowable catch and the days-at-sea regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08112042000540">In my parliamentary experience, it would not be a fishing debate if we did not say something about North sea cod. This is no longer quite the poisonous issue that it once was, but it remains a source of concern, not least because of its impact on discards. The current management plan for North sea cod suggests a 15 per cent. increase in the total allowable catch. Compared with the position of a few years ago, that is a remarkable achievement, and we should not underestimate its significance. However, there is scope for the UK to press for more. The more cod TAC that we can get, the less of a problem there will be with discards. The ICES advice, with all the caveats that we have applied to it, says that it would be possible to have an increase of up to 80 per cent. of the North sea cod TAC while maintaining the spawning stock biomass at the minimum safe size of 70,000 tonnes. I should place on record, for the avoidance of doubt, that I am not calling for an 80 per cent. increase, but as an exercise in arithmetic I am trying to show the Minister that there is scope for significant flexibility in future.</p>

We last saw any significant reform in 2002, so this will take us to 2012 for the next round. The 2002 reforms were, in many ways, quite timid. The creation of regional advisory councils was welcome, and the North sea RAC, in particular, has functioned very well. They have shown the potential for regional management.

fishing industry to shift from Brussels to the communities most closely affected. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) said, we would like to see a move from regional advisory councils to regional management councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="81120-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08112042000542">We have to be mindful of the need to preserve elements of the common fisheries policy that are to our significant advantage, such as the concept of relative stability, the Hague preference and the six and 12-mile limits&#151;and I make a special plea for the Shetland box. A lot of creative and imaginative thinking was being done in the fishing industry from 2000 in the lead-up to the December Council in 2002 that introduced the changes. I hope that the process we are starting will lead to a similar increase in creativity and fresh thinking on fisheries management. As long as that takes place, and that sustainability and the fishing industry are at its heart, it can only make these debates more profitable in years to come.</p>

I always say that as I welcome each one, with a note in jealousy in my voice because it is not me doing the job, which is the most important job in Government as far as we, the fishing MPs, are concerned. He will help to shape the future of our industry, and the best advice we Back Benchers can give him is to hug the industry close. The most successful Ministers are those who have kept in closest touch with the industry. It is interesting that the Fisheries Minister in the devolved Government in Scotland has been very effective because, in a smaller nation, he can be closer to a big industry than is possible in the more impersonal environment of British politics. I welcome our new Minister again, and say to him that his success is our success.</p>

Takings are up because of inflation and because we have switched species. As white fish catches have gone down, they have been replaced by shellfish and nephrops, or langoustine as they call them in Scotland now&#151;is that the Scottish dialect word for nephrops? Returns have therefore been kept up, but the value of landings has declined 24 per cent. in real terms since 1998, 30 per cent. of the jobs have been lost since 1996 and there has been a 43 per cent. decline in the number of registered fishing vessels since the early 1990s.

apposite. The decline is almost entirely due to the common fisheries policy, which was imposed by Ted Heath. He used to sit in debate after debate trying to defend the betrayal of the British fishing industry that he carried through in 1972, which unfortunately tied our hands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000547">We must recognise that the common fisheries policy has been expensive for Britain. There is no use ignoring reality and pretending that it will go away. If we calculate the total EU catch to be 5.3 million tonnes of fish and its value to be &#163;5.6 billion, with 70 per cent. of fish caught in British waters&#151;what used to be exclusive British waters&#151;and we deduct from 70 per cent. of &#163;5.6 billion the &#163;645 million that is the value of landings in this country, we are left with &#163;3.3 billion. The fish are caught in our waters, though not by our vessels&#151;thereby not providing employment in this country&#151;and sold in Europe. That is the effect of the common fisheries policy. We have been swindled, and the policy was devised for that purpose.</p>

Instead of making things better, it has made them worse. It has become tighter, clumsier and messier. The position is straightforward. In Brussels, we have approximately 40 bureaucrats in what is now called DG MARE&#151; I thought that the title referred to a new director general when I first heard it. The main acquaintance of those 40 bureaucrats with fish and fishing is acquired in Brussels fish restaurants, where they eat the best of the world&#146;s fish. I am sure that the officials at the Commission believe that things are going well for fishing because they are served such delicious fish in Brussels restaurants. The best service that we can do this country is to close the Brussels restaurants so that the bureaucrats can no longer eat their fish. Perhaps then they will begin to think that there is something wrong with fishing. I even begin to think that it is all their fault.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08112042000552">It is impossible for a small group of bureaucrats in Brussels to legislate for and regulate fishing vessels over 45° of latitude or to legislate for vessels of all sizes, from small vessels of under-10 metres to huge, powerful fishing vessels. One code of regulation cannot cover everything. The problem is that, because legislation and regulation are done in a remote fashion from Brussels, the measures have to be broad brush. That is why control is preferred through total allowable catch and days at sea limitations. Effort can be reduced by cutting down the days at sea. Control is also exercised through decommissioning&#151;cutting down the number of fishing vessels, thus limiting the fishing effort. The bureaucrats prefer broad, crude controls to the more sophisticated controls that are necessary to deal with a complex industry that covers many waters with different production and many species of fish. One policy, developed in Brussels, cannot cover everything.</p>

<p><a name="st_o252"><a name="08112042000553"><a name="81120-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="08112042001084"><b>Mr. Goodwill:</b>
 Is it not also the case that a number of countries that participate in those negotiations do not have a fishing industry&#151;or even a coastline, for that matter&#151;and are perhaps therefore willing to negotiate away fishing interests for their agricultural interests, which are under consideration at the same time?</p>

<p><a name="st_o253"><a name="08112042000554"><a name="81120-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="08112042001085"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 That is correct. That can also be the case for the Fisheries Commissioner, but fortunately Commissioner Borg comes from an island. He therefore has some knowledge of fishing and has been effective in that role, but that is not always the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08112042000555">The problem is that we need regulation that involves the industry instead of regulation that is imposed from the top down, as it is now. We should hand power down to the industry and let it regulate itself, determine its own catches and how to achieve them, and set its own objectives and define its own way of getting there. The more we hand power down to the industry, the more effective it will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08112042000556">Having come here when Mr. Gladstone was Prime Minister, I have seen the changes to the fishing industry over a long period. When I came here, the fishing industry was big and fished mainly in Icelandic, Faroese and Greenlandic waters. The industry was involved in distant water fishing with big vessels and the owners were very powerful. Indeed, the industry was run like the mafia: the owners would come down to the House of Commons in a train of state and tell us fishing MPs what we should do and say. We were sent regular briefings and a newspaper, as well as offers of fish to keep us going through the long winter nights in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000557">That was succeeded by a period in which the big boys pulled out and the industry began to operate on a much smaller scale, although it was difficult to manage or organise and much of it was extremely angry. Today, the fishing industry has totally changed, at long last. The industry now wants to be involved. It does not want to be bureaucratised, but it wants an influence over its own fate. The industry wants a say and is prepared to accept regulations, provided that it is consulted during the formulation of those regulations on how to maintain the catches. The industry can be consulted through the RACs, which are an innovation that Brussels needs to listen to more&#151;it listened very well in the first year, but it is listening less effectively these days&#151;rather than simply imposing things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000558">I must express my disappointment at the European Court of Auditors report on DG MARE, which the court clearly wanted to merge with the Environment Directorate-General, because the report is totally hostile towards DG MARE for the wrong reasons. The report says that the common fisheries policy has been a failure&#151;we have been saying that in this place for a long time, so I am glad that the realisation is dawning in Brussels. However, the report also says that that is because the fishermen cheat and are irresponsible and disorganised and because nation states fiddle the results and do not police the policy adequately. That is exactly wrong. The policy fails because it is a centralised policy that cannot be imposed on a multifarious industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000559">We have to recognise that the European Court of Auditors report has got the wrong end of the stick. That is best illustrated by the emphasis that we have placed this afternoon on discards. The scale of discards is worrying&#151;the Opposition spokesman gave us some horrifying statistics about that. The issue receives enormous publicity, as well it might when valid, good-quality fish are discarded and when the cod that the fishermen cannot land is just chucked overboard&#151;dead, useless&#151;so that they cannot make a return on it. Fishing boats are expensive to run, but there the fishermen are, chucking saleable fish overboard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000560">The problem arises because the quotas fixed by the Commission and the stocks&#151;presumably determined by the scientists, but often inaccurately so&#151;are out of kilter. Until we adjust the two, there will be discards. However, applying rigid quotas in a mixed fishery, which is what we have, makes discards inevitable, so we need to develop a way of dealing with them. The more quotas are reduced, the greater discards will become. That is an inevitable law of fishing, but the Commission does not recognise it. The more we reduce cod quotas, the more discarded cod there will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08112042000561">The only way round the problem is to get flexible measures, which the industry has pioneered. It is amazing that after all these years in the centrally controlled common fisheries policy, it is left to the industry to develop new methods of management that are more effective in conservation terms, but are more difficult to implement because of the laggard nature of the CFP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08112042000562">The sort of measures pioneered by the industry include cod avoidance plans. A Jubilee fishing vessel in Grimsby, for example, has adopted a cod avoidance plan&#151;in other words, fish in areas where it is possible to avoid catching cod. That is one way of conserving cod, but some kind of reward is needed for fishing that way, and the reward has to be extra days at sea, to make sure the system works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08112042000563">Another method is using different mesh sizes or new gear. There is some American gear called &#147;the eliminator&#148;&#151;it is not named after Governor Schwarzenegger, who was the Terminator&#151;and it looks very promising. It has been trialled by Arnold Lockyer in Scarborough and deserves to be trialled more extensively. It will allow people who have caught their cod quota to carry on fishing for haddock or whatever, using this selective gear. Conservation can also be managed by area closures.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman mentions area closures. Does he endorse the industry-led efforts to close the Trevose grounds&#151;very important juvenile and spawning grounds&#151;that have resulted in a noticeable increase in stock and a reduction in effort control? It is worth emphasising that it was an industry-led proposal. It is important, because in a mixed fishery, it is impossible not to catch some of the stock whose landing the European Commission is keen to prevent.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I did not give way at first as I expected to hear an interjection in a Scottish accent, so I was somewhat confused geographically. He is absolutely right that the industry has been conscientious in developing that sort of area measure, with which, I believe, the future lies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08112042000568">We can promote conservation by having observers on fishing vessels&#151;and if we cannot have an observer, we can have closed-circuit television. It is interesting that the industry is up for both of those developments and is making proposals to develop them, but acceptance by Brussels has been very laggardly. Today&#146;s industry wants to conserve stocks and sees the importance of sustainability, which is obviously a way of keeping the industry going, yet it has been restricted by the common fisheries policy, which is supposed to be about conservation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08112042000569">I shall not go into too much detail over what to look for in the negotiations, as other Members have done it better. The first prospects were gloomy&#151;I read in <i> Fishing News </i>a headline saying, &#147;EU wants big cuts in TACs for 2009&#148;. It goes on week after week. I am glad that the ICES proposals were published in advance and that they are now open to debate and discussion, because the industry needs a say on the science as well. There is a long-standing misunderstanding between the fishing industry and the scientists, particularly about where the checks are done. The scientists seem to want to trawl in the same place with the same can of trawl gear that they trawled with last year, whereas, as far as I know, fish move around. The fishermen know where they are, but the scientists appear not to. That distorts the results. I think that the ICES figures were first published in June; they were gloomy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000570">We began with a prospect of gloom and cuts, but I think that that was rather misleading. We ought not to be inured to cuts, and I do not think we should accept the cuts that are being forecast. We should involve the industry in the science and in developing quotas through the RACs. The gloomy prospects have been alleviated by a sensible decision about the Celtic sea. The proposal for a cod recovery plan has been rejected&#151;thank heavens, because it would have had a knock-on effect on catches of other species. However, we are still left with the proposal for a 25 per cent. effort cut, which I think is too abrupt. It is difficult for an industry, much of which is on the margins of profitability, to survive a further cut. As other Members have pointed out, the British fishing industry has already suffered massive cuts, and it is time to call a halt.</p>

Government, we can encourage the use of cod avoidance plans. The Government have a responsibility to help and finance the industry&#146;s search for new methods and new ways of planning, as well as its requirement for training and safety measures. They were laggardly in giving us de minimis finance to cover fuel costs. However, they can help the industry in lesser ways by financing more research and observers, and the development of a new fishing strategy, in the build-up to the 2012 review. Without going into all the arguments over species, I would argue for more and closer co-operation between Government and industry, and a delegation of power from Brussels to the industry, via the RACs.</p>

It ensures the preservation of natural balances and the sustainability of catches. It must, therefore, be included in the consultations on where marine conservation areas are to be. At present it feels excluded: it feels that decisions are being made without involving it sufficiently. If fishing is to be excluded from marine conservation areas, however, that must mean all fishing. We cannot allow British fishermen to be excluded from British marine conservation areas while European fishermen are allowed to assert their right to fish for quotas within British areas. There must be one law for all&#151;it must be common, if we are to have a common fisheries policy at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000574">I want to say a few words about the Wash and north Norfolk inshore shellfishery, and then a few words about the wider national fishing situation. The Fisher fleet at King&#146;s Lynn is extremely important. There are smaller fleets at Brancaster and Wells, and to the north-west there is the Boston fleet. The Wash and north Norfolk fishery is one of the world&#146;s premier shellfisheries, and is renowned for brown shrimps, cockles, mussels, whelks, crabs and of course lobsters. There is a significant number of jobs. Over 70 boats operate out of these ports. The Minister can tell us the figure when he winds up, but I estimate the multiplier to be between 10 and 15. For every job offshore, there are 10 to 15 jobs onshore in processing, packing, servicing, engineering and ship repairing. There is the one shipyard in my constituency for every job offshore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08112042000578">Many challenges face this fishery&#151;more now than I have known for many years. The Minister talked about how well the shell fisheries were doing, but he was referring to 2007 figures. Brown shrimps, for example, are now selling for &#163;1.50 a kilo; last year they were selling for &#163;10 a kilo. The cockle season for 2008 has been a disaster, down 40 per cent. Mussels are now selling for &#8364;450 per tonne; last year they were selling for &#8364;700 a tonne, with transport costs included. Many of the variable costs have gone up. My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) mentioned red diesel, which went up as high as 70p a litre, making it quite prohibitive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08112042000579">I want to talk briefly about wind farms. Centrica now has Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farms under way; they became operational earlier this year. It now has consent for the 250 MW Lincolnshire farm. Before too long in excess of 500 wind turbines will be operating in the Wash and along the Norfolk coast. As someone who is a vehement opponent of onshore wind farms&#151;I have always said that the place to put them is offshore, where one can secure a degree of critical mass and economies of scale&#151;I should say that there are important ramifications for fisheries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08112042000580">The latest planning proposal from Centrica will involve two buried sub-sea cables through the Wash, which will connect up to the national grid. I am pleased to say that Centrica has agreed that 11 km of onshore cables will be buried. As far as fish are concerned, the jury is out. There will be some conservation advantages, as the area around the turbines will be an exclusion zone that will not be able to be fished; indeed there will be an opportunity for some of the shellfish to breed and regenerate without any fishing taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08112042000581">There are many concerns about the main cable and the lack of access to mussel beds during the cable laying. There will also be an area of the Wash and the offshore Norfolk shell fishery that will be out of bounds for the foreseeable future, certainly for the life of these turbines. It is important that we are able to find out the exact size of the area affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08112042000582">I also think that proper compensation should be paid to the fishermen in my constituency. I have every faith in Sam Laidlaw, the relatively new chief executive of Centrica, and his renewables team, who have made it clear that there will be compensation for fishermen who lose out as a result of these renewable power developments. Obviously, to have a commitment to pay compensation is important, but we need the talks to continue and for a conclusion to be reached so that the fishermen in my constituency know exactly where they stand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81120-0014.htm_para28"><a name="08112042000583">I wish to touch briefly on a technical matter, which the Minister may be well briefed on&#151;in fact, I am sure that he has heard of the ross worm, or Sabellaria spinulosa, reefs. The ross worm is a marine worm that builds tubes from sand and shell fragments, and the reefs are made of large dense conglomerations of Sabellaria tubes. They are important because Sabellaria reef is on the list of habitats requiring protection under the EU habitats directive. That directive led to the creation of the Wash and north Norfolk coastal special area of conservation, and further protection was granted by the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster will know because he was interested in that legislation&#146;s passage through this place. The Wash is, of course, also a site of special scientific interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08112042000584">These reefs are important for their high biodiversity value; they support a large number of different species. The reefs are under threat and have declined in number, however. The fishermen concede that they have been damaged by demersal fishing operations. Natural England has concluded that the Wash reefs are an outstanding example of the habitats and it is determined to offer more protection. It is keen to prohibit the use of tow-fishing gear in certain areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08112042000585">There is widespread local agreement that that important type of habitat should be protected, which is why the Eastern Sea Fisheries Joint Committee has outlined four possible closure areas, and a byelaw would close those areas to demersal trawling and dredging. The total area will be 2,765 hectares, and the largest areas are the Lynn knock and the Lynn deeps. Some of these areas are hardly fished at all, but others are heavily fished, and although there is widespread support for the conservation measures, I have concerns. Where there is fishing within important SSSIs such as the Wash, it is necessary to strike a balance between commercial activity and maintaining conservation and habitats and other associated challenges. I am concerned that there is no compensation, and I wonder whether the Minister might look at that. I am also concerned that the review framework will be on only a five-year basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08112042000586">There is a possible way forward, however.

Under the proposed marine Bill, there will be no-take areas, so why not put the byelaw proposals for the Sabellaria reefs on hold until the new Bill has been enacted? The new and more powerful inshore fisheries and conservation authorities have been mentioned, and they will have substantial influence and more power than the existing sea fishery committees. It would make sense to wait until those bodies have been established, and then take a long, hard look at the reef problem. I know that this is a technical area, and I can see that the eyes of some Members in all parts of the House are glazing over, but this is important to my constituents. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am glad that the shadow Minister, my hon.

Sustainable fisheries management is the Government&#146;s overriding policy objective, of course, but that requires high-quality fisheries management and top-class law enforcement procedures. That is currently the role of the Marine and Fisheries Agency, which has a good record. There is high morale, as shown by the Eastern Sea Fisheries Joint Committee in my constituency, and the staff are motivated and committed. However, although the MFA has been going for only two and a half years, it is now due to be replaced by the new marine management organisation. I am concerned that hard-working fisheries officers who cover fisheries in my constituency could lose their civil service status. They could lose their immunity and privileges as Crown servants, and so be exposed to litigation, lawsuits and damage claims.</p>

between &#163;22 million and &#163;26 million. Considerable disruption will be caused and morale might be damaged, and I would have thought that this is the worst time to undermine the effectiveness of fisheries officers, given that there are so many other challenges to meet.</p>

One need only consider the different bodies that they have created over the years to realise that. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is one such example. One would have thought that the individual parts going into it would have resulted in substantial savings, but the reverse has happened&#151;the new body is bloated and extremely bureaucratic, and it is costing far more.</p>

The policy is bureaucratic, ineffective and not fit for purpose. A number of hon. Members have pointed out the scandal of the discard of healthy, edible fish. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby and my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster graphically illustrated that it is unsustainable and immoral. We want great changes to the EU fisheries policies, because the CFP has been a disaster, environmentally and economically. Radical reform will be needed, which is why I support my hon. Friend when he says that he is determined to push for such an agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08112042000592">The Minister also talks of reform&#151;long-term management, better regional management and a consistent approach across the EU&#151;but we have heard that all before. I was in the House in the 1980s and 1990s, so I heard successive Conservative Fisheries Ministers say exactly the same thing&#151;they still carry the bruises of trying to tackle the issue of reform. Over the past 11 years, Labour Ministers have gone into bat in exactly the same way. They have achieved a certain amount, but nothing like enough. I welcome the Minister&#146;s personal commitment, but because of what has happened I am a sceptic and I fear that he will fail, as his predecessors failed, unless he opts for something far more radical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000593">We need significant reform, so why not start with repatriating control of the six to 12-mile zone? That would send a strong signal that we mean business in terms of supporting our fishermen. We need a completely new and fresh approach, and I do not feel that this Government are able to deliver it. That is why I support the approach outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster, and why I wish him well. This radical reform can be delivered only by the official Opposition when they come into government.</p>

&#147;You&#146;re my last chance.&#148; In a sense, I am that constituent today, saying it to the Minister on behalf of the fishermen of Hastings and Rye. Year after year, we have the same debate&#151;I suppose the good thing is that we have a new Minister every year to whom we can express our views. I hope that the enthusiasm that the current Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), has brought to this task and the expertise that he is already displaying will ensure that he attends this debate next year, when I hope he will receive our congratulations on the results that he has achieved, particularly for the under-10 metre fleet in areas such as mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000595">I am unashamedly parochial. The fishing industry is very important, but more important still is the fishing industry in Hastings and Rye. For historical reasons&#151; and like other ports around the country&#151;Hastings and Rye depend on their fishing fleets, not only for what they bring in economic terms but for what they bring to the history of the towns. I do not want to overstate the point, but my constituents are at their wits&#146; end about what to say to make the difference and encourage and embolden my hon. Friend to make the changes that will allow the industry to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000596">It is not putting it too strongly to say that the under-10 metre fleet is now in a critical state&#151;on the edge of the precipice. If nothing is done, the industry will fall below the critical mass necessary to sustain itself, with all the consequences that will have. I do not want to repeat everything that I have said in previous years, as I am sure the Minister is well enough briefed to know the arguments that we make every year, often repeated from the year before. Suffice it to say that that the fishermen of Hastings and Rye are part of a tradition that stretches back at least half a millennium. Some of the families who are still holding on can trace their ancestry back to the 18th century and earlier. They are proud not only of their profession, but of their towns, and I am too. Ports such as Hastings and Rye would be diminished beyond recognition without the active participation of a fishing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000597">It is therefore mystifying&#151;and I genuinely do not understand this&#151;why the arguments that have been put forward on behalf of the under-10 metre fleet do not lead to changes. I admit that I am biased and not objective about this issue, but those arguments are so cogent and obvious that I do not understand the problem. I know that the Minister has not long been in post and, like his predecessors, is a courteous and thoughtful colleague, but warm words and understanding are not enough. This time we need decisions that will allow the fortunes of my constituents and others in the under-10 metre fleet to flourish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08112042000598">It is no coincidence that although Hastings still provides the largest beach-launched fleet in Europe, that fleet now has just 27 active participants, down from 44 just a few years ago. The young men have left the industry. I heard just yesterday of three grandfathers who have decided to pool their efforts in a single boat&#151;each previously traded on their own&#151;because that way they can make just about sufficient to supplement their pensions. That is not the way to run a profession or secure its future. There are wives and children to feed and mortgages to pay, and the paucity of provision that has been offered to the under-10 metre fleet in terms of quota is insufficient to maintain viable businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08112042000599">Things have to change and perhaps I can explain a little more about some of the issues that so frustrate and anger my constituents who are so ill-treated by the system. The Minister will be aware that some 50 per cent. of the employment in the UK fishing industry is in the over-10 metre sector and the other 50 per cent. are employed in the under-10 metre sector. He also knows&#151;although I will repeat it so that it cannot be misunderstood&#151;that 97 per cent. of the quota is committed to the over-10 metre sector with less than 3 per cent. to the under-10 metre sector. I understand that within the channel and nearer to home the percentages are greater, but those are the bald figures. It is disappointing that so far our Government have not been able to change those figures, and it has become clear this afternoon that the Opposition would not make that change either. Somebody has to step in and do something. Direct action may be the next step, but let us leave that point for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08112042000600">Until recent years, our conservation-minded small boat fishermen could eke a living as the quotas were not so strictly enforced. Estimates were made but that was it. Then came the buyers and sellers regulations, which mean that every fish is now measured. Of course, previously people were probably taking more than their strict permissions allowed, but they were getting by. Now that is no longer possible. In consequence, the quotas in the under-10 metre sector as converted to licence conditions are wholly insufficient, as has been the case for the past several years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08112042000601">Essentially, the campaign is to ask the Minister to transfer some small part of the quota that is enjoyed by the larger producer organisations to the under-10 metre sector. I do not buy the idea that such property is incapable of transfer. The quotas are nationally owned assets, and they can be distributed by the Government in any way necessary. I understand that people who have borrowed money on their boats and the like in anticipation of future quotas must be taken into account&#151;we must be sympathetic&#151;but when one sector has 97 per cent. and the other 3 per cent., it is not a valid argument. Perhaps only a 2 per cent. transfer would save the under-10 metre sector and make very little difference to the larger boats&#151;the difference would not be of sufficient importance to affect their viability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08112042000602">I repeat: I simply do not understand why the Minister receives advice that such a provision is impracticable. Every Minister receives that advice, so there is a common trend and the outcome is always the same. The problem is that the advice will lead inevitably to legal action by the New Under Ten Metre Fishermen&#146;s Association, a newly formed representative group. Although such action will be taken with great reluctance, the organisation simply does not have an alternative. That is the position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000603">I appreciate that the Minister is worried that simply transferring quota to the under-10 metre sector would encourage the owners of latent licences to take to sea, and thus have no real beneficial effect on the full-time professionals to whom I referred. In the over-10 metre sector, the Department has removed capacity by decommissioning, so my plea is for the same thing to happen in the under-10 metre sector. The capacity has been reduced in the over-10 metre sector, but the quota has remained, thus aiding it. I have been told that just &#163;5 million would be sufficient&#151;let us remember that we spent &#163;160 million in the over-10 m sector&#151;to purchase the licences of a significant number of the latent boat  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="20" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>20 Nov 2008 : Column 435</b><br>
owners and still leave the quota behind in the under-10 metre pool. I can tell the Minister how to do it: simply, he goes to findafishingboat.com, where he will find that the totality of the licences on offer would cost less than &#163;5 million. Consequently, a significant number of latent licences could be taken out of capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08112042000604">I am not entirely convinced that an increase in quota would revive the interest of existing dormant licence holders. Why would it? There would have to be a significant increase in the number of fish available to bring back most of the boats that are out of service. Already, the under-10 metre sector licences have gone down from 7,000 to 3,000 by aggregate penalties, meaning the 10 or 20 per cent. reduction in catch potential when boat licences are aggregated. That is a natural process. Be that as it may, if there is a belief that reducing capacity is important, using findafishingboat.com could be a cheap answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08112042000605">At one time, there was the additional problem of owners of 10-metre boats who decommissioned moving to the under-10 metre sector. I am pleased to tell the Minister that the experience of my constituents is that that no longer happens. That is not surprising, because even those people could not make a living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000606">The fishermen in my constituency are upset that the Government seem unable to hear their pleas because, I am reliably informed, their French counterparts&#151;the inshore fishing fleet of France&#151;receive not 3 but 40 per cent. of a bigger cake. How can it be fair that in France the inshore fleet receives 40 per cent. when ours gets 3 per cent.? True, the French measurement is not strictly the same as ours, because its inshore fleet is not limited to under-10 metre boats, but the starkness of the comparison needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08112042000607">What is more, the French are simply not keeping to the rules. The port of Boulogne sends out fish price lists, and I have a copy here from August; the evidence is available. In it, the various fish available to the British market from the port of Boulogne are listed and priced. Under the heading &#147;Cod: Gutted&#148;, there are no prices. There are simply the words &#147;Plenty on black market!&#148;. The audacity of the French to note the availability of illegal, black market cod in that way without receiving any sort of reproach is a matter that I want the Minister specifically to take up. It is indicative of what our fishermen say is happening. Obviously, most of the evidence is empirical, but the fact remains that the small fishermen of France are surviving well and the small fishermen of the UK are not. There must be a correlation there. It might well be that the French and others are simply failing to enforce the rules that Brussels suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08112042000608">The issue of cod has already been debated. I welcome the announcement by my colleague the Minister that certain technical measures may well be the answer, and I hope that they will lead to a quota increase, which is what fishermen in Hastings and I have been calling for. For now, however, there is no cod left to collect this year. That means that, this week, 90 per cent. of my constituents&#146; catch was thrown back. That is an even higher figure than those we have already heard. The science makes it clear that the cod is there, particularly in area 7D, but, because it cannot be landed, it is being wilfully destroyed under the discard rule. There is no other word for that but &#147;wicked&#148;. It is wicked to destroy fish in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08112042000609">I want to explain why this is being done wilfully on the part of the Department, and why something needs to be done about it, at least for area 7D. Back in 2006, area 7D&#151;the part of the channel in which the fishermen of Hastings and Rye fish&#151;had a cod quota for the under-10 metre fleet of 214 tonnes. In that same year, area 4C in the southern North sea&#151;the next area along&#151;had a quota of 204 tonnes. If area 7D had a larger quota then, surely it should have a larger quota now. Because of the recovery of stock in the North sea, however, the quota for area 4C in 2008 has increased almost twofold to 385 tonnes, while in area 7D, the under-10 metre fleet may now catch only 53 tonnes. So while the North sea quota has doubled, the area 7D quota has been reduced by 75 per cent. That is simply not on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="81120-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08112042000610">On inquiring, I learned that the reasoning behind that decision, apparently made without any science, was that area 7D was being treated as part of the Irish sea&#151;anyone who has visited Hastings will know that it is nowhere near Ireland&#151;rather than part of the North sea, which is just round the corner. How can officials get things that wrong? They only need a map to be able to tell where it is. Of course, the science also tells us that the stock in area 7D is North sea stock, not Irish sea stock. Will the Minister deal specifically with this point?</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="08112042000611"><a name="81120-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="08112042001094"><b>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford) (Con):</b>
 I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s frustration. He asked how the officials could have got things so wrong. Whether they did or did not, will he acknowledge that, whatever they did, Ministers approved it? Is he not frustrated that his Ministers, who have been in power for the past 10 years, are going along with officials whom he thinks have got it wrong?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention but, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) said a moment ago, officialdom has been advising Ministers of both persuasions for many years, and it would seem to those of us who represent the fishing industry that they have all got it wrong. Perhaps that has been the only constant advice that has been coming through, although not from the current officials; they change, but I guess that the books remain.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says that everyone has got it wrong, and by his definition that must mean both officials and Ministers. Why does he think that Ministers cannot see, as a result of his debating skills, that they have got it wrong and should do something about it?</p>

 My ambition is that my hon. Friend the recently appointed Minister will get it right. That is why I am making this plea today, but the problem is that decisions have been made over the years that appear illogical. No answer has been given to me or to my fishermen constituents as to why that should be, so I cannot think that the situation that I have just described can be anything other than a cock-up. The idea that Hastings is in the Irish sea and not the North sea is clearly wrong.</p>

I do not know about the North sea, but there are shoals of cod in the English channel. I am told that they cannot be avoided because they are so plentiful, and that that is why 20 boxes have to be thrown away at a time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08112042000617">I want the Minister to look right away at the problem that I have described so that the same mistake does not occur next year. We are in the North sea and not the Irish sea. The science is on my constituents&#146; side, and I simply do not understand why we should allow that error to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08112042000618">Finally, I return to the issue of the share-out. In area 7D and along the channel, the under-10 metre fleet is entitled to just 31 per cent. of the cod catch, whereas the over-10 metre producer organisations receive 69 per cent. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Minister for all these numbers, but he will have seen some of them in correspondence and I am sure that his officials will get the rest from <i> Hansard</i>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000619">An even more startling figure than the share-out proportions is that 93 per cent. of vessels in area 7D, and 86 per cent. of the work force, are in the under-10 metre sector. I repeat that they receive only 31 per cent. of the share-out, but members of the over-10 metre sector do not fish the 69 per cent. that they get: instead, they sell on the rights. They do not own those rights, which are simply the gift of the British Government, yet they sell them on, to the disadvantage of my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08112042000620">One of my constituents went out this week and said that he brought back seven sole and half a box of plaice but discarded 30 stone of cod. Another constituent discarded a quarter of a tonne of cod, and all those fish are dead at the bottom of the sea. If my hon. Friend the Minister wants to find a solution&#151;and I think that he does&#151;he must listen more to Paul Joy and his colleagues in NUTFA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08112042000621">In fact, after I wrote my speech, the Minister met NUTFA and other representatives of the under-10 metre sector. I thank him very much for that, as I know that he is listening, but he must act as well. We must tell the European Commission that the French need to play to the same rules as we do, because the price list that I earlier called an incitement is a step too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08112042000622">Perhaps the best way of listening would be for the Minister to do what he suggested earlier and delegate to the industry responsibility for the division of quota as well as for the other technical matters to which he referred. Any industry body making those decisions should consist of the over-10 metre producer organisations, as well as representatives from NUTFA and the under-10 mere sector.

 I shall be brief, because there are just four things that I want to say, and two of them follow from what the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster) has said. The fishing community along the Northumberland coast, although much smaller than it used to be, remains a significant contributor to the economy of the area and, importantly, provides families with a livelihood, so we need to address its concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000626">The main problem that the local fleet has faced this year in Northumberland, as in so many other areas, is the enforced discarding of prime white fish because of lack of quota availability. This year is shaping up very much like last year, with prawn fishing giving very poor returns, but the grounds awash with whiting and cod. Even the smallest under-10 metre trawlers are having to dump about 150 kg of cod and 300 to 400 kg of whiting per day, regardless of what gear they use. For that, they get as little as 100 kg of prawns and 100 kg of haddock. The fish that the fishermen are out to catch are effectively swamped by the fish that they cannot land and have to discard. They regard discarding as an unethical practice, damaging to fishing stocks and to the housewife who could buy the fish. That is not what local fishermen, and their forefathers, went into the industry to do. However, that proves that there is a lot of cod and whiting there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000627">Of course, as my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) pointed out, discards are a major issue in negotiations with Norway. It is a practice that Norway has consistently tried to avoid in its policies. It is a rather strong position to assert that future arrangements that are negotiated should not allow for large amounts of discard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000628">I referred to the second problem earlier in a brief intervention on the Under-Secretary&#151;the issue of purchasing quota or licences when capping arrangements are under consideration. Skippers who have replacement vessels under construction are having great difficulty sourcing relevant licences within budget. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposes a two-tier system, allowing only those vessels with substantial track records to fish from the pool, so licence-brokers have put up prices by as much as 60 per cent. The individuals concerned had made binding financial commitments to vessels before the consultation proposals came out. The effect of the consultation has been a serious increase in prices. The advice being given to the men is that they ought to go for only those grossly over-inflated licences at very high prices. That poses a difficulty for those who simply want to maintain a small, viable fishing fleet in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000629">The third point that I want to mention to the Minister concerns the consequences of the recent floods on the breakwater at Amble, which is part of the harbour on which local fishermen depend. We had most disastrous floods in Northumberland just a couple of months ago. In a debate that I introduced on 20 October, I drew attention to the state of Amble&#146;s south breakwater, which was severely damaged in the floods in ways that will be extremely difficult to repair. The work below the surface has been severely gouged out by the floods.</p>

costed and put in front of it, but I wanted some understanding, and I have not yet heard from the Minister on that. I do not expect him to respond to that point in the debate today, but I hope that he or one of his colleagues will write to me quickly, indicating that the Department understands the problem and is prepared to give it sympathetic consideration. The issue is important both to the fishing industry and the leisure marina, which is the other contributor to the harbour. In days gone by, Amble was a coal port. That, of course, is all over, and it is the fishing industry and the leisure industry that depend on, and have to sustain, the harbour works that make it possible to operate from Amble.</p>

Members, is on the changes to the structure of sea fisheries committees. Most of the changes are welcome, and what is proposed looks like a sensible way to proceed. However, it is quite clear that in Northumberland there is no appetite at all for a body covering a larger area than the 70 miles of coastline that the Northumberland sea fisheries committee currently covers. We are anxious for the Government to take account of that. Indeed, the Minister himself gave the most powerful of reasons why the Government should do so, when he said&#151;I think that I am quoting him fairly accurately&#151;that fisheries are best managed by people with local knowledge. That is the situation in Northumberland, and in the sea fisheries committee; it is a situation that we want to carry into new, stronger and better arrangements. I hope that the Minister will take that point seriously, and will consider those four matters, along with the many others raised in this important debate.</p>

 Thank you for calling me to speak in our annual fisheries debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I welcome the Under-Secretary to the Front Bench. I am sure that he will hear a great deal from me and my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), on fisheries.</p>

I want to pay tribute to a stalwart campaigner on behalf of Britain&#146;s fishermen and fishing industry, Dolly Hardie, who passed away a couple of weeks ago at the age of 88 in Diana, Princess of Wales hospital in Grimsby and whose funeral was held on Monday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08112042000634">Dolly was of the sea. Her family were born into the fishing industry in Grimsby. Indeed, her father lost his life at sea during the second world war, when trawlers accompanied other vessels across the Atlantic. Dolly&#146;s husband Bill was a skipper, and her son is also a skipper. She took up the fight on behalf of the fishermen of this country, particularly in relation to distant-water trawlermen. She campaigned to get those trawlermen compensation after they lost their livelihoods following the cod war. She never gave up and was a true fighter for the cause, and she recruited my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby to that cause. When I was a newly elected MP, she was one of the first people to come to see me, because she wanted to ensure that I was onside in that great campaign.</p>

 I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to Dolly Hardie, who was a wonderful fighter for the fishermen of Grimsby. There will be a great gap in the new Minister&#146;s life, because he will not receive letters from Dolly Hardie telling him how to run his Department, how to run the fishing industry and what to do about the fishermen.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend and neighbour for that intervention. Considering that he worked alongside Dolly for far longer than me, it is vital that he has put that on the record. When Dolly received her MBE from the Queen, the Queen pointed out that it is most unusual to award a woman an MBE for her services to the fishing industry. Dolly would have had a little chuckle to herself to see that I am the only woman Member in the Chamber today speaking up on behalf of the fishing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000638">That got me thinking about the contribution that fishermen have made over the years to the freedoms and liberties that we enjoy today. At the beginning of the debate, we paid tribute to those fishermen who lost their lives in the past year. A few weeks ago, I dare say that we all attended memorial services on Remembrance Sunday. An enormous number of men from areas such as Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes lost their lives at sea during the first and second world wars. We often think about the number of people lost in the trenches, but when a ship went down all hands were usually lost. Hundreds of names are inscribed on memorials and in churches in Grimsby, Cleethorpes, the surrounding villages and, no doubt, around the coastal areas of Britain.</p>

She was Hardie by name and hardy by nature, and we in our community will truly miss her.</p>

 I, too, welcome the new Minister to his role. We seem to get through Ministers fairly quickly, perhaps because they get burned out by the frustrations of trying to negotiate using the sensible points that Members from all parts of the House make&#151;points which it is sometimes hard to get through to the European Commission.</p>

The same issues come forward again and again, and, again and again, the issues are not addressed when an agreement is made. We talked at length about discards, a measure that is supposed to conserve stocks, but actually results in their destruction. Fishermen from Whitby and Scarborough in my constituency tell me that the problem is not just that they discard fish that are under-sized or of the wrong species, but that, now, an increasing  <br>

number of fish of a perfectly legal landing size are discarded so that larger fish with a better market value can be landed instead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000642">We heard how the industry has declined over the years. The Minister&#146;s figures demonstrated that while the number of fish being landed had declined, their value had gone up, but that did not compensate for the massive increase in gas oil over the summer, which made it difficult for many skippers to decide whether to put out to sea. The situation has been made even worse by the big subsidies that the Spanish and other European Union competitors have received. The fact is that the common fisheries policy has failed: it has failed in recovering stocks, it has failed our fishermen and, in many ways, it has failed to preserve the marine environment. We should look to Iceland and Norway, although not, as the First Minister of Scotland suggests, as a model for financial services.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I would not criticise Norway. When I was in Glenrothes, however, there were comments about how an independent Scotland had been compared to Iceland, with its successful financial services industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08112042000645">Iceland and Norway certainly lead the way in conserving fish stocks, and ideas such as landing everything, and technical measures such as long-lining or better nets all deserve consideration. Talking to a skipper in Scarborough yesterday, I was absolutely appalled to discover&#151;the Minister may well wish to confirm this figure&#151;that this year, 18,000 tonnes of cod have been discarded. Even worse, given that we in Yorkshire take money very seriously, that is valued at &#163;5.4 million&#151;income that could have gone to our fishermen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08112042000646">Quota increases need to be understood in the context of many years of reductions. For example, a boat that originally had a quota of 100 tonnes is now down to about 18 tonnes, and a 15 per cent. increase would raise that amount only to 20 tonnes, so the situation is still very difficult. We have heard about how, in the opinion of some fishermen, it may be possible to walk across the North sea on the backs of the cod, but we also hear from some scientists that there is hardly a fish left in the sea, so the Minister has a very difficult job in trying to define a route through those two different points of view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08112042000647">One of the problems is that the scientific vessels understandably use the same gear and go to the same part of the sea when they go out to do the research, and they do not catch any fish. In September, interesting work was done out of Whitby. One of the scientific ships, the Cefas Endeavour, went out for a semi-pelagic trawl&#151;that is, a trawl just off the bottom&#151;along with the Our Lass II, one of Mr. Arnold Locker&#146;s vessels, which was using its own gear. When the vessels came back, it was discovered that the scientific vessel had caught only 8 per cent. of the number of fish caught by Mr. Locker&#146;s vessel. Mr. Locker&#146;s vessel had caught more than 10 times as many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08112042000648">Moreover, the Cefas Endeavour did not catch any juvenile fish&#151;fish of less than a year old&#151;but Our Lass II caught 10 boxes&#146; worth, weighing 400 kg. The  <br>

disparity cannot even be put down to the power of the vessels, because the Cefas Endeavour has a 3,000 hp engine, whereas the engine of the Whitby-built Our Lass II has not much more than 500 hp. When the same experiment took place in January, the scientific vessel caught 15 per cent. of the fish caught by the Whitby vessel. The Minister should draw conclusions from that research; when fishermen say that there are a lot of fish out there, they are often not going out of their way to mislead people on purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08112042000649">The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) raised a point about the 10-metre vessels, and I want to raise the same issue. Many of the boats that operate out of Whitby and Scarborough are now primarily lobster and crab vessels. There are good stocks of shellfish out there and prices have been good although, as we have heard, they are not so good now. That is due to the increasing cost of credit and the cost of transport&#151;many lobster caught in Whitby are transported to Spain, and that has resulted in prices being depressed. By the way, given that prices are low, now may not be a bad time to introduce a new V-notching scheme for lobster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08112042000650">As I said, many of the vessels do not go out primarily to catch white fish, but they do catch cod. They catch cod during the summer because they use static lobster pots, which catch some cod. During winter, they put out gill nets at slack water to catch white fish as well. So from November to Easter the vessels catch cod. During the summer they and the merchant do not have to declare a catch of less than 25 kg, but during the winter catches of such fish are an important aspect of their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08112042000651">As I understand it, the Minister is trying to root out quotas that are not being used and are preventing latent capacity. He needs to be careful in considering the vessels that do not catch a lot of white fish, because the fishermen involved are still full-time workers to whom white fish are important although they catch shellfish most of the time. There are also the genuine part-timers who do not necessarily rely on fishing for their primary income. The amount of fish landed by such vessels is already looked at, but there should also be analysis of the accounts to see who the full-time fishermen are. That would be useful. We should not eliminate the full-time fishermen who have turned to shellfish catches because of the uncertainty about cod stocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para29"><a name="08112042000652">Fishing is important to my constituency, not only because of the people out at sea but because of the jobs onshore. The quay at Whitby has a new shellfish holding facility and that is helping us develop our export markets&#151;not only lobster and standard crab, but the velvet crab that we previously had difficulty holding in good condition for export. There are also jobs onshore in processing. Recently, I visited Whitby Seafoods, famous for Whitby scampi; the company processes 3,000 tonnes of fish annually and has a &#163;15 million turnover. Interestingly, unlike the processing plants in Aberdeen, every single one of the 130 staff at the Whitby Seafoods plant is a local person. The company is being developed positively by the Whittle family.</p>

We will show him some of the success stories as well as the difficulties faced by fishermen in Whitby. I shall be delighted to stand the fish and chips myself.

of its vessels north of the border. Its current vessel is a twin-rig trawler for Mr. John Clark. It is continuing the long tradition of shipbuilding in Whitby, stretching back to the days of Captain Cook.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para31"><a name="08112042000654">Every port that lands fish must have an ice factory. Because of the dwindling amount of fish being landed in Whitby, the economic viability of its co-operative fishermen-owned ice factory is in some doubt. We need to consider that fact carefully. It was particularly frustrating this summer when a French vessel was landing whiting, which our fishermen could not go out to catch, and its crew did not buy any of our ice because they had ice-making facilities on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81120-0016.htm_para32"><a name="08112042000655">I look forward to the introduction of the marine Bill. What are the Minister&#146;s views about recreational fishing in marine conservation areas? We do not want commercial fishing in an area where fish can spawn and where we can conserve that vital environment. Conservation is at its best in on-land areas where, for example, shooting takes place. I hope that the Minister will consider that recreational fishing, which also plays an important part in the economy of Whitby and Scarborough&#151;with people going out on day trips, and even longer trips&#151;should be allowed to take place in those areas, obviously with certain controls.</p>

When we have disasters out at sea or ships in difficulty, they are never hesitant to go out and rise to that challenge.</p>

If that were done, it would be a &#147;Ravenscraig&#148;. It would be worse than a major commercial bank failing in the City of London. It would be utter devastation.

That does the EU and, particularly, the common fisheries policy, no favours whatsoever, and it is annoying and alarming for those of us who are involved. The EU CFP has little credibility anywhere in the world, and such pronouncements do not help it in any way, shape or form. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) pointed out that we are giving away &#163;3.3 billion in the value of UK fisheries that are transferred elsewhere in the EU.

According to the Western Isles Fishermen&#146;s Association, the TAC has been set using some of the most up-to-date surveying work, which employs television surveying. Scientists say that stocks are healthy, so there is no scientific justification for a cut. I am glad that the Minister said that there will be no blunt cuts.

As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said, the Minister should hug the industry close, and he is more than welcome to come to Stornoway to try to do that. There is an airport close to the harbour, so it will be quite easy for him to get in and out; there is a large fishing vessel fleet of the type we are talking about; and as it is my constituency, I will ensure he gets a very good welcome.</p>

It is an example of the tone that he has brought to the debate, to which I referred earlier. It is a tone of co-operation, allowing us to work through the problems as they emerge. If he goes to Stornoway, fishermen might point out the nature of the Swedish grid, which is emerging as a possible solution to some of the difficulties that have come out of the Commission. Fishermen feel that those have been unsuccessful in Denmark, and that they might even be dangerous. I do not know whether they are or not, but I feel it would be remiss of me not to pass that information on to the House, as safety concerns are paramount in the fishing industry.

It is a call for a restriction on horsepower in the Minch to about 500 hp. Donald Archie MacNeil, a fourth cousin, has been instrumental in calling for a horsepower restriction. He was probably the first person to mention it to me. The Western Isles Fishermen&#146;s Association supports it, as does the Mallaig and North-West Fishermen&#146;s Association. Processors in the islands support it as well, and given the breadth of support, I hope that the Minister will consider the idea. Bigger and faster boats give the fish less chance to escape from the net when they are trawling. The prawn fishermen of the Western Isles have come up with their own solutions, and I hope that they will be listened to.</p>

When I was a child, and perhaps long before that, discarding would be termed a sin, plain and simple&#151;a waste. We need accurate data on discarding. We still need to know what the cod discard was last year. Discards have been blamed for some changes in the eco-system. The bonxie, or great skua, has grown in numbers and is devastating the populations of many other seabirds. According to a report in <i> The Scotsman</i> a couple of weeks ago, that rise in numbers could relate to the tonnes and tonnes of fish that are discarded at sea. It seems that they are not just rotting in the sea; something is feeding on them, and it could be the bonxie. Anyone who has seen this ferocious bird knows that it will attack anything, including man. It would be galling if the practice of discarding were not only causing fishermen to lose money, but causing extra damage to nature as well.</p>

Dogfish is not a targeted fishery in the west coast of Scotland. It has a TAC of 739 tonnes, but, crucially, no landing can include more than 5 per cent. dogfish. Consequently, between October and February, many dogfish, which end up in nets&#151;that cannot be avoided&#151;are dumped. According to fishermen, probably only 25 per cent. of the annual TAC is caught, so many tonnes of fish which do not even exceed the quota are dumped. If the Under-Secretary could tackle the 5 per cent. rule, that would go some way towards making the improvements that fishermen want.</p>

and bureaucratic Europe appears to steamroller them out, with little consideration for local opinion. It is almost de rigueur for Europe to devise such proposals, regardless of local feeling and the damage that could be done to an already fragile economy. I hope that the Under-Secretary will take cognisance of local communities&#146; concerns, make representations in Europe about them, and note that, for centuries, we in the Hebrides have balanced our needs with nature&#146;s needs and nature&#146;s power, which we know only too well.</p>

Perhaps he can use his good offices with the Treasury to address it. Fishermen in some ports pay duty on the fuel as they buy it and have to claim it back, which leads to cash-flow problems and several other difficulties for them. Establishing the principle of all fishermen accessing duty-free fuel would be a great and welcome help to the fishing industry. It would probably cost the Treasury nothing and save some extra bureaucracy.</p>

 I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and the approach that he has taken in his job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08112042000677">My constituency is on the west coast of Scotland, just south of that of the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil), and many of the problems to which he referred have been raised by the fishermen in my constituency, too. The current Commission proposals for 2009 could put the entire fishing fleet in my constituency out of business, other than those vessels using only creels or pots. The Commission&#146;s proposals are to ban fishing on the west coast inside the 200-metre contour line unless certain conditions are satisfied. However, as nearly every fishing vessel that operates from a port in my constituency fishes inside that line, the effect would be devastating on the industry and the wider community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08112042000678">The condition that the Commission has proposed which causes the problem is the one that I raised with the Minister in my earlier intervention, namely that if vessels were allowed to fish within the 200-metre contour line, the Swedish grid would have to be incorporated in the fishing gear. However, hardly any effort has been made to assess the effectiveness of the grid in the conditions off the west coast. The Clyde Fishermen&#146;s Association is concerned that it will prove impossible to incorporate the grid into its members&#146; fishing gear. The problem appears to be the grid&#146;s rigidity when fitted to vessels of the type used off the west coast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000679">New ideas such as the Swedish grid should not be introduced unless they have been thoroughly tested and proven to work safely under the exact conditions in which they will have to be used. I was encouraged by the Minister&#146;s response to my intervention and wish him well in his negotiations in Brussels. I hope that he will be able to block the regulation, because the grid simply has not been properly tested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08112042000680">The Clyde Fishermen&#146;s Association has put forward an alternative proposal, which is to increase the size of the square mesh panel from 90 mm to 160 mm, which would allow the cod to escape while still catching nephrops. That is the same objective that the Swedish grid is supposed to achieve, so I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to the Clyde Fishermen&#146;s Association&#146;s alternative proposal. The Clyde fishermen fish for nephrops, whose stock is healthy. The Commission&#146;s reason for introducing the Swedish grid is to prevent cod by-catch. However, previous studies have shown that the cod by-catch when fishing for nephrops off the west coast is negligible. Increasing the square mesh panel to 160 mm would achieve the same ends as the Swedish grid, but unlike the Swedish grid, it is proven technology. I therefore urge the Minister to do all that he can to block that untested proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08112042000681">Another concern of the Clyde fishermen is the proposal to cut the nephrops total allowable catch by 15 per cent. The proposal seems to be based purely on average landings from recent years and not on any scientific evidence that the nephrops stock is in danger. However, basing the future TAC simply on landings from previous years is a badly conceived principle&#151;it is known as the &#147;use it or lose it&#148; principle&#151;and should be rejected. A TAC should be based on scientific evidence. I also understand that there is a proposal on the table to reduce the fishing effort by 25 per cent. However, in  <br>

view of the healthy nephrops stock and the insignificant cod by-catch, there seems to be no justification for that proposal, so it, too, should be opposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08112042000682">Let me turn to the effects of the credit crunch on the fishing industry. I was on the isle of Tiree in my constituency a couple of weeks ago and spoke to fishermen there. They fish for velvet crabs using creels. There are several boats based on the island so, bearing in mind its smallness, they provide employment to a significant proportion of people living there. The same applies to many other remote communities around our coasts. The crabs are exported to Spain, but the effect of the credit crunch has been to halve demand, which clearly puts at risk jobs on the island of Tiree and in many similar communities. The velvet crab market seems confined to Spain, but this is a good, healthy British food, caught sustainably in British waters, and we should encourage more people in this country to eat more of such food. I thus urge the Minister and his DEFRA colleagues to mount a campaign to persuade people in Britain of the benefit of eating British crab&#151;a healthy food, caught sustainably, as I said&#151;and at the same time to save jobs all round the British coast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08112042000683">Finally, I turn to the future of the common fisheries policy. I was encouraged by the Minister&#146;s approach. We need to move from regional advisory committees to regional management committees and I certainly wish the Minister well in following that approach. I also wish him well in the December Council. As I said, I am encouraged by the approach he has adopted; all power to his elbow.</p>

 It looks like I am the last to speak in this debate before the concluding speeches start. I commend the Minister for his approach to his new brief on his first outing at the Dispatch Box. It is also an enormous pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid), who has always been assiduous in his support for fishermen in his area. My constituency is not quite as widespread as that of the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil), although it extends some 80 miles from west to east and most of it is on the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08112042000685">My first point is about the nature of the debate. In taking interventions, the Minister was apologising for the extent of his speech, but when we debate fisheries matters here, there is an argument for trying to find a different structure and perhaps for having a debate closer in style to that of a scrutiny Committee. This is a debating Chamber, not a speechifying Chamber, and I believe that it is the interchange between Members and the Minister that provides the greatest value. Frankly, I would not mind significantly curtailing my own speech&#151;I will try to keep this one as brief as possible&#151;in order to give the Minister even more time. I managed to intervene only twice on the Minister and I would have been happy to get in a few more times in order to encourage him to address the most important issues that need debating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81120-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08112042000691">I also want to say something about the marine Bill. I intervened on the Minister earlier to ask about the proposals for the alteration of sea fisheries committees and for inshore fisheries conservation authorities. They are welcome in many respects, but I am anxious for him to take account of the importance of maintaining the geographical coverage and boundaries of the present sea fisheries committees. My constituency, unlike other parts of the country, contains two of those committees. </p>

I doubt that that important conservation measure would have been introduced if the matter had been considered on a wider basis, beyond the Isles of Scilly.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right: the matter was raised earlier, by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham). It is an important issue, and I am sure that the Minister was listening when it was raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08112042000697">I want to say something about the under-10-metres regulations, and in particular about the concern about the period between July 2006 and January 2008. For 12 consecutive months, a 300 kg limit has been used as the measure for each species. That is the measure against which it is decided whether a vessel is entitled to fish a particular species. It is a question of maintaining a quota rather than fishing within a 300 kg limit. What worries many in the under-10-metres sector is that, especially as the measure is retrospective, it could have a number of consequences, which might be unintended but would certainly be inequitable. Inevitably, a large number of fishermen during that period will have fished non-quota species, many of which have been mentioned: bass, crab, lobster and gurnard. The Minister must understand that a lot of those fishermen are catching as a by-catch many of the quota species as well. In Cadgwith in my constituency, there is a cove fishing community with eight boats and 12 men working all year round that is essential to the economic viability of that community and it could be seriously undermined by these proposals. Whole communities may be seriously affected. It may seem small beer in the whole scheme of things, but for that community it will be significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08112042000698">For the very low impact fisheries such as mackerel handliners, there are serious concerns as well. They have been told by the Department that the 300 kg limit would not apply to mackerel handliners but in fact the secretary of the South West Mackerel Handliners Association, David Muirhead, was told in a letter only last week that the limit will apply to mackerel handliners. If we wanted an example of a stone age, low impact fishery, the mackerel handliners would be the best case in point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08112042000699">I hope the Minister will take into account that the proposals to control the leasing of quota, particularly in the under-10 metres sector, will not save any fish. Now, in that sector, fishermen are catching fish and then leasing quota to allow them to be landed. In future, they will still catch the fish but they will discard them. I hope that he will take some cognisance of that as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08112042000700">It was proposed from the south-east sector originally that the best way of eliminating latent effort is for the Government to buy up licences, not to decommission the vessels. The boats could then become pleasure boats or something else. I hope that the Minister will look at that as an alternative to the measure that is currently proposed. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are keen to establish a good fiscal stimulus in the economy. What could be a better fiscal stimulus than buying the licences of the under-10 metres sector?</p>

tenets that have affected the western waters, means that our fishermen are discarding a tremendous amount of fish. The proposals for the allocation of quotas for this year, particularly cod and other fish, will not save a single fish. Those fish are being caught anyway and will be discarded.

I am keen to improve understanding of the science, however, and my Department has now established and supports the continuation of the fisheries science partnership, which promotes joint working between scientists and the industry, and that is starting to feed in to ICES advice. I want that to continue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o285"><a name="08112042000709"><a name="81120-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="08112042001117"><b>Bill Wiggin:</b>
 ICES is funded by DEFRA to some extent. Will the Minister look into how he can use that influence to improve the quality of the recommendations that come out of ICES?</p>

<p><a name="st_o286"><a name="08112042000710"><a name="81120-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="08112042001118"><b>Huw Irranca-Davies:</b>
 I will certainly continue to look at all the available science, including that from ICES. We should not denigrate the work that ICES does, because it provided a strong bargaining position as we went into the negotiations; it helped us in many ways. We always look to improve the science, however, and to work with the industry, and I hope that shows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08112042000711">The issue of the multiplier across the industry was raised. We estimate that for every job directly in the fisheries there are at least 10 in wider onshore employment. Employment in the fish-catching sector stood at 12,700 at the end of 2007, the corresponding figure for the fish-processing sector is about 15,000 people, and almost 28,000 jobs are directly involved in the fishing industry. We estimate that there are a further 110,000 jobs in sectors that exist directly as a result of the fishing industry, such as shore services and gear manufacture. That is a substantial number of jobs, and it is why we are having this debate today. This is not only to do with conservation of the seas; small and larger communities inland depend on the fishing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08112042000712">The debate has, by and large, been unpartisan, and I intend to keep it that way and to continue that spirit in my ongoing discussions. The Department was, however, accused of lacking ambition in a number of ways, not least on discards. However, I say to the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) that what we are doing on discards&#151;what the Scottish fleet is doing on that&#151;is what has helped us to get to our current position, driving forward in negotiations with Commissioner Borg and winning the argument about how to proceed in an intelligent way and achieve sustainable fisheries. We are not complacent and we do not lack ambition, and when we go into common fisheries reform we will drive forward again. We have come out of these negotiations with the big ask for the fisheries of a 25 per cent. mortality drop, but that is coupled with advances in the way we tackle discards, and I know the hon. Gentleman agrees with me that that is the way forward. The Government are not lacking ambition, and we will make progress with his support and that of other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08112042000713">The scale of the discards has been discussed by several hon. Members. In 2007, North sea fleets discarded 23,600 tonnes of cod. As I mentioned at the start of this debate, that is a disaster not only for people who hear those figures but for the fishermen, who do not want to discard. Some of our pilots, not least within the inshore fleet, have taken a more innovative approach to dealing with discards, based on landing what one catches and the close monitoring of those vessels. When I have met those involved, I have found the response to that encouraging. They see our approach as the way forward,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="20" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>20 Nov 2008 : Column 453</b><br>
and we will build on it. We have run two discard pilot projects in recent years, the first of which was on the north-east coast prawn fishery&#151;a copy of the details of that project is in the House of Commons Library. The second was a joint project on the Irish sea involving the UK and Ireland, and we could talk more about that. We are seeing that our approaches are successful and that they are helping us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08112042000714">A number of hon. Members rightly raised the issue of the displacement of effort. We need to examine it, as it no use putting in place measures that just move the problem along. A general reduction in effort, which we are examining under the revised cod recovery plan, should ensure that the displacement of effort for which there is scope does not occur. These restrictions limit an effort by these vessels whether or not they are catching cod, and that principle becomes interesting when we consider what we do with other fisheries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08112042000715">I am dealing with some of the issues raised in interventions, so let me turn now to the eliminator trawl. That new trawl, which was developed in America, keeps cod out of the net but retains other white fish. It has been trialled effectively in the North sea, and some vessels continue to use it effectively. I know that Scottish colleagues are looking at variations of it that are better suited to hard ground. The eliminator may have some of the answers, and it is one part of the solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08112042000716">ICES&#146; advice on the Irish sea, North sea and west of Scotland nephrops is for cuts of 13 to 26 per cent. The initial Commission proposals are for 10 to 15 per cent. cuts, although, again, the full hand has not been revealed. I said at the outset where the Government intend to head on these negotiations with the Commission. The fundamentals must relate to balancing the needs of the stocks&#151;not only next year, but in the long term&#151;and the fisheries. I shall remind the Commission of the socio-economic impacts of blunt cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08112042000717">I have discussed the timing of scientific advice, so I shall skip over that now. Fleet adaptation schemes were also mentioned in an intervention, so I should say that they are optional; they are not a requirement in order to access European fisheries fund money. However, we are working closely with the industry to examine how best to maximise the impact of the EFF money available for fleet adaptation. There is more to be done, but we are doing many of the right things on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08112042000718">I turn next to quota management and its reform, both now and in the long-term. Officials and Ministers are of the opinion that this is part of a longer view. The review of the common fisheries policy, and of quota management within it, is the beginning, not the end, of reform. The hon. Member for Leominster asked what happened to the quota management change programme. That programme commenced in May 2005, but the Scottish Executive formally withdrew from it in September 2007, bringing an end to that process. A lot of good work was done and that has not been lost; it will provide a crucial input into future decisions. This is not the end of the process and, as has been mentioned, we need to deal with both current and long-term issues of quota reform and quota management within CFP reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08112042000719">I wish to set out the background to this matter. In the &#147;Net benefits&#148; report of 2004, the Government published a set of 33 strategic recommendations for the UK  <br>

fishing industry. They were worked up into 12 action points, of which six have been successfully implemented and six are ongoing, including key proposals on reforming the management of access to the common fisheries resource. That was being taken forward by the QMCP, in conjunction with the four UK Administrations. We are currently developing a project, as part of the CFP reform agenda, to consider how best to reform access to fisheries in the longer term. That is ongoing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08112042000720">The issue of marine coastal zones was also raised. It is correct that, under the marine Bill as it stands, we could ban only UK vessels from fishing in marine coastal zones, but the point is that the European Union is requiring all member states to identify offshore special areas of conservation, or SACs. We will have leverage to seek reciprocal arrangements with other member states to respect each others&#146; protected areas. We will find a way through this problem. Being in Europe is sometimes complicated, but it gives us the right outcome eventually. We will work through it, with support from hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08112042000721">I turn now to individual contributions. I thank the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and others for their welcome to me. It is good to receive their thanks today, as this is a challenging job, but with their support I will get through it. The hon. Gentleman highlighted the role of emergency services and talked about the back-up helicopter at Sumburgh airport. I can tell him that we have tried to obtain clarification of that issue. We understand that recently the back-up reserve S92 helicopter based at Sumburgh has been redeployed to the Solent to provide night-time cover for the AW139 helicopters that have been undergoing modification. I am advised that the situation will be resolved tomorrow, and the AW139 helicopters will return to full night and day search and rescue duties. If I can help with any other aspect of that matter, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will get in touch and we can take it from there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08112042000722">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned fuel costs. I am glad that they have been returning to normal, and I have discussed that with my officials. Hon. Members have also mentioned fuel duty. The fishing industry is exempt from paying fuel duty, which places it in an advantageous position compared with other businesses and sectors, but it is not Government policy directly to subsidise fuel costs, including for commercial fishing vessels. Such subsidies can lead to over-capacity, distort business decisions and act against the long-term interests of the industry. Not least, they can be discriminatory and unsustainable. However, there is plenty of assistance available for the fleet, and I should mention that the European fisheries fund can grant aid to projects to improve fuel efficiency on board vessels. In addition, several initiatives are planned to help the industry to adapt, such as the fisheries science partnership and the challenge fund, and a capping and decommissioning scheme for the under-10 metre fleet, which has been mentioned already. That is an investment of &#163;4.6 million in the industry by DEFRA, in addition to the &#163;38 million EFF money for England.</p>

 When I brought up the issue of fuel, I was not looking for subsidised fuel but for fuel that would be duty-free at point of sale.</p>

Member for Orkney and Shetland mentioned, I can assure him that we are fully engaged with them, both officially and ministerially. Our offer to the Commissioner and colleagues in other member states is active engagement; we are at their disposal. In the light of what we are talking about and as we head towards December, the EU-Norway discussions are critical. They sometimes get overlooked, but they are pivotal, not least in terms of what will happen to TAC adjustments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08112042000726">The science suggests various approaches, and the presidency may take one view and other member states another. We certainly take the view that in order to incentivise the fleet to avoid discards and to adopt intelligent approaches to sustainable fishing, we need what we have termed a &#147;substantial&#148; increase in TAC. The incentives should favour landing more cod, but killing less. We do not want fish to be dumped over the side. We will continue to make progress on that, and I am glad to hear from many hon. Members that they too want to see that happen.I already mentioned science, so I shall simply say, on wider CFP reform, that a focus on regional input is absolutely right, and it is how we intend to drive the matter forward.</p>

He referred to the Hanseatic League. It is not my strongest period of history, but I understand that it might have been a precursor of the European Union. He also talked about the impact of sub-marine work for offshore wind farms. A close eye needs to be kept on that, but I noted his balanced and commendable approach to the need for renewable energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="81120-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08112042000729">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the delicate Sabellaria reefs, which are constructed by the Sabellaria worm under the sea.

The Commission is minded to do that, as we are, and we need to actively engage with it. He was sceptical whether we could deliver.

I have asked officials to ensure that he is written to promptly. He and others asked about the changes in the size, shape and geographic spread of sea fisheries committees. I will return to the matter. I said in my initial answer that we will seek local stakeholder involvement, including that of the existing sea fisheries authority, when we consider the matter to ensure that we get things right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08112042000734">The hon. Gentleman spoke articulately about the under-10 metre fleet. NUTFA, which is going from strength to strength, and others, have stressed to me that the focus should be on the working vessels, not the slipper kippers. That is where the focus should be, and where mine will be. A sustainable future means livelihoods for the fishermen who currently fish around our coasts, and taking tough decisions on how we avoid simply dragging back fishermen to sea who have been sitting on licences. We need to find an intelligent way forward. That could mean that I lose my sudden popularity for a short time, but I am committed to ensuring that when people look back in six and 12 months, and two years and five years, they feel that we made the right decisions for the long-term sustainability of the under-10 metre fleet.</p>

Recreational fishing will certainly have a part to play in that, because the essence of the marine conservation zones and marine planning will be local stakeholder engagement.

I agree that we need to avoid what could be alarmist signals to the fleet. We actually need practical, rational discussion on the science and what we are observing, and on what we believe to be the solutions.</p>

Indeed, we have something of an undertaking with it to look at the matter. We will see what we can deliver. My officials are intimately engaged with Scottish Executive officials in trying to put the expert opinion and the views of stakeholders before the Commission. We have a long way to go, and I do not underestimate the challenge that we will face in the final stages of the negotiations, but we will try to win the very best deal available.</p>

I think that I have already dealt with that matter, but I thank him for raising it. However, to follow up on that point, the Bradley review proposed that the current 12 sea fisheries committee districts might be reduced to about six, but I have not suggested that that number is right.

Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran) reminded us of his long-standing expertise and his contribution to these debates over many years. I welcome that, and I thank him for welcoming me to my new role. He made a very balanced and considered speech. He mentioned longer-term CFP reform, and rightly said that we needed to move away from pork barrel politics. We need to have much more to do with long-term sustainability, in relation to the profitability of the fisheries and to the conservation of the seas. I should like to repeat a point that is worth repeating, by clarifying that, in the current round of negotiations, our Government&#146;s approach is to land more and to discard less. We shall continue to take that approach. The discussions between the EU and Norway will be important in that regard, and a figure of between 25 and 30 per cent. has been mentioned in relation to increases in total allowable catch, but we will have to see. We have to achieve the right incentives for the fleet.</p>

He illustrated his point with the example of people who were working 20-hour days for &#8364;240 a month, with no health and safety provision and, in some cases, no accommodation. I am happy to continue to discuss that matter with Government colleagues here and in the Scottish Government, but it is an important issue that we have already recognised. The Border and Immigration Agency and the Department for Transport are leading on this issue, with input from others, including DEFRA.  <br>

I will be doing that, however; I have hugged many a fishermen already&#151;not literally&#151;and I am enjoying the experience. He called this the most important job in government and I know that he will relay what I say to my right hon. Friend in No. 10, but it certainly is a very important job.

He has lobbied effectively and hard for his under-10 metre fleet, and continues to do so. He urged me to make the necessary changes and I will do so, using his input and listening to his constituents and others. He rightly said that warm words will not be enough this time and that we need decisions, and I agree. Although my decisions may not always be popular, I will use input from people in this Chamber and elsewhere to make the right decisions for the long term. In this role, I might sometimes be more unpopular than popular, but this is not a popularity contest. I also thank him and others for the representations that they have made.</p>

However, things have moved on and the composition and fishing patterns of the inshore fleet have changed.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise in the House tonight the long-running saga of the liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. I am delighted to see on the Front Bench my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, who will reply to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08112060000004">On 5 July 1991, while waiting for a visitor in Central Lobby, I was approached by a dozen employees of BCCI who had come to lobby Parliament, and indeed any MP they met, about the dramatic closure of BCCI by the Bank of England, supported by the Government. At the time, BCCI was the seventh largest bank in the world. The closure had happened mid-morning on that day. This is the longest-running campaign that I have been involved with in my 21 years in this House. In the current global financial crisis, in which banks have taken centre stage, it is vital that we do not lose sight of the victims of BCCI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para30"><a name="08112060000005">The bank was founded in 1972. At its peak in 1990, it operated in 73 countries, had more than 400 branches, and had assets in excess of $20 billion. It had approximately 6,500 depositors in Britain and a million depositors worldwide, 40,000 employees worldwide and, reportedly, &#163;4.7 million actually in the bank in the United Kingdom. The decision to close down BCCI was primarily taken by four men: Eddie George, then Governor of the Bank of England; Brian Quinn, the head of banking supervision at the Bank of England; John Major, the Prime Minster; and his Chancellor, Norman Lamont. It was closed because the Bank of England, which of course was then the regulator of the banking system, said, in effect, that the bank was full of fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para31"><a name="08112060000006">The customers were in shock. The depositors included small depositors in places such as Leicester and West Bromwich, many local authorities&#151;most significantly Western Isles council in Scotland&#151;Channel 4 and many other household names. Right hon. and hon. Members joined me in meetings with Mr Major, Mr Lamont, Mr George and the liquidators. We attended many of the hearings and listened to many of the judges in what I regard as a successful campaign to bring the attention of the world to the victims of BCCI. I remember the words of Prime Minister John Major that there was a big black hole in the bank and that creditors would get no money from it&#151;a position supported by the liquidators, Touche Ross, which told depositors not to hold their breath and expect any payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para32"><a name="08112060000007">With its owner, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, one of the richest men in the world, its exotic locations, its colourful stories and its sheer size, it remains a mystery to me why no one has made the story of BCCI into a Hollywood movie. At the time of the closure, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi undertook to underwrite the entire losses in the bank in order to ensure that nobody would face hardship. It was as if he and his advisers had foreseen what the Government would subsequently do in relation to Northern Rock 17 years later.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para33"><a name="08112060000008">There is still a great deal of suspicion about why BCCI was actually shut down. Abu Dhabi was even persuaded by the Bank of England to remit the last amount of more than $600 million that would have enabled the bank to re-emerge as a strong and more viable international banking group. That took place the day before the bank was actually shut. The decision to close down the UK operations was a greater mystery in the light of the fact that BCCI&#146;s UK operations had a high liquidity ratio&#151;the ratio of deposits to lending was 60:40&#151;and were declared clean and untainted by the Bank of England. BCCI&#146;s UK operations could easily have been ring-fenced, but that option was ignored, whereas some countries ring-fenced BCCI local operations in order to protect the deposits and employment of their own citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para34"><a name="08112060000009">The then Chancellor set up the Bingham inquiry, chaired by one of this country&#146;s most influential jurists. The definitive report, although not dealing with the reasons for closure or apportioning blame, set up the current system of banking supervision. The Financial Services Authority was born out of BCCI, and we were assured that never again would banks be unregulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para35"><a name="08112060000010">Thousands of people lost access to their savings without notice, causing some of the greatest of human tragedies&#151;the break-up of homes and marriages, cancelled medical operations, lost jobs, ruined careers and, in some cases, suicide. Thousands lost access to their bank accounts and saw their businesses collapse. Just in case hon. Members think that the issue is not as relevant now as it was 17 years ago, let us look at what is happening in Iceland. It may take years to get back all the money frozen in the Icelandic banks when they went bankrupt earlier this year. The parallels with what happened in the aftermath of BCCI are very clear, although they are not on the same scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="81120-0019.htm_para36"><a name="08112060000011">Local authorities are drawing on the BCCI example as a warning of the situation they could find themselves in. Mark Finch, head of finance at Breckland council, told members of the council&#146;s audit committee last Friday that the present situation could become as drawn out as the one involving BCCI, saying:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081120/debtext/81120-0020.htm"/>


<a name="81120-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08112060000053"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;BCCI has not yet been resolved. These things can take years and we have no idea how much we can expect to receive back or when it is likely to be received. We will wait and see with bated breath but we do not yet know how we will be treating it on our balance sheets at the end of the year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08112060000012">Deloitte Touche, appointed the BCCI liquidator, was quick to judge immediately after closure that it would not be able to recover any money, and suggested a payment of zero to 10 per cent. on the dollar for the company&#146;s worldwide depositors. Although the liquidation may have proved complex and involved a number of jurisdictions, in excess of $1.2 billion has been charged in worldwide fees. The liquidation has made multi-millionaires of the accountants and lawyers. Some $700 million of those fees have been spent in the United Kingdom, where Deloitte and Touche has billed for about $296 million, while Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Lovells, two firms of solicitors, have earned themselves $173 million. To be fair to them, I should say that Ralph Preece, a Deloitte and Touche partner, defended the size of the fees, claiming that creditors would not have seen such high returns without the firms&#146; litigation work. However, that is disputed by members of the creditors committee and by former employees, who objected to  <br>

<notus-date day="20" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>20 Nov 2008 : Column 463</b><br>
the unsuccessful litigation that the liquidators mounted against the Bank of England. I pay tribute to the former employees who led that campaign, including Runi Kahn, Qaiser Malik and Mohammed Qayun.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08112060000013">The liquidators have realised a total of about $7.7 billion to date, and a reported further $800 million is being held back for future fees. On that basis, the liquidators fees would represent about 25 per cent. of the recoveries. In many quarters, including some of the accountancy fraternity, such high fees are considered obscene. On several occasions, the depositors and former employees have called on the Insolvency Service at UK Trade and Investment to launch an investigation into the liquidators&#146; fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08112060000014">It is strange that a $20 billion bank, which allegedly lost $10 billion in a black hole, according to its liquidators, and has liquidation costs well in excess of $1 billion, has still been able to pay almost 90 per cent. of the money to its depositors. All that money has been found from somewhere, and the depositors have been paid back, albeit in dribs and drabs, over the past 17 years. One wonders where the bank would have been today if it had not been forced into liquidation and had taken the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi&#146;s generous offer, which was rather like the injection of cash that some other Gulf royals recently gave to our own Barclays bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08112060000015">Even if we give the liquidators the benefit of the doubt, we find that what disappoints so many is the apparent unwillingness of successive Governments&#151;not just the present one&#151;to intervene to bring the liquidation to an end. Over the past 17 years, I have met every Minister with responsibility for insolvency matters to try to get them to use their good offices to halt the haemorrhaging of money, but every one of them, advised by the Insolvency Service, has declined to do so. At ministerial meetings, they have offered tea, biscuits and sympathy when I have taken BCCI employees and creditors to see them, but they have claimed not to have a relevant interest. I therefore look forward to meeting the present Minister about the case. After many requests, he has kindly agreed to see me on Monday, and I hope that, apart from tea, biscuits and sympathy, he will give us some positive news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08112060000016">Like the liquidators, Ministers feel that the size, complexity and difficulties of the case mean that it has had to carry on for a long time. The Insolvency Service, the regulator of insolvencies, has stood by and done absolutely nothing, and final statutory responsibility rests with the Secretary of State, but either he is unwilling to intervene or he has been advised not to do so. It is perfectly acceptable for Ministers to intervene to help Northern Rock, HBOS-Lloyds TSB and, as we heard just a few moments ago on our televisions, Royal Bank of Scotland; but, for some reason, it is not acceptable for them to help to end this liquidation. Ministers in the Department for Trade and Industry have been described as the Pontius Pilates of this very sad story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08112060000017">However, there is some news&#151;just before Christmas. The global liquidators of BCCI have announced that the payment of a seventh interim dividend of 2.5 per cent. to admitted creditors will be made in December. I welcome this. It brings the total dividend to date to 86.5 per cent.. and at least one further dividend will be paid, although the amount and the timing remain uncertain. That is the problem&#151;the uncertainty and mystery about how things have been done.</p>

 Every time the creditors&#146; committee and other creditors have asked that the creditors be brought together to hear from the liquidators about what has been happening during the liquidation, they are told what they have always been told&#151;&#147;Sorry. The list is too long. We can&#146;t send out letters because it will cost too much.&#148; Yet the liquidators are still prepared to charge the bank for the liquidation. I hope that one of the things that the Minister will do is say to the liquidators that there should be another creditors&#146; meeting so that the creditors themselves can question what the liquidators should be doing. However, why should the liquidation stop when there is so much more to squeeze from the carcase in liquidators&#146; and lawyers&#146; fees?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08112060000022">It may have gone unobserved, but if the liquidators&#146; fees had been properly audited and found to be excessive, the depositors might have already received almost 100 per cent.&#151;if not the full 100 per cent.&#151;of their money. Perhaps it is time for the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee to hold an investigation into the longest running liquidation in history. Surely Parliament&#151;which, frankly, has also been sitting on its hands in dealing with this matter&#151;should want to discuss why the liquidation has gone on for so long, so that we could at least learn the lessons and make sure that things are not done in the same way in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08112060000023">Next Wednesday, I will be 52, but I live in hope that while I am still a Member of this House, and still alive, such an investigation can take place. If it can, those who have stood by and sat on their hands will finally be called to account. The BCCI liquidation needs to be called to an end. We need to ensure that such a thing does not happen again and to examine thoroughly how the Insolvency Service operates. Clear legislation is needed to protect the interests of the public, no matter how a bank closes, and to monitor the work of liquidators when they feel that they cannot hold creditors&#146; meetings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08112060000024">The Chancellor was right to take the stance that he did in protecting and preserving Northern Rock and to take the other measures to protect this country&#146;s failing banking system. UK taxpayers are now stakeholders in a number of banks. A repetition of the final catastrophe and human tragedy that was the closure of BCCI was avoided by the Government this time. However, the Government should not forget the victims of BCCI.</p>

of BCCI, to secure justice for its creditors. I wish him in advance a happy birthday next Wednesday and thank him for his kind comments. As he would expect, I have read some of the previous Adjournment debates on this issue, and I give no weight to the fact that he said some very kind things about the Ministers who preceded me in this role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08112060000027">My right hon. Friend has campaigned with great energy to keep the issue in the public eye, and throughout that period his objective has been simple&#151;to ensure that the hard-working savers, businesses, local authorities and others who, in good faith, deposited their funds in BCCI get as much of their money back as possible. I assure him that the Government share that objective, and we will certainly not forget the victims of the whole process. He set out the history and the scope of the bank&#146;s operations at their height. He also made comparisons between what happened then and the more recent banking troubles that the Government have been dealing with. I want to return to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08112060000028">The main focus of my right hon. Friend&#146;s speech was a series of perfectly legitimate questions about speed, the fees involved, and the role of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and its predecessor Department. Let me begin with the issue of time scale. The liquidation of BCCI was, as he said, one of the largest and most complex ever seen in this country. It involved a bank that operated in many different jurisdictions around the world&#151;I think that he said 70 countries, which is broadly in line with our understanding. That complexity has of course contributed to the length of time that the liquidation has lasted. It is not the longest in the country&#146;s history&#151;there have been examples that have lasted many decades&#151;but 17 years is a very long time on anyone&#146;s time scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08112060000029">The next question is what that 17-year period has resulted in. As my right hon. Friend said, when the bank first went into liquidation, there were fears that creditors might see very little of their money returned. However, the success rate has been greater than was initially feared. The creditors have now received about 84 per cent. of their debts and, as he remarked, they will receive a further 2.5 per cent. before the end of this year. Although the process has indeed been very lengthy, it has not been one that has not yielded the results for depositors for which he has campaigned with such skill and determination over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08112060000030">The UK liquidation&#146;s domestic receipts, together with its share of global receipts, amount to some $4.18 billion, which includes a sizeable payment from the bank&#146;s majority shareholders. Significant realisations have also been raised from legal actions taken against third parties on the basis of fraudulent action. In addition to the next dividend, the liquidators hope that it may be possible to pay a further, final dividend to creditors at the end of the liquidation.</p>

 When the liquidators informed the Minister of that fact, did they indicate when the end of the liquidation would be?</p>

 I do not have a date, but, as my right hon. Friend is aware, the liquidators hope to pay a further dividend beyond the one that is due before Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08112060000033">In order to realise such sums, it has been necessary for the liquidators and their legal advisers to expend considerable amounts of time, effort and money. Let me say something about the fees to which my right hon. Friend referred. The fees involved are large&#151;there is no doubt about that. The English liquidators charged remuneration fees of just under $350 million and incurred legal costs of a further $232 million in the 16 years ending in January this year. Those are very large amounts of money in anyone&#146;s language, and I understand why he draws attention to them. The issue is not just the fees, but what is recovered as a result of them. As I said, substantial sums, certainly more than was expected at the start of the process, have been recovered for the creditors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08112060000034">In addition, my right hon. Friend presses me to intervene in the process, and I have no doubt that he will do so again when we meet to discuss the matter next week. I shall say a little more on the Government&#146;s role, the relationship between creditors and liquidators in the setting of fees and the scrutiny of the ongoing liquidation process. Under English insolvency legislation, the setting of the liquidators&#146; basis for remuneration is a matter for the company&#146;s creditors, either in a liquidation committee or at a meeting. It is not set by the Secretary of State. If creditors feel that the remuneration charged by a liquidator is excessive in the context of a case, they are able to challenge that remuneration at court. In this case, the committee could go even further. It approves the liquidators&#146; remuneration on a quarterly basis. It is clearly right that those with an economic interest in the outcome of a liquidation have the greatest influence over its processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08112060000035">My right hon. Friend referred to meetings and how they are supervised. The BCCI&#146;s liquidation committee, which represents the creditors, has played an active role in the course of the liquidation and has overseen the actions and conduct of the liquidators. It is the committee&#146;s responsibility to ensure that they are satisfied with the level of remuneration that the liquidators have charged.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="08112060000036"><a name="81120-0020.htm_spnew3"><a name="08112060000061"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 My right hon. Friend must know that every time the creditors&#146; committee wants to challenge the liquidators&#146; fees, it has to go to court and do so before a judge, which means more money being spent out of the bank. It has to pay its lawyers, the costs involved and the liquidators&#146; costs, if it loses. Every time it makes a challenge, more money is spent on fees. That is the problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="08112060000037"><a name="81120-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="08112060000062"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 That is consistent with what I said. It has the option to go to court; that is how insolvency law operates. If creditors wish to challenge such fees, they must go to court to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08112060000038">My right hon. Friend stated that the liquidators are holding back a further $800 million for future fees, if I heard him correctly. I am informed that that is not the case, and that a lesser sum is being held back, in respect of unclaimed dividends and dividends declared where the relevant creditors have yet to confirm their claims.</p>

<p><a name="st_o299"><a name="08112060000039"><a name="81120-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="08112060000063"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>

 It is certainly more than $100 million less than the figure my right hon. Friend quoted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08112060000041">The liquidators meet, consult and correspond with the committee on a regular basis. There may be a suggestion that the committee is not able to exercise its  <br>

scrutiny role, and that the liquidators are free to proceed, if I may use the vernacular, in their own way and in their own sweet time, but it is worth stressing that the committee, which is representative of the body of the bank&#146;s creditors, receives its own independent legal advice funded by the liquidation itself. If one looks at the make-up of the committee, one finds that it does not look like a body of people who would be easily duped. The committee meets quarterly and may also have ad hoc meetings in the year. It receives its own independent legal advice, which the court has authorised as an expense of the liquidation. The committee receives a full set of accounts each quarter, together with a report on the liquidators&#146; activities in that period. Aspects of the liquidation can be very complex and the independent legal advice ensures that the committee can understand the content and the import of the reports that it receives. The liquidators&#146; remuneration is approved by the committee on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08112060000042">My right hon. Friend may wish to take issue with that, and he is perfectly free to do so, but it is not a process in which the creditors have no voice, or only a passing voice. The liquidators prepare an annual budget for their activities, and their performance is measured against that on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p><a name="st_o301"><a name="08112060000043"><a name="81120-0020.htm_spnew7"><a name="08112060000065"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 That is most helpful and useful. All we ask is that ministerial minds be focused on that issue from time to time and that the Minister write to the liquidators regularly. If necessary&#151;if the Government are hard up&#151;I will give him the stamp, but he is the Minister for post offices, so that should not be a problem; some remain open in this country. Will he write to the liquidators and ask what the current position is and why things are taking so long? A letter from the Minister carries so much more weight than a letter from a Member of Parliament or anyone else. It concentrates the minds of the liquidators. He simply has to put in his diary every two months a reminder to ask what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="st_o302"><a name="08112060000044"><a name="81120-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="08112060000066"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 I assure my right hon. Friend that I do not want the process to last longer than necessary, but, when it comes to closure, there are interests to be weighed in the balance about the recovery of moneys for the creditors. It is important to bear that in mind. He asks me to bring the matter to a close as soon as possible and I appreciate his desire for closure because 17 years is a long time. I also appreciate the anxiety that those who lost money through no fault of their own as a result of having deposits in the bank at the time of the liquidation have experienced. However, let me make a couple of points about closure. It is not determined by me or the Secretary of State. The problem of time scale&#151;long as it has been&#151;must be balanced with the creditors&#146; interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08112060000045">If the creditors judge that the well of recovery has not run dry and that some sums could still be recovered, and push up the anticipated 86.5 per cent. recovery rate to which my right hon. Friend referred even higher, it may not be in their interests to bring the matter to a premature close. The creditors and the liquidators must make that judgment. The Department and the Secretary of State have not turned their eyes away from the problem. Throughout the period, the Secretary of State has received an annual report from the liquidators on the conduct of the liquidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08112060000046">The closure of such a liquidation, which has run for nearly two decades and realised billions of dollars for  <br>

creditors, is not a simple process. It must also be borne in mind that the English liquidation is not the main procedure. Bank of Credit and Commerce International was registered in Luxembourg, and the main proceedings are the Luxembourg liquidation. Consequently, Luxembourg liquidators, Luxembourg law and the Luxembourg court have the most important say in when and how the liquidation is closed. It is essential to the efficiency of the global liquidation that all three liquidations close in an orderly and co-ordinated fashion when the time comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08112060000047">I repeat that the process should take no longer than necessary, but I stress that it must be consistent with the creditors&#146; interests and the possibility that further moneys may be recovered for them. The English liquidation must close before the Luxembourg liquidation, but that can happen only when the winding-up process is complete. Deciding on the right time to close down the liquidation is a matter for the liquidator and the liquidation committee, working with the other global liquidations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08112060000048">Potential further recovery is a live issue. As I understand it, one recovery involves the enforcement of a judgment that exceeds $300 million. Any recoveries from that would be paid into the liquidation for the benefit of creditors. All parties would like the liquidation to finish as soon as is reasonably practicable while continuing to act in the creditors&#146; best interests. When they are pursuing such moneys, we must ask whether it is in their interests to engineer the closure of the liquidation. I am happy to meet my right hon. Friend next week, as has been arranged, but I want to be clear about my role in such situations and to stress the interests of the creditors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08112060000049">I turn to the parallels that my right hon. Friend drew with the banking crises that we have seen in recent months. He mentioned Northern Rock and some other cases. However, I suggest that there is a legal difference between the Government&#146;s role in stopping a collapse of the banking system&#151;that is what has driven the recent interventions, which started with Northern Rock and was followed by some others&#151;and the Government&#146;s legal position in respect of the running of an individual liquidation many years after it began. As I have said, insolvency legislation gives that role to creditors and liquidators. I appreciate my right hon. Friend&#146;s point about intervention, but I am not sure that we are talking about a parallel situation. However, I am happy to discuss that with him further when we meet next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="81120-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08112060000050">In conclusion, I again pay tribute to my right hon. Friend&#146;s tenacity and to the compassion that he has rightly shown for those who had deposits in the bank. The Government have not turned a blind eye to the problem; nor do we intend to do so. We operate within the insolvency legislation, which gives a role to the liquidators and a role to the creditors through the liquidation committee. That is the context in which the liquidation is being done. Substantial sums have been recovered, and I hope that more can be recovered for the creditors affected. When discussing how long such a long-running liquidation should take, it is important to bear that interest in mind, as well as our legitimate desire to bring the process to a close within no longer a time scale than is necessary.</p>
