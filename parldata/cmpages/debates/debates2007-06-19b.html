We have already recognised in the high level output specification discussions the centrality and importance of greater capacity on the railways. That is why I made it clear in March that as part of that statement this summer, 1,000 extra carriages will be provided for the country&#146;s railways.

In particular, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, just last week, provisional figures were published showing that there has been a rise of 85 million bus and light rail passenger journeys, and that 80 million of those additional journeys are made in the English non-metropolitan areas.

There is a direct train only once every one hour 52 minutes; on many trains, people have to change if they want to go to London, a journey which can take as long as two hours 36 minutes; and an open return often costs &#163;139. That is a very poor service between an important area of the country and London, so we need that improvement. Will the Minister redouble his efforts in persuading Network Rail to take on that project?</p>

 For every Conservative Back Bencher who complains about not enough money being spent on the rail network, their Front Benchers complain that we are spending too much. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about the line but, as he will know, it is currently served by 18 trains in each direction every day&#151;a level of service that would be envied in many other parts of the country. However, it is entirely up to Network Rail to decide if and when to spend money on the project, and how much.</p>

 The Minister says that this is nothing to do with central Government.

 Local authorities might take advantage of various sources of funding for such schemes. The Department for Communities and Local Government offers several opportunities through regeneration funding.

 There is an ongoing debate in the industry about the length of franchises; the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to point that out.

 I must tell my hon. Friend that if we are pandering to the <i> Daily Mail</i>, it is not working. The prison population has certainly risen. Overall, crime is down, convictions are up and the Labour Government are catching more criminals because of the greater numbers of police on the streets. Irrespective of that, I recognise the problems that my hon. Friend identifies. We want there to be better use of community sentences, and stronger community sentences. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 has given 12 orders which I hope will be utilised more effectively over the next three years than they have been, with a great deal of effort, over the past three years. I am confident that we can build extra prison places, manage the prison population in an effective and productive way to prevent reoffending, and build on community sentences to ensure that people do not return to jail or to offending once they have been through the criminal justice system.</p>

Select Committee on 22 May, at that point arrangements were made to have a working group of the Lord Chief Justice, at which Department for Constitutional Affairs officials engaged in discussions in preparation for the Ministry of Justice. However, the most important thing is that section 1 of the Courts Act 2003 lays out the Lord Chancellor&#146;s responsibility to ensure that there is an &#147;efficient and effective&#148; courts service, and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 ensures the independence of the judiciary. Moreover, a concordat sets out the agreement on relationships between Ministers and judges. I am sure that all those things will have the full support of this House.</p>

 As there is not even agreement with the judges on interim working arrangements, let alone a long-term solution to what the Lord Chief Justice sees as a serious constitutional problem, is the Minister prepared to allow a situation to continue in which there is a real divide between the judiciary and the Executive, even about the implementation of the concordat in the Act that she has described?</p>

 There are interim working arrangements in place. The courts are working and the judges are ensuring that justice is done in the courts. The Lord Chancellor and the Ministry of Justice are ensuring that the court system is operating. Of course there are operational issues that the judiciary raised with the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department and are now raising with our Department, and those are being considered. I have seen the evidence that was taken by the right hon.

the prison budget of some &#163;2 billion. Obviously, it is the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor, under section 1 of the Courts Act, to ensure that there is an efficient and effective system to support the carrying out of the business of the courts, and that resources are dedicated to that. As for the independence of the judiciary, that too is enshrined in statute and underpinned by the concordat.</p>

 It is a shame that the Government are not able to provide those statistics, because one in five people going into prison have a drug dependency problem. Many of them then have treatment in prison&#151;detox and rehab. They start their treatment regime and then, when they leave prison, they go to the back of the queue and lose out on all the benefits that they might have experienced if they had been able to continue their treatment.

That would save money and be much more effective. It would be cheaper than prison, and cost the country much less in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07061943000188">The Ministry of Justice has been in existence for five weeks. I announced on 9 May my Department&#146;s approach to penal policy. I announced that we would continue to protect the public by providing prison places for those whom the courts determine need custody, and that that would include asking the Sentencing Guidelines Council to review its guidance. I also made it clear that we should make best use of the best community sentences where evidence says that they reduce reoffending and offer more effective punishment, and that we would continue to deliver in line with the recommendations of Lord Carter&#146;s 2003 review, including end-to-end offender management and public service reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07061943000189">Today, I wish to provide details to the House of how the Government will ensure that all those whom the courts send to prison can be accommodated. I will update the House on the detail of Lord Carter&#146;s inquiry into prisons, announce the building of further custodial places, and set out further measures to improve the functioning of our prisons and to reduce reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07061943000190">We have made public protection from the most dangerous criminals a priority. We are bringing more offenders to justice than ever before&#151;25 per cent. more than when we came into office. Those who commit violent or sexual offences can now receive an indeterminate prison sentence. The length of time for which criminals are sent to prison has increased, with the average custodial sentence in Crown courts rising by 25 per cent. between 1995-2005. As the House will know, more people are being sent to prison than ever before. That means that, overall, there are 40 per cent. more serious and violent offenders in prison than in 1997. Since 1997, the prison population has increased from 61,467 to 81,016 today, a record high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07061943000191">Nationally, crime is falling. There are 5.8 million fewer offences than in 1997, but we know we need to go further. We have been working intensively with 44 of our most deprived communities, where crime and disorder are highest, to reduce crime still further. Early indications show that the work is making an impressive impact and crime is falling at twice the rate in those areas than the national average. The Government are determined that the public be protected from dangerous offenders, and that court sentences and other orders be obeyed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07061943000192">In addition to those measures, we have taken steps to increase the resources spent on community punishments and interventions designed to address the causes of crime among offenders. Tough community sentences have been developed, which have proved more than successful in reducing reoffending.

We will be starting work immediately on 500 of those extra places and the first of the additional places will come on stream in January 2008.</p>

I am today publishing the terms of reference for his review. As the terms of reference make clear, Lord Carter will look at the long-term future of the prison estate and at both the supply and demand of prison places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07061943000196">Those additional measures will bring on more prison places, which are much needed. Currently, as I mentioned, the prison estate is near to full. To ensure that we can accommodate all those sent to prison by the courts, we will continue to rely on police cells, as a temporary measure, and where necessary court cells. I am personally grateful to chief constables in England and Wales for making police cells available to us where necessary and to the Court Service for more than 100 court cells to date. The use of police cells may be necessary until the end of this year at the latest, pending the increase in capacity from some of the 8,000 prison places coming on stream and then, at the beginning of 2008, from the additional prison places I have announced today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70619-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07061943000197">In addition to increased prison capacity, I have authorised the issuing of guidance to prison governors to allow them to make wider use of the prison rules provisions to authorise release on licence for offenders who are coming to the end of their sentence. [Hon. Members: &#147;Ah.&#148;] The guidance will authorise release on licence, in accordance with existing prison rules, up to 18 days before their release date, for those who have been sentenced to a determinate prison sentence of four years or less.

The criteria specifically exclude offenders convicted of serious sexual or violent crimes, those who have broken the terms of temporary release in the past and foreign national prisoners who would be subject to deportation at the end of their sentence.

Is not the crisis that we now face a failure of design, for which the Chancellor bears responsibility? We heard today from Manchester that he will ensure extra fast-build prison places to address the problem. But why&#151;if the Labour Chief Whip, the right hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith), would stop chattering&#151;why, if the resources are available, were they not made available in time to prevent this predictable chaos? How much is the Chancellor providing? How many places will be built, and when will they be available? Are these not likely to be fast-fill prisons that will soon demonstrate the short-term nature of this Government&#146;s approach?</p>

In previous years, as they released inmates early from open prisons, they transferred unsuitable offenders from the secure to the open estate. Will the Minister undertake to the House in terms that he will do no such thing again?</p>

We are committed to raising the number of prison places, but we are also committed to things that I know that&#151;deep down, secretly&#151;he supports, such as looking at better community sentences, ensuring that we get people out of prison by reducing reoffending, and looking at people who have under 12 months to serve to see whether we can make sure that they do not reoffend in the future. I know that he believes in that, although the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) takes a different view.

In many cases, those sentences are for crimes where there is no evidence that the increase produces better public protection or a bigger reduction in offending.

We are acutely aware that extra legislation can often put pressure on prison places. We will continue to look at that and I hope that we are making progress.</p>

Will there be a speedy increase in the number of places for people with drug problems who would do better in secure rehabilitation centres instead of crowding our prisons? Given that we know that the numbers are approaching record levels, will we have from today a change to the crazy policy that has seen prison numbers and reoffending going through the roof and a realisation that unless we bring prison numbers down, rather than building more prisons, we will not be giving the public what they want: less crime and, above all, less reoffending?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has a thoughtful approach to such issues. One of the Ministry of Justice&#146;s prime jobs is to try to prevent reoffending. We need to examine several long-term solutions, such as how we can have an impact on drugs and alcohol treatment, how we can work in the community, and how we can invest more in giving additional treatment to people in prison. However, I cannot get away from the fact that the public need to be protected from the growing number of serious and dangerous offenders. We are examining how we can build extra prison places. Our strategy involves building prison places and examining the wider issues of community sentencing and the way in which to prevent reoffending.</p>

It is our objective that there should be fewer women in prison. With the benefit of that report, we can achieve that over time, with difficulty, with resources and by examining the prison estate as a whole as part of Lord Carter&#146;s review. I have already said that I expect the Government to respond to that report by late autumn at the latest, and I very much hope that we can do that.</p>

 As my hon.

I need to ensure that we expand the public understanding of the benefit of those schemes. They are tough schemes that prevent reoffending, often much more effectively than does prison. As I am trying to do, I need to visit the probation service, sentencers and the Prison Service and promote the idea that community sentencing has a value. In many cases, particularly for low sentences, it is much better at reducing reoffending and it makes community pay-back visible to people in the community. I want to ensure that we promote the benefits of community sentences both to the offender and to the community, for the simple reason that they prevent reoffending. That means, ultimately, that somebody&#146;s garden shed will not have been broken into; somebody will not have been robbed on the street or mugged; and that some event will not have happened that would have caused crime to rise.

 My hon. Friend raises a very important point.

One of the matters on which I gave evidence was the need to put in prison people who are dangerous, violent or sexual offenders, so that the public can be protected from them. Equally, I emphasised the need for an examination of strong community sentences. We already have in place a very large number of community sentences. I think that we should increase that number if we possibly can and encourage sentencers to do so, not because such sentences reduce the prison population, although being honest, they do, but because they reduce reoffending, which is the most important consideration in bringing forward those ideas.</p>

 With prisons bursting at the seams and a new Department in charge, this is a watershed at which certain fundamental principles can be re-evaluated. Will the Minister say whether he intends to examine the key performance indicators within which the Prison Service is required to operate, because in the past organisations such as the Prison Reform Trust have criticised the KPIs, arguing that they do not measure whether the needs of the prison population are being met in respect of the distance that prisoners are kept from home and time spent out of cells? Will he revisit that matter, which will respond to sensitive involvement by the new ministerial team?</p>

 As my hon. Friend will know, I have been in post for five weeks. I need to examine a number of issues with the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), who has done a good job in the past year. We will examine the performance of the Prison Service with Phil Wheatley and the Prison Service and the National Offender Management Service. The Prison Service is doing a good job of meeting the objectives set by the key performance indicators. We need to keep the matter under review, and I will certainly consider some of the issues that my hon. Friend has mentioned.</p>

 Does the Minister accept that in the past 10 years four Home Secretaries have responded to media pressure by taking away discretion on sentencing from the courts and putting them under pressure, which has dramatically increased the prison population to almost double what it was when I was Home Secretary, without paying the slightest heed to the inevitable moment when they would hit the buffers and there was no accommodation? Although I do not know what the new Ministry of Justice is for, except perhaps to make the Minister an innocent victim&#151;he has made a statement about a fiasco for which he is plainly not responsible&#151;will the new Department produce a change of culture in which the platitudes about community sentences and making prison only for those who need it are turned into reality by returning proper discretion to the courts and ensuring that prisons are used only for violent, dangerous and recidivist criminals in conditions in which there is some hope that some of them will be rehabilitated?</p>

 I am grateful for the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s concern for my innocent victimhood. I do not regard those ideas as platitudes. I believe in community sentencing and considering how we can prevent reoffending in the long term. We are doing a considerable amount of work and putting extra resources into drug treatment orders, which is much more than what happened when the right hon. and learned Gentleman was in office. There is a big problem with drugs in the United Kingdom today, and we need to examine imaginative ways to deal with it. Drug treatment orders are important.</p>

 As one who does not read the <i> Daily Mail </i>and who views the prospect of 100,000 of my fellow citizens being incarcerated more as a source of national regret than a symbol of political virility, may I compliment my right hon. Friend on having discussed the alternatives? May I draw his attention to the problem of secure accommodation and bail hostels, particularly in west London, where there are no vacant places today. I appreciate that the Minister launched a programme yesterday, but what hope can he give to those justices of the peace who want to place people in bail hostels but who are unable to do so?</p>

 My hon. Friend has raised an important point. As he has mentioned, yesterday the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South, announced an increase in the number of bail hostels in the course of this year. The bail hostel places programme will provide approximately 1,000 extra places in the course of this year, and I hope that we can examine the pressures in areas such as west London and make that figure a reality. Those 1,000 places are not cheap, and they are paid for through taxation. We make that our priority; other parties may not.</p>

 Is the Minister aware of the contribution to prison overcrowding made by the growing length of time spent in prison by unconvicted remand prisoners? In particular, there has been a big growth in the population of young offenders institutions since 2001. The issue is not more prison places, but more efficient courts.</p>

 There is a range of issues. I accept that many people are held on remand, in some cases for very long periods. Again, I cannot generalise. Some people are held on remand because they may ultimately be convicted of serious violent and sexual offences, and the public need that element of protection during the course of the trial process, which can be very long. I hope that in many cases the Ministry of Justice can serve an important function in considering the criminal justice system in terms of the supply side of prisons and community sentences, and in the efficient management of the Courts Service, so that we help to reduce some of the delays that mean that people spend a long time on remand before their conviction or acquittal.</p>

 Last week, my constituent, Kenneth Milburn of Enderby, was jailed for five years for illegal possession of handguns. The judge said that the crime did not merit a jail sentence and that he jailed him with &#147;great sadness&#148;. That was the result of poor legislation passed by this House. Mr. Milburn threatened or harmed nobody, and he is unlikely to reoffend. Will the Minister look at that case so that perhaps we can free up a place in prison for a burglar and let out Mr. Milburn, who is unlikely to harm anybody, and who is deaf, 63 and in ill health?</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that I am unable to comment on individual cases that he may bring up.

However, the gun legislation is in place for a positive reason&#151;to help to reduce gun crime and its impact. If the hon.

 Does the Minister agree with staff at Dorchester prison, which I recently visited, whose assessment is that one of the main points of entry into prisons of illegal drugs and other contraband is through abuse of the release on licence system? In effect, what happens is that somebody who is released on licence loads themselves up with drugs in every available orifice, commits another offence, and then goes back into the prison having been used as a camel so that the drug material gets in there. I was told that that is the main means by which drugs are now getting into Dorchester prison. In that case, why is the Minister extending the system?</p>

 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. We need to tackle drug trafficking into prisons, perhaps through a range of measures given the variety of means whereby those drugs get in. Under the current system, 405,259 releases on temporary licence took place in 2005, of which only 339 are failures. The modest extension of the scheme that I announced today will involve about 1,400 individuals. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point very seriously. We need to tackle drugs in prison, and there is a range of ways in which we can undertake that. The Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South, is working hard with the Prison Service to do so. If the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an exceptional point. A large element among the people who are in prison today face the problems that he mentions. Through his all-party group on speech and language difficulties, he is doing significant work to raise those issues in Parliament. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have given him a commitment to consider the matter in detail. It is important that we raise the basic literacy and numeracy levels of people entering prison. We need to create, as I hope we will, greater employability for them on their release, because employability, confidence, literacy and numeracy are the keys to preventing reoffending.</p>

 Is this not yet one more blow to honesty in sentencing&#151;the relationship between the nominal sentence and the time spent in prison?

 Again, I cannot go into the details. The reply depends on many factors, including a risk assessment that the prison governor undertakes and the crime that the individual committed. The statement made it clear that serious and dangerous offenders and a range of others will not qualify for any scheme. We will ensure that, when possible, individuals who are reaching the end of their sentence and can return home earlier under licence can also, if recalled in the event of any breaches, be helped to reintegrate into the community at the end of their sentence to help with some of the pressures that we face in the Prison Service and that they face in their daily lives. I cannot comment on the particulars but, if the hon.

 On 16 April I announced that the Chief of the Defence Staff had appointed Lieutenant-General Sir Rob Fulton of the Royal Marines, currently the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar, to lead an inquiry into the operational circumstances surrounding the seizure of 15 of our personnel on 23 March. I also announced an independent review of the media handling of the incident and its aftermath, and subsequently confirmed that it would be led by Mr. Tony Hall, chief executive of the Royal Opera house and formerly the BBC&#146;s director of news and current affairs. I am grateful to General Fulton and Tony Hall, who have both completed their respective reports to tight deadlines with all the professionalism and candour that was expected of them. I am now informing the House of their findings, as I undertook to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07061943000270">I begin by stressing that the two reports are very different in nature and therefore require different handling. Mr. Hall&#146;s review is a public document, which is today placed in the Library of the House and published on the MOD website. As I made clear in April, General Fulton&#146;s report is classified, because it addresses operational and tactical issues, which cannot be discussed in public without increasing the risks to our forces. Nevertheless, those events and the issues that they raise are legitimate subjects of parliamentary and public concern. To balance those factors, I decided that I would give a broad outline of General Fulton&#146;s findings to the House, but that the full report would be given to the Defence Committee. That has been done; I leave it to the Chairman and members of that Committee to comment today as they see fit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07061943000271">General Fulton highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the northern Gulf as an operating environment. We are there as part of a coalition maritime force carrying out a variety of demanding tasks against a backdrop of wider and rapidly evolving international issues. His report is impressively thorough. It has looked at every aspect of the incident, and others that may hold valuable lessons. To complete the report, he has carried out lengthy interviews with all the people involved and at every level of the chain of command.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07061943000272">Hon. Members urged that specific matters should be considered, and I would like to tackle some of those points to the extent that I can do that, consistent with the constraints of operational security that I mentioned.</p>

He concluded that, although there were some broad similarities in the circumstances, the events were different, and that the requisite lessons of the time were learned and applied. Secondly, he considered the rules of engagement and confirmed that they were entirely appropriate for the task and remain so today. Thirdly, his report is clear that the event was not the result of equipment or resource issues, including helicopter availability, the size and suitability of the Cornwall or the size and armament of the boarding party&#146;s boats. The coalition force commander in the Gulf has reiterated that he is  <br>

content with the capabilities deployed by the UK but, as ever, we keep that under review. Finally, General Fulton confirmed that the presence of the BBC on HMS Cornwall was not a factor in any of the operational decisions taken on 23 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07061943000274">General Fulton has, however, identified some shortcomings. This was a coalition operation&#151;hon. Members will not need me to spell out the merits of that&#151;but clearly there is a cost in terms of added complexity. Despite that, it is vital that the procedures that we all share can adapt rapidly to change in such a complex strategic environment. General Fulton&#146;s report has identified some faults in that respect, and we are addressing them with our coalition partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07061943000275">General Fulton has also identified some specific national shortcomings. The central lesson is that we must improve our ability to identify and assess the risks that this complex environment generates, and to train and posture our forces accordingly. He noted the need for improvements in a range of areas: in the handling of intelligence, in communications, in doctrine and in training&#151;both individual and collective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07061943000276">On training in particular General Fulton notes&#151;and this is worth repeating&#151;that the Royal Navy&#146;s generic training for operations remains world class. By the time a Royal Navy ship deploys on operations, it is well prepared for a wide range of potential roles. However, the report does identify a need to improve some training specific to particular tasks, including boarding. Furthermore, it recommends that in future we deploy specialist rather than composite teams for boarding operations&#151;a recommendation that we have already acted on. General Fulton also recommends that we ensure that we learn quickly from the experience of other nations operating in the area and get better at sharing information with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07061943000277">Above all, General Fulton&#146;s report concludes that the events of 23 March were not the result of a single gross failing or individual human error, but of the coming together of a series of vulnerabilities, many relatively small when viewed in isolation, which together placed our personnel in a position that could be exploited by Iran. His conclusions suggest that there is no case for disciplinary action against any of the individuals involved&#151;<i> [Interruption.]&#151;</i>but his report emphasises that many of those individuals could have done more to prevent what happened. In that respect, it identifies some failings, both collective and individual, which the Royal Navy&#146;s chain of command will consider and deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07061943000278">General Fulton recommends a range of actions to address the shortcomings that he has identified. An action plan has been drawn up and a number of measures have already been taken, allowing us to recommence boarding operations in April, and further measures are under way. The Select Committee on Defence has been briefed on the action plan, but as I indicated at the start, there is a limit to how much I can say to the House. I can say that I, together with the chiefs of staff, are content that General Fulton&#146;s report and the resulting action plan will ensure that our people are properly prepared for future operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07061943000279">I turn to the Hall review, and let me say at the outset that we accept all of its recommendations. In my statement to the House on 16 April, I made it clear that the intention of the review was not to embark on a witch  <br>

hunt focused on apportioning blame for the decision to allow media payments to the returning detainees. Like the Fulton report, the Hall review confirms that it would be wrong and counter-productive to focus on finding individuals to blame for these events. What was needed was a calm and dispassionate assessment of what happened in order to learn the lessons and to improve the ability of the MOD and the services to handle similar events in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07061943000280">Tony Hall makes it plain that on the question of whether payment should have been made for individual stories, there was a</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07061943000282">I welcome the report&#146;s clear recommendation that media payments to serving military or civilian personnel for talking about their work should simply not be allowed. That confirms my announcement on 9 April of an interim ban on acceptance of media payments. Work is now under way to make detailed amendments to service and MOD regulations and guidance to reflect that conclusion. The report further identifies that work is needed to establish a clearer policy on the naming of individuals and their families in such cases. That work, too, is already under way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07061943000283">The report also identifies some broader themes. Perhaps most crucial is the huge change over the past 25 years in the context in which media coverage of operations takes place. Media access has increased significantly and the agenda has changed. The focus on the individual, for example, inevitably clashes with the service ethos of group first, and the desire to present instantaneous news from the heart of the action can conflict with the need for operational security. That means that, although it is clearly in the interests of the MOD and the media to co-operate, tensions exist. We need to manage those tensions better, and we need to rebuild confidence between the MOD and the media. The report also makes it clear that we need to help the media to develop a better understanding of defence issues so that they can be set in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07061943000284">The report recommends that, for the future, the lead for the media handling of such episodes should lie clearly with the MOD, rather than with a front-line command or a single service. It also recommends some strengthening of what the report notes is a relatively small central press office. The report also makes clear a number of recommendations on the need for clearer decision-making processes. I accept those entirely. Unequivocal understanding of who should sanction what is essential. The recent capability review, published in March, also highlights that, and in response we have already been looking at how we can clarify responsibilities and improve accountability within the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07061943000285">I hope that it is clear that we have sought, wherever possible, to learn the lessons from this difficult episode, both operationally and in terms of media handling, and to be open and accountable in so doing. We have had two reviews: one independently led, and today put into the public domain; the second, of necessity, classified, but shared with the Defence Committee to  <br>

Both are focused on the future, determined to help ensure that we do not make these mistakes again. The Chief of the Defence Staff and my permanent secretary will take the lead in implementing the recommendations. I expect the great majority to be implemented by the end of this year, and many of them sooner than that.</p>

They are respected everywhere for their bravery, their professionalism and their ability to get results.

It is also important to avoid giving the impression that no one is to blame for what was a national embarrassment. I am sure that the Select Committee will want to consider the report in great detail in the months ahead. Over the past few days, I have had the chance to speak to a large number of Royal Navy personnel, many of whose views concurred closely with those expressed in the Fulton report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70619-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07061943000289">I would like to raise a number of specific issues with the Secretary of State. It is clear that the frequency of successful and unresisted boardings produced a diminished sense of danger, so that the equipment used on the occasion that we are discussing was deemed suitable. Is he satisfied that, in an increased state of alert, we have sufficient alternative and additional equipment available? Is he convinced that the helicopter cover is now sufficient, both in platform numbers and hours allocated, for the task of boarding? On intelligence, is he satisfied that information from UK and other sources is sufficient to warn of an increased risk of attack, above and beyond a necessarily high base line, given the approach and activities of the Revolutionary Guard? He also mentioned training. Will he tell the House more about where in naval training the failures have occurred? We are pleased that, in future, specialist teams will be used for boarding. It is, after all, dangerous work, not work experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07061943000291">There is an issue that I think the whole House needs to discuss, that of embedded media. Can the Secretary of State tell us, as a matter of fact, whether the BBC crew was still on board HMS Cornwall when the seizure took place? The authors of the report clearly do not believe that the presence or otherwise of BBC personnel was a factor in our operational decisions, but what about the other side? What about the Iranians? Does not the presence of live television crews in a place where we know the Iranians are constantly considering attacks provide a potential incentive for them in the knowledge that they have a ready media audience in attendance? Does that not deserve far more attention in the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07061943000292">The whole report is scathing about the Government&#146;s approach to media handling. The Ministry of Defence did not take control, therefore the media set the agenda. It would have been sensible to involve the Press Complaints Commission, but the Government refused the offer. There was a collective failure of judgment. Many people could have said no to the sale of individual stories, but no one did so. Ultimately, that is the Secretary of State&#146;s job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07061943000293">One final issue needs to be raised&#151;Labour&#146;s handling of MOD press since 1997. There are 229 people in the Government&#146;s communications department at the MOD. This Government abolished uniformed single-service press officers in their attempt to control and politicise MOD press, and it is clear that they could not even do that competently. The Conservatives believe that the abolition of uniformed single-service press officers was a mistake, and an incoming Conservative Government will reverse it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07061943000294">As I have said, I believe that the Government&#146;s handling of the whole crisis, especially the media aspect, made a national embarrassment incomparably worse. The Secretary of State has already apologised to the House for his role in the media handling, and naturally the House accepts that; but the whole House will expect it not to be repeated. Our forces are the best in the world, and they certainly deserve better.</p>

 I think that I can deal with all the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that any of them transgressed the border between what we can discuss in the House and what cannot be discussed for reasons of operational security.</p>

There are matters that must be put right, which is why I was determined that we would conduct the two reviews whose results I have announced today. I asked for the faults to be exposed and for recommendations to be made on how they could be corrected, and I believe that both General Fulton and Tony Hall have done that for us. I intend to see this through, and will see through the operational side with the supervision of the Select Committee.</p>

As I said in my statement, the report makes it clear that the incident did not result from equipment or resource issues. Indeed, the coalition maritime commander has explicitly said he is content that he has the resources required for the tasks that he is given; but, as ever, we keep resources under review. I have said many times that we will always  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07061943000298">There has been a great deal of speculation about helicopters, but the bottom line is that if the helicopter had been asked to stay at the scene, it could have done so. There is sufficient helicopter support for these operations. That issue, however, comes within the broader continuing review of resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07061943000299">Was there an intelligence failure? General Fulton&#146;s inquiry centred on exactly that sort of question. Clearly, any failings in this regard would be operationally sensitive, but I can tell the House that there were shortcomings, which will be addressed through a plan overseen by the chiefs of staff. The Select Committee has been briefed in detail, and I do not intend to go into any further details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07061943000300">The generic training given to the Navy through FOST&#151;flag officer sea training&#151;was considered to be world class against the test of the review, but a shortcoming was identified in relation to the need to train for specific tasks, particularly boarding. That is exactly what has been addressed, as well as the issue of there being specifically nominated boarding parties instead of the way in which they were previously put together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07061943000301">The BBC was present on HMS Cornwall at the time. General Fulton&#146;s reputation goes before him, and I am sure that all who know him know that he has done a thorough and professional job. He has come to the view that the BBC&#146;s presence had no operational effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07061943000302">I shall now turn to the Hall report and the media&#151;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks about intelligence; I have already addressed that issue. There were shortcomings in respect of intelligence, which have been dealt with, but I shall not go into the detail of them in public for obvious reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07061943000305">I realise that my reply is lengthy, but a series of questions were asked to which I should respond. At the heart of the Hall report is the judgment that the MOD, as opposed to the single service, should have taken responsibility for the media and for the media handling of the captives when they were returned. I accept that recommendation and that analysis. However, although that judgment is correct, it does have the benefit of hindsight. It was the view of those planning to receive the released captives that they should be received back into a military environment. The same analysis informs a lot of calls for us to receive injured servicemen back into a military environment, in order to enable them to recover from the trauma that they have been through. The view was taken, which I agreed with at the time, that it was right to bring these people back into a service environment. However, as the Hall report makes clear, there was at the time a media storm, and the level of media demand outstripped the ability of that environment to cope. I accept that, and I also accept that we need to make sure that that never happens again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07061943000306">An offer from the PCC came on the day of the captives&#146; release. The Hall report recommends that there should be engagement with the PCC in developing the ability of our media shielders to support people through the early stages of such a process. I also accept that recommendation. It is entirely different from what was offered to the MOD, and which it did not respond to. The Hall report does not conclude that single-service press officers should be reinstated, but it does say that there should be more engagement of a higher level of military personnel in the MOD press centre and the communications operation. We will act on that recommendation.</p>

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement and for his briefing to colleagues last night. We should also be grateful to Tony Hall for giving us this report on the media handling. However, I still hold the view that I have held throughout: the media handling is something of a red herring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07061943000308">The Secretary of State has taken responsibility, which is right because permission for the revelations could only have been given by him or in his name. I simply seek a reassurance from him that among the lessons that are learned will not be a temptation to gag military officers from talking to the press in the course of their ordinary duties. Some of them have intimated to me that they occasionally feel that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07061943000309">The Secretary of State has told us that the Fulton inquiry was thorough; I have no reason to doubt that, and I entirely understand why it cannot be published. However, there are a number of unanswered questions. We gather from the statement that there was not a problem to do with equipment or lack of helicopters, that there was not a major intelligence failure and that there was not any particular serious error anywhere in the line of command. In that case, what exactly did go wrong? Did the Royal Navy simply fail to comprehend the level of threat that the Iranians posed? If so, that was in stark contrast to our land forces in Basra and on the border, who understood only too well what the threat was&#151;and, indeed, that has been discussed many times in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07061943000310">The Secretary of State says that lessons must be learned quickly from the experiences of our partners. Do the other nations involved in this work use constant air cover? It remains to me unfathomable that these dangerous operations could be taking place in contested waterways without a greater degree of air cover than seemed to be available within the coalition at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07061943000313">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that the situation could have been much worse, but the fact is that it did not develop into something much worse. There is some credit to be given to those who secured the return of these 15 young people much more quickly than many informed commentators said could be done, in a situation in which the Iranians did not get the public apology that they so craved for their own propaganda purposes, and in which their own behaviour and illegal activities, exposed across the region, diminished their standing in the region among those countries whom they most tried to impress by these actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70619-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07061943000314">The hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions that I will seek to answer quickly. It is not our intention to gag the armed forces; however, they are in a difficult position. We need to find a balance between openness and risk to security. The overriding ethos of the services is the putting of the interests of the whole above those of the individual. Every single individual in the services who seeks to engage with the media takes on that challenge, which is why there is a clear and unequivocal rule that if a member of the services wishes to engage with the media, he or she requires permission so to do. Some are barred by contract from so doing, as the report reveals. This is all very sensible, but a significant degree of communication goes on between members of the armed services, the media and the public. We are not going to move back from that openness, but we will have to manage it against the various challenges, particularly those to security.</p>

 We will consider the PCC training recommendation with a view to acting on it, but I know from the reports about the families that have come back to me how grateful they were for the support that they received during the crisis. When their family members were returned, many said unequivocally that they had been well supported by the generic help that the MOD had been able to offer in facilitating help from the services. The report reveals that, when it came to helping the families, we sought to have in place an officer representing the service and a person acting as a media shield. It may be that both should operate in the same chain of command, and be given support with their media skills. That seems to be the recommendation made by Hall, and I intend to see it through.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his support. There is no doubt that HMS Cornwall was operating in Iraqi waters and that the incident itself took place in Iraqi waters. Indeed, people will recollect that in the early days the Iranians provided us with a set of co-ordinates, and asserted that was where the event took place, but when we told them the co-ordinates were in Iraqi waters they changed that set and found one in their own waters.

 With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I do not accept that. Boarding parties have always been made up of people with other specialist skills, specifically trained for that job.

In relation to the media-handling side, I was adamant to the House that I was not instructing a review that was intended to be a witch hunt. It was intended to identify what happened, the lessons that needed to be learned and how we could move forward, which is exactly what I intend to do.

Our nation faces growing housing problems that can be met only by building new, and improving existing, council housing, and by having a fair financial balance between local authorities and housing associations in the provision of affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70619-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07061943000368">Since 1997, fewer than 1,800 council houses have been built in total&#151;in contrast to an average figure of well over 180,000 each year in the decades following the election of the Attlee Government. Despite a great cost to the taxpayer and an enormous loss of accountability, the private sector, including registered social landlords, has built at an annual rate of only 15,000 homes in the past 10 years. It has proved to be incapable of dealing with the increasing overcrowding and homelessness in many parts of our land; only a renaissance in public sector construction can do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70619-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07061943000369">There is a strong national consensus on the matter. Some 3 million tenants, 1.6 million households on waiting lists, trade unions and councillors of all parties are agreed. The six candidates for the Labour party deputy leadership have said that we must have a new housing policy and three successive party conferences have voted to encourage and finance direct investment in council housing&#151;the fourth option. It is the purpose of the Bill to provide a legal framework for that fourth option so that it can be an addition to, or a replacement for, the current three options, which are all seriously defective.</p>

Legally, housing associations are private companies and they borrow directly from the private market. RSL board members are often paid, banks are in the driving seat, and executives are on inflated pay scales, funded by soaring rents from hard-pressed tenants. Councils that are trying to coerce or bully their tenants into stock transfer will claim that the Government&#146;s rent convergence formula ensures that rents will increase by the same amount whether tenants transfer or not, but in reality that formula is worthless. New tenants can be pitchforked up to the target rent immediately, service charges are not included and the valuation method can and will be manipulated to generate much higher rents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07061943000371">My Bill would aim to protect tenants&#146; rights to lifelong secure tenancies, which are sacrificed following a stock transfer. The assured tenancy on offer is not the same thing at all because a promise by a new registered social landlord not to use its greater powers in law, for example on eviction, is nothing like comparable to the statutory rights that secure tenants have at the moment. Although we are told that transfers will be made to &#147;community based&#148; organisations, that often does not last because landlords can get into a financial mess and be taken over by remote businesses, or can become caught up in the merger mania that is fuelled by the Housing Corporation&#146;s drive for mega RSL groupings. We should not forget that tenants have no vote on such takeovers and mergers and that the new owners of the housing have no obligation to deliver on old promises made by others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07061943000372">The Bill would protect tenants from the scandals that we see when unscrupulous and uncaring councils use large-scale funding that comes from the pockets of local taxpayers to run misleading and unbalanced campaigns to frighten tenants into voting for stock transfers. Together with so-called independent consultants and advisers, they produce dubious glossy propaganda booklets that, in essence, say to tenants, &#147;You have no alternative but to vote yes to transfer.&#148; That is an outrage. We need no crystal ball to point to the cracks and stains on the rosy pictures painted by those who are hellbent on flogging off, at a knock-down price, public assets that were built by and for successive generations of tenants and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07061943000373">The track record of stock transfers is often pretty dreadful. Shelter found that homelessness worsened in areas with stock transfers, while the National Audit Office said that it cost thousands more to improve each home after transfer than would be the case if councils were just given the money to do the work themselves, which the Bill proposes. Any genuine consultation on the future of publicly owned housing must, as a minimum, ensure that tenants hear all the arguments, that there is equal access to public funds for both sides of the case to be put, and that there is a formal ballot on any change. As that is just what the Bill spells out, I urge a moratorium on any further ballots until the new Prime Minister&#146;s housing policy becomes clearer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07061943000374">May I turn to my Bill&#146;s proposals to ring-fence rents and capital receipts for direct investment and to require equal financial treatment in the provision of affordable homes for local authorities, and for housing associations and other RSLs? The argument of the ancien r&#233;gime about to leave office is that we simply cannot afford the level of investment in publicly owned housing that is brought in by private finance. There are two fatal fundamental flaws in that approach: first, the theory that there is no cost to the taxpayer in the options for privatisation when there most definitely is; and, secondly, the theory that there is a huge increase in public expenditure with direct investment when there most certainly is not. Tenants are right to demand a level building site for councils on which the fourth option can be constructed, as opposed to the three privatisation options. The same amount of public funds spent on subsidising stock transfers, arm&#146;s length management organisations and the private finance initiative should be available in the growing number of cases when council housing is retained.</p>

The moonlight robbery campaign points out that tenants pay an average of &#163;800 per year more in rents than they get back in management, maintenance and major repairs. That represents a national annual total of more than &#163;1.5 billion. It is unacceptable that money is being leeched from council housing and council tenants in such huge volumes to subsidise private developers who are building houses that are still priced way out of the reach of ordinary, hard-working families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07061943000376">The unequal financial treatment between unaccountable and often remote housing associations and democratically elected local housing authorities defies belief. For example, making debt write-off conditional on stock transfer is a form of blackmail, and my Bill would bring that to an end. The Auditor General has stated that that form of debt repayment has no net effect on the Exchequer, so why is it denied to local housing authorities, but doled out to RSLs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07061943000377">Rental income must be ring-fenced in the national housing revenue account and the pooling of local rents for national distribution needs an overhaul. Housing support for hard-up areas should come from the taxpayer, not the tenant. The rigging of write-offs and gap-funding subsidies to make RSL business plans stack up is a stitch-up. A fresh approach that is rooted in real, unforced choice for tenants, and fair financial deals for councils, with the availability of debt write-off and gap funding, would benefit millions of people throughout the land. Waiting lists will shorten, overcrowding will lessen and living conditions will improve. Council estates can again be the stable and mixed communities in which many in the House, like me, have lived.

Ever since 1324, we have had in statute some provision to detain people solely by virtue of their mental ill health, although I apologise for the terms in which the legislation was couched in 1324, when the royal prerogative asserted that the king had jurisdiction over the persons and property of &#147;idiots&#148; and those who happened to &#147;fail of&#148; their &#147;Wit&#148;. Obviously, legislation moved substantially, and in the Vagrancy Act 1714, we had the first articulation of how we should be able to detain somebody purely by virtue of their mental ill health. That subsequently translated into the Mental Health Act 1959 and then the 1983 Act, which made clear the requirement for a therapeutic environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para25"><a name="07061943000399">The principles that I feel are important in this issue are pretty straightforward. First, no psychiatric unit can be a prison by another name; it must be a therapeutic environment. Secondly, any person, whatever their mental condition, whether or not it is a condition that we currently believe is curable, must have the right to appropriate treatment and we cannot simply wash our hands of them.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend confirm that the amendment would certainly enable people with personality disorders to be treated in a therapeutic environment? My concern is that people with such disorders have in the past been refused treatment on the grounds that they are untreatable according to a very rigid interpretation of the terms &#147;alleviate&#148;, &#147;likely to alleviate&#148; or &#147;not worsening&#148; symptoms.</p>

 I believe that there have been instances since 1983, and that there were certainly instances before, in which people believed that the treatability test was actually a curability test, and that because one could not cure somebody of a personality disorder, one should not therefore bother to treat them. That view is certainly not held now among most psychiatrists, most consultants working in hospitals and most of those working in mental health services today. I hope that, in future, as science advances in this area, we will be able to provide many more treatments. Who knows? Perhaps in the distant future, we will be able to get closer to curing some of these personality disorders.</p>

He was sent immediately to Broadmoor, where he spent 10 months being assessed. At the point of conviction, in trial, the judge was told that he could not send the man to Broadmoor under sentence and could send him only to a mainstream prison, because under current mental health legislation, he could not be treated.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has made a valid point. We should consider not only people who might commit a homicide, but, far more significantly, those who might be considering suicide. As last year&#146;s report on avoidable deaths by the university of Manchester pointed out, some 1,300 people who had been through mental health services committed suicide last year in the United Kingdom compared with some 30 homicides. It may be that when some people&#146;s minds are very disturbed, the dividing line between homicide and suicide is not as clear as it might be for others.

 I am a little concerned by something that the hon. Gentleman has said. Will he accept&#151;I declare an interest as a member of the BMA medical ethics committee&#151;that treatment is more than just intervention? Treatment is something that has a chance and that has been shown to be effective in having a chance, although not in every case, of alleviating the condition in some way. That is different from intervening or placing someone in a therapeutic environment. If the concern is to protect the public, it should not be done under a notion of treatability when it simply involves intervention or detention. Will the hon.

 I return to the first principle that I articulated, namely that no psychiatric unit should be a prison by another name. However pleasantly it might be arranged, we cannot detain people just for the purpose of detaining them, and there must be some kind of therapeutic benefit. That is the purpose of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para26"><a name="07061943000406">We also need to adhere to two other important principles. First, the public have a right to protection. Historically, mental health legislation has always allowed for the protection of the public.

The treatability test in section 3(2)(b) of the 1983 Act specifies that</p>
<a name="70619-0009.htm_brev9"><a name="07061943000443"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70619-0009.htm_para29"><a name="07061943000409">That is clear, but it refers only to those with a psychopathic disorder or mental impairment and not to those with other mental disorders.

However, I believe that there is a need to insert a form of treatability test if we are to get the balance right. The Lords version of the treatability test sets too high a hurdle because it insists on the word &#147;likely &#148;, as in a treatment being</p>

Is it more than 50 per cent. likely&#151;that is what &#147;likely&#148; means in most dictionary definitions&#151;that the treatment will produce one of those two outcomes? That is difficult to argue. It is also difficult to argue at the beginning of an individual&#146;s treatment under detention that their condition will be alleviated or will not deteriorate further, because the process of detention or of starting treatment may itself bring about a deterioration in the condition.</p>

 I support the general direction in which the hon. Gentleman is going but remain a little concerned. Sometimes people are treated with a small chance of success because they are consenting autonomously and are not being forced into it. Moreover, they are able to carry out a risk-benefit calculation that may well fall on the side of benefit even if the treatment is not likely to be effective. In this case, we are talking about depriving someone of their liberty, so there is good reason for the hurdle to be high. I hope that the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful case. Does he agree&#151;I think that this is helpful to his argument&#151;that the concept of purpose in relation to medical procedures was imported at a late stage into the Mental Capacity Bill in the context of making it clear that euthanasia was not acceptable, and that that was done for precisely the reason that he is adducing&#151;as part of the scope of the doctor&#146;s considerations in making the intervention?</p>

 As is so often the case, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It is a simple matter of logic that if someone says that they intend or propose to do something, and then set about doing it in a way that one could reasonably expect to have no likelihood of success, they cannot genuinely have intended or proposed to do it. Therefore, if the purpose of the treatment is</p>

Clearly, it is not right to detain somebody solely to prevent somebody else from being fearful of that person&#146;s mental condition. I do not believe that that is what &#147;effect&#148; meant, and that it referred to the condition itself.

He appeared to ignore the fact that not only one but three tests must be fulfilled to detain someone because of their mental disorder. We should add a fourth, namely the availability of treatment. It is important that detention cannot happen unless the person is suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or to an extent that warrants that. On top of that, he should be detained in the interests of his health and safety or with a view to the protection of other persons. Given that all those tests must be met, Lord Carlile&#146;s concerns about detention to treat Tourette&#146;s syndrome are not valid arguments.</p>

The relationship cannot be indirect; the manifestation must, by definition, be an element of the condition. The reason for the word &#147;manifestation&#148; is that it has a direct route into the mental disorder. Let me give an example. Somebody who is schizophrenic might suffer and be extremely angry because he has just split up with his partner. He might be furious with her. However, we should not be allowed to detain somebody solely to treat that anger unless the perhaps violent anger is a direct manifestation of the mental disorder from which he suffers. That is important.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady because she has enticed me into my next paragraph. I know that many clinicians say that it is standard clinical practice to differentiate symptoms and signs. Using that term in the Bill therefore appears nice and clear. A symptom is something that patients can articulate or feel to be part of the condition. A sign is what the clinician can objectively perceive. Those definitions are generally accepted, although some clinicians use &#147;sign&#148; differently, to mean either what a clinician can perceive through understanding of the clinical condition or what any person could perceive. That introduces an element of ambiguity.</p>

The word &#147;manifestation&#148;, which has no clinical meaning, provides much greater clarity in the Bill because there must be a direct relationship between the manifestation and the condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07061943000425">On that basis, I hope that my right hon.

All the organisations that have written to me and to her, asked for meetings with her and lobbied her as ferociously as me&#151;our last meeting was this afternoon; I hope that we never have to discuss the Bill again after today, much as I like her&#151;support that. I hope that she can put on record her precise understanding of &#147;manifestation&#148; and that she will say that the Government are prepared&#151;perhaps uniquely&#151;to accept an amendment from a Government Back Bencher.</p>

However, we should not wash our hands of people in that situation. Neither should we encourage the culture of blame, which all too often attends mental health services when somebody takes either their own or somebody else&#146;s life. All too often when that happens, the newspapers will demand, &#147;Let&#146;s find the psychiatrist who let this person out.&#148; We cannot completely eliminate risk and we have to be cautious about both detaining and releasing people. Furthermore, we should not give up seeking treatment for those who have personality disorders just because we have believed that the treatment was not very effective in the past.</p>

It is undoubtedly a compromise, but when the Minister rises to her feet, I hope that she will not just accept the amendment grudgingly. I hope that she will not feel that she is simply backing down. I hope, rather, that she will ardently embrace the amendment, because it will leave her with a better Bill.</p>

 I will speak briefly, because I want the Minister to have the opportunity of explaining why she is backing the amendment&#151;ungrudgingly, as I am sure she will. We are very pleased, as are the vast majority of those who served on the Committee, to support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). He made a forceful, intelligent and well balanced case this evening, as he did in Committee, which is why we said we were strangely endeared to his proposals. We thought then that they had a scintilla&#151;or chinchilla, as I believe he reinterpreted it in Committee&#151;of therapeutic benefit, which we believe is so crucial to the whole Bill and the whole principle of mental health. Throughout the Bill&#146;s stages in the Lords and in this House we have tried to reinsert such a provision.

To do so, as the hon. Member for Rhondda said, is to make hospitals prisons by another name. We know that the number of people who have been subject to sectioning has gone up considerably, so there does not appear to be a problem under the treatability test at the moment. We need to retain some form of that treatability test. To remove the treatability requirement, whatever the Government&#146;s intentions, is to permit indefinite preventive detention and to change the law from a health measure to one of social control, of which we have been fearful all along.</p>

Rhondda. I entirely agree with him that a treatability test is not a curability test; it is about being able to provide some therapeutic benefit, some alleviation of conditions or whatever for the person concerned. The hon. Gentleman made that quite clear when he first proposed a version of the amendment in Committee. We wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07061951000006">I have a few questions for the Minister, and I would like her to give the House some assurances. We query the use of the word &#147;manifestations&#148;. I gather that the parliamentary draftsmen had a problem with the term &#147;signs&#148;. I think that we have reached a suitable compromise on the semantics of the definitions, but it would be useful if the Minister confirmed that the word &#147;manifestations&#148; is intended to cover the same ground, and no more, than the term &#147;signs&#148;, which was the term that we originally suggested. &#147;Signs&#148; is a medical term used in connection with symptoms, meaning the evidence about the patient&#146;s condition that is elicited by observation of the patient by the doctor. The symptoms are what the patient complains of. Will the Minister tell us what would be covered by the term &#147;manifestations&#148; that would not be covered by &#147;signs&#148;? The code of practice refers to symptoms, manifestations and behaviours arising from the disorder. I assume that behaviours are now not covered, and that the code of practice will be amended accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07061951000007">As the amendment relates to the definition clause, will the Minister make it clear&#151;if she is going to accept it&#151;that it will operate as a criterion for compulsion? In other words, will she confirm that a person may not be detained unless there is medical treatment available to him, the purpose of which is to alleviate, or prevent a worsening of, the disorder?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07061951000008">A point that I raised in Committee was that the purpose needs to have an evidence base; it should not be simply the subjective view of the clinician. We have now exchanged the term &#147;likelihood&#148; for &#147;purpose&#148;, and the purpose to treat someone has to be based on evidence that the treatment should achieve the purpose, and therefore has a more than 50 per cent. likelihood of success, as the hon. Member for Rhondda has said.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman might recall that, in Committee, I originally suggested that we use the word &#147;intent&#148; rather than &#147;purpose&#148;. As I understand it, in law, the word &#147;purpose&#148; is much stronger in insisting on an element of likelihood than &#147;intent&#148; would have been, which is why I used it.</p>

problem of the Bill. It is an ethical principle of medicine that its objective is to benefit patients, although it does not always do so. Detention by the NHS, as opposed to detention by Her Majesty&#146;s prisons, has&#151;save in rare cases of epidemic control&#151;the goal of doing some real good to the patient. Indeed, the 1983 Act allows for the detention of seriously ill and at-risk patients, provided that there is a treatment likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration of their condition. That is the treatability test that, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, applied to no one other than psychopaths and the mentally impaired. The treatability test left us with the problem of those with an untreatable personality disorder, which was dealt with without conclusion by the Joint Committee, and for which our Committee did not find a solution either. Some said that such people should be released, and I think that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said that they should be interned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07061951000012">In Committee, the Government made some entirely reasonable points. One was that existing legislation could be used to ignore and duck hard-to-treat personality disorder cases. I accept that that is a problem. They also pointed out that a consistent and deliberate refusal of treatment by an aggressive psychopath, for example, could engineer his dismissal by establishing, quite reasonably, that he was not treatable. The Government therefore initially favoured the definition of treatability that stated that appropriate medical treatment was available. They pointed out, quite reasonably, that not all medical treatment goes beyond palliative treatment, and that chronic conditions are often dealt with by the management of symptoms rather than by an outright cure. The Lords, fearing that the proposals involved simple imprisonment under another name, defined &#147;appropriate available treatment&#148; in the old way, as treatment that was likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration of the condition, and we were back to square one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07061951000013">The Rhondda amendment, if I can call it that, is an attempt to bridge the gap. It removes the word &#147;likely&#148;, and defines &#147;medical treatment&#148; as having the purpose of alleviating, or preventing the worsening of, mental disorder and its manifestations. It recognises that psychiatry is a relatively young science, and that remedies are not sureties or even always probabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07061951000014">Even if it will not always prove successful, detaining desperately and seriously ill people who are at risk&#151;which, as the hon. Member for Rhondda explained, is what we are talking about&#151;with a therapeutic purpose seems to me to be generally justifiable, subject to the normal rules on advocacy, appeals, tribunals and so on. I believe that the amendment can and should be supported, provided that the Government and those who tabled it make it clear that by &#147;manifestation&#148; they mean symptoms rather than the public impact made by a person&#146;s behaviour. Mental provision should not be about hiding people away and ignoring their conditions.</p>

 I rise only to express my delight and amazement that the impassioned speech I had prepared to support this vital amendment is not necessary, and to try to allay the anxiety about the word &#147;sign&#148;. The full description is &#147;physical sign&#148;, meaning that which is found on physical examination of the patient. I am afraid I know very few psychiatrists who still possess stethoscopes, and I rather doubt that many of them actually examine patients. I entirely agree that &#147;manifestation&#148; is far the most sensible word.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) on assembling such a powerful coalition against me. There is not a grudge in sight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07061951000017">My hon. Friend set out very clearly all the ways in which he had tried to address this difficult issue. Let me remind the House what the Government hoped to achieve by removing the treatability test in the 1983 Act and replacing it with an &#147;appropriate medical treatment&#148; test. I am sure that Members, especially those who served on the Committee, will know that&#151;as I think everyone has now acknowledged&#151;the treatability test did more harm than good. As my hon. Friend said, it required clinicians to predict that treatment would be likely to work before certain patients could be detained. As he also said, on occasion it has been misinterpreted as meaning that patients could be detained only if they could be cured, rather than treated. That led to a culture in which, too often, patients with personality disorders were turned away from services on the grounds that they were supposedly untreatable. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) gave the example of a particularly disturbing incident in her constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07061951000018">That culture was bad not only for public safety reasons but because of the trauma that it caused to patients, their families and their carers. It also held back the development of services for people with personality disorders, despite the clinical advances being made. I believe that as a result of our removal of the treatability test, such development will be enabled rather than frustrated by legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07061951000019">The wording of the test has given some patients a perverse incentive to refuse to engage with treatment, in the hope of arguing that they cannot be detained because the treatment is not likely to work. I have been told of disturbing cases in high-security hospitals where patients have been advised by lawyers not to engage with treatment because it would lead to release. I know that all members of the Committee were concerned about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07061951000020">The new &#147;appropriate medical treatment&#148; test requires a patient&#146;s medical treatment to be</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07061951000021">That is much more than the treatability test currently requires. Nothing in that test requires medical treatment to be appropriate to the patient as an individual, and, unlike the treatability test, this test applies regardless of diagnosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70619-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07061951000022">Accusations were made that the new test would require detention without proper treatment. That is not the case, and is not what was intended. As my hon. Friend said, an amendment made in the other place would effectively have reinstated the treatability test, and in some cases would have made it worse by extending it to all areas of mental disorder. We removed that amendment in Committee because of the problems that it would have created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07061951000024">The amendment that we are discussing today has considerable support from Members in all parts of the House. I have given it serious consideration, and have met representatives of several organisations. I recently met members of the British Medical Association, who urged me to support the amendment provided that it was clear that &#147;manifestations&#148; were linked to an underlying mental disorder. My hon. Friend rightly explained that manifestations of a mental disorder were the way in which the disorder was manifested. Clearly a disorder can manifest itself only in the thoughts and actions of the person who has the disorder, not in the reactions of others. The crucial difference is that this amendment describes the purpose of the medical treatment; it does not turn on the likelihood of treatments achieving that purpose.</p>

Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) asked about the difference between signs and manifestations, as did the hon. Members for Southport (Dr. Pugh) and for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor). We believe that &#147;manifestations&#148; is better than &#147;signs&#148; because the latter can be interpreted more restrictively as only the things that clinicians observe in a clinical setting. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest was getting at that with his stethoscope point. Some clinicians use &#147;signs&#148; to mean only what a clinician can observe through examination at a specific time, which would exclude, for example, reports by third parties of self-harm or suicide attempts. The examination would, therefore, be confined to what was happening there and then. That is why we believe that &#147;manifestations&#148; is a better word to use than &#147;signs&#148;.</p>

 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07061954000005">My speech will take a little longer than the Minister just took in eventually forcing herself to say that she supported the last amendment we discussed. I hope that she will take a little less time to reach the same denouement on new clause 12. It should come as no surprise to her, as it mirrors amendments tabled in the Lords which she promptly savaged in Committee on very poor grounds. I hope that she has reconsidered and consulted experts, and will admit the error of her ways by now agreeing to restore this rightful amendment to the Bill, whose provisions were originally added to it in the Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07061954000006">New clause 12 represents a basic principle of mental health law: that patients should be involved in, and informed about, their treatment. People with mental illness are unpredictable. That is not something that just happens and goes away; it can come back, and people might live with many episodes of mental illness over many years. As a result, many people with mental illness develop a great knowledge of what works best for them when the illness flairs up; they develop coping mechanisms. They will therefore have their own views on the long-term use of what are powerful and potentially harmful drugs. Such drugs might be deeply unpalatable for some; we have addressed side effects in the past, such as weight gain, diabetes and disabling, embarrassing and at times painful movement disorders. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07061954000007">It is essential that patients are involved in, and informed about, their treatment, and where they retain capacity, as many do, their wishes should be respected. The principle that compulsion should be the last resort underlies our approach to the Bill. For people with a mental illness, the best forms of therapy involve the trust of the clinician, who has the power to prescribe powerful&#151;mind-altering or physical feature-altering&#151;drugs. More than for any physical illness, it is essential that there is a position of trust between the patient and the clinician.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07061954000008">We must respect the autonomy, personal integrity and personal responsibility of the patient. That is a basic human right. In the Bill in its current form&#151;without the impaired decision-making amendments, as added in the Lords&#151;there are inconsistencies compared with how we treat physical illness. The Bill is also still stigmatising, so we have reinserted the amendment that gives an impaired decision-making test, acknowledging that if someone suffers from a mental disorder, it does not automatically mean that they are not fully able to make decisions. That should help to reduce stigma and enhance personal autonomy and responsibility. I would hope that the Minister&#151;along with all the other people and organisations who are interested in mental health&#151;supports that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07061954000009">The addition of the impaired decision-making provision also makes the grounds for non-consensual medical interventions for people with a mental disorder similar to those for people with a physical disorder, thereby helping to reduce stigma and discrimination. I think that all Members agree that far too much stigma is still attached to mental illness. We have a lot more to do to reach a position where somebody going for treatment for a mental illness is viewed no differently from somebody going to a hospital for treatment for an illness such as cancer or heart disease. We are still a long way from achieving that. At the basis of our perceptions on this subject and how we can change them is the way we configure our laws on how people with mental illness are treated. That is why an impaired decision-making test is essential.</p>

 There is something I do not understand. We are talking about a situation in which two clinicians have already established that a person is suffering from a mental disorder and needs to be compulsorily admitted for treatment. Part and parcel of such a mental disorder is some degree of thought disorder&#151;in a sense, that is the manifestation of the disorder. How does the hon. Gentleman&#146;s extra condition of judgment being &#147;significantly impaired&#148; help the clinician who has already made the judgment that that person has a serious mental disorder?</p>

 The hon. Lady debated that with us in Committee, and I shall respond to her points later. However, it is important to recognise that many people with mental illness retain capacity and should therefore have the right to influence their treatment.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that when we think about people who are detained, we may forget the spectrum of conditions for which people are sectioned? Some are voluntary admissions but many are in crisis, and it is often the sections made under crisis that we think about. However, I have known many cases in which people being sectioned were calm and rational through the admission process, so there is a spectrum of conditions.</p>

 That is absolutely right and reflects the point that I was making. It is an unpredictable process, and people go through highs and lows. Of the 47,000 sections last year, some 20,000 occurred after voluntary admission. Surely we want to encourage more people to engage with mental health services as early as possible, so that their condition is treated before it becomes more extreme and they have to have more extreme treatment, and might then be subject to compulsory sectioning. We are trying to encourage best practice and trust in the clinician, and to encourage people voluntarily to engage with mental health services.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman very much. I was simply going to point something out, through him, to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). He is talking about capacity, but my point is, what will the phrase &#147;significantly impaired&#148; add to a clinician&#146;s judgment? &#147;Capacity&#148; is a readily understandable term.</p>

 In order to make some progress, perhaps the hon. Lady and the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07061954000020">It is important to remember that if a patient with depression has a potentially fatal physical illness such as heart disease or cancer, they may be treated for it only if they give capacitor&#146;s consent, or if they lack capacity and such treatment is in their best interests. In other words, the law permits that patient, if they retain decision-making capacity, to refuse treatment for an illness such as heart disease, but not for an illness such as depression. That is surely inconsistent and wholly illogical, and we are trying to achieve some consistency in the way that this legislation is framed. I make no apologies for returning to this very important principle in the Bill.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right on both counts, and I will touch on that issue briefly in a minute. As the Minister is always keen to refer to that Act when it suits her, perhaps she will acknowledge that point now&#151;when it suits us, for a change&#151;so that we can draw on that experience, limited in time scale though it is so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70619-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07061954000025">Genevra Richardson&#146;s expert committee on the 1983 Act recommended an approach to compulsion based on capacity. In her submission to the Public Bill Committee, she said:</p>

The presence of impaired decision making as a condition for the use of compulsory powers is essential if we are to apply the recognised principles of health care equally across mental and physical disorder. It will help significantly to reduce both the discrimination reflected in the Mental Health Act 1983 and the stigma which feeds on it. In the years since the publication of our Report our understanding of the nature and extent of the stigma attaching to those with mental disorder has greatly improved...and it is clear that the retention of the impaired decision making amendment would mark a significant step in the battle to combat it. Far from seeking to deny treatment to those who need it, the impaired decision making condition would place mental and physical disorder on an equal footing and would begin to break down those barriers which deter people from seeking the help they need.&#148;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is arguing a fine line.

If the new clause is accepted, the number of such people might increase, and I cannot vote for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause knowing that that might be the case.

 I would say to them that it is a tragedy, and that if suitable services had been available for their loved ones, some of those suicides&#151;never all&#151;might have been avoided.

Moreover, there is no evidence that the inclusion of an impaired decision-making clause would reduce or increase the number of people under compulsory treatment in any case. The hon. Gentleman must also consider how the legislation is currently framed, and the fear that patients who retain some capacity might have in presenting to services if they think that they are then much more likely to be subject to sectioning and to have their own wishes, knowledge and experience overridden. They might not present to those services at all, and would therefore not get any help from them. Their condition might fester under the clinical radar and, as a result, they could be even more likely to commit suicide or to commit some harm against members of the public.</p>

It is a fine line, but surely the point is that it is better to encourage and entice people to engage with those services. Offering a framework that respects their integrity and their wishes when they retain the capacity to have sensible wishes is surely more desirable than saying that their wishes will be overridden, simply because the legislation does not accommodate them.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman also accept that it is all very well to say that the person should engage with the services on a voluntary basis, but the trouble is that in practice the services are often not available at the moment of crisis, such as in the middle of the night or at the weekend?</p>

 If the services are not available at the moment of crisis, having a piece of legislation that says that the person&#146;s wishes can be overridden will not make any difference. It is the services that make the difference, and the person may think that it is not worth engaging with the services, or they may be deterred from or frightened of doing so&#151;perhaps because they have had long experience of mental health services or bad reactions to drugs that were forced on them against their better judgment. They might decide that they would rather suffer than run the risk of being dictated to by a psychiatrist who might be acting in their best interests, but who overrides their wishes even if they retain their capacity. The danger of those people slipping under the clinical radar is as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than the scenario the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>

 That is the point that I have tried to make. If somebody has reached such a traumatic point in their life that they are contemplating suicide, they will, in most cases, have impaired decision-making capability and, therefore, the system and the legislation could pick them up. We covered that point in Committee, and if the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) will not acknowledge that, we will have to agree to disagree. He does not have empirical evidence for his view, as I do not, so I am siding with giving some credence to the decision-making capacity of the patient.</p>

As has been said, the mental health legislation in Scotland has the same criteria as this new clause, albeit for the assessment stage as well as the treatment order. Anecdotal evidence from psychiatrists and social workers in Scotland suggests that it is not causing dilemmas for clinicians. The principle has been recommended for Northern Ireland, and it is a criterion for admission in other jurisdictions, including Ireland, New South Wales, North Carolina&#151;where the famous Dr. Swartz hails from&#151;Israel and Saskatchewan.</p>

 That is a fair point, because people&#146;s conditions do fluctuate. That point was addressed in Committee and in some of the submissions made to it. The new clause would not remove the discretion of clinicians to make a judgment on how someone&#146;s condition varies.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman still has not addressed the point that I made earlier. Other parts of the Bill refer to the &#147;capacity&#148; of patients to make decisions. The new clause talks about the ability to make decisions being &#147;significantly impaired&#148;. I have asked him to explain how that extra test will add to the ability of the clinician to make a judgment about whether someone should be compulsorily detained. Is he applying a different test to mental capacity? If so, is it a higher test that the mental capacity test or a lower one? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> If it is the same test, why does he not talk about capacity, instead of significant impairment of judgment?

 I hope to be helpful to my hon. Friend by pointing out that within the context of mental health legislation, clinicians regularly work with two tests that are interrelated. For example, they regularly work with the concept of capacity to consent to treatment as well as notions of insight into illness. That is not unusual, and that is probably what the hon.

 The proposed test is a lower one, but my understanding is that the word &#147;capacity&#148; is used to refer to brain damage, which can be physical as well as mental.

 I am trying to understand the point made by the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey). I was not a member of the Committee, although I accept that she was and that she has explored the matter in detail. She said that the existing legislation contains a clear capacity test, but I do not think that it does. Essentially, a doctor or an appropriate clinician judges that a person is suffering from a mental disorder and should be detained. That is not a blatant capacity test, so it is appropriate to introduce an impaired judgment test to capture the point that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has made.</p>

 I shall not give way for a while, as several conversations seem to be going on at the same time. Those hon. Members who want to make a contribution to the debate should do so before the Minister accepts the new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07061954000058">The breadth of the law as its stands contrasts with the provisions in most countries, where the seriousness of a condition, or the harm that might be caused, are essential criteria for detention. We consider that the criterion of impaired decision making provides a preferable alternative to the seriousness criterion in the 2004 Bill, because it is more specific and directs the clinician to the correct issue of patient choice and autonomy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07061954000059">The vast majority of people with a mental illness, like those with a physical illness, retain in full their ability to make their own decisions throughout. They are treated by GPs or psychiatrists without being detained. Of those who are detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 some, as I have said, will also retain their capacity. A recent study found that 15 per cent. of detained patients, especially those who had been detained on a previous occasion, retained their capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07061954000060">The authors of that report also found that a capacity test worked with a high level of reliability, which answers part of the point raised by the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey). The IDM test imposes a lower threshold, and does not apply to section 2 patients. If it were passed into law, I believe it would lower the percentage of detained patients who retain their capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07061954000061">What are the consequences of failing to take account of decisions taken by a person who has insight into his condition and is fully capable of making a choice? I think that there are four. First, patients with full capacity come to resent their psychiatrists. As I said earlier, they tend to avoid their services for fear of being forced to have treatment that they do not want and which they believe may be harmful to them physically. That in turn can lead to them becoming more ill, with some slipping below the clinical radar or being deterred from presenting in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07061954000062">Secondly, patient outcomes may be damaged if personal decisions are not taken into account. Thirdly, patients may be harmed by treatment that may be unnecessary, and fourthly&#151;and most importantly&#151;stigma is increased. Failing to take account of vulnerable people&#146;s decisions can, and does, destroy their trust in the medical profession, on whose members they rely for mental and physical health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07061954000063">Inevitably, detention in hospital is a major disruption to a person&#146;s life. In the context of the blame culture, in which every tragedy caused by a patient can potentially be attributed to misjudgments by a psychiatrist, psychiatrists often feel required to section patients against their better judgement or the best interests of those patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07061954000064">The predictable consequence of the present law is that people with full capacity can stay away from the psychiatrist because they can justify an irrational fear of being detained. In that sense, the law is totally counter-productive: as I have said before, we need patients to engage early.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07061954000065">Tony Zigmond, vice-president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, has followed our proceedings very closely and I am sure that he is doing so at the moment. He has said:</p>
<a name="70619-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="07061954000079"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Enabling people to feel able to seek help early, to talk about their fears and difficulties, without fearing scorn, humiliation or loss of status, freedom, job and friends is the best way to bring about improvement in their health&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07061954000066">As in other areas of medicine, the best outcomes are achieved when patients engage early, take a full and active role in their treatment and have trust in their psychiatrist or other professional. In that connection, the NICE guidelines on anxiety state:</p>
<a name="70619-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="07061954000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;involving individuals in an effective partnership with healthcare professionals, with all decision making being shared, improves outcomes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70619-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07061954000067">Another aspect of the problem is the stigma felt by members of the black and minority ethnic community. They strongly support the new clause, and feel deeply stigmatised by the present law. The figures for the disproportionate detention and sectioning of people from the BME community bear out those fears.</p>

To ensure that she is not squeezed out, I shall finish my remarks now, save to say that the new clause should be added to the Bill as it is fundamental to our view of mental health legislation and to the need to respect people with a mental illness who retain capacity. I very much hope that the Minister will have a last-minute conversion and accept it.</p>

 Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. The proposed test is different, as the term &#147;capacity&#148; relates to cognitive ability. The Scottish legislation deals with the matter adequately, holding that the concept of impaired decision making is separate from incapacity. The further factors that should be taken into account are set out in the Scottish provisions, with a patient&#146;s impairment being measured, for example, by his ability to retain information concerning care and treatment, and to make decisions accordingly.</p>

 I pointed out that a number of states already have an impaired decision-making test that has worked perfectly satisfactorily. There is no evidence that a capacity criterion would reduce the number of people under compulsory treatment, as the Minister claims it would.

That might be true, but it is alarming to think that the state has reached the point that everyone deemed to need treatment should be detained if they disagree, which is what the Minister is trying to say.</p>

 I am sorry, but other countries have other mental health legislation; I am talking about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause. He has given no explanation of exactly what the test is and how it differs from the capability test in other parts of the legislation. Why should we adopt one test to judge whether a patient is capable of understanding the nature and purpose of the likely effects of electroconvulsive therapy, but an entirely different one when they are to be admitted to hospital under a compulsory order? It is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s responsibility to explain that but he has not done so satisfactorily, so he does not deserve support for the new clause.</p>

 Unlike the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey), I support new clause 12, which is well reasoned. In previous debates in Committee, I would have been minded to support the Minister&#146;s arguments if mental health problems were indeed static for a period of time. I know that the Minister holds in great respect Patrick Geoghegan, the chief executive of my local mental health partnership. He told me about a schizophrenic patient who could hold a rational discussion at one meeting but at the next would be kicking and screaming and making a mess of the office. It was deemed that the patient could make decisions about her future treatment and she voluntarily accepted treatment. As it was recognised that she had capacity to make decisions because she allowed herself to be admitted to hospital for treatment, logically she should be allowed to decide which treatment she did not want. She might know her own needs and her own body&#151;for example, that a drug did not work well&#151;much better than the clinician.</p>

All those things can be taken into account, but the state of impaired decision making must not fluctuate.

 In one sense it is different, because if a person lacks capacity, it is a more or less permanent condition&#151;such as in the case of a person with learning difficulties&#151;whereas a person who may have a mental health condition can fluctuate between having impaired judgment to understanding and full capacity. It will be for medical professionals to make that judgment. They are well able to do so, and are willing and want to be able to apply this test.</p>

That was the basis of Genevra Richardson&#146;s recommendation. It was a fundamental principle that was crucial in relation to the stigmatisation of people with mental health problems, so before I return to the issue of protection of the individual or the public, I want to spend a few moments considering that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70619-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07061956000033">Stigma against people with mental health problems is so endemic in our society that people are ashamed of admitting that they might have a mental health problem. I have recently been involved with the all-party group on ME, and people will bend over backwards to avoid any idea that they could have a condition that might have a psychiatric element, because of the stigma associated with it. The social exclusion unit pointed out that six out of 10 employers would not employ someone who had a mental health problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70619-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07061956000034">The stigma is endemic in our society. I know, because my father suffered from schizophrenia, and when I was growing up it was something that one was ashamed of. I could never tell my friends that my father had schizophrenia. I could not take people home, because of his behaviour. People will not talk about mental illness. The situation is getting better, but the stigma is still endemic in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70619-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07061956000035">We have been talking about public protection, and about preventing people from committing suicide. The most important thing that could be done to help us achieve public protection and protection of the individual would be to remove the stigma associated with mental ill health, which prevents people from coming forward because they do not want to admit their feeling that they may have a mental health problem. That, to me, is a crucial aspect of the Bill. A lot of the discrimination that would appear to be in the system, and the greater use of compulsion for people from black minority ethnic backgrounds, can be attributed to the fact that the stigma is even greater in some of our ethnic communities. In fact, when relatives do eventually refer a family member for help, they usually refer them to the police rather than to mental health services, such is the stigma associated with mental ill health. Genevra Richardson put it much more effectively than I can when she explained why she recommended that a judgment should be made about impaired decision making.</p>

There is some difference amongst clinicians. Some clinicians say that as a result of the impaired decision-making requirement a very few people may not receive treatment; but the General Medical Council says that although a person who is suicidal may have capacity to make decisions, their ability to make decisions about medical treatment for their mental disorder is impaired because of their express desire to commit suicide, or the concern that they may do so.</p>

The question did not relate to capacity; they were known to be dangerous. In many other cases, the failure of mental health services and the lack of co-ordination between different teams, and between social and health services, in providing for those patients led to the tragedies.</p>

principle that people without impaired judgment ought not to be detained against their will unless they have done some provable wrong. However, that leaves us with the crunch question: what happens to people who are severely mentally ill, suicidal or homicidal, but who have unimpaired judgment? Several answers have been given. One answer given repeatedly is that there are no such people; it is a null class. Mentally ill people who are suicidal or homicidal necessarily have impaired judgment. That is a good answer, but it renders the new clause entirely redundant, because anyone who meets the original criteria for detention&#151;someone who has a severe mental illness and suicidal or homicidal tendencies&#151;meets the impaired judgment test as well. The new clause would therefore be logically superfluous, if cosmetically attractive.</p>

It might be asked: who are they, how many of them are there, and how easy are they to single out given the lack of a universal or legal understanding of the impaired judgment criterion?

However, we are talking about people who have a severe mental illness&#151;an illness that haunts the mind, infects every mood, for most people permeates every waking moment, and spreads its dark shadow over all their actions.

 In supporting the new clause, and following on from the hon.

That was particularly true of those who had been detained previously. Ignoring that group of people has real consequences. One of them was identified by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), who has great expertise in this subject. Stigma will be increased. There is also an effect on the relationship between the patient and clinician.

I was particularly concerned about those who fall into the category of potentially suicidal, because, at one point, the argument appeared to be that, if they had capacity and it was their decision not to be treated, they should be told to go on their way, with the obvious catastrophic consequences. However, I have to tell the Minister that having made a particular effort to satisfy myself on this point, I now believe that that would not be the case because I do not think that any clinician would stand by and allow a person to commit suicide, or to be a danger to others. A person&#146;s wish to die would be a consequence of a mental disorder, so in such circumstances, the clinician&#151;</p>

suicides are not only people who are crying out that they wish to end their lives. People who are deadly earnest about taking their lives&#151;I am not putting people who choose to end their lives because of a terminal illness in this category&#151;and are determined to do so often deploy all sorts of devices to try to conceal the decision that they have made. Clinicians have to make judgments today about whether such complicated people are intent on taking their lives. I see no reason to go along with the Minister&#146;s suggestion that new clause 12 would deny clinicians the ability to make a judgment. If a person was considered to be a danger to others because he or she wished to kill someone else, that intent would be a symptom that the person was seriously unwell.

try to explain slight differences between what phrases might mean. However, confusion would be created by accepting a new clause that used an entirely different phrase. That would be important, given that the Bill will be interpreted by the courts.</p>

 This is my fifth year of studying the reform of the Mental Health Act 1983. I served on the scrutiny Committee and, like the hon. Lady, on the Public Bill Committee. I and many others have urged the Minister to use the Scottish Act as a blueprint for the legislation for England and Wales. If she had done so, we might not be dealing with such differences today. We could simply have lifted a lot from the Scottish Act and put it into our legislation, including the principles in the Bill. However, for an extraordinary reason that I still do not understand, the Minister and her team rejected that proposal, and the Bill is the poorer for it.</p>

 I will take only a few minutes because I understand that the Minister will want time to respond to the debate. However, I want to deal with a couple of points that were raised. I realise that I was not a member of the Public Bill Committee. Many hon. Members who have participated in the debate have taken a great deal of interest in the Bill and have spoken about its details with knowledge. I speak for no one but myself.</p>

Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) claims that given that there is a definition relating to capacity in clause 27&#151;she said that that measure related to consent to treatment, but it is actually on electroconvulsive therapy&#151;any other definition in the Bill relating to capacity should use the same wording for the sake of consistency. However, that would be wrong, because it would mean that the test for admission would be the same as the test for ECT. As she probably knows better than me, given that she has followed the Bill&#146;s passage, the architecture of the Bill is such that ECT has a higher threshold of incapacity than mere sectioning because anyone who was sectioned could otherwise have ECT administered to them. Although there might be merit in pure consistency, the example that she cited did not work because her point would undermine the separate threshold for ECT that exists for not only historical reasons, but clinical ones.</p>

 The threshold is lower because I do not think that the supporters of new clause 12 would want people sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 to qualify automatically for ECT. Although the hon.

always does on such matters, also would have done so. The matter was dealt with eruditely and logically by my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), who has a PhD in logic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07061965000034">The point to make is that it is possible to want to end one&#146;s life or to have one&#146;s life ended without necessarily having impaired judgment. It is also possible to have a mental illness as well. I shall describe two scenarios. If someone is terminally ill, they may reject immediately life-saving heroic treatment because they know that they are going to die and they want to exercise their autonomy and be allowed to die, not to have their life saved if they know they are going to die or suffer. Indeed, they may seek something that is unlawful in this country at present&#151;assisted dying, which has never been opposed on the grounds of being irrational. It has been opposed for other reasons, which we cannot discuss now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07061965000035">That is one scenario. It is possible in that scenario for the person to be depressed as a result of their terminal illness, and/or it is possible for the person to have a serious mental illness anyway, whether or not it is depression. Just because someone rejects non-mental treatment because they wish to die or end their life, which may be considered suicidal, does not mean that they should be sectioned. That is why a test such as the one proposed in the new clause in that small minority of cases would add extra confidence and insurance against what otherwise might be deemed to follow automatically&#151;that is, sectioning&#151;because the person is suffering from a mental illness, which makes it appropriate for them to receive mental treatment in a hospital for that illness, and to protect them from taking actions that might end their life. There is a case that the Minister must address, which the new clause seeks to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07061965000036">There is also the case&#151;for reasons of brevity the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak did not go into it in as much depth as she might have done&#151;about non-discrimination. People who refuse treatment that is life-saving and who are not terminally ill are entitled to do so if they retain capacity to do that. So a patient might, without not having capacity, refuse to have a big operation that a doctor would recommend and that would be life-saving. That does not mean that they are being irrational, that they do not have capacity or that their judgment is impaired. We do not force such physical treatment on them for their physical ailment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07061965000037">As for people with a mental illness, although we must take care that we act in their best interests and I recognise the difficult judgments to be made, we should not presume&#151;it goes to the stigma&#151;that they have impaired judgment if they are not looking after themselves or have an intention that their life should end sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07061965000038">It is vital that we ensure that people who have a severe mental illness and as a result of that are suicidal, are able to access treatment. I am satisfied, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for Southport was, that the new clause would not prevent that. It may help cope with stigma and raise doubts in the minds of people who might otherwise automatically seek to impose compulsory treatment on people with mental  <br>

illness. It represents an extra test that might prevent unnecessary restrictions of liberty where that is not appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07061965000039">I know plenty of people who have rightly been sectioned, who are not suicidal but who are self-neglecting to the point of infestation and to the point of malnutrition, who have a severe mental illness. I have sought in my medical practice to have them sectioned. A test of suicidal intent is not required. That was the point that I made to my hon.

 With the new clause we are back on familiar territory. An amendment was inserted originally in the other place, which we took out in Committee, and it has been reintroduced today by the Opposition. It will not surprise them to know that I do not agree with the proposal in the new clause. I understand many of the points that have been made during the debate. I know that we are dealing with a sensitive issue. I listened carefully, as always, to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones). I shall reiterate what we are trying to achieve through the Act, which is a sensitive piece of legislation because it affects extremely vulnerable people. It deals with their protection and the protection of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07061965000042">The primary purpose of the Mental Health Act is to provide an effective, properly safeguarded mechanism by which clinicians can intervene to protect people from the risks of mental disorder, where that is necessary. There are clear criteria for detention under section 3: first, that the patient has a mental disorder which makes medical treatment in hospital appropriate; secondly, that such treatment is necessary for the patient&#146;s own health or safety or the protection of others; thirdly, that detention is the only way to ensure that the patient gets the treatment; and, thanks to the Bill, that appropriate medical treatment is available. We discussed that earlier today when I accepted the compromise amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07061965000043">The new clause would introduce a new test which would subordinate issues of necessity and risk to the question of the patient&#146;s decision-making ability. It builds on provisions that we have been working with since 1983. Detention should be based on whether the patient is at serious risk of harming themselves or others. What the new test would mean is uncertain, as it is unprecedented in English law. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I remind hon. Members that we are in an English jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07061965000044">I understand that the supporters of the new clause argue that if the patient understands that they have a mental disorder which can be treated, and understands the treatment on offer but decides to refuse it, as long as their decision has not been distorted by their mental disorder there can be no compulsory intervention,  <br>

whatever the risk to the patient or anyone else. We must be clear that that is the intent of the new clause. It has been interesting to hear the debate today about whether that would mean that some people could not be treated. I am clear that some people who are treated now would not be treated under the proposal, because their decision to leave themselves or other people at risk would take precedence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07061965000045">That is the intention of the new clause. What are the reasons behind that? Let us consider some of the statements that have been made by the Opposition. I shall read into the record what has been said about the new clause. In the other place the Front-Bench spokesperson for the Conservative party said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70619-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07061965000046">That was the view expressed in the other place&#151;that the state has no business to interfere. This goes back to arguments that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) made in asking why there is a distinction between what would happen with a physical illness and what would happen with a mental illness. There is a clear distinction. First, the person must have a mental disorder in order to be detained. Secondly, they must be a risk either to themselves or to others. Thirdly, detention has to be necessary and appropriate medical treatment has to be available. That is why there is a difference. We are talking about an individual who is going to commit self-harm or suicide, or harm others.</p>

 The reasons are the same as those for which we do not impose physical treatment on patients who have capacity and do not have impaired judgment, but who reject physical treatment, even when it might save their lives. There will be very few patients with mental illness who do not have impaired judgment&#151;I accept that point&#151;but there will be some, and why should they be treated differently? We have to act proportionately, and I think that the proposed arrangement would give a fair balance in the case of self-harm.</p>

 Okay, we are now down to saying, &#147;Let&#146;s treat it in the same way as we treat physical illness.&#148; The hon. Gentleman therefore wants a new threshold, and he has now accepted that there will be people who will not be treated if the House agrees to what is proposed. Effectively, we would be saying that we did not want such people to harm others, but that it was fine that they could go away and commit suicide, even though they had a mental disorder and were a risk to themselves. It is sometimes quite difficult to work out whether somebody is a risk to themselves or to others; most clinicians will say that it is difficult to make the distinction. The hon. Gentleman is therefore introducing a difference between two groups, but I would say that that is quite difficult to do. We would be saying that, although appropriate medical treatment was available, a new test meant that people would be excluded from treatment. We need to be clear that that is what the House is now considering and what would be brought about.</p>

In the definitions that I gave yesterday in respect of victims&#146; rights, the point that I was making absolutely clearly was that we should do everything we can to make sure that people do not get into such a desperate state that they commit ghastly acts to others or themselves. The point of the new clause is to ensure that they are not discouraged from presenting early so that they can get the help voluntarily or compulsorily to ensure that they do not reach that desperate stage.</p>

Let us look, say, at what would happen if 10, 5 or 2 per cent. of people could not be detained, and at what we are talking about in figures&#151;real people who would not get treatment in future. There were some 22,500 detentions in England for treatment under section 3 in 2005-06. If 10 per cent. of those were ruled out, 2,250 people would not get treatment; 5 per cent. would be 1,125 people; and 1 per cent. would be 225. Those are real people who would not get treatment under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals.</p>

 They are not real people. Those are completely hypothetical figures that the Minister is characteristically using to try to caricature the case that is being put to her. I referred to a lower threshold. I also said that there is no evidence that she can produce that the numbers subject to compulsion will be higher or lower as a result of the proposal. What I did say is that people will be less deterred from presenting to receive the help and support of services, which we want to encourage them to do.</p>

 Yes. We are talking about compulsory treatment. That is exactly the point that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was making. He believes that if an impaired decision-making test were introduced, some people would not get treatment. In that case, I ask Conservative Members how many people is an acceptable number to be turned away from treatment. Such people would be either suicidal or a danger to others. What number would be acceptable?</p>

 I am confused, because the hon. Gentleman has distanced himself from the points made by the Conservative spokesperson in the Lords.

While impaired thinking is a common feature of mental disorder, impairment of the ability to make treatment decisions specifically is not, of itself, a criterion for diagnosing mental disorder, or any particular mental disorder. For example:</p>

this may no longer be the case. They may, however, not be prepared to accept that they have been ill or to accept the need for treatment.

 That is a ridiculous argument. The hon. Gentleman has said that we should prevent people from committing suicide, but he has tabled a new clause that would increase the likelihood of its happening. His policy is to accept this Government&#146;s suicide prevention strategy, which includes measures in this Bill to ensure that we can get treatment to people when they need it. He has admitted that the new clause would allow people who are a risk to others to go out into the community in unsafe circumstances, because it does not discriminate between people who are a danger to others or a danger to themselves, as my hon.

 We have only a little time left to consider the final groups of amendments, and I am sure hon. Members who wish to participate are especially keen to comment on the exclusions from mental disorder provisions in the second raft of amendments. I shall therefore speak only briefly about the first raft, and mainly about new clause 11. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) is keen to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to discuss amendment No. 88.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70619-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07061965000596">The British Association of Social Workers has supported and provided briefing notes for the new clause, which covers warrants to search for and remove patients. It would update the 1983 Act, which is out of date and causes some problems. Section 135 of the 1983 Act allows magistrates, on the application of an approved social worker, to issue a warrant when it is necessary to gain access to private premises to assess someone for possible admission under the Act. Warrants are requested far more often than they were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70619-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07061965000597">In addition, court procedures have been tightened up, and the approved social worker now needs to make a formal application to the court, supported by written evidence. That has served to highlight the shortcomings of section 135, which does not reflect the whole range of circumstances in which warrants are needed and, indeed, issued, forcing approved social workers and magistrates to bend the law to ensure that access can always be gained to someone who is in urgent need of admission to hospital. The reason is that the section basically dates from the Lunacy Act 1890 and the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. It has never been updated to conform with modern needs and circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70619-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07061965000598">The section provides for a warrant to be issued in only two circumstances: when the person lives alone and is unable to care for themselves, and when the person does not live alone but is being</p>

there was no treatment. If there was a danger to self or others, it was assumed that the police would use common law to gain entry. However, their common law powers are greatly circumscribed by section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows them to enter only in dire emergency</p>
<a name="70619-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="07061965001198"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for the purpose of saving life or limb.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07061965000600">If, therefore, someone who lives alone harbours paranoid beliefs about their neighbours but can still care for themselves, the professionals have no power to gain access to them to assess the need for admission. They must effectively wait until an assault has been committed and that person can then be arrested. By the same token, a warrant cannot be obtained when the person is living with someone else who does not neglect or ill treat them, even if that someone else is a child, infirm or unable to allow access. In some cases, family members, far from ill treating or neglecting the mentally disordered person, are concerned about them and desperate for them to receive treatment but are too frightened of them to let the police and the professionals into the house against their wishes. A high proportion of cases in which access is plainly justified do not fulfil the existing criteria, forcing approved social workers to misrepresent circumstances to obtain a warrant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07061965000601">We have modified the new clause since it was first debated in the Lords to tackle a valid objection by the Minister in the other place that it deleted an existing power to obtain access to someone who needed care other than for mental disorder. The new clause now retains existing powers but deletes the stigmatising phrase &#147;not under proper control&#148;. As a witness to the Joint Scrutiny Committee put it, inclusion of the phrase made it sound as though we were talking about dogs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07061965000602">The new clause now provides for access to be gained in any circumstances in which it is necessary for the professional to carry out an assessment for possible admission under the 1983 Act. However, it also imposes a new restriction that a warrant can be granted only when it has not been possible to gain access without one. That is designed to prevent the widespread misuse of the current system whereby the police insist on obtaining a warrant even when access has not been denied or it is not certain that that will be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07061965000603">We believe that the restriction would require the approved mental health professional to demonstrate to the magistrates that all reasonable efforts had already been made to gain access by non-forcible means. It is therefore likely that the new clause would reduce rather than increase the number of warrants issued. Lest there is a concern about increasing the range of circumstances in which the police can enter private property, it should be noted that clause 228 of the 2004 draft Mental Health Bill&#151;may it rest in peace&#151;which the Government abandoned more than a year ago, contained much greater powers for the police to enter private property by force without a warrant, and purely at the request of an AMHP in circumstances in which a person was in urgent need of care and control to prevent him from causing serious harm to himself or others. Even the extension of police powers that the  <br>

new clause proposes would not extend as far as that, as a case for forcible access would always have to be made in the magistrates court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07061965000604">The new clause is slightly technical but the law is clearly out of line with current practice and I hope that the Minister will accept it in the constructive and positive way in which I move it.</p>

 Order. The hon. Gentleman may speak about amendment No. 88, but he is not moving it at this time. At the moment, only new clause 11 is being moved. If and when there is any question of a vote on amendment No. 88, the hon. Gentleman may move it formally.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. In my excitement, I was getting ahead of myself. I shall try to stay within the bounds of parliamentary protocol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07061965000608">Amendment No. 88 is designed to change the definition of a place of safety so that, as far as possible, it is not a police cell. Too often, people who have a mental episode that results in a disturbance or act of violence end up in a police cell. As far as possible, we would like to ensure that a place of safety is actually in a therapeutic environment. If that is not possible, however, we would hope that within 24 hours of someone being placed in a police cell after an episode of mental illness, they would be found a place in a therapeutic environment where they could receive appropriate care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07061965000609">I believe that the amendment is hugely important because it sends out a message about how we regard mental illness, which is not a crime. In certain cases, it may drive people to commit acts that could be perceived to be criminal or, indeed, are criminal, but mental illness in itself is not a crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07061965000610">I have personal experience of being around people who have had extremely violent and aggressive episodes of mental illness, and I have to say that it is very frightening, but I can say now, with hindsight, that a police cell is not what these very ill and sick people need. It really is not. The police are not trained to be the jailers of the mentally ill; it is outside their range of competence. They are not skilled at managing the symptoms. The police are not clinically trained. I would have thought that locking someone up in a police cell could only add to the trauma and make that sick person even sicker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07061965000611">If we do not progress with the amendment, I hope that the Minister and others will look further into the way that mental illness is approached in the community, particularly by the police, and try to find ways of ensuring that when the police are confronted with a violent mentally ill person, they can recognise the situation and call on the help of clinical experts to help them to manage it&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) is getting agitated, so I shall give way.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that warm words, though very welcome if forthcoming from the Minister, will not on this occasion suffice? We need some sort of formal commitment that mentally ill people will speedily be put in a place of safety other than a police cell. Very often, they will not be able to give voice to their own anxieties. They look to this House to protect them&#151;and protect them we must, otherwise there is a real danger of what I would call careless and accidental incarceration or careless cruelty. We have a responsibility to avoid that.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point in his usual eloquent way. The amendment would allow the House to send a message to people who are mentally ill that we care about their welfare and about alleviating their troubles and that we want to ensure that, in as many cases as possible, they are in places that best meet their needs as ill people&#151;as patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07061965000614">I recall describing in Committee something that happened in my constituency, but I shall not go into it in detail again. It concerned a young girl of about 14 who was having a violent episode. I was with the police on that occasion and we were called to the house. It sounded as though there were about 30 people in that house, throwing things, screaming and yelling, but it was actually just one tiny 14-year-old girl. This little girl was walked out in between two policemen. I cannot remember whether she was handcuffed&#151;I hope she was not&#151;but she was put in a police car and taken to a police station. I, a totally untrained observer, could recognise that the girl was mentally ill. What was happening to her was completely and utterly not in her interests. It was a moving experience for me. By accepting this amendment, I hope that we can ensure that such circumstances are kept to the absolute minimum in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07061965000615">In providing a therapeutic environment, we must strike the right balance between having beds and community facilities.

 Is there not another practical point? We heard from the Ministry of Justice today that police cells are going to be used for criminals because there are not enough places in our prisons.

 I understand where my right hon. Friend is coming from. It is just not right to take people who are mentally ill and put them in police stations and in police cells next to criminals.

 I appreciate that there will be difficulties of interpretation at the margins, but I come back to the 14-year-old girl. It was not difficult to interpret that decision. What happened to her was clearly wrong and could not be justified in any society that claimed to be civilised in its approach to people with mental illness. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but we are here to navigate our way through these difficult issues and I am sure that there is a way forward. I know that the Minister will have something to say about it.

 May I say that I understand the sentiments behind both these amending provisions, but that for reasons I shall set out, it is difficult to accept them? I intend to set out what we are trying to do in respect of the issues covered by amendment No. 88 and to discuss some changes in the Bill that impinge on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07061965000622">New clause 11 is designed to amend section 135(1) of the 1983 Act. Let me explain that the purpose of that subsection is to protect a person who may have a mental disorder from ill treatment, neglect or an inability to care for themselves and to ensure that they receive any care or treatment that they need. Obviously, the use of that subsection is quite a serious step, which can involve considerable interference in the person&#146;s home and family life, so we have to be very careful when we talk about making changes to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07061965000623">New clause 11 amends that section so that it would apply to virtually anyone with a mental disorder who might need care or treatment. That brings us back to the concern that the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) himself raised in pointing out that there had been rather a large presence when the person concerned was a young vulnerable girl.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07061965000624">Social workers have raised the issue of getting a warrant more quickly and easily, but we must try to ensure that every effort is made to gain entry in a voluntary manner before resorting to obtaining a warrant. Obviously this does not always work, as was illustrated by the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined. It is feared that opening up new clause 11 in this way would extend those rather intrusive powers. That is why we have a problem with it, and why it is unacceptable. Concerns have been expressed by social workers about this issue, but we have looked at the matter carefully and want to make improvements to the present arrangements at local level between, for example, mental health workers and the police, without taking the rather intrusive powers proposed in the new clause.</p>

of police stations for the detention of mentally disordered people. I have recently met representatives of the Police Federation to discuss their concerns about the issue. We also debated this in Committee, where we went over a number of the arguments. I said that I agreed that a police station was not the ideal place to detain such people, and that a hospital-based facility was more likely to be suitable in almost all circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07061965000626">That is what we are aiming for, but we need to recognise that there will sometimes be occasions when a police station has to be used; my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) outlined an example. There could also be circumstances in remote rural areas in which this might have to happen. I am glad that the amendment goes some way towards recognising that, and that it does not try to limit the circumstances in which a police station may be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07061965000627">It is true that 72 hours is a long time for someone with a mental disorder to be detained at a police station. It is important to remember, however, that that is the upper limit. Recent data produced, I think, by the Independent Police Complaints Commission showed that the average length of time spent in police custody under section 36 of the 1983 Act was 10 hours, and that the vast majority of people left within 18 hours. In 2005-06, only about 5 per cent. of the people detained remained in custody for more than 24 hours. That is reassuring, but we still need to do better, because it is also clear from the figures that some people are detained for longer than that. The amendment would make it impossible for such people to be detained, which causes real practical problems in regard to our accepting it.</p>

 Would it be possible for the Minister to take away the more sensible words that she has used in the House this evening and ask the draftsmen to incorporate them in a suitable change to the Bill? What she has said is rather better than what is in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o366"><a name="07061965000629"><a name="70619-0016.htm_spnew11"><a name="07061965001770"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 I have been setting out what is in the Bill at the moment, but amendment No. 88 seeks to change some of that. When this was debated in the other place, where it was also a matter of concern, we tabled amendments to sections 135 and 136 of the 1983 Act to allow people to be transferred from one place of safety to another. That will enable a person who has initially been taken to a police station to be moved to another, more suitable, place of safety when appropriate. That was not possible under the current Bill, so we have changed the legislation so that a person with a mental disorder may be moved from a police cell to another place of safety. That will help to reduce the amount of time that some people spend at a police station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70619-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07061965000630">We are backing up this strategy with money: &#163;42 million has been made available to improve the mental health estate, and &#163;58 million this year. Some of that money will facilitate an increase in hospital-based places of safety, which will also reduce the amount of time that some people spend in police stations. In the new code of practice for England, we also intend to reinforce the aim for police stations to be used as a place of safety only as a last resort&#151;for example, only if nowhere more suitable is available. I am sure that hon. Members will appreciate that the code will have some force, particularly in legal cases.</p>

 The Minister has spoken eloquently about the period of time that a person might spend in a prison cell.

 We have held discussions with representatives of the Police Federation and, if my memory serves me correctly, they produced some figures from a particular area.

That is why they were pleased about the changes that we have made in the Bill.

In both cases, that includes a level of intoxication that does not cause lasting harm or dependence. Both misuse and dependence are covered by international classification of diseases 10, and are therefore classified as mental disorders. It is therefore necessary that the exclusion be worded to cover both, so that neither the binge drinker nor the casual consumer of drugs is considered a case for compulsion. </p>

It was until recently included as a mental disorder in ICD 10. It is no longer necessary to cover sexual orientation because it is neither listed as a mental disorder nor considered in society as a disorder.

 Order. I should point out that there is very limited time left. I hope that speeches will be brief, as the Minister should be accorded the courtesy of a reply. I call Chris Bryant.</p>

 You always say that before you call me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and you do so with great wisdom. I shall, however, be immensely brief. Although I suspect that the amendment will pushed to a vote, I will not vote with the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), and I simply want to explain why. It is not that I believe that homosexuality is a mental disorder; that we should detain people for their cultural, religious or political beliefs; or that we should detain people because of their likely commission of illegal or disorderly acts. It is simply because the amendment as drafted is complex, in that it involves a triple negative. There have not been many challenges since 1983, because the exceptions were unnecessary in the 1983 Act and are unnecessary today. I do not believe that any of these things is a mental disorder and, therefore, it is patronising to put on the face of the Bill that we consider them not to be mental disorders.</p>

 I shall also be brief. An essential difficulty in the legislation is the open nature of the term mental disorder. It is not related to medical taxonomy or to clinical categories and it is therefore helpful to say what it is not. That is the point about most exceptions lists, and about putting principles on the face of the Bill. As has been said, many other legal systems have similar, but not identical lists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70619-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07061965000671">The argument against lists is that they are restrictive and can be faulted on a case by case basis. There are obviously instances of political or religious beliefs, and cultural or sexual practices that are so alarming that, by themselves, they might be symptomatic of a deluded or deranged state, though one would look for other associated symptoms. One thinks, for example, of the political or&#151;for that matter&#151;religious views of someone such as David Icke, and things such as paedophilia and necrophilia. Equally, we can cite instances in which gay people, communists, religious dissenters and generally socially wayward people have been labelled improperly as mentally ill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70619-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07061965000672">It is a fascinating topic, but it is essentially theoretical. In real world situations, including exceptions does no evident harm, sends out important signals about cultural and social sensitivity and tilts practice in a wholly desirable way, as do statements of principles. If we were making law in a Platonic spirit of purity, completely unhooked from practice, disconnected from context and timeless in its significance, an exceptions clause would not be included, but that is not what we usually  <br>

do. We usually do a more pragmatic and mundane job and, in the current circumstances of the worldwide climate we inhabit, there is not a shred of evidence that including exceptions does any harm, and a fair presumption that it may do some good.</p>

<p><a name="st_o382"><a name="07061965000673"><a name="70619-0017.htm_spnew10"><a name="07061965001786"><b>Ms Rosie Winterton:</b>
 Once again, we return to a topic that was a matter of considerable controversy and impassioned debate throughout the passage of the Bill, and indeed during its long gestation. That is whether it is necessary to include on the face of legislation a list of matters that are not to be regarded as mental disorders. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) put his finger on it<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Do wake up! We are all quite interested in this issue&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o383"><a name="07061965000674"><a name="70619-0017.htm_spnew11"><a name="07061965001787"><b>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford) (Con):</b>

 Clearly. At the moment, there are three exclusions in the mental health legislation as it stands. Our intention is to keep the exclusion for alcohol and drug dependence, but to abolish those for sexual deviancy and for</p>
<a name="70619-0017.htm_brev6"><a name="07061965001205"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;promiscuity and other immoral conduct.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70619-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07061965000676">The exclusion for promiscuity and immoral conduct dates back to the 1959 Act and the way mental health legislation had been misused before that to detain unmarried mothers and otherwise enforce moral codes. The exclusion has now served its purpose and is no longer needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70619-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07061965000677">The exclusion for sexual deviancy added in 1982 was probably intended to refer to homosexuality. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda said, that was at that time still listed as mental disorder in the international classification of diseases. However, that exclusion was quickly associated with paedophilia and sexual offending. Its effect has been that paedophiles, for example, can be detained and treated under the Act, but only where clinicians diagnose an underlying condition, such as an antisocial personality disorder. Paedophilia&#151;though a recognised mental disorder in itself&#151;is excluded because of the provision on sexual deviancy, which is why we are removing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70619-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07061965000678">The amendments propose a set of new exclusions, but most of them refer to things that are not mental disorders in the first place. In other debates on these matters, in Committee and elsewhere in the House, Opposition Members have maintained that the proposals are less to do with what is happening at the moment than with what might happen if a very extreme Government were to take over&#151;</p>

 We are getting close, I admit, and maybe it is not such a bad idea. However, my point is that an extreme Government might ask clinicians to start detaining people for their cultural, religious or political beliefs. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is one of those who has put the other argument&#151;that the amendment does not have to do with UK practice or with the good faith of Ministers or the existing system but with the fact that there have been chilling experiences in other countries, where people have been singled out for mental treatment because their faces did not fit.</p>

Given that clinicians have not detained people for their political beliefs for many years, the idea that the advent of an extreme Government will mean that they will suddenly start detaining people under the Mental Health Act is a little difficult to swallow.</p>

<p><a name="st_o387"><a name="07061965000682"><a name="70619-0018.htm_spnew0"><a name="07061965001791"><b>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington, North) (Lab):</b>
 Is the Minister confident that all the exclusions listed in amendment No. 91 are covered specifically in other legislation, and that there is therefore no need to name them to send the message outlined by the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)?</p>

 It would not be possible to detain people for their religious beliefs, because the Act states that people can be detained only if they have a mental disorder. A person&#146;s religion is not a mental disorder, and neither are his political or cultural beliefs or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda pointed out, his sexual preference or identity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07061965000684">The existing legislation provides an ability to appeal to the mental health review tribunal. The principles that will be put in the code were accepted when they were considered by the Lords, and they make it clear that unlawful discrimination is not allowed. The relevant criteria&#151;that the person involved has a mental disorder and is capable of causing serious harm to himself or others, and that appropriate medical treatment is available that must be delivered in a hospital setting&#151;have to be met. If they are not, the person involved cannot be detained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07061965000685">I can understand why people feel that the amendment would be nice, but I have some concerns about it. The Mental Health Alliance has said that exclusions act as a check on clinical discretion, but I believe that we should be trying to ensure that clinicians can treat people as they need it. The amendment is seen as a safeguard, but I do not think that it is because, as I said earlier, the circumstances that it lists are not mental disorders. Legal exclusions should cover things that are mental disorders, not things that are not.</p>

 I want to make three quick points. First, the principles to which the Minister referred are not on the face of the Bill. Secondly, I agree that we are legislating for this country, now. However, does she accept that the legislation on mental health and other issues passed by this House sets an example to the world, and that other countries with Governments even less scrupulous than this one take notice? Thirdly, does she admit that our proposal in respect of paedophilia lays to rest the fears that she might have had in that respect?</p>

 I certainly accept that the hon. Gentleman has made a case for the exception of paedophilia. He says that the legislation may last for a long time, and that to prevent the actions of some future Government we need to include exceptions now, but waving the Mental Health Act at a Government who are locking people up for their political, religious or cultural beliefs is unlikely to have an effect.</p>

 We are not discussing that&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>In fact, I said that most of the exceptions were not mental disorders and those are the ones that worry me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07061965000693">Although there have been only a small number of challenges to the legislation, they have been worrying; for example, the Clatworthy case, in which the patient was convicted of indecent assault of two young girls and detained on grounds of psychopathic disorder. After the sexual deviancy exclusion was introduced his case went before the mental health review tribunal where it was argued that he did not meet a definition of psychopathic disorder because his only dangerous behaviour was sexually deviant and was thus excluded. The tribunal disagreed but the case went to judicial review and the judge found in favour of the patient. We must not imagine that such circumstances will not arise. There have already been four major cases and they have affected the operation of the tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07061965000694">Secondly, the more exclusions in the Bill covering conditions that are not mental disorders, the more the possibility of a challenge. Somebody could easily claim that they were detained because of their religious persuasion&#151;because they said, &#147;I have X, Y, Z powers&#148;. A challenge could be mounted on each of the exclusions. When people are detained against their will, they will look for ways to challenge their detention. There can be reasonable grounds that a person does not have a mental disorder, but we must not confuse the issue by including a range of conditions in the Bill that an individual could use to meet a challenge against their detention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07061965000695">I want to back up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda. He is right: it is patronising to say that we have to exclude sexual preference as a possible mental disorder, when it is clearly not a mental disorder. A similar issue arises in relation to autism. People from the National Autistic Society asked me why we were describing autism as a mental disorder, because some of them do not accept that description. If we say that sexual preference must be listed as an exclusion in the Bill because it is a mental disorder, we are sending the wrong message. That is why we cannot accept the amendment and I ask the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) to withdraw it.</p>

 Order. I apologise for interrupting the right hon. Lady, but it is quite unfair to the Minister at the Dispatch Box if conversations are going on in the Chamber. Hon. Members should stay if they wish to listen to the debate, or depart quietly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o398"><a name="07061972000005"><a name="70619-0018.htm_spnew11"><a name="07061972000053"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07061972000006">The Mental Health Act 1983 is primarily about the circumstances in which people with a serious mental health problem can be detained and treated without their consent to protect themselves or others from harm. Not surprisingly, this is a sensitive matter, so any Bill to amend that Act is likely to provoke much debate and controversy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07061972000007">It might be helpful if I set out why the Government want to update our mental health legislation. We want to ensure that people with serious mental health problems receive the treatment that they need to protect themselves and others from harm. We need to recognise that the world has moved on since 1983. Many more people can now be treated in the community, rather than in hospitals, so the use of compulsory powers should reflect that. Professional demarcation lines have changed since 1983, and functions are now being carried out by people with the right skills and experience, rather than individuals from particular professions. Again, our legislation should change to reflect that fact. We also want to strengthen patient safeguards, which includes tackling human rights incompatibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07061972000008">The Government began their review of mental health legislation in 1998. Since then, reforming the legislation has been the subject of wide-ranging debate, which has been enormously helpful. We have listened to relevant stakeholders and made many changes as a result of discussions with them. The decision to proceed with an amendment Bill rather than the 2004 draft Bill was a response to the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. I take this opportunity to thank that Committee for all the work that it did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70619-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07061972000009">We have had long and helpful discussions in the House on the Bill before us. The discussions in Committee were particularly helpful&#151;</p>

 Absolutely. I am glad that I was able to table a range of amendments on Report covering issues that were raised in the other place and in Committee. I am pleased that we were able to accept the excellent amendments from my hon. Friends the Members for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon), which were supported by many other members of the Committee. I am glad that the Opposition parties also gave their support to a number of the amendments that we tabled. I am thinking particularly of the amendments on age-appropriate accommodation and, crucially, those on victims and on advocacy.</p>

 This could be the last intervention that I make on the Bill. One of the amendments that the Minister did not accept in Committee was the request to have people with autistic spectrum disorders added to the exemptions in the Bill. The National Autistic Society, of which I am a vice-president, writes today about the Report stage, saying that people with autistic spectrum disorders continue to be detained inappropriately, and the society believes that their situation will be worsened by the Bill, not improved by it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o402"><a name="07061972000014"><a name="70619-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="07061972000057"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 We discussed autism not only in Committee, where the hon. Lady tabled a number of amendments, but when I attended the all-party group on autism. In addition, in discussions that I had until Friday last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) put forward arguments from the National Autistic Society. The meeting of the all-party group showed some of the divergence of opinion, even among those representing people with autism. I am thinking particularly of one of the Opposition Members who questioned why we were even considering some of the changes that the hon. Lady suggested. It is a complicated subject but I was glad that we were able to have the debate in Committee. I am more than happy to continue to look at how we can assist on issues such as the code of practice, to make sure that services are developed appropriately. As I said, I hope that the amendments that I tabled on supervised community treatment, the conditions that can be applied and how they will be applied will give some reassurance to those who are concerned about SCT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07061972000015">Where we have not been able to accept amendments, we are trying to use non-legislative means to tackle the issues raised, such as the nearest relative provisions, which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), and places of safety, which were also mentioned today. We will continue to work on those matters, although it was not necessarily right to include them in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07061972000016">I thank the many organisations that have worked with us in developing some of the Government amendments.

As I said, our discussions in this House have followed on from many of the discussions in the other House, which have informed our debates. I believe that although we have not been able to respond to all the concerns raised there, we have been able to respond to very many of them.</p>

in their best interests. We sometimes forget that the Bournewood changes are a very important part of the legislation, about which I know that two Opposition Members are particularly concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07061972000021">I should also mention all the work put into the analysis of the Bill by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and my hon.

Members would say that the officials have been open to discussion and approachable to Members of the House if they have been needed to give other information. I also thank all members of the Committee. We had an excellent debate with participation from all sides, and we were able to explore many of the issues very thoroughly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07061972000022">I want to stress how much we want to continue to work with a wide range of stakeholders in implementing the Bill once it receives Royal Assent. I know that many have already been involved in developing the code of practice, and we would certainly like further input from all those with an interest, including Members of the House. Many have also been involved in drafting the secondary legislation, such as measures on new professional roles. Again, we want to work with all concerned to make sure that we get this right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07061972000023">All told, I think that the Bill that we are&#151;I hope&#151;about to send back to the other place is a significant improvement on the one that came to this House, although we have been able to reflect some of the discussions there in the amendments that we have been considering over the past two days. I hope that Members of the other place will feel that we have taken on board their concerns and responded to the points that they made, as well as to the points made in Committee. I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House and wishing it a speedy completion.</p>

 I echo the Minister&#146;s words in saying that the Bill has provoked much debate and controversy, which I think is probably something of an understatement. It has been a long haul; as she said, nine years have gone by. I think that I have been responsible for the matter on the Opposition Benches for five of those nine years, and that she has had responsibility for a little longer. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It feels like we have been at it for a long time on the Mental Health Bill. We have been through two draft Bills, the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, this Bill, the Richardson expert committee and countless meetings, briefings and debates with various members of the Mental Health Alliance and others.</p>

that form the Mental Health Alliance do on behalf of thousands of people up and down the country every day of the week. We need a Bill that helps those organisations, because they look after some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07061972000027">I pay tribute to the work that was done in the Lords. I disagree with the Minister about whether this Bill is better than the one that came from the Lords. An enormous amount of professional expertise was applied to the Bill in the Lords, and I think that Members of the other place may have a few things to say when it returns to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07061972000028">I pay tribute to the many professionals who day in, day out do a difficult job looking after people with a mental illness. Again, our duty is to make their job easier and to clarify the law under which they work, which has always been our intention. I agree with the Minister that there is a need to update the legislation. The 1983 Act was largely based on the 1959 Act, so it is almost 50 years since the underlying principle of the legislation was updated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07061972000029">There have been advances in mental health treatment, mental health law and the flexibility with which we deal with patients. Rightly, we must respect people&#146;s lifestyles: we have moved away from the asylum system; the professions involved have changed; and there are human rights incompatibilities. All along, we have said that we need a Mental Health Bill, but we need the right Mental Health Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07061972000030">I welcome the Minister&#146;s success in getting the Government to move a substantial distance in a number of areas. She took note of the record six defeats in the Lords on substantial points of great principle. We welcome what we have seen on Report in the past two days on age-appropriate treatment. I also echo the Minister&#146;s tribute to Lord Williamson&#146;s amendments, which started the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07061972000031">As I have said, we have made good moves on introducing victims&#146; rights into the Bill. I welcome the compromise on treatability and pay tribute to the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) for the intelligent, balanced and assiduous way in which he introduced it. We have removed some of the more objectionable and unworkable parts of community treatment orders, not least the provision on abstaining from particular behaviours, and we have linked CTOs to medical treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07061972000032">However, we have not gone far enough. The Bill still fails to take into account the international evidence, which the Government commissioned. It is still far too open-ended, and as such we think that it provides too much of a deterrent for people to engage with mental health services. We are still at odds with the Government about the roles of various &#147;responsible clinicians&#148;, which may be open to legal challenge. Furthermore, inconsistencies remain with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the renewal of detention following initial sectioning. We still have serious problems about the definitions and the exclusions. It is unfortunate that the debate on that was truncated, because those are substantial points of disagreement that go to the heart of the Bill.</p>

 Before I give way to the Minister, I should say that if she did not mention the Michael Stone case, I may have confused it with the John Barrett case. She has mentioned the Michael Stone case before. What is common to all those cases is that they show a failure of the system and the services in not being there to pick up those people when they needed to be picked up.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong to say that I have mentioned the Michael Stone case&#151;I have not. I mentioned the Michael Barrett inquiry&#151;I am sorry, the John Barrett inquiry&#151;because one of its conclusions was that the only way that it would have been possible to ensure that John Barrett complied with treatment as an out-patient would have been through supervised community treatment, which was not available at the time. That is why we believe that supervised community treatment is important.</p>

 I entirely take the Minister&#146;s point. I think that we are confusing Michaels and Johns; if that is my fault, I apologise. Nevertheless, whatever reference has been made to community treatment orders, there was in both cases a failure by the system in relation to somebody who tried to engage with it, and a failure by the services to provide a safety net and to move in at the appropriate time.</p>

That suggests that the Bill is being used as a substitute for the lack of appropriate services and deficiencies in the mental health service as it stands. It confuses availability and access to services with the need for coercion in order to ensure that patients accept services that are offered.

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07061972000043">It is interesting to note that the Minister dismissed out of hand the situation that will pertain, for example, in the constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath&#151;that of the incoming Prime Minister. Under her assumptions and analysis, the constituents of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath are being allowed to commit suicide because of impaired decision making, yet she has no evidence to support it. Has the incoming Prime Minister said, &#147;Under impaired decision making, there is a serious problem with my constituents being more susceptible to suicide&#148;? I very much doubt that there has been, yet the Minister is going to create a difference between mental health law on either side of the border. Clearly, Scotland has produced much more enlightened mental health legislation, and that will throw up serious differences between how patients are treated on either side of the border.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has consistently failed to answer one question. He says that there will be people who would not need to be detained because they did not have impaired judgment, but he has never given the figure for how many people he thinks it acceptable to turn away from services saying, &#147;We&#146;re not going to treat you either because you are a danger to yourself or a danger to others.&#148; What is that figure?</p>

 The Minister is trying to repeat our previous, truncated debated. Her logic and analysis imply that, in the incoming Prime Minister&#146;s constituency, under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which contains impaired decision-making provisions, people are much more susceptible to suicide. There is no empirical evidence for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70619-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07061972000046">We are worried because there is a significant risk that the Bill will undo much of the good work in improving mental health services and the relationships between service users and providers. There is a genuine risk of investing in a new regime of compulsion, which will have a counter-productive effect, alienating rather than engaging with people with mental health problems and possibly increasing rather than reducing patient and public safety. Patients could well slip under the clinical radar, and we do not want that to happen. We want a Bill with which we can work, with which clinicians can work and with which patients can work and engage. We want a Bill that reassures the public that their safety is being protected, and balanced with the liberty and medical care of others.</p>

I urge my colleagues to vote against it, but in doing that, I hope that the Government will take our concerns on board, engage constrictively with the Lords and go that bit further so that we can have a Mental Health Act 2007 of which we can all be proud. I look forward to considering the measure again when the Government have taken our concerns on board and it returns from the Lords.</p>

 After a long journey, we have reached an interesting juncture. The Bill arrived in the Commons surrounded by controversy, heavily amended and cloaked in colourful rhetoric. Some said that it was simply a Home Office measure, which was intent on coercing the mentally ill, an open charter for compulsory medication or a means of handing out psychiatric ASBOs, likely to terrify and worsen patients&#146; conditions.

Secondly, she has done a good job by listening to Labour Back Benchers. It is very rare for the Government to accept amendments from their Back Benchers, and it is quite nerve-racking when an amendment has been tabled, but one is not sure whether the Minister is going to accept it, because it makes one think of having to vote with the Opposition against the Government.</p>

In particular, there is a shortage of talking therapies, especially in working class constituencies around the land. We need to put that right.

The treatment of a person with a physical illness who has mental capacity and who withholds consent for treatment would, in law, constitute assault, but such treatment of a person with mental illness will be sanctioned by legislation. However strong the arguments for administering such treatment might be, this is a difficult principle to breach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07061980000027">I am also concerned about the excessive scope of community treatment orders and the nature of the exclusions that we have debated over the past two days. Functionally, my concern is for the people who are not represented among those joining the debate, namely, people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, or with different levels of sophistication or differing abilities to stick up for themselves. The hon. Member for Rhondda touched on this issue a moment ago. Such people might find themselves enmeshed in the system. All the conventional measurements in relation to the involvement of people from black and minority ethnic&#151;BME&#151;backgrounds suggest that they are clearly being very badly served.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07061980000028">I am also worried about the absence or patchiness of treatment facilities in some parts of the country. We cannot necessarily legislate to put that right, although we have done so in relation to age-appropriate treatment. I want to pay tribute to the Minister, who made some good changes in Committee. I would not wish to caricature the Government&#146;s position at all in this regard, but I do have those outstanding reservations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07061980000029">Behind those reservations are two considerations. The first is that there is some kind of ghost in the machine that we have not yet fully eliminated. It is the ghost of control systems, as opposed to the treatment, support and protection of minorities and people with real difficulties and sensitivities in their lives. My strong feeling is that if we are worried about people with mental health problems in the community, the best way to approach the issue is positively and at source through appropriate treatment, rather than seeking to get out of the problems by saying how toughly we can control them. That is not to say that there should be no controls. Of course there should be controls, and they have been hallowed in statute for many years, but they need to be weighed very carefully in each case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07061980000030">Finally, let me make an appeal to the Minister. I think I can do that on the basis of the constructive relationship that we enjoyed during the passage of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and subsequently in the context of some its implementation. The Minister has shown an exemplary readiness for dialogue. During the passage of the 2005 Act, with which I was more intimately concerned than I am with this Bill, progress seemed impossible at one stage. There was a time constraint, there were huge differences in views, and there were passionate concerns about such issues as euthanasia. Nevertheless, we somehow managed to work ourselves into an almost complete consensus by the end. We have not yet done that with the Mental Health Bill, which is why I shall not be supporting it tonight.</p>

I think that if Ministers are prepared to respond to concerns expressed in another place, to respond again when they return to us&#151;as no doubt they will&#151;and to iron out the remaining issues, we shall have a Bill that reflects our power to debate and, above all, our power to engage with this most sensitive group of people, to whom we all feel that we have an obligation and whom we need to serve by getting the legislation right.</p>

 I, too, congratulate the Minister. In some respects, this has been a very difficult Bill. Some of the arguments have been separated only by a thin line, which was exemplified by those that we heard today on new clause 12. It has certainly been a difficult Bill for the Minister to steer through the House, but she has done it with courage and professionalism, and has presented her arguments with great clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07061980000033">I want to make it clear that the Committee was not full of people who were always going to agree with the Government. Some of the awkward squad were there. I include myself in that: I was prepared to challenge the Government, although on this occasion I have agreed wholeheartedly with the Government line. I am very pleased to be able to say that. I believe that the addition of the advocacy measure to the final Bill is a great step forward. I was a little surprised that it was not included initially, but I am very pleased that it is there now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07061980000034">I must tell all those who have deluged me, and other Committee members, with briefings that there has just been too much of it. It has jammed my e-mail inbox, and filled my sacks of mail. I have a confession to make: I have not read it all. I think that there is a message there. Why should we receive a briefing from the Mental Health Alliance and, at the same time, briefings from all its members? I am grateful for the briefings, but I ask those who sent them please to send us a few less in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07061980000035">During the Bill&#146;s passage, I have detected a tension between psychiatrists and psychologists. The Government are trying to build a modern mental health service in which all professionals work in harmony and to the same end&#151;to help the patients who benefit from the service. I hope that the professionals will listen to that message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07061980000036">At the beginning of the Committee stage I felt like a member of the Stasi, being accused of wanting to lock people up for having strange religious practices, political views or sexual deviancies of one kind or another. In fact, I felt&#151;and now believe wholeheartedly&#151;that the Minister was trying to strike a balance between liberty and human rights on the one hand, and on the other the need to recognise that there are people out there who can benefit from modernised mental health services. People with serious personality disorders, for instance, can benefit from the application of appropriate treatment, with a consequent saving of lives that might otherwise be lost as a result of both homicides and suicides.</p>

 The Opposition will vote against it, which is sad. As with all proposed legislation, this Bill will be proved to be successful or not when its provisions are put into practice. I hope that it will benefit the patients for whom it is intended.</p>

 I thank the Minister for her generosity in spending time with me when I have asked to see her during the course of the Bill&#146;s proceedings. I also particularly wish to thank the Mental Health Alliance. In my view, it did not send too much material, but put a lot of work into supporting Members who were dealing with the Bill. I also thank the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the National Autistic Society for helping me with my representations on the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07061980000040">I look forward to working with the Minister on the code of practice. There are still problems to do with people with autistic spectrum disorders. There is a problem in that people with autism are detained inappropriately in unsuitable settings and for far too long. I hope that the code of practice will address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07061980000041">Finally, let me raise again an issue that I mentioned at the end of my speech on Second Reading, and which has not been touched on today. Early intervention with appropriate levels of resources is the answer to mental health issues. It seems incongruous to me that the Minister should suggest that by voting against the Bill the Opposition will be responsible for putting patients at risk.</p>

 I have no trouble in supporting the Government and voting for the Bill, as it is a substantial improvement on the current legislation. I thank Members of all parties here and in the other place, as well as those who have briefed and supported us in our discussions, for their work in helping to bring about the current state of play in respect of the Bill. I particularly thank my right hon. Friend the Minister. As other Members have mentioned, she has been very open and has bent over backwards to discuss the Bill frankly. I also thank her for her attendance at meetings of the all-party group on mental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70619-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07061980000045">The Bill has been much improved since it first appeared many years ago. Much of the angst that we have experienced in the past eight or nine years could have been alleviated had greater regard been paid to the expert committee that reported in 1999 or 2000. Too much emphasis was placed on public safety as a result of some tragic cases that were in the news at that time.</p>

treatment that they need as early as possible. The effectiveness of our mental health services is judged not by the number of people who are subject to detention and sectioning, but by our effectiveness at getting services to them when they need them. I am still disappointed that the Government were unable to accept the new clause on impaired decision making.</p>

Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) suggested that there might be more mental health Bills. However, we have not been able to discuss yesterday or today new clause 1, which would give people suffering from a mental health problem a right to assessment, and we still do not have rights to a comprehensive care plan on discharge. There are issues that we need to address beyond this Bill to ensure that we get excellent services to people when they need them. The Government have done much to invest in mental health services, but I am afraid that it is still a Cinderella service. That is the&#151;</p>

 I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise an issue of considerable concern to many of my constituents, especially those living in the town of Chelmsford: the Post Office&#146;s proposal to move Chelmsford Crown post office from its current site in Exchange way to WH Smith in the High street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07061980000546">Eight sub-post offices have been closed, a number of which were in the most deprived parts of my constituency. The Crown post office became the nearest post office for some local residents, even though many of them&#151;young mothers and pensioners&#151;were not affluent enough to afford vehicular access to it. The post office has been in Exchange way for many years; it is popular and extremely well used. What is important for wheelchair users and people with limited mobility is that it is within 50 yd of car parking for disabled people in Market road, so their access is easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07061980000547">My constituents want to know why the Post Office believes it necessary to move the Crown post office from that site, which is acceptable to local customers and the town, to the High street. We are grateful that it is to remain in the centre of the town with all the other shops, where people naturally go to do their shopping, but there are some drawbacks, the first of which is access. Motorists cannot use the roads that pass WH Smith. The front, in the High street, is pedestrianised, so it is blocked for vehicle access, and the road at the rear, where there is an entrance to the building, can be used only by buses. Even if cars could use it for access, a series of bus stops along the road would make such arrangements unfeasible or impossible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07061980000548">The nearest disabled car parking spaces are about 300 yd away, and I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the Department of Transport&#146;s guidelines on the location of parking bays for disabled people:</p>
<a name="70619-0021.htm_brev12"><a name="07061980000596"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As pedestrians, many disabled people will have a limited mobility range, and will require specially designated parking bays closer to the places they wish to visit. Whether on-street or off-street, parking bays for disabled people should not be further from major destinations (e.g. bank, post office, large store, supermarket.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07061980000549">The guidelines categorise various conditions of disability and the maximum distance from car parking to building. For the visually impaired, the distance should be 150 m; for wheelchair users, 150 m; for ambulatory people without a walking aid, 100 m; and for stick users, 50 m. The disabled parking bays nearest to the WH Smith site are 300 yd away, which will create significant problems for people who need to use wheelchairs or who have limited mobility. The road layout and the siting of the building mean that the problems are insoluble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07061980000550">There is another access difficulty for my constituents. If they want to enter the proposed post office at WH Smith from the pedestrianised area, that is fine because the entrance is at ground level. But if they use the rear entrance&#151;which is adjacent to most of the bus stops, so a lot of people may use it&#151;there are steps immediately inside the building going down to the retail area. That will cause problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07061980000551">My constituents and I find it even more staggering that the post office will be sited not on the ground floor but on the first floor of the building. The Post Office says it will ensure that WH Smith meets the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act, and I have no doubt that it will, but there will be problems if the level of usage is similar to that of the current Crown post office. WH Smith has only one lift for disabled people, which takes a maximum of eight people. If wheelchair users use the lift, eight people will not be able to get in the lift at once. Given the level of usage, particularly at peak times such as on a Saturday, queues will form within the retail area where WH Smith is selling its own products, as people wait for the lift to the first floor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07061980000552">One might also say, correctly, that there is an escalator up to the first floor at the front of the building, but there is no escalator down, so people would have to use the stairs. I have no knowledge of any proposal or commitment by the Post Office or WH Smith to put in a down escalator, and there is an argument that they will not be prepared to do that because if they do, the only way up or down would be by lift or escalator and there would be no stairs, because the building is not big enough to house a proper staircase and a down escalator, and some people do not like using escalators, or would feel that their choices were infringed upon by having to use the escalator option. If the escalators were to break down, of course, the sole option would be the conventional stair system, even though it would be on an escalator that was not moving.</p>

 My hon. Friend knows that many of my constituents will use this post office, and he may also know that the post office in Brentwood faces an identical fate, with the counter being located upstairs. My concern, and I should be grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s views on it, is that people with a disability, who may have difficulty walking or be in a wheelchair, or perhaps parents with prams, will bustle about downstairs waiting to use the lift. If the building has to be evacuated, such people might find themselves trapped.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend because he makes an extremely important point, which to my mind strengthens the case against placing the main Crown post office services on the first floor. There is indeed the potential for safety problems if there were to be a fire or any other form of accident in the building, particularly if, as my hon. Friend says, one is dealing with people who are elderly and frail, or have a disability, or are of limited mobility. My constituents are extremely anxious and unhappy about this element of the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07061980000555">The Post Office has said that it might well provide a few services downstairs. We are in a consultation process, which I will come to in a minute, and it is easy to make promises such as that, but I do not think it adds up to very much. My constituents want to go into the post office, as they do now, on the ground floor, with ease of access, and they want to be able to enjoy the range of services.

services range from buying stamps to dealing with car tax and benefit collection. I am not convinced that a viable limited service could be provided on the ground floor. Yet again, that would eat into the commercial viability of WH Smith, which will use the ground floor to carry on its commercial activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07061980000556">I also want to make a point about the consultation process. We are fairly cynical in Chelmsford, because there was a consultation process about the closure of the eight sub-post offices. I had some input into the consultation, as did many of my constituents, local councillors and others in the local community. The results of the consultation may have been received, but, in all eight cases, no indication was given that attention was paid to them or that they were listened to. When the consultation time ended, the precise proposals that were announced originally were pressed ahead with and implemented. We came to the conclusion that there was little point in having a consultation process, because we felt that no one was listening to the ideas, proposals and counter arguments that we put. Of course, one has to admire the Post Office: cleverly, there were no problems with the postmasters and postmistresses, because they got extremely generous financial remuneration for ending the siting of sub-post offices on their premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para20"><a name="07061980000557">In this case, the consultation process is even trickier, because it is not about the decision to move from one building to another. That is a done deal. The Post Office has said, &#147;This is what we&#146;re going to do,&#148; and I cannot have any input into a consultation process to argue why that is not in the best interests of the local community, or even possibly the Post Office&#151;and neither can my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) or my constituents. That is not on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para21"><a name="07061980000558">The consultation process is on a much narrower issue: the services that will be provided inside the post office. Post offices are post offices; they provide a wide range of services and I would be amazed if the Crown post office, if it moves to WH Smith, started to cut the essential business that it provides to my constituents. If anything, I think it would like to increase the range of services that it provides, and I am all in favour of that. If the Minister believes that that is what should happen, I am 100 per cent. with him. We need to give more business to Crown post offices and sub-post offices to help them to thrive and develop in a highly competitive world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07061980000559">What is the point in a consultation process in that respect, given that we all agree that it is in the interests of the post office to provide more services? I am not convinced about the consultation process, because I fear that the move is a done deal&#151;unless at this late stage the Post Office can be persuaded that the building that houses WH Smith in Chelmsford is not suitable, because of the problems with access and the Department for Transport guidelines on the maximum distance between where cars can be parked and the building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para23"><a name="07061980000560">I had a meeting with Post Office representatives this morning, which I found useful because I had an opportunity to explain my points to them. Not unnaturally they are not intimately familiar with Chelmsford High street and its WH Smith, but they were prepared to listen and they took on board my points about vehicular access and the layout of the building. However, the Post Office has to realise that, although it is a business&#151;I do not  <br>

object to that or have a philosophical problem with it&#151;it is also a service to the community. It has a loyal customer base that uses the Crown post office and has used it even more since the closure of one particular sub-post office. The Post Office has an obligation to its customers and an obligation to think about the social service that it provides, as well as the commercial service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para24"><a name="07061980000561">I urge the Post Office to think again, even at this late stage, because it has come up with a building that is not as suitable as it may have thought. I think that this has probably got wrapped up in the fact that the Post Office is implementing a package with several branches of WH Smith throughout the country. Of course, not all the branches have the same layouts and are in the same sorts of building. Some of the branches might work very well and be extremely suitable, but I bet that they will not be on the first floor, with difficult to access for those with disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para25"><a name="07061980000562">I understand that the Minister cannot wave a wand and tell the Post Office not to behave in such a way. I do not expect him to announce that he will do that today, much as I would love him to do so. However, given his Department&#146;s connections and dealings with the Post Office, I hope that he will be able to persuade it to reflect on the concern, anger and disappointment of my constituents. I also hope that he will ask it to think again and perhaps find a more suitable building in the centre of Chelmsford that does not have the same problems as the building it has selected.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) on securing the debate. He spelled out clearly the importance of postal services to his constituents and emphasised his concerns about the future of the Crown post office in Chelmsford high street following the announcement made by Post Office Ltd on 19 April of its decision to move the branch to a nearby WH Smith store. I know that he has been lobbying hard and making strong representations on behalf of his constituents. I will try to answer the questions that he asked about Crown post offices, although I must emphasise that the Government do not have a role in detailed operational decisions such as that on the Chelmsford office, which he accepts. Nevertheless, I emphasise that the Government share the concerns of hon. Members about securing a sustainable future for the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para26"><a name="07061980000564">The hon. Gentleman appreciates that there is a pressing need to tackle the significant losses that the network of Crown post offices is incurring. There are about 450 Crown post offices and it is estimated that they lost about &#163;70 million last year alone. Clearly, that position is not sustainable, and the Government fully support the Post Office&#146;s policy for reducing the losses, which includes maintaining a core network of Crown post offices while continuing to drive forward efficiencies and the franchising of branches when suitable opportunities arise. We welcome the commercial deal between Post Office Ltd and WH Smith because it will secure the retention of a main post office service in each of the 70 areas affected. Without that deal, there would have been a huge question mark hanging over the future of many Crown post offices and a question whether there might be outright closures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para27"><a name="07061980000565">Concern has been expressed about the service provided in franchised Crown branches. The evidence from the pilots with WH Smith shows that it is wrong to say to customers that franchising a post office will automatically lead to a reduction in the quality of service. Staff at franchised post offices are trained by Post Office Ltd in exactly the same way as directly managed staff. Franchisees are bound by stringent contractual requirements to ensure that service standards remain at the same high level following the transfer from the direct management of Post Office Ltd. It is important to say that franchising is not closure. Franchises and conversions do not reduce the number of post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07061980000566">I can appreciate that customers will initially be unsure about the service implications of moving the branch from its existing location, as the hon. Gentleman outlined. Change can be unsettling&#151;for some more so than others&#151;but I understand that there is positive evidence from mystery shopper visits to, and focus group feedback on, the six pilot transfers to WH Smith stores that took place last year. The majority of customers welcome the pleasant environment and excellent customer service. More generally, many customers welcome the fact that there is a complementary retail offering on the same premises, as well as extended opening hours, which usually go hand in hand with the transfer to a franchise partner. Indeed, I understand that the new Chelmsford branch will offer extended opening hours of 9 am to 5.30 pm from Monday to Saturday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para29"><a name="07061980000567">Critically, the decision emphasises to customers that post office services will continue to be provided in Chelmsford town centre. Almost 14,000 post offices are already run by private businesses&#151;individuals or franchise chains&#151;including some 900 or so of the 1,400 large main post offices in town centres. The network has always relied on private business for the majority of its outlets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para30"><a name="07061980000568">The hon. Gentleman spelled out in detail his concerns about the consultation arrangements. It is important to stress that the local public are being consulted by Post Office Ltd. As agreed between the Post Office and Postwatch, the consumer champion, in the code of practice on post office closures and relocations, there is consultation on the service implications for each franchised office. However, it has always made clear that the decision to transfer the management of a Crown branch to a franchise partner is an operational decision for the Post Office to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70619-0021.htm_para31"><a name="07061980000569">The proposal to convert the WH Smith branch in Chelmsford went to public consultation on 30 May 2007 and runs to 11 July 2007. I would expect the important matters that the hon. Gentleman raised this evening, such as the disabled parking bays, to be addressed during the consultation. I hope that his meeting today with Post Office Ltd gives him some reassurance that it will take those matters on board. This evening&#146;s Adjournment debate will help in that process. The current planned month of the transfer is October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07061980000570">Post Office Ltd has taken decisions on which branches will convert to WH Smith management based on a range of factors, including the proximity to WH Smith stores that are seen as suitable to accommodate a post office franchise, existing overheads such as the lease on properties, and what the company and WH  <br>

Smith consider to be the future potential of branches. They are not a reflection on the current branch performance or on the people working in the branches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07061980000571">In some stores, as in Chelmsford, the first floor provides the most suitable space to accommodate the post office facility. I understand that the existing branch has a total of 10 fortress-style counters, and the new location will also provide 10 positions, with eight of those being open-plan. As regards disability access, Post Office Ltd has given an assurance that all branches will be fully accessible to all customers, with special arrangements in place to assist customers with special access needs, for example in branches like Chelmsford, where the post office counter is not on the ground floor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07061980000572">As one would expect from an established prominent high street retailer, WH Smith is also fully aware of its responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and will ensure that the branch remains fully accessible for all customers, including those with mobility problems. Although I understand that the store, as the hon. Gentleman described, does not have an escalator from the first floor down to ground level, a customer lift is available in-store for customers unable to negotiate the stairs. I understand that the lift holds a maximum of 13 people at any one time and is capable of accommodating pushchairs and wheelchairs. The Post Office and WH Smith are therefore confident that this will adequately accommodate the needs of customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07061980000573">Many customers will see the products that WH Smith and the Post Office sell as complementing each other. The deal with WH Smith guarantees that that branch will be operated for a minimum period of seven years. In the extremely unlikely event that WH Smith does not want to extend the initial contract or is unable to fulfil it, the Post Office would obviously take steps to ensure that services are retained in that key location. It must be remembered that typically some 10 per cent. of the offices in the network change hands every year, so the Post Office is very experienced in managing that successfully. The deal between Post Office Ltd and WH Smith is a purely operational and commercial issue for the parties, and does not impact on the Government&#146;s recent consultation on the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07061980000574">There are a number of challenges facing the post office network, including the need to tackle the losses of the Crown network. Although many of us and our constituents say we like our post office and value it highly, the reality is that, collectively, we do not use it as we once did. It is an undeniable fact that many people now prefer to pay their bills by direct debit or use one of the Post Office&#146;s competitors, do their banking via the internet or use a cash point machine, renew their motor vehicle licences online, and keep in touch using emails or text messages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07061980000575">Some 4 million fewer customers are using post offices each week compared with just two years ago. Although many Crown offices might still be very busy and well used, they are trading low margin products in high cost locations. In the financial year 2005-06 the post office network lost &#163;2 million a week, as we have discussed in the Chamber on a number of occasions in the past six months at least. When the figures for the performance in the financial year 2006-07 are released, it is expected that the losses will be closer to &#163;4 million per week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07061980000576">For too long the Post Office was deprived of much needed investment. The Government have reversed that approach and invested substantial sums in supporting the network&#151;some &#163;2 billion since 1999. We have supported Post Office Ltd in its efforts to develop its range of financial service products, with Government&#146;s investment having included &#163;500 million for the Horizon project to bring computer systems into every post office throughout the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07061980000577">The Post Office recognises the need to increase its range of services, adapt to changing shopping habits and give sub-postmasters products to sell that appeal to the needs of today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s customers. Post Office Ltd is the largest provider of foreign currency in the UK and the third largest provider of travel insurance. The Post Office is also the UK&#146;s fifth largest fixed-line telephone service provider, and one in every 25 credit cards issued last year was from the Post Office. So new products have been introduced and more are in the pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07061980000578">Through the statement made by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last month and the &#163;1.7 billion committed to Post Office Ltd until 2011, the Government have set out a framework to create stability for the network so that the Post Office can move forward with confidence and rise to the challenges of the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70619-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07061980000579">I do not underestimate the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman has outlined on behalf of his constituents. I am convinced that Post Office Ltd will take those points on board and respond to him positively. The urban reinvention programme of several years ago did not start out as the best consultative exercise that the country has ever seen. The Post Office recognises that, as does Postwatch, and I have said on behalf of the Government that that was the case. However, the position when it finished was a lot stronger than it had been before, Postwatch is very well placed to ensure that it represents the consumer much more effectively and Post Office Ltd is becoming much more sensitive and can be expected to respond positively by Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I will make sure that the comments that he has made tonight will be communicated to Post Office Ltd as part of the consultative exercise.</p>
