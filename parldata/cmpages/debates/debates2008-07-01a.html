When I visited the site, it was made clear to me that the local authority was undertaking this in a positive spirit because it recognised that it faced a real housing supply problem and that it had to look for alternatives to building out from the local market town of Louth, which is not far away. It is its choice to remove this option from the list&#151;which, I should make clear, was a local authority bid&#151;but it will still have to recognise that it has a housing supply and affordability problem that it must address, and that the problem will not go away even though it has removed its bid for an eco-town.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. One purpose of the eco-town programme is, of course, to provide more housing, but another is to look at what innovation can be brought to bear on making sure we have zero carbon across a whole development and on taking advantage of the opportunities that a site the size of 5,000 households at minimum can give us. We must look at what we can learn from this programme. Already in the last six months we have learned an awful lot about waste, water neutrality and about both the technologies that are currently available and those that are in the pipeline and that could be applied to the eco-town programme. As my hon. Friend says, we must learn about how they could be applied to new builds in existing communities or be retrofitted in existing communities. The benefits of the programme are to do with eco-towns, but they also offer a lot of potential for the built environment elsewhere.</p>

 We certainly will not be going on our motorbikes together; that is for sure. I cannot promise that I will go to those specific areas, but I reassure the hon. Gentleman and the whole House that the eco-towns programme, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing has said, is subject to intense scrutiny and proper examination. We have to make some difficult decisions, and we saw last week during the final stages of the Planning Bill the inability of the Conservative party to take difficult decisions.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will know that she has hardly been able to walk past me or my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) over the past few months without our badgering her about the Kings Norton new deal for communities project. I thank her for confirming &#163;21.6 million for that project over the next three years. Will she confirm that the important thing now is that Birmingham city council and the other partners should get on with putting the project into practice? I echo, too, the point made by my hon.

 I would not quite classify my hon. Friend as having stalked me around the corridors of the House of Commons, but he has done exactly what a good Labour MP should do, which is to call Ministers to account and to press his case. He has done that effectively. I confirm that the priority is to get on and to make the difference. The big capital investment in Kings Norton will significantly transform his area. We have discussed before in the House the importance of the development trust being able to lead the development and to shape it for the future in the way that local people want. That is how we get sustainability.</p>

Let us not forget that the result of eight years of Labour investment in the new deal for communities has been significant changes in tackling crime, raising young people&#146;s educational achievements and raising people&#146;s satisfaction with their area. One thing on which we need to do more is tackling worklessness, which is why I am concerned that in the areas involved, local authorities in particular must work with Members and the community to give some of the people who have never had a chance the opportunities that we can offer them.</p>

 The 2007 comprehensive spending review provided &#163;6.5 billion for the delivery of 45,000 social rented homes a year by 2010-11. I recently announced that the Housing Corporation will have increased flexibility to help registered social landlords and others to purchase new homes from developers for social rent. It is expected that &#163;200 million will be spent on that in 2008-09.</p>

 What we can do is ensure that we use the money that we have available for our affordable housing programme to keep the market moving. I shall shortly announce a new set of actions that we will take to show that we have ideas about what happened last year and how the programme will go forward. Clearly, that will be affected by events here today, to which we must be able to adapt. I hope that the announcements that I shall make shortly will show that we are responding to the situation. We will build more affordable homes, for rent and to buy, but at the same time we will use our revenue and influence to ensure that we help the housing market at this difficult time.</p>

 Will the Housing Minister undertake to examine objectively the cost of providing affordable houses in the eco-towns? If it turns out that they are much more expensive than affordable housing elsewhere, will that not drain the budget and make it much more difficult to meet the Government&#146;s overall target for affordable housing?</p>

 I will take that as support for affordable housing in eco-towns. Of course we look at price issues. I have said that the eco-towns should aim for at least 30 per cent. affordable housing, which could be for rent but will also include low-cost home ownership. That demonstrates the fact that, along with our aims on other fronts such as public transport and the environmental sustainability of eco-town projects, affordable housing is very important to this Government in any development, including eco-towns.</p>

 A number of new flats in my constituency remain unoccupied and planning permissions are not being progressed, presumably as a result of the current state of the housing market. Does my right hon.

 Of course, we do not just impose housing targets out of nowhere. We have in place an assessment that takes into consideration the housing needs of communities, and I suggest to my hon. Friend&#146;s local authority and others that they ensure that they undertake that assessment. The planning guidance and other help that we have given them enables them to influence what sort of housing is built. If local authorities all got on with developing their local development framework, that would give a much better indication of their vision for their community. When developers made proposals, local authorities would then be in a stronger position to argue against the sort of housing that might not meet local needs.</p>

 Three quarters of the homes in my constituency that were built as social rented properties have been sold off. As a consequence, the supply of social rented properties locally is inadequate, and one in three of the young people we lose never return because of the lack of affordable housing. Does the Minister accept that it is very important to ensure that homes built to be social rented properties remain affordable, and that community land trusts perform an excellent role in ensuring that such homes are protected from the vagaries of Government policy?

 Not only do we recognise the importance of CLTs as a model for the support of local affordable housing, we are doing something about it. We are already working with a number of CLTs of various sizes around the country. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright), has been engaged with this matter as part of his work on the Housing and Regeneration Bill. We will do more in this area, but I am proud to be part of a Government who are prepared to look at many different options that offer people the chance to have housing in their communities.

 I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has met representatives of the project to which my hon. Friend refers. Her example demonstrates that housing for people in the 21st century should be varied. It might be provided by the local authority, a housing association, a CLT or a co-op, but different models of home provision are exactly what we need if we are to open up the market. I have worked with co-ops to tackle worklessness and social housing. Their excellent work has had an important influence on showing how social housing can be a springboard to further opportunities for people.</p>

our decent homes programme and the measures that we have taken to increase social housing. About 250,000 homes have been made available through registered social landlords, but the work does not stop there. That is why, among other measures, we are working with CLTs, housing co-ops and local housing companies, and the &#163;6.5 billion that we have put into such schemes demonstrates that this Labour Government are on the side of people who need housing.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will know, as I know, that the Government take the importance of green belt and greenfield sites extremely seriously. We have a policy that the majority of development should be on brownfield land&#151;something like 60 per cent. of all new development&#151;and, at 75 per cent. in the past couple of years, we have exceeded that target considerably.

 I hope that the Minister realises that that is equivalent to 60 per cent. more people on waiting lists in England than in the past, that in London there has been a near doubling of people on the waiting lists since Labour came to power, from 181,000 to 333,000, and that in my borough over the same 10-year period the number of those on the list has gone up from 3,700 to 8,900. Will the Minister be far less complacent about Labour&#146;s abysmal record of providing social housing and realise that, unless the Government do fantastically differently in the next two years, they will be regarded as absolute failures in looking after the people of this country, who expected more from a Labour Government?</p>

 I think that I could be accused of a lot of things, but complacency is not one of them. Clearly the pressure on our housing list is concerning, which is why we have doubled the amount of money that we can spend on affordable housing. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), however, we also have to look at the different types of housing that we provide to people. The waiting list is not an indicator of absolute need. Since&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i>If the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) listens, she will hear the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80701-0003.htm_para0"><a name="08070194000116">Since 2003, households have been able to apply to any local authority&#146;s waiting list, which has obviously contributed to some of the rise. On top of that, people are living longer so we often have to find housing for four generations of families compared with three generations years ago. Single-person households now make up 72 per cent. of new household projections. Unfortunately, part of that is because love does not last, people break up and there are more divorces. We are dealing with a very different set of demographics but we have shown that we are putting money behind the initiatives and, like the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), I await with anticipation Mayor Johnson&#146;s plans for affordable housing in London.</p>

 My right hon. Friend must realise that the only way in which to bring the waiting list down is to build more houses. Now that we are entering a period when the house building sector is slowing down, many building companies will make very competitive tenders for public sector housing, so will we work with local authorities to ensure that we can build those houses and reduce the waiting lists?</p>

 Yes, we will work with local authorities. Certainly, some of my discussions over the past month or so have been about the role that local authorities could play both in supporting people who may find themselves in difficulty regarding their mortgage payments and also in working with us to make sure that existing building projects go ahead and on how we can use our muscle in terms of our affordable housing programme not only so that homes are built but also so that we keep people at work in the building trade.</p>

 But is not the recession in the housing market bound to be bad news for people who cannot afford a home at market prices? About 50 per cent. of all affordable homes in Britain are by-products of homes built at market prices, and if the Government do not think a little bit more long term about how those markets might be decoupled so that the social and affordable sector does not depend entirely on the health of the market sector, the misery and misfortune of people who would normally be able to afford a home will inevitably be multiplied in families who cannot afford their home.</p>

 I welcome the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s genuine concern about the affordability of housing. That is why we have helped about 110,000 people on to the housing ladder through our various shared equity and shared ownership schemes. It is interesting to note that despite the current situation a third of transactions are being undertaken by first-time buyers, so there is already some movement in the market. However, just as in May, when I announced an expansion of &#163;100 million in our Open Market HomeBuy package, which helps many people on to the affordable housing ladder, so I shall be making further announcements in the not-too-distant future about what more we can do to help people to have a home of their own. For the long term, I hope that the present crisis will help us to talk with lenders and house builders about different models for home ownership in the future.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Bristol looking at the great work on homelessness that is being done with the local authority. My hon. Friend will be aware that current homelessness legislation provides a strong safety net for families with children and for vulnerable people. As soon as the local authority is satisfied that homelessness is likely within 28 days, it must take steps to ensure that the applicant and his or her household will continue to have somewhere to live. However, I understand her concerns and we are working with the Ministry of Justice, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and others to provide and develop mortgage rescue packages to prevent homelessness in the first place. Alongside the biggest-ever cash injection for homelessness services, I am sure that will help to minimise as much as possible the risk of repossession.</p>

 I wonder whether the Secretary of State has had time to look at the latest survey by the Local Government Association, which has branded 24-hour drinking a failure. The LGA survey warns that violence continues to blight the streets leaving taxpayers with a completely unacceptable &#163;100 million bill. On top of that, local authorities have lost &#163;43 million in licensing costs. Does the right hon. Lady believe that 24-hour drinking is a social experiment that has failed?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be very well aware that the number of 24-hour licences in this country is tiny. There has been a relaxation of licensing provisions so that people can now drink at different times. If he talks to the police, he will find that in his area, as in mine, they are pleased that we now have staggered closing times, and that we do not see the scenes on the streets that we used to see when people all came out of premises at the same time. We now have a better system for managing our night-time economy, which means the local authority, the police, trading standards and environmental services all working together on the issue. That is the practical approach, rather than an approach in which figures are plucked out of the air.</p>

 It is fortunate that the Local Government Association talked to local police and trading standards. The overwhelming majority of health authorities and councils reported pressure on resources. The right hon. Lady cannot kid herself any longer: our towns are nightly turned into vomitoriums, with brawling and bad behaviour. In March 2004, she said that the reforms would create a &#147;continental cafe-bar culture&#148;. How did her dream of a nation at ease with itself, gently sipping chardonnay, turn into something more like chucking-out time in Deadwood?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman thinks that my dream is of people gently sipping chardonnay, perhaps he has not often been on a night out in Manchester, and perhaps he needs to go on one. I can tell him that a night out in Manchester is now a much more pleasant experience, because the police are active on the streets, the local authority has introduced a &#147;best bar none&#148; award in which bars are rewarded for managing their premises properly, and people can go out and thoroughly enjoy themselves in a safe environment.

making practical policies that work on the ground, with people working together. Local authorities&#146; trading standards departments have done an excellent job of cracking down on some of the off-licences and pubs that have been serving drink to under-age youngsters.

 In addition to failing to cope with waiting lists, the Government have, in 10 years, presided over a 10 per cent. reduction in the amount of social housing in England.

 The &#163;6.5 billion that we are putting behind the affordable housing programme is an indication of what we are providing&#151;and that is just for social homes for rent. We are also doing work to enable local authorities to use their land assets, through local housing companies, to build more homes. I am sure that the hon.

We have enabled more than &#163;20 billion to be spent on transforming the living conditions of many social tenants. Sometimes in government, one has to make choices about priorities. Having done that work, we are now in the middle of a programme that will offer many more thousands of homes, with up to 45,000 homes a year being built for social rent by 2010-2011.

 My hon. Friend will be aware that we have strengthened the guidance in that area, and we urge local authorities to use it. Again, however, to strengthen the arm of local authorities, it is very important that they undertake their strategic housing assessment so that they can demonstrate that they are not only up to speed on housing needs locally, but actively engaged in the question of where the housing should go. Alongside that, we are working with local authorities to identify the land banks that are available to them for the location of future housing.

He is right that there is a very high number of challenged schools in his constituency, but Nottingham city schools also have one of the highest rates of improvement in the number of children getting five GCSEs. Yes, the base is low, but the city is doing extremely well in making progress. My hon. Friend has already met the Secretary of State for Children, Schools  <br>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Last week, I saw on the Order Paper that I had been fortunate enough to have a question selected for a response, most likely from one of the Under-Secretaries of State. The question related in every particular to the responsibilities of his Department&#151;to a British standard for flood-resistant products in connection with planning policy statement 25. Imagine my surprise when I saw that my question was no longer to be taken today. I have not had an explanation. If I do not get a satisfactory explanation, will you, Mr. Speaker, look kindly on the issue as a subject for a future Adjournment debate?</p>

<h3 align="center">Transparent Taxation (Receipts)</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="80701-0004.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="08070194000378"><h5 align="left">3.35 pm</h5>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80701-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08070194000351"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for all receipts printed in the United Kingdom to contain a figure for the total amount of tax paid on the goods and services purchased.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08070194000155">I declare my interest as the owner of a small retail store in Swansea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08070194000156">The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that taxation is as transparent as possible. People rightly want to know how their money is spent, but it is also essential for the Government to be open about how that revenue is raised. The Government estimate that the Treasury&#146;s receipts for 2007-08 will be &#163;549.9 billion, projected to rise to &#163;575.2 billion next year. The Bill would be particularly relevant to purchases that are subject to multiple taxes and duties. I am thinking specifically of fuel, tobacco and alcohol, which are everyday items bought, at one time or another, by the majority of the population. Each purchase soon adds up. On those products alone, the Government will rake in an estimated &#163;41.2 billion in 2007-08. That is a huge amount of people&#146;s hard-earned money, and they deserve to see exactly how it is collected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08070194000157">The Bill would benefit the taxpayers of this country and have few, if any, cost implications for major businesses. It would not be an extra burden but merely a hassle-free way of making Government as open as possible. Smaller businesses would not be targeted by any potential legislation; safeguards would be put in place to ensure that they were not adversely affected. Placing the amount of tax generated on each receipt next to the total price would make people better able to see how and where their taxes are collected. It is important that people see where their money is going; in that way, a Government can be held fully accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08070194000158">In researching the Bill I have consulted representatives of the Adam Smith Institute and the TaxPayers Alliance, both of which have given their unequivocal support to the measures that I seek to introduce. Both those organisations have said that taxation should be more transparent and that people have a right to know how much tax they are paying on a particular product. One of the most interesting concepts that surrounds taxation is that of tax freedom day, which shows how long we have to spend working for the Treasury before our money becomes our own. Last year, that meant working from 1 January until 4 June just to pay our tax bill. It is that sort of realisation that hammers home the need for open and understandable taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08070194000159">I should like to take the three main products one by one. Fuel duty currently stands at 50.35p per litre and is scheduled to rise by 2p in October of this year&#151;unless <i> The Independent</i> is wrong, Ministers get their way, and there is yet another U-turn. Then, of course, there is VAT at 17.5 per cent. As with all goods subject to duties&#151;I suspect that a large number of people do not realise this&#151;the Government tax the duty as well. Rather than paying VAT on the basic price of the fuel, we pay it on both the basic price and the 50.35p. In April 2008, according to the Library, unleaded petrol retailed at an average of 107.6p per litre&#151;remember those heady days?&#151;and the average diesel price was 116.5p per litre. According to further figures provided by the Library,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 July 2008">

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 735</b><br>
the pre-tax price would be 41.2p per litre and 48.8p per litre respectively. Putting those figures into context and including VAT, that means that 62 per cent. and 58 per cent. of the money that people pay for their fuel goes to the Treasury. As people will know, during the past few months, while I have been researching this Bill, fuel prices have risen considerably to about &#163;1.20 per litre for unleaded and as much as &#163;1.34 for diesel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08070194000160">My Bill would ensure that people were aware of the rising amount of tax that the Government are creaming off. As a practical example, let us assume that I went to the petrol station and put &#163;20-worth of unleaded petrol in my car. For the most part, the receipt would mention only the amount of VAT but, as I have stated, that is only a minor part of the taxation. Under the Bill, the bottom of my receipt would read, &#147;Total&#151;&#163;20.00; total tax take&#151;&#163;12.40.&#148; There would be no hidden costs, and when the Government talked about 2p rises the public would be able to see the exact effect as soon as it came into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08070194000161">Tobacco is exactly the same. For those without a degree in economics, tobacco taxation is especially complicated. There are two duties on cigarettes. As of 12 March 2008, the specific duty is &#163;112.07 per 1,000 cigarettes, there is an ad valorem duty of 22 per cent. of the retail price and&#151;lest we forget&#151;VAT. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that a packet of 20 king-size cigarettes would be subject to 217.03p specific duty and 109p ad valorem, which suggests that the VAT on a &#163;4.95 packet of cigarettes is 86p. Under the Bill, the receipt would read, &#147;Total&#151;&#163;4.95; total tax take&#151;&#163;4.12.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08070194000162">The Budget immediately raised alcohol taxes by 6 per cent. above inflation, and there will be a 2 per cent. rise above inflation every year until 2013. That is projected to lead to a &#163;600 million rise in revenue for the Treasury by 2008-09. From 17 March 2008, alcohol duty rates are &#163;14.96 per 100 litres of beer and, on wine and spirits, &#163;21.35 per litre of pure alcohol. To most normal people, such figures and statistics are not grounded in reality and everyday life. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that we currently pay 30.04p on every pint of beer, 134p on bottles of wine and 548p on bottles of spirits&#151;and then there is VAT. Under the Bill, a receipt for a pint of beer that cost &#163;3 would state, &#147;Total tax take&#151;83p.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08070194000163">As with any proposed legislation, it is important to think about the unintended consequences. In the scenario that we are considering, the consequences would be minute, if not non-existent. As many hon. Members know, I am a convenience store owner in Swansea. I know that our till can be programmed to produce the type of receipt to which I have referred with minimal cost to the business, and that it could be done during the next servicing of the till. For businesses whose tills are not capable of that change, there would be no requirement to upgrade and no forced time limit, but the Bill would provide that when they purchased new machinery that could produce the requisite receipts, the till should be programmed accordingly. That way, smaller businesses would not be hit with an additional business cost, but naturally progress to the system that I propose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08070194000164">Let me take the opportunity to reassure the House that there is no intention to impose any negative effect on small businesses&#151;after all, they employ 58 per cent.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 July 2008">

of the UK&#146;s private sector work force. However, it would be in the spirit of the Bill for smaller premises to display signs that specified the tax take on average cigarette, alcohol and fuel products. By the same reasoning, there will be no additional cost to the companies that make the tills. The technology required for that is already available and used in a huge number of tills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08070194000165">That leaves the consumer. I do not believe that a single argument could be made to suggest that the Bill would not be beneficial to consumers. It represents an uncomplicated way of creating a more transparent taxation system, in which the general population can experience at first hand exactly how, where and when they are being taxed. It will lead to greater understanding of the taxation system and, I hope, mark the beginning of the end of stealth taxes, with which the incumbent Government have become synonymous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08070194000166">There is not enough time to go through examples of every tax, and no one would want me to do so. [Hon. Members: &#147;Go on!&#148;] Well, we certainly do not have time to go through all the taxes that the Government have introduced since they came to power in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80701-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08070194000167">The Bill is in the spirit of open government. It is relatively cost and hassle free, and there would be great benefit to the public with no extra burden on them or the retailer. In short, it is a simple measure that would lead to a better understanding of the tax system, allow transparency and provide greater appreciation of how taxes are collected. At a time when hard-working families are feeling the pinch of higher prices on food, fuel, energy, tobacco and alcohol, it is only right that the Government should also tighten their belt, and let the public see the total tax as well as the total tax spend.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend say a little more about this while she is setting the scene? She quoted from the Treasury Select Committee&#146;s press release and mentioned a figure of 1.1 million households. I believe that that represents 20 per cent. of the figure of 5.3 million households that was put forward last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Treasury officials appearing before the Treasury Select Committee last year said that they broadly accepted that figure. Will the Minister tell the House whether the Treasury has looked again at that figure? Many hon.

I was contacted today by a constituent who feels that she has been hit by a double whammy, because she will also lose out as a result of the switch from housing benefit to housing allowance. Can the Minister give me an assurance that all these cross-cutting issues will be looked into when the Chancellor returns to this matter in the pre-Budget report?</p>

No one inside or outside the Chamber really believes that the changes introduced by the Government in new clauses 11 and 12 are some kind of well thought through, counter-cyclical response to the economic slow-down. They were announced on 13 May as an attempt&#151;to use the language of the Treasury Committee&#151;to pull a rabbit out of the hat ahead of the Crewe and Nantwich by-election and to undo the damage that the Prime Minister did in the 2007 Budget by putting short-term political calculation ahead of long-term political principle. Behind the spin, this is simply the final act&#151;at least, it is for this year&#146;s performance&#151;of what, depending on one&#146;s point of view, is either a tragedy or a farce of epic proportions, which has been delivered at epic cost, both financial and political.</p>

 I note the tone in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s final phrase, but I do not know where he has been over the past couple of months. He knows very well that the answer to that question is no. We have said that we accept the abolition of the 10p rate and the simplification of the tax system. That is supportable, but the Government have to ensure that it is delivered in a way that is not carried on the backs of the poorest taxpayers in our society. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have been keen to promote that principle. What I am speaking warmly of is the principle that when parties make manifesto commitments&#151;we could all think of a few of them&#151;it is generally good for the health of the body politic if they deliver on them.</p>

The Financial Secretary told us that there were very sound reasons for abolishing the 10p rate. The very sound reason that I can determine is that it was in order to fund the 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax that was announced with a flourish at the end of the 2007 Budget speech&#151;a speech that was constructed and intended to be the launch pad for the then Chancellor&#146;s bid for the Labour leadership and thus the office of Prime Minister. He thought that, by giving a demonstration of Blair-like ability to appeal to middle English voters, he would appeal to his party as an election winner in the mode of his predecessor. The price that was to be paid by the poorest in our society in the form of a deferred increase was buried in the small print. The plan was to hold the election in the autumn and worry about the mess that fell into place the following spring after the election was safely out of the way. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80701-0005.htm_para22"><a name="08070194000221">Therefore, the Chancellor did not announce a fiscal giveaway in the Budget in March because he had nothing left to give away. In fact, he said in his Budget speech that the best way to help families is not through a further rise in personal tax allowances. Of course, that was before; now he claims that he meant to say that the best way to help families is through a further rise in personal tax allowances. As the temperature started to increase on the Labour Back Benches, the Chancellor pleaded that he had no money, and said that he could not rewrite the Budget. As the temperature reached boiling point when the Bill was before a Committee of the whole House, however, his resolve snapped once again, and a perfect 180° U-turn was executed by the Treasury&#146;s now rather accomplished U-turns team&#151;veterans of the non-dom tax, the entrepreneurs relief, the foreign profits tax, and now the banking reforms. The Budget that could not be reopened was reopened; the money that the Chancellor did not have was found; and the barbarians at the gate&#151;I am sorry to refer to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) in those terms&#151;were bought off. Or were they?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80701-0005.htm_para23"><a name="08070194000222">The emergency Budget on 13 May plucked another &#163;2.7 billion of borrowing out of the air, and at a stroke reduced the number of losers from the 10p tax debacle from 5.3 million families to just 1.1 million families. But two questions remain to be answered. The first is the one that the Financial Secretary identified from the Treasury Committee&#146;s report: what about the other 1.1 million families? On the day of the great climbdown, when the right hon. Member for Birkenhead went to see the Prime Minister, the words being used were &#147;compensation in full backdated for everyone&#148;. To date, we have still not heard how the remaining 1.1 million losers will be compensated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80701-0005.htm_para24"><a name="08070194000223">Secondly, we have not heard from the Government what will happen next year. Will the personal allowances stay at the level of new clause 11, and be indexed in accordance with existing law? Will the additional winter fuel allowance be repeated in future years? Speculation is rife. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that, in the absence of action to extend the effect of new clause 11 into 2009-10 and 2010-11, by 2010&#151;which, as hon. Members will have noted, could be a general election year&#151;some 18 million families would be worse off than they are in 2008-09.</p>

House? We are genuinely puzzled over why some of those on the lowest incomes should face this tax increase, and we cannot believe that the Government really intended it. Is it not rather a pity that the Financial Secretary did not repeat the assurance that all 1.1 million people would be guaranteed not to be worse off by whatever means the Government come up with in the autumn?

 That is true. There was speculation at the beginning of this fiasco as to whether it was a simple error&#151;a failure to understand the distributional consequences of the measure&#151;but I well remember saying in the Committee of the whole House that, while I deferred to no one in my enthusiasm for criticising the Prime Minister, I had never suggested that he was either stupid or innumerate. Subsequently, in evidence to the Treasury Committee, officials have made very clear that a full distributional analysis was undertaken, that the measures announced in the 2007 Budget were announced&#151;as the phrase goes&#151;with eyes wide open, and that the Prime Minister knew exactly what he was doing. What his game plan was at the time, when he was faced with the Labour party leadership and a possible election in the autumn, is anyone&#146;s guess, as I have said.

 Various suggestions are being bandied about. I do not consider it my responsibility to be prescriptive about the solution that the Government should adopt.

While I do not propose that he should help the Government to dig themselves out of a hole, he might suggest that he would be ready to ensure that they do not get out of the hole without fulfilling the commitment made to the very poorest workers.</p>

families who are still worse off, and in future years for those who have been compensated by the increase in personal allowance but do not yet know if they will get the increase next year along with the additional winter fuel payments. We are united on that, because it is morally unacceptable to fund a tax cut on the backs of the poorest, and because the Government promised that they would do such a thing&#151;and rebuilding political trust in this country, which is a priority for my party, requires that Governments get into the habit of keeping the promises they make.</p>

It is a variant on an amendment that we tabled in Committee of the whole House and it should appeal alike to those who expect the best from the Chancellor and those who fear the worst, because it introduces a sunset provision for the changes to the starting rate unless the Chancellor has by the end of this year laid before the House of Commons a report setting out what he has done, and what he intends to do, to compensate those who are still losers when all the measures are taken together, following the introduction of the measures that the Government are introducing today.</p>

Given the parliamentary arithmetic&#151;unless the rate of by-elections increases a little between now and the end of the year&#151;that will mean in practice that he must satisfy the 50 or 60 Labour Back Benchers who have been most concerned about, and active on, this issue that he has in this autumn&#146;s pre-Budget report delivered on the commitment to compensate all the losers.</p>

the benefits of the 2007 proposals that was trumpeted by the Chancellor at the time, and spoken of in warm terms by the Financial Secretary in consideration of the National Insurance Contributions Bill, was the alignment of national insurance and tax thresholds. We were told that that would bring greater simplicity to the tax system and reduce cost burdens for businesses and taxpayers alike. It was a strategic step in what the Financial Secretary called the significant simplification of the tax and NI system. Indeed, she told the House during consideration of the Bill that the alignment of NICS and higher rate income tax was the &#147;main purpose&#148; of the Bill. I am sorry to have to tell the House that, if that was the main purpose, the House&#146;s time has been wasted. Thanks to new clause 12, as the Government claw back the benefit of the increased personal tax allowances from higher rate taxpayers, the higher threshold for national insurance contributions will remain, so people will still pay more in national insurance, but the threshold for the higher rate of tax is dropped, reintroducing the complexity&#151;the removal of which was claimed to be one of the principal benefits of the 2007 package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80701-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08070194000242">New clause 6 seeks to shine the spotlight on the misalignment of tax and national insurance thresholds. It would require the Treasury, in any year when the thresholds are different, to report to Parliament explaining why, setting out its plans for convergence in the future, and setting out the costs to employers and the HMRC of a divergent system and the savings that would be made by convergence. The Government have made the case that a simpler tax system is a better one. That is ironic, in view of the fact that this is the same Government who have given us the longest tax code in the world and made our tax system one of the most complicated, but on this issue they were right. If it were not so debilitating to Britain&#146;s reputation, it would be laughable that just about the only effective measure that the Government have introduced to simplify the tax system has unravelled under the weight of their incompetence.</p>

I would be interested to hear from the Financial Secretary whether the Government are still committed to the objective of aligned thresholds, because her language of late has suggested a desire to move the thresholds closer together, rather than the original and meaningful purpose of aligning them completely.</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend served with distinction on the Committee that considered the National Insurance Contributions Bill. He is well-versed in these issues. The Financial Secretary will have heard his comments and, I hope, will feel able to respond to them in her substantive speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80701-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08070194000246">Let me move on to new clause 1A. There is a theme among these amendments and new clauses of seeking to strengthen Parliament&#146;s control over the process. New clause 1A seeks to strengthen Parliament&#146;s knowledge and oversight of the Treasury&#146;s projections in a situation where the state of the public finances is deteriorating rapidly. Traditionally, the Chancellor gives to Parliament statements of the Treasury&#146;s forecast of economic growth and public borrowing twice a year&#151;at the pre-Budget report in November and at the Budget in March. In normal times, that is just about sufficient. However, when the public finances are deteriorating rapidly and economic growth projections are being downgraded regularly, that is simply not good enough. Parliament is being kept in the dark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80701-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08070194000247">At the time of the pre-Budget report last year, the Chancellor said that the Government would borrow &#163;36 billion and that growth this year would be 2 to 2.5 per cent. In the Budget, just four months later, he said that he would borrow &#163;43 billion&#151;&#163;7 billion more&#151;and downgraded his growth forecast to 1.75 to 2.25 per cent. Since then, the continuing effects of the credit crunch and the oil price shock, all of which Britain is ill-prepared to absorb, have led every commentator, including the Bank of England, sharply to downgrade their expectations of economic growth. With a downgrading of the growth forecast invariably comes a downgrading of tax receipts and, all other things being equal, an increase in the expected level of borrowing.</p>

The Government have now stated that they will borrow an extra &#163;2.7 billion for the 10p compensation package. The picture is complicated and it is simply not good enough, when the Government is led by a Prime Minister who claims to want to reinforce the accountability of the Executive to Parliament and to build a new relationship between citizen and Government, for them to keep both Parliament and the population in the dark.</p>

They must make those proposals known to Parliament, and not only in private to their Back Benchers.

At least one of those myths was laid to rest in 1997, when the incoming Labour Government famously committed to&#151;and delivered on&#151;public expenditure levels that were unchanged from those of the previous Conservative Government. It is perhaps a measure of the Opposition&#146;s esteem for this Government that they have committed&#151;if they were to return to power in, say, 2015, or some later date&#151;to stick to our public expenditure levels for a two-year period.

especially for the low-paid, is hugely important to Labour Members. That is why the abolition of the 10p tax rate in the 2007 Budget had such resonance on our Benches. It was because of its impact, which I shall discuss in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80701-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08070194000266">The most effective Labour Prime Minister of the 20th century was indisputably Harold Wilson, who famously said&#151;I think that it was at the October 1962 Labour party conference:</p>
<a name="80701-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="08070194000367"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This party is a moral crusade or it is nothing.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80701-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08070194000267">The last Prime Minister quoted those words on the death of Harold Wilson. Amen to them, because many Labour Members felt moved to join our party in a crusade to combat poverty, tackle inequality and root out injustice. We can be proud of a legion of successes and advances, but when it became clear that the unintended consequences of the 2007 Budget would adversely affect 5.3 million people on low pay, while leaving 21 million people better or no worse off, we were alarmed that poverty, inequality and injustice were being worsened by the decisions that had been taken. That was a triple whammy, and we urged the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;by then it was the new Chancellor&#151;to eliminate it. We did not want those three problems of poverty, inequality and injustice to become entrenched, perpetuated or institutionalised to any extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80701-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08070194000268">That was how the debate started about how to get out of the situation. It was not a problem such as would feature in the children&#146;s comics, where with one bound we could be free. An awful lot of time, trouble and evaluation of options was involved. My early contribution to try to assist the Government drew on my background as a tax accountant. I designed and promoted a fairly simple framework based on an additional tax allowance of &#163;1,200, but with tapering. It would have compensated those who had lost out, and only them, with the amount that they had lost through the abolition of the 10p rate, and only that amount. The people who were affected at that stage, before the 13 May announcement, were typically those on an income starting at about &#163;5,200. The peak loss occurred among people with an income of about &#163;7,600, for whom the loss was about &#163;240, and it tapered off because of all the tuppences that they were receiving from a lower rate at a capped level of about &#163;19,600. So there was a triangle with, at its centre, &#163;7,600. Those people who earned about that amount were, before the 13 May statement, losing about &#163;240.</p>

 I can. There are always myths in the area of taxation and accountants grow fat exposing them or sometimes exploiting them. The fact is that the official reason for the abolition of the 10p rate was at least in part that it would fund the reduction of the standard rate from 22p to 20p. The actual losses of 5.3 million people, as I shall go on to explain in a moment, aggregated to about &#163;700 million in that regard. In no way did the savings generated for the Government by the abolition of the 10p rate for the lower band of  <br>

income earners fund the tuppence reduction for salaries that went off into infinity from about &#163;19,600. I think that I intervened on the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) in the Budget debate to make that point. They made a small contribution to that reduction, but it would be unfair to say that it was a case of the poor subsidising the rich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80701-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08070194000271">I therefore devised a fairly simple framework to compensate people with the exact amount that they had lost. They typically had income taxed at only 10 per cent. under the old system, between &#163;5,200 and &#163;7,600. The maximum loss was &#163;240 per annum. I incorporated my framework into early-day motion 1477. In a rare success, I got a letter published in <i> The Guardian</i> on 7 May, six days before the Chancellor announced the details of his scheme. One part of it reads:</p>

They have a higher tax allowance that is tapered off and disappears. It starts to taper off at about &#163;21,000 and disappears totally by about twice that sum. I urged my right hon. Friend the Chancellor not to pursue the winter fuel allowance, national minimum wage and tax credit route for the under-65s. It was an imprecise, uncertain and lengthy way of doing it. This is a tax problem. It was a problem injected into the taxation system and it needed a solution within the tax system. It did not need solutions that were incomplete, delayed or inaccurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80701-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08070194000276">I was pleased to be present in the Chamber on 13 May when the Chancellor announced an extra tax allowance, albeit not my &#163;1,200, which would have been the basis for reimbursement of full losses. The Chancellor decided to reimburse average losses, so obviously the tax allowance he inserted was not &#163;1,200 but &#163;600. That reimbursed the average loss of &#163;120, but it was not tapered and allowed for the fact that it was not applied to those who pay income tax at the 40 per cent. rate&#151;as all of us in the Chamber do. New clauses 11 and 12 are designed to implement the Chancellor&#146;s statement of 13 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80701-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08070194000277">The package was broadly welcomed on the Labour Benches at the time, but the difficulty was that it gave &#163;120&#151;&#163;600 extra allowance at 20 per cent.&#151;to 22 million people, of whom a good 14 million or more were not adversely affected by the abolition of the 10p rate. They had not received a hit of any kind, but 5.3 million&#151;that famous figure&#151;had been affected.</p>

 I was just coming to that point, so I shall make it now. New clause 20, to which I am speaking, sits on top of the Chancellor&#146;s existing arrangements. I did not want to interfere with the thrust of those arrangements, because 14 million or more of the 22 million people in question will have already factored into their personal budgets the fact that they will receive &#163;120 during this tax year&#151;&#163;60 in September and &#163;10 in each of the following six months. As the Chancellor said on 13 May, that was designed in part to compensate people for higher fuel bills and so on.

What will it cost? It is a matter of relatively straightforward and simple arithmetic. The maximum uncompensated loss at present, which went from 0 to &#163;240 to 0&#151;from &#163;7,200 and so on&#151;has been reduced by &#163;120, so the uncompensated loss runs from 0 to &#163;120 to 0 again. The average uncompensated loss, which my new clause will address, is around the &#163;60 mark as far as we can tell: thus, 1.1 million people at &#163;60 is &#163;66 million. That is not an enormous sum; it is the kind of amount that the Chancellor might find down the back of the metaphorical settee when announcing his Budget. It really is a trivial sum. It is about 100th of 1 per cent. of his total tax take, not a major hit on the level of taxation. At only &#163;66 million it is very good value, and I am sure that the Chancellor and his representative on the Treasury Bench must be tempted to snatch my hand off at this point.</p>

I think that there may have been heated debates about that in the Committee. I would love to get on to the Treasury Committee; that is a bid for membership, although the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which I have served for seven years, is a fine Committee. I guess that there were heated debates in which a rather stronger phrase than &#147;not substantially well-targeted&#148; was used. The phrase is much too kind, because the approach that the 13 May statement took towards dealing with the uncompensated 1.1 million people was like using a blunderbuss at Bisley, as I heard someone on the radio say this morning. I agree with that statement, not least because I made it myself.</p>

There was always a trade-off between targeting and complexity; we know that. Such trade-offs are endemic in the taxation and welfare systems. We have to deal with that in whatever way we can. The Chancellor faced a dichotomy&#151;a clear choice. He could go for a simple system, perhaps with a simple flat-rate allowance, but that would be expensive because of the dead weight and the lack of tapering. Otherwise, he could go for a slightly more complicated system that was cheap, focused and targeted. I think that that is a fair description of new clause 20, which I am promoting.</p>

Typically, constituencies represented by Labour Members of Parliament have 2,000 or perhaps even 2,500&#151;in some cases there are 3,000&#151;such individuals or families. To Members of Parliament, &#163;120 a year may not seem a substantial sum, but to families who are up against it, with high and rising core prices, even an addition of &#163;10 to their monthly income can be helpful, crucial or valued.</p>

 About six weeks ago, I was sitting in the front room of a retired miner who had a relatively low retirement income. I would guess that he was about 70 or 71 years old, and he was certain&#151;he had rung me up in high dudgeon, so I dashed the two miles from my office to where he was&#151;that the Chancellor&#146;s abolition of the 10p tax rate had left him with a higher tax burden. However, he was wrong, and I pointed out why. His British Coal superannuation scheme had been slow to implement the much higher personal allowance that the 2007 Budget had provided for from 6 April 2008 precisely to cater for the abolition of the 10p rate, among other things. So my hon. Friend is right: more people felt that they had been adversely affected than had actually been in practice. There has been more concern, hostility and disapproval among not only those who have lost out themselves, but those who have observed our party for a generation and more and believe that what we did at that time did not sit easily with the objectives for which we have fought and will continue to fight.</p>

When the history of the Brown premiership comes to be written, people will offer many explanations on how he came to be such a disappointment in the post. They will say, for example, that he should have called the election in November and that that was a great missed opportunity. They will say that the lost tax discs were indicative of a wider malaise in the Government and that the visit to Iraq during the Conservative party conference made it hard for the Prime Minister to sustain the position that the era of spin had come to an end. All kinds of explanations will be offered on why he failed to live up to expectations, but the one that will last longest in the public mind&#151;because it is not to do with Westminster political to-ing and fro-ing, but with the everyday lives of millions of people&#151;will be the fiasco of the doubling of the 10p tax rate.</p>

As the Treasury Committee rightly says, there are huge dangers in seeking to pull rabbits from hats, but that is precisely what the then Chancellor sought to do. It was a manifestly political move&#151;about his positioning, his inheritance and his wanting to be perceived as the rightful heir to Blair, a mantle that he was keen to claim from the right hon.

I have been a Member of Parliament for only three years, so I have not had the opportunity and privilege of witnessing many Budget speeches. The Budget speech that I am talking about was significant, because it was the final one of an extremely long-standing Chancellor who had served in office for a decade. We remember that the Labour Back Benches resembled a football stadium after a winning goal had been scored in the last minute. There was a sense of euphoria that their man had come up with such a brilliant scheme&#151;that he had out-manoeuvred the Conservative party and made it inevitable that he would become the Labour leader and Prime Minister and that Labour would go on to win the next general election.</p>

We do not agree with the Conservative party policy position&#151;that the Conservatives will match whatever level of tax the Labour Government set. That is not right or responsible, so we are in favour of lower marginal rates of tax for people on low and middle incomes. I will revert to some of the other proposals shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80701-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08070194000327">Let me complete the phases of the Labour rebellion. We began with the joyous response, then we had phase 1 and we moved to the third phase, which was the climbdown. Now we are in the fourth phase, which is rebellion rising up again. That must be a source of great dismay to the Financial Secretary and the Prime Minister, because I suspect that they thought that the issue had been quietly put to one side. Eighty per cent. of those who were losers&#151;roughly speaking, about four out of five of the losers from the doubling of the 10p rate&#151;had been bought off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80701-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08070194000328">What is more, millions and millions of people who were net beneficiaries had been given even more money, although they will all have to repay it eventually. Indeed, we will all have to repay it eventually, because borrowing is, after all, only deferred taxation. In the short term, however, people have more money in their pockets. I assume that the calculation that the Chancellor and the Prime Minister made was that if they could buy off 80 per cent. of the losers, the remaining 20 per cent. would fall by the wayside and not many people would notice. By definition, they were the poorest 1.1 million people, and in many cases probably do not have the loudest voices or the best opportunities to make their grievances known. That was the political calculation.</p>

Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)&#151;that there is always a difficulty on these occasions over whether to go for the simple, easy-to-understand, less well focused and therefore possibly more expensive option or the complex but more targeted option. What the hon. Gentleman has proposed, aligned with what the Government propose, means that they are jointly going for the option that is both expensive and complex. That is probably quite a messy solution, although if they cover all their bases&#151;that would be the result of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#151;they can ensure that everybody is fully compensated. The obvious question is why we got ourselves into this mess in the first place, and that is what I have been trying to help the House understand in the past 10 minutes.</p>

would think that there were enough people in the Labour party wondering where it all went wrong without the need for anybody else to supplement that process. My concern is with the 5.3 million people in this country whom the then Chancellor and now Prime Minister sought, as a deliberate act, to make poorer, even though they were the poorest people in the country. He did that so that he could claim that he was a better heir to Blair than the leader of the Conservative party, make a connection with middle English, despite the fact that he is not English himself, and be an exciting and reforming Prime Minister who could win a fourth term for Labour and reach the promised land of a 20p basic rate, which Margaret Thatcher never achieved.</p>

while the Government tried to decide what to do and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead held a gun to their head. Then the announcement was made that the Government were going to borrow &#163;2.7 billion, &#163;2 billion of which would be given to people who were net gainers in any case. And we are now in a position of having 1.1 million people who are still losers.</p>

The new clause seeks to ensure that, when changes are made to the levels of income tax, a proper assessment is made of the impact of the changes. One of the biggest lessons from this hopeless process must be that sleight of hand&#151;the rabbits being pulled out of a hat&#151;will be consigned to history, and that there will be greater transparency in the setting of taxation. Members of the Treasury Select Committee and Members who wish to participate in debates in the Chamber should be able to have the information clearly and concisely set out on who will be the winners and who will be the losers. We should not have to rely on organisations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It is an excellent organisation, but there is no reason why it should have the job of telling Members of Parliament the implications of Government policy for people on low and middle incomes.</p>

Labour Back Benchers have expressed support for the principle behind the amendment, which is to ensure that this issue does not disappear into the long grass of politics. We do not want a situation in which everyone vents their fury and expresses their reservations here, after which the Government push their measures through using their natural majority and everyone forgets about the 1.1 million people who are still losers as a result of this change. The Liberal Democrats are keen to guard against that, and I would urge Members on both sides of the House to support amendment No. 6. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 people in a typical constituency remained losers, and the amendment would ensure that their interests would not be forgotten when the political debate rolled on to new territory.</p>

fiasco that one also understands what motivated the then Chancellor to introduce the policy in the first place. I can tell all those Members for whom the scales have not yet fallen from their eyes that it was not a concern for the poorest people in this country. If that had been his motivation, he would have rejected the policy instantly. It was done because he wanted to position himself in a way that was politically advantageous over the Conservative party in particular, and to a lesser extent, over other Opposition parties.

Why has this become such a salient political issue at this time? It is because food prices, council tax bills and petrol prices are rising and the sort of people who might not have felt the pinch quite so badly when the then Chancellor announced this policy&#151;the economy was then still growing at a reasonable rate&#151;are now feeling that pinch very acutely indeed.

than the Government&#146;s eventual announcement. I have to say that I wrote to the Chancellor on 9 May; obviously, my letter had not reached him by 13 May, when he announced that the Government&#146;s proposed solution was to raise the tax threshold.

 I urge the Government to think again, and more promptly than their timetable suggests. I do so because many of our constituents are worried sick about the state of their family budgets. Food prices are rising rapidly, and the combination of tax increases and price increases is putting enormous pressure on family energy budgets, especially to meet the fuel bills for motor cars, which many people need to get to work or to the shops, especially in rural areas. At this juncture, the last thing that such people need is extra pressure on their respective budgets from the kind of tax increase that we are discussing. The Government would be well advised to think again about their timetable, and to consider whether they can go further to respond to this very serious and good debate&#151;with perhaps one exception from the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;and to make people feel a bit easier about their future and their family budgets.</p>

The second question is more urgent and important today: what will be offered to the 1.1 million people, who, as the Government admit, along with their critics, are losing out from the mishandled package of tax changes? Can there be some statement to reassure them? I was disappointed that the Minister did not choose to inform the debate more at the beginning.

Their wages, for good reasons, are not going up by enough to compensate for that. We all know that there will have to be a real squeeze on people, but it perplexes us that the squeeze is to be more intense on those on the lowest incomes because of this tax proposal.

Therefore, I must admit that I feel some scepticism when I hear Conservatives talking of their concern about poverty.</p>

 I do not recognise the hon. Gentleman&#146;s figures, but I do know that poverty has been rising recently under this Government, so he should be extremely careful about what he says. People are more interested in today and tomorrow than the dim and distant past. I remember that the Conservative Administrations to whom he refers made sharp reductions in income tax across the piece, thereby benefiting those on lower incomes as well as those on higher incomes, and we were very pleased to do that. Today, I am, however, explaining my personal position in today&#146;s circumstances, and I think it is reflected by my Front-Bench colleagues, in that we feel that the squeeze is too intense and that it is not right for it to be intensified by tax measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80701-0009.htm_para11"><a name="080701101000021">I remember when the Budget we are discussing was delivered. The big reduction in income taxes for the rest of the people&#151;the reduction in the standard rate&#151;came at the very end like a rabbit from a hat. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition had to rise to respond not having had the benefit of any pre-briefing of what the Chancellor was going to do. In the meantime, the shadow Chancellor, myself and one or two other Conservative Members&#151;including, I suspect, the shadow Chief Secretary&#151;had a quick look at the figures and realised what was going on, and the shadow Chancellor immediately left the Chamber to tell the nation it was not a tax cut but a tax con. That was his phrase, and it summed up the situation extremely well. I was the next Conservative Member after the Leader of the Opposition to speak in the debate, and I explained why we felt this was a misjudgment and that quite a lot of people would lose from the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="st_o178"><a name="080701101000022"><a name="80701-0009.htm_spnew9"><a name="080701101000654"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>
 I am enjoying the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s partisan speech, but, on a point of accuracy, the Conservative party leader welcomed the policy and the first Member of this House who raised the concerns we are discussing was a Liberal Democrat.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. The Leader of the Opposition made a careful and sensible speech for someone who had not had a chance to read the Budget. Everybody else who spoke in the debate had had a chance to read bits of it, and as we well know it is necessary to read the Budget as well as to hear it in order to understand what is going on. For understandable reasons, the then Chancellor was much prouder of the tax reductions than he was of the tax increases, and that needed to be filleted out from the documentation. I am just explaining what happened at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80701-0009.htm_para12"><a name="080701101000024">The Government have had a long time to consider the sensible criticisms that were made at the time of the Budget and subsequently. By now, Ministers must have done an awful lot of homework and figure-work on this problem; they must have been worrying away for weeks, if not months, on the 1.1 million. Therefore, I urge the Financial Secretary to share a bit more of her thinking with us in order to allay the fears among her own Back Benches and to deal with the sensible criticisms voiced by the Opposition. Above all, she needs to say to the 1.1 million people not just that the Government wish to be on their side, but that they will take a practical measure to try to assuage some of their grief.</p>

 I shall be brief, which I think will be found merciful. Let me first, however, comment on the great Liberal lion that roared and roared this afternoon. I thought that at any moment there would be some great proposals to help the lowest paid&#151;such as we would have hoped for and expected from Lloyd George&#151;but what happened? A dribble came out about bookkeeping arrangements and offering transparency. They are not unimportant considerations, but this debate is about how we can help the poorest workers in our society, and on that matter the Liberal Democrats spokesman managed, under great prompting from Labour Members, to devote two minutes of his time and had no proposals on the amendment paper that offered any hope.</p>

I come to praise the Government, but also, as gently as possible, to leave a warning with my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. I do not intend to rewrite the history, as some have been trying to do, of the events leading up to the Government&#146;s additional Budget measures to compensate most of those who lost out from the abolition of the 10p rate. All I wish to say to the Government is that although many of the leadership thought that I was running some sort of campaign, I do not think that we sent out even two e-mails on the issue. Labour Back Benchers responded instinctively on this issue. There was real anger felt that, for whatever reason&#151;through oversight or by design&#151;the burden of the Budget should fall on the very poorest. It was that anger that led to the Government&#146;s statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80701-0009.htm_para14"><a name="080701101000027">We should all remember that when the negotiations were going on, we all thought that the Government would say nothing until November. The Government brought forward what we intended to be only part of the measures of compensation. All of us were content at that stage&#151;I certainly was&#151;that we would not see anything until November. The Chancellor of the Exchequer sent my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall) off with his Committee to inquire into the matter and bring back proposals. The Chancellor would then come to the House with a set of measures to compensate those who had lost out. Let us remember the lead-up to this debate: none of us expected the Government to do anything until November. The Government have given details of many of their plans that will come into force in September. We do not think that they go far enough, but we should praise the Government for what they have done.</p>

 Is my right hon.

The right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), and the Liberal Democrat Front Benchers, gave the impression that they were foremost in bringing this important matter to public attention. Is it actually because of pressure by Labour Back Benchers that our poor constituents will be looked after in this way?</p>

There was no campaign on this side&#151;only a couple of e-mails&#151;but Labour Members felt intensely strongly about the issue.</p>

If enough of us feel at that stage that the Government have not fulfilled the promise that we thought that they were making to our poorest constituents, a motion will be tabled. I cannot believe that if those on the Labour Benches again make their views known, the Opposition will not try to exploit that by giving us time to debate the subject. However, that motion will be debated in our name and we will not follow what the Opposition ask us to do in the Lobby.</p>

 In a sense, the right hon. Gentleman has answered the question I was going to put to him. Why does he not support new clause 4? I hope that his reason is not solely that it is tabled in my name and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends. I spoke quite deliberately about it in terms of giving Parliament the last say and I drew attention to the fact that according to current parliamentary arithmetic that essentially means giving the group of 50 or 60 Labour Back Benchers who have been most active on the matter the final say over whether the measures announced in the pre-Budget report are acceptable or not.</p>

Other people might wish to assist us in achieving that objective but all I say to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is that during my 30 years in the House I have never experienced a group of Back Benchers instinctively reacting in the way that we did. If we do not get satisfaction tonight with new clause 20, we will return to the subject in November. We are not prepared for the year to pass by without the Government&#146;s bringing forward measures that, as my hon.

 I am pleased to be speaking on behalf of the Treasury Committee. On Second Reading, I said that the Committee would undertake an inquiry arising from the controversy over the removal of the starting rate of income tax. The result is the report that was published on Saturday, which, I am glad to see, has been welcomed in the House and outside. It is a complex document, reflecting the complexity of the subject.

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 771</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para0"><a name="080701101000037">I had best refer Members to the summary, which documents the five main subjects that we considered. The first was low-income households and the abolition of the starting rate. We said that the losers were those with a small taxable income for whom the loss of a small amount of money was significant when managing a budget at a time of rising prices, particularly rapidly rising energy and food prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para1"><a name="080701101000038">Secondly, we considered the options for 2008-09 and the changes made on 13 May. The problems arose from a removal based in the tax system, and our main recommendation is that the solution should be required to be in the tax system. Thirdly, we looked at the broader context and the poverty targets, to which I shall return later. Fourthly, a big lesson for the Government is the need to get the process right. They need to learn the lessons from the budgetary process and to use the pre-Budget report as it should be used. They should not turn the pre-Budget report into an early Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para2"><a name="080701101000039">Finally, we considered the way forward, which concerned no reforms other than those to the tax system. The 15 May announcement on increased personal allowances is, the Committee says, a welcome step to a simpler tax system with fewer of the low-paid paying income tax. The Treasury should resist introducing further complications to the system. Every effort should be made to avoid returning those who have been taken out of the tax system by the 13 May changes back into the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para3"><a name="080701101000040">I want to concentrate on three brief points. The first is the relationship between tax and poverty priorities. The second is the use of the tax system for further compensation measures. The third is the provision of information by the Treasury and the role of the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para4"><a name="080701101000041">On the relationship of tax and poverty priorities, our report&#146;s detailed analysis makes it clear that the losers from the removal of the 10p band do not equate to the very poorest in society. However, we also highlighted the danger that the household analysis may assume income-sharing in households that does not take place. The Government must pay heed to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para5"><a name="080701101000042">Also, the tax system needs to be considered alongside the welfare system. The system as a whole is not working as well it should, as is shown by the rise in child poverty in 2006. That figure rose by 100,000 to a total, before the deduction of housing costs, of 2.9 million children in poverty. Moreover, there was a sharp rise in pensioner poverty in 2006-07: before housing costs were deducted, that total rose by 300,000. Those figures reversed the tremendous improvements that this Government have made in both areas since 1997, and it is important that we get the Government to return to achieving success in the broader context when it comes to poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para6"><a name="080701101000043">The Committee received powerful evidence that successes in combating poverty have concentrated on the non-working poor. Many people still find that work is not a pathway out of poverty. In-work poverty is an important problem, as we highlight in our report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para7"><a name="080701101000044">The Government must solve the running sore of the abolition of the 10p tax rate, not least so that they can concentrate on more effectively on their long-term priorities in respect of poverty. The Committee made one recommendation that did not get as much attention at  <br>

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 772</b><br>
the weekend as others did. We proposed that a poverty commission should be established to help with the focus on poverty. The Pensions Commission, chaired by Lord Turner, achieved a lot. It was an independent, non-political body and its recommendations to the Government were listened to. I feel that a poverty commission could be a similar organisation: it would comprise independent and non-political people, and would provide an important way of keeping the Government on target. After all, this is the only Government to have set out an ambitious agenda to eliminate child poverty by 2020. If the Government are to achieve their ambitions by 2010, they will have to meet stretching targets: indeed, to do so, they would have to reduce child poverty by 300,000 every year over the next four years. That is ambitious, but they must not give up on that aim. It is important that they continue to concentrate on it, and so I hope that they will take that recommendation very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para8"><a name="080701101000045">Our second recommendation has to do with the use of the tax system for further compensation measures. The Committee report identifies further developments of the tax credits and benefits system that may be needed, in the medium term and beyond, to tackle poverty. However, we are clear that the only way to reach all those who have lost out as a result of the removal of the starting rate&#151;and to compensate all losers in low-income households&#151;is through the tax system. The Government should not meddle with tax credits or anything else, as compensation should be provided through the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para9"><a name="080701101000046">We identify a range of options through the tax system: none is perfect, but we give the Government an option menu. I concur with my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field): this subject was discussed on Second Reading, and if the Government had waited, that might have allowed them to find a more measured way to tackle the problem. However, we have to deal with reality, and my message to the Government is that any solution must be achieved through the tax system, in a measured and considered way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para10"><a name="080701101000047">We do not identify a preferred solution, as the Treasury is best placed to do that. However, the key point that we make is that the changes announced on 13 May and implemented by the proposals before the House are the start of the process, not the end. It is very important that the Government take that on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para11"><a name="080701101000048">My final point has to do with information and the use of the PBR. We seek to identify lessons from the 10p tax saga for future Budget policy making, and draw two main conclusions. First, the Government must be clearer and more open about the distributional effects of their policies, and we recommend that a household impact assessment accompany each Budget and PBR. If such an assessment had been compiled when Budget 2007 was produced, the Treasury Committee would have had time to study it at our leisure. We would have identified both winners and losers, and we would have known where we were going. Any future changes must delineate the winners and losers, as otherwise we will return to opaqueness and confusion.</p>

earlier, it would also have helped Ministers when they were making the original decision. The Treasury&#146;s permanent secretary told us that the full distribution analysis was available to Ministers when the decision was made in 2007. If so, why has it not been published subsequently, so that we could all see it?</p>

 There was a lot of conflicting evidence. I well remember the director of the budgetary process coming before the Committee. He was asked how many losers there would be. Was the total 5.3 million? We asked him that question many times, and at last he responded by saying that that might be the ballpark figure. It was all conjecture, but we want certainty. The Government must bear that in mind in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para12"><a name="080701101000051">The Committee&#146;s report also emphasises the benefits of proper consultation about personal tax measures. We return to a theme that we have identified before&#151;that the Government can and must use the PBR more as a tool for consultation. The outcome would have been better if that approach had been adopted in respect of capital gains tax, inheritance tax and the non-doms&#151;and I could list more examples. The Government should not use the PBR as an early Budget. They should not spring surprises on us: instead, they should use the PBR for consultation purposes, as it was intended. Then, people will not be surprised or disappointed by the content of the Budget when it is announced, because the appropriate the consultation will have taken place. That is an extremely important lesson for the Government to learn.</p>

I want to place it on record that this is not a partisan issue, and that hon. Members of all parties feel that it is wrong to decrease the tax burden on middle-income families by increasing the burden on the poorest. The only people who we know were prepared to press ahead with the measure in the knowledge of its distributional impact were Ministers on the Treasury Bench. We now know that they had full knowledge of the effect that the change would have on the poorest families in our society.</p>

 I note the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments, and he has made his point forcefully. That was a long intervention, and I heard what he had to say. I am sure that all other hon. Members in the Chamber, as well as people listening outside, will have heard him too. However, my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire drew to the House&#146;s attention the often misstated position in terms of the proportion of public spending that we are accused of engaging in, compared to the Governments of the 1980s led by Mrs. Thatcher. He said that public spending by her Governments amounted to more than 40 per cent. of gross domestic product. I hope that he will accept that that caused the failures that led to unemployment.

I heard his comments today, and particularly the emphasis that he placed on the need to get the process right. I was asked a number of questions about why the 10p rate was abolished and why it was introduced in the first place. Members of the House and the public would do well to read my right hon.

That means that 22 million people on low and middle incomes will gain an additional &#163;120 this year as a result of our new clauses and amendment. Some 4.2 million households will receive as much as they originally lost, or more, and the remaining 1.1 million households will also see their loss at least halve.

The changes suggested in the Government&#146;s new clauses and amendment represent the fairest and most effective way to help a large number of people who have lost out.

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80701-0010.htm_para19"><a name="080701101000067">The result of new clause 4 would be that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs would have no legal power to collect any tax on the first &#163;2,320 of taxable income. That would impose a huge burden, and it would cost all taxpayers &#163;6.7 billion to finance the change. As we are now more than three months into this tax year, HMRC would have to repay the tax deducted and then ask employers to collect it again after Royal Assent, on the basis of clause 3 of the Bill.</p>

It outlined the impact that the announcement of 13 May would have. At the time of that announcement, it was made clear that we would set out plans for future years in the 2008 pre-Budget report in the autumn. At that stage, the Chancellor will report back to the House. I see absolutely no merit in requiring him to report back again in January. However, the hon.

 I have already explained why making a report in January is not necessary, as we shall make one in the pre-Budget report. As for the report suggested in the hon.

However, we should see that in the context of the progress that we have made in aligning tax and NICs whenever possible. We have simplified the structure of employers&#146; national insurance, replacing multiple rates with a single rate and abolishing the entry fee. With just two main rates of income tax and two rates of national insurance in this tax year, the UK&#146;s personal tax system is already one of the simplest in any developed country.</p>

 I should tell the House that I believe that new clause 6, tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, is technically flawed. [Hon. Members: &#147;Why?&#148;] I can tell hon. Members why. Subsection (1)(b) states that the basic rate limit is set out in section 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007, but in fact it is in section 10(5). Also, the new clause does not recognise that with tax calculated annually and national insurance weekly, it would be rare for the two to be exactly  <br>

aligned. Requiring a report every time they were not aligned is unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80701-0011.htm_para0"><a name="080701101000079">Turning to the substance of the debate, we have focused on what needs to be done to address the problem described by my right hon. and hon. Friends. Amendments Nos. 102 to 109 envisage two parallel tax systems. One would have three rates of tax&#151;10 per cent., 22 per cent. and 40 per cent.&#151;and the other would have two rates of tax&#151;20 per cent. and 40 per cent. What I am saying formed the substance of the letter that I sent to my hon. Friend, but it is of value to explain why the amendments would not work, although we have considered them. Individuals could choose to be taxed under one or the other system at any time during the tax year. They could change their mind at any time over an unspecified period. We have estimated that the amendments would cost about &#163;1.8 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80701-0011.htm_para1"><a name="080701101000080">I am afraid that the proposal would prove to be unworkable for individuals, for employers and for HMRC. Two parallel tax systems would require employers and HMRC to set up a new system over and above the one currently in place. That in itself is doable, and if it were the right thing to do, it might be necessary to do it, but, most importantly, I am not convinced that individuals who have lost out from the changes would find such a tax system beneficial. Two different systems would be confusing and impossible to understand for some taxpayers and hon. Members will acknowledge that those in the lowest income groups would find it particularly difficult to judge which system would benefit them. HMRC would simply not be in a position to give advice on such decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80701-0011.htm_para2"><a name="080701101000081">I very much appreciate the manner in which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire spoke to new clause 20. The one thing about which I agreed with the hon. Member for Taunton was his description of my hon. Friend&#146;s speech. My hon. Friend spoke with humour but passionately about what is clearly a serious issue not just for him for many of my right hon. and hon. Friends. New clause 20 is superficially attractive. We have had an opportunity to talk through some of the detail. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear in his evidence to the Treasury Committee that we had looked at what could be done through tapering, but we had to reject it for this year. For instance, I am advised that the new clause would affect 7.1 million taxpayers. I want to explain why that is the case. It would require a further 5.6 million people, most on low incomes, to complete a self-assessment tax return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80701-0011.htm_para3"><a name="080701101000082">There are 7.1 million people with incomes between &#163;6,400 and &#163;13,600 who would benefit from the extra personal allowance proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire. The average gain for those on lower incomes would be around &#163;60, with an overall cost of some &#163;450 million, because the number of people who would benefit goes so much wider.

complete self-assessment tax returns. We have considered the taper, and for those reasons, we believe that a taper is not the right way to deliver, in the swift way in which we wish to deliver it, the help that we want to give to address the problem described. Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury estimates that the new clause still means that about 200,000 households would not be fully compensated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80701-0011.htm_para5"><a name="080701101000086">The point about pensioners illustrates the point. People aged 65 or over should benefit from significantly increased personal allowances. Low and middle-income pensioners can have an income of at least &#163;9,030 before they pay tax. However, if individuals are concerned, as has been described this afternoon, that their tax code is not correct, they should obviously contact HMRC, which will seek to correct it as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80701-0011.htm_para6"><a name="080701101000087">It is worth appreciating the fact that for pensioners with incomes over &#163;21,800, subject to a taper to reduce additional allowances, it can be more difficult to get the allowance right in-year because of the complexity of the taper for pensions. That reinforces the point that I have been making that a taper is complex and would inevitably lead to many more people being required to self-assess. So I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire will accept that.</p>

 The Minister cannot seriously be suggesting that the need to fill in tax returns is the reason why this will not work. She expects 750,000 people who pay tax on their savings to fill in a tax return to claim back on average &#163;80 from HMRC.

 I am acknowledging that there are difficulties. The number of people who would be drawn into self-assessment is large. They would be precisely the people who would find it difficult to judge which of the two tax rates they would benefit from.

 First, I shall discuss new clauses 5 and 19. New clause 5 is technically deficient. It is not clear how it is intended to work in conjunction with the provisions that are to be brought in by separate order. The intention is to delay the whole of part 7 until the report has been written and endorsed by Parliament, but that does not sit easily across these measures; the same applies to new clause 19.</p>

Other measures in part 7 include clauses relating to appeals, excise matters, funding bonds and measures under the avoidance disclosure rules and others. Those clauses are vital if the HMRC is to deliver the benefits set out in the O&#146;Donnell review, including the closure of the tax gap and the modernisation of existing legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para0"><a name="080701105000501">The importance of adequate safeguards has been recognised by the Government and the HMRC and the valuable views of representative bodies have been taken on board. In Committee, we spent seven hours on schedule 36 alone. I am not complaining about that; it is right that such an amount of time should have been spent on such important legislation. In addition to those safeguards in the primary legislation, further protection will be provided by regulations and guidance. Broadly, that is the main area of disagreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para1"><a name="080701105000502">It would be helpful to consider what the legislation actually includes. For compliance checks, schedule 36 alone includes 37 separate and identifiable safeguards. The levels and reductions for penalties for incorrect returns are now set in statute, rather than being in HMRC guidance to be left to the discretion of officers. On resolving disputes, clause 122 will introduce an optional statutory review of HMRC decisions. The amendment would delay that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para2"><a name="080701105000503">Throughout our debates, the Opposition have repeatedly stated that all safeguards should be in primary legislation. I do not accept that, and I do not believe that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) would if he were in my position; I hope that he will not be any time soon. Legislation cannot cover every conceivable scenario. Other forms of safeguard can be both flexible and a protection for the taxpayer. In deciding whether the HMRC is acting reasonably in any particular case, the courts will take account of its published guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para3"><a name="080701105000504">As with last year&#146;s penalties clauses, there will be full and open consultation on the guidance. That approach was applauded last year. Work on producing guidance on compliance checks in formal disputes resolution, penalties, debt and unpacking containers will be completed well in advance of the legislation&#146;s coming into effect. Although it is true that we have not always been persuaded that further safeguards are necessary, additional safeguards were introduced in consultation before the Bill was introduced and in the course of our proceedings. The HMRC has been prepared to forgo certain benefits of alignment when respondents to consultation made a strong case for the retention of safeguards. For instance, we have retained the inquiry window for direct tax self-assessment cases and the evidence of facts rule for VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para4"><a name="080701105000505">Following consultation, we also agreed that a penalty on a third party should apply only when that third party deliberately falsified or withheld information from a taxpayer. We removed a proposed penalty for failure to allow entry to premises unless there had been an independent external authorisation. During the parliamentary process itself, the Government have tabled further amendments ensuring that the power of entry and inspection does not extend to any part of premises used solely as a dwelling. Other than in cases involving the taxable supply of goods, we restricted the power to inspect business premises to those used by the person whose liability is being checked. I recognise the concerns that have been expressed about ensuring adequate safeguards, but such safeguards must provide real and effective protection for taxpayers, rather than merely create bureaucracy and delay. The balance is right in part 7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para5"><a name="080701105000506">As I said, new clause 5 seeks to delay that implementation of part 7 until further reports. What could such reports add to the already extensive consultations and detailed debates in the House? No doubt, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will make the case in a moment. New clause 19 seeks to delay the implementation of part 7 until regulations containing a taxpayers charter have been approved by the House of Commons. Acceptance of that new clause would result in the additional safeguards in part 7 being delayed for another year&#151;a somewhat perverse outcome, given the importance attached to safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para6"><a name="080701105000507">As the House will know, we are considering the introduction of a charter, which should bring many positive benefits, especially in improving the relationship between the HMRC, taxpayers and other customers. I want to put on record my gratitude to the representative bodies for the interest that they have shown in the subject, and particularly to the Chartered Institute of Taxation for the paper that it published in March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para7"><a name="080701105000508">The consultation published on 19 June makes things clear. The terms of a charter should not be set out in legislation. That is not to devalue the charter, which is an important standard. Many taxpayers&#146; rights are set out in tax legislation&#151;for instance, the right to appeal against certain HMRC decisions. Others, however, are provided through non-statutory routes such as codes of practice and departmental practice. In addition, an array of non-tax legislation&#151;the Human Rights Act 1998, data protection legislation, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the like&#151;also governs the HMRC&#146;s relationship with taxpayers and claimants. A charter is intended to support that. The wording of an accessible and useful charter is not intended to be like that of legislation; it is meant to be a guide to the law. The use of statutory wording in a charter would compromise the intention to create a simple statement of the basic rights of taxpayers and other customers in their relationship with the HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para8"><a name="080701105000509">This is a large group of amendments, and I shall try to address quickly each of them in turn. Clause 112 forms part of a package of measures allowing the HMRC to check that taxpayers have met their obligation to pay, return and claim the correct amounts of tax. That package includes the power to require the production of documents and the power to inspect them. In essence, the clause reproduces the equivalent provisions from the former Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. The clause consolidates the provisions that ensure that documents include electronic versions and allow HMRC officers access to computers holding information required for a tax check. The new provision also aligns and decriminalises the penalties that apply when a person obstructs an inspection of computer records or fails to provide reasonable assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para9"><a name="080701105000510">Amendment No. 8 would not have any impact on the HMRC&#146;s ability to carry out checks on electronically held records. The existing provisions would continue in force until superseded by clause 112, but the amendment would leave in place the current unsatisfactory situation whereby a person could face a criminal charge for obstructing the exercise of the power or for failing to offer reasonable assistance under one provision, and a financial penalty under the other provision. I believe that it is better to align those now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para10"><a name="080701105000511">The reports by Kieron Poynter and the Independent Police Complaints Commission following the loss of discs containing child benefit data have recently been published. Both reports make it clear that the HMRC did not give data security the priority and attention that it should have done. Those are strong criticisms that the department has taken on board. I am grateful to the IPCC and to Kieron Poynter for their thorough reports, and I fully accept all their recommendations. HMRC has already made progress on 39 of the 45 recommendations and has implemented 13 of them. The powers in clause 112 already exist and would continue to operate regardless of amendment No. 8. It would be unnecessary for another report to be undertaken by HM Treasury. What is needed is work to ensure that data security is a top priority, and the Poynter review acknowledges that that is already well under way. The amendment is therefore superfluous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para11"><a name="080701105000512">Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 concern provisions for taxpayers and third parties to appeal against notices to see statutory records. The Bill already introduces a right of appeal against requests for supplementary information. That is new, as current legislation provides only a right of appeal against information requests made as part of a self-assessment inquiry. However, since taxpayers are required by law to keep certain records, it should not be onerous for them to provide them. A right of appeal would not be appropriate or effective. It is difficult to see what grounds for appeal would succeed. What is more, sadly, evidence from income tax self-assessment suggests that where such a right of appeal exists some non-compliant taxpayers exploit it by routinely appealing against all notices for even the most basic information so as to delay the proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para12"><a name="080701105000513">As I said, safeguards need to be effective. The power to require statutory records must be exercised for the purpose of checking a tax position and must be exercised reasonably. Those are better safeguards. I can understand the concerns, but the amendments would not achieve the protection hoped for and could do the opposite. I hope that they are not pressed to a Division. As I have said repeatedly in considering the HMRC&#146;s powers, I will keep this matter under close review to ensure that the new powers and the proposals in the Bill work in the way that is intended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para13"><a name="080701105000514">Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 seek to prevent the HMRC from ever visiting or inspecting records at a taxpayer&#146;s home. The legislation currently prevents officers from visiting premises used solely as a home. The motives behind the amendments are wholly understandable but they fail to recognise the complexity of people&#146;s affairs in the 21st century. The amendments would prevent visits to, for example&#151;I am not singling these groups out for any particular reason&#151;dentists, doctors, hairdressers or carpenters. Hairdressers seem to feature in our discussions. I could go on, but I will not. I am talking about those who, for example, use one room in their house as a surgery, salon or workshop. The amendments could also affect the ability to inspect pubs, corner shops and other premises where the taxpayer lives on those premises. They would affect unacceptably the HMRC&#146;s ability to carry out its duty of checking that the right tax has been paid at the right time by all businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para14"><a name="080701105000515">The problem of distinguishing between business premises and homes is not unique. It is faced by the rating authorities&#151;we discussed whether their definitions could be used&#151;by planning offices and by local authorities. In each situation, the detail of what is considered to be business premises is set out in guidance. HMRC has agreed that guidance is needed to set out the circumstances in which it is acceptable to visit a home used for business purposes. Assurances have already been given in Committee that that guidance will be written in consultation with representative bodies. Assurances have also been given that the homes of home workers and those occasionally working from home will not be treated as business premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para15"><a name="080701105000516">Amendment No. 38 appears to be attempting to restrict the times when the HMRC can specify the time and place of a visit to situations where the taxpayer does not agree a time and place. It is not clear that the amendment would work. If it did, it would apparently prevent HMRC officers from making a visit if the occupier agreed to a visit two years&#146; hence. I will wait to hear about the detail of that proposal. Amendment No. 39 is a replica of an amendment that we discussed in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para16"><a name="080701105000517">Amendment No. 4 seeks to retain the general time limit for taxpayers&#146; income tax claims at five years and 10 months. However, that would make it out of step with assessment time limits and with other claim time limits, which we are aligning at four years across taxes. We made progress on time limits in Committee, so I will not labour the points again. The new framework continues to deliver parity between taxpayers and the HMRC. Where tax has been underpaid as a result of a mistake, the HMRC will be able to assess that only within the new four-year period. Similarly, a taxpayer will be able to make a claim within four years. None the less, HMRC will still accept later claims where the taxpayer has a reasonable excuse, including where an error on the HMRC&#146;s part has led to the claim being made outside the time allowed or where a taxpayer has given clear notice of his or her intention to claim before the time limit expires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para17"><a name="080701105000518">The HMRC and I recognise that pensioners and those on low incomes have very particular needs. The HMRC is working to understand them and to find ways to overcome barriers and raise awareness about the need for formal claims. The HMRC will work with taxpayer representatives, including the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, to identify which groups of people are likely to be able to make claims, and the HMRC&#146;s publicity will target those groups to inform them of their rights to make claims and of the time limits. I have said it before in Committee and say it again today: I will keep the effectiveness of the HMRC&#146;s publicity and the planned PAYE system improvements under review to ensure that people are prepared for the new time limits from 1 April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para18"><a name="080701105000519">I will pause at this point, as before I turn to some of the other issues, it might be helpful to hear what the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire has to say.</p>

have been responsible for quite a chunk of that time, but I do not think that I will be addressing the House at anything like that length this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para19"><a name="080701105000521">The debate that we had in Committee was important. The Government&#146;s consultation and the proposals in the Bill provoked a considerable response, and there was a great deal of public interest. The professional bodies looked very closely at what the Minister said, in particular, to seek reassurance and a further understanding of what the measures involved. The debate was therefore a valuable and useful part of the Bill&#146;s passage; in many respects, the process worked as it should have done. I compliment the Financial Secretary on the way in which she has addressed this matter, attempting to deal with the issues in a constructive manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para20"><a name="080701105000522">There are times in the course of all debates, including on this Finance Bill, which is no exception, when the Opposition wish to highlight&#151;&#147;take pleasure in&#148; would be the wrong way of putting it&#151;the fact that a Government have moved their position. We make accusations of U-turns, fiascos and humiliations&#151;and rightly so with regard to some of the matters that we have debated today. However, on the subject of our discussion, the Government have moved for the best of reasons. There has been an intention to listen to the concerns of professional bodies and an attempt to allay them. We wish that the Government had gone further in some instances, which we shall discuss this evening, but I want to put it on record that the Government&#146;s approach has been sensible. Equally, I hope that the Financial Secretary agrees that our approach has been one of constructive opposition in trying to scrutinise the Government&#146;s actions and highlighting where we think they are wrong, but trying together to move the law in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para21"><a name="080701105000523">The principal concern that the professional bodies raised is, at heart, simple. By and large, there is no objection to greater harmonisation of powers for different types of taxes. There are sometimes one-size-fits-all problems, but by and large, some harmonisation is recognised as beneficial. However, there is concern about balance regarding HMRC&#146;s powers and deterrents. They are mostly increasing and are perhaps advancing faster than the safeguards. What HMRC requires to collect tax efficiently and enforce tax law, and the safeguards for protecting the taxpayer, are out of sync to some extent. That point is at the heart of the concern expressed by the professional bodies, and we raised it on numerous occasions in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para22"><a name="080701105000524">Movement has occurred and the Government have taken a constructive approach. There has been movement on notice before inspections of businesses and on inspections of third party premises. The Financial Secretary made some helpful comments and provided clarification on issues such as set-off involving tax credits. An Opposition amendment was even accepted; it dealt with the length of time after which HMRC may serve an information notice on a deceased person&#146;s tax position. We are grateful to the Financial Secretary for agreeing to the amendment on the basis that it was common sense&#151;as she said, it was a good amendment. That is not to say that there were not many other good amendments, which were not accepted, but we take what we can.</p>

Other specific issues to be kept under review include professional privilege, the meaning of &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; in the context of penalties and, as the Financial Secretary mentioned this evening, publicity for tax reclaims. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para24"><a name="080701105000526">However, we have also heard a great deal&#151;we heard it again tonight&#151;about the way in which many issues that we have raised will be addressed in guidance. The Financial Secretary said that we argued that everything needs to be in primary legislation. Yes, we argued that more than we currently have should be in primary legislation. Oppositions tend to argue that regulations should be made by the affirmative rather than the negative procedure, although there were circumstances in which we did not adopt that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para25"><a name="080701105000527">There are times when it is appropriate for HMRC to use guidance because it gives greater flexibility, which can be necessary. Guidance will be used for a list of matters. However, the thinking behind new clause 5 is that we could not examine the guidance or make an informed decision about whether the balance that I considered a moment or two ago was being struck. We have to take it on trust that, when the guidance is produced, following consultation with professional bodies and so on, that balance has been achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para26"><a name="080701105000528">Let me briefly consider some of the issues with which guidance will deal&#151;the Financial Secretary also mentioned some. Sometimes there will be clear-cut cases of what constitutes a business premises and what constitutes a private home, but at other times, they will be borderline. Guidance will provide the answer to that and to what constitutes a business activity. It will also cover the information that should be provided to the taxpayer when HMRC visits a premises. There will be a code for unannounced visits and greater detail about what constitutes statutory records. There is also the tribunal system. The Financial Secretary said that the Ministry of Justice was examining that matter and that a Finance Bill could not tackle it. We considered reporting scheme reference numbers and HMRC&#146;s disclosure rules. There is also HMRC&#146;s policy on set-off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para27"><a name="080701105000529">One could take each item and present an argument about whether it should be dealt with in primary legislation, regulation or guidance. It is not my purpose to pursue those arguments, but to emphasise that, even if we accept the Government&#146;s case that those matters should be tackled through guidance, Parliament is considering the subject without full knowledge of that guidance. The Government have worked constructively, but to some extent they have done that because of our parliamentary proceedings, which focus the mind of Ministers, their advisers, professional groups, the Opposition and Parliament as a whole. Parliamentary involvement means that we do not simply drift into accepting a set of provisions that do not entirely satisfy the wider business community, taxpayers and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para28"><a name="080701105000530">I said at the outset that the process of considering the Finance Bill had been valuable and useful for the provisions on HMRC powers.

Financial Secretary has questioned officials and forced them to justify the provisions. That is healthy. New clause 5 would grant an opportunity&#151;perhaps not on the same scale as the Finance Bill; we had a good four or five sessions on the powers&#151;for Parliament to revisit part 7 and all the various disparate issues that I have mentioned before it comes into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para29"><a name="080701105000531">At that point, the Treasury would have to prepare and lay before the House of Commons a report setting out the safeguards available to the taxpayer and third parties in respect of HMRC powers in part 7. The Financial Secretary will then have to sit down with officials and see whether the balance has been achieved and whether the guidance provides the proper protection, knowing that she will have to appear before members of a committee who will not only question and scrutinise, but receive support and guidance from professional bodies. Again, I appreciate that that would be hard work for busy Ministers and also for Opposition spokesmen, but it would be a useful exercise ensuring that when we come to the end of the process, the warm words, and the undertakings that we have heard from the Financial Secretary, which I do not doubt for a moment, are delivered in practice. That is the thinking behind new clause 5. We find that a persuasive argument, and I should like to give notice that we intend to press new clause 5 to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para30"><a name="080701105000532">Briefly, new clause 19 deals with the taxpayers&#146; charter, which is advocated by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), who will no doubt speak on the matter. I do not wish to spend a great deal of time on it, but it would be fair to say that the thinking behind new clause 19 is similar to the thinking behind new clause 5, so obviously we have a great of sympathy for it.</p>

Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 relate to the right to appeal against taxpayer notices. Paragraph 29 of schedule 36 gives taxpayers and third parties a right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal against an information notice or third party notice. However, there is no right of appeal if the notice relates to a taxpayer&#146;s statutory records. The Financial Secretary made the point that given that there are circumstances in which businesses are required to keep records, they should therefore have to disclose them. That is a fair point, but our concern&#151;the Institute of Chartered Accountants has highlighted this, too&#151;is that there is sometimes a grey area between business records and personal records.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80701-0013.htm_para32"><a name="080701105000534">In our debate in the Public Bill Committee, the Financial Secretary referred to a hairdresser&#146;s appointment diary&#151;as she said, many of her analogies and examples involved hairdressers&#151;and that was helpful. A hairdresser&#146;s appointment diary is clearly a business record. That is not in dispute. However, many people will keep a diary that contains some business-related entries, but a majority of personal entries. They may take a different view from an HMRC official on that personal diary, which by its nature will contain personal information that an individual would, for whatever reason, not want to fall into the hands of a third party.</p>

They have no ability under the Bill as drafted to appeal to a third party when there is a disagreement. The purpose behind amendments Nos. 34 and 35 is to address that issue.

be to give a right of appeal purely on the basis of whether the document in question is a statutory record. The Financial Secretary said that there was a danger of delays and that people might use an appeal mechanism to delay unduly the progress of an HMRC inquiry. However, we should remember that the tribunal will have the power to impose costs in the event of determining that any such delay is vexatious. I therefore question whether the Financial Secretary&#146;s argument is necessarily that persuasive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para1"><a name="080701105000536">Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 relate to paragraph 10 of schedule 36, which deals with the power to inspect business premises. The issue here is whether the premises are used solely as a dwelling, in which case the powers are not applicable, or whether, as we argued in Committee, the provisions could be broadened to include premises that are used in whole or in part as a dwelling. In Committee, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)&#151;he is here now, so perhaps he will speak on this point&#151;provided the useful example of a musician taking a booking. When a musician takes a booking, they will not have one room in the premises that is used for business purposes, to which HMRC could have access, thus leaving the rest of the house&#151;the private dwelling&#151;untouched. Rather, it is likely that a phone call would be received in a living room, the study or a bedroom, which would therefore be being used, at least in part, for business purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para2"><a name="080701105000537">There is clearly some sensitivity to the issue, which the Government recognise, because they already accept that paragraph 10 of schedule 36 should not apply to premises that are used solely as a dwelling. There is clearly agreement on that. However, the exemption in paragraph 10 would appear to be largely ineffective for those people&#151;I suspect that this is a large number of people, not just musicians&#151;who do some work from home, such as making phone calls or working on a computer. With regard to those circumstances, that sensitivity, which the Government accept in paragraph 10, does not appear to have been addressed. I would therefore be grateful if the Financial Secretary addressed that concern. If there is some sensitivity towards dwellings, what is the reason for it; and, given that explanation, how does she justify the narrow exemption in paragraph 10?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para3"><a name="080701105000538">Let me turn to amendments Nos. 38 and 39. As the Bill is drafted, where HMRC wishes to inspect a premises, it must either agree a time with the occupier, give at least seven days&#146; notice&#151;I acknowledge the fact that the Government moved from 24 hours&#146; notice, which we welcome&#151;or be authorised by an authorised officer. That third leg is important and relates to combating fraud, although that is not the concern in this context. Amendment No. 38 would mean that the notice period would be triggered only if the officer had sought to reach an agreement with the taxpayer. The concern, which has also been raised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, is that although there is provision that there should be agreement&#151;the Financial Secretary said in the Public Bill Committee that she anticipates that, as a rule, HMRC will seek to reach an agreement with the taxpayer&#151;that could, strictly speaking, simply be ignored by HMRC. HMRC could immediately start counting down the clock towards the seven days&#146; notice without having first attempted to reach an agreement. Amendment No. 38 attempts to address that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para4"><a name="080701105000540">I have some sympathy with the Minister&#146;s view that the amendment&#146;s drafting is not as clear as it might be, but its intention is to ensure that the first step is the reaching of an agreement. If that cannot be achieved, the clock will start ticking towards seven days or, as we argue in amendment No. 39, towards 14 days. In Committee, we debated how many days it should be, but there was an element of &#147;how long is a piece of string?&#148; to our discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para5"><a name="080701105000541">The reason behind our proposing 14 days is that people often go on holiday for up to a fortnight, and they should not have to come back to find HMRC on their doorstep. Fourteen days is therefore more reasonable. We are not talking about combating fraud or about the equivalent of a dawn raid. I recognise that there are times when HMRC needs the power to move quickly and to surprise a taxpayer whom it suspects of fraud, but we are not talking about those circumstances here. I therefore believe that 14 days&#151;as opposed to seven days&#151;is entirely reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para6"><a name="080701105000542">Before I deal with amendment No. 4, I should like to say a few words about Government new clause 16 and its consequential amendments. We do not have any particular problems with the new clause, although we wonder why we are getting a new clause at this stage. To be fair, however, the explanatory notes state that this is as a consequence of the Commissioners of Revenue and Customs <i> v.</i> Midlands Co-operative Society case, which was determined in April. The case related to the right to make a claim for overpaid VAT being capable of being transferred from one person to another, and to how set-off could be avoided in such circumstances. I would be grateful if the Minister told us what financial risk might be at stake in those circumstances, although she might not have the figures to hand. I do not know what scale is applied in claims for overpaid VAT, or other taxes, where an amount is set off, but presumably that is the amount that could be at risk. If she enlightened the House on that point, I would be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para7"><a name="080701105000543">Theoretically, the transferee of a VAT claim could be entirely innocent. In the circumstances envisaged in new clause 16, the set-off could be made against the transferee as though it were against the transferor. However, what remedy would be available to a transferee who had acquired a VAT claim in all innocence? Those circumstances might be unlikely, but I would like to know whether a motive test, which often is incorporated into measures to tackle avoidance, was considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para8"><a name="080701105000544">I must reiterate some of the concerns about the set-off provisions. We have expressed our concern that set-off might occur when it is not in the best interests of taxpayers, and that perhaps it should be achieved only with the agreement of taxpayers. In particular, we have asked what would happen in an ongoing dispute between HMRC and a taxpayer and HMRC sought to make use of its powers on set-off. There are further issues relating to set-off, and although we have no specific objections to the new clause we have one or two queries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para9"><a name="080701105000545">Amendment No. 4 deals with reclaiming overpaid tax, which we debated in Committee&#151;albeit fairly briefly, given the nature of the issue. The Low Income Tax Reform Group&#151;LITRG&#151;has been active in this regard, and I was pleased to hear the Minister say that she is working with the group to address the matter. Paragraph 12 of schedule 39 will reduce the time limit for reclaiming  <br>

overpaid tax from five years and 10 months to four years. Many people on low incomes, especially pensioners, overpay tax and are not aware of their right to reclaim it. LITRG has highlighted three situations in which this tends to happen. The first is when tax is deducted at source from bank or building society interest at a higher rate than that at which the depositor is liable. The second is when older people are not given the right age-related allowances&#151;we have heard plenty of anecdotal evidence about that&#151;and the third involves incorrect PAYE codes being given to people with multiple income sources, such as more than one pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para10"><a name="080701105000546">LITRG has criticised HMRC&#146;s efforts to highlight the issue of overpaid tax. It has been particularly critical of the fact that the number of leaflets and other paper products produced by HMRC has diminished over the years, and of the fact that there has never been a take-up campaign for the blind person&#146;s allowance. Many people assume that one has to be blind to claim it, but that is not the case. The group also says that these matters could be resolved if HMRC carried out regular matching of PAYE records and established an annual routine of contacting all those whom it had identified as due for a repayment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para11"><a name="080701105000547">This is an important issue. The organisation Tax Help for Older People has conducted a survey of recent claims for back tax. It found that 44 per cent. of low-income pensioners who had had tax repayments had been entitled for six years or more. The Bill states that the rights of those low-income pensioners would be reduced, and that they would be able to claim only for four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para12"><a name="080701105000548">In Committee, I referred to the pensioner tax-back project, which, in 2005, repaid 50,000 pensioners some &#163;20 million. It is interesting to note the comment by Robin Williamson of LITRG. In an e-mail to me, he described that as being merely the &#147;tip of an iceberg&#148;. In Committee, the Government&#146;s position was that there would be a one-way flow if we changed the arrangement, and that the period allowed for reclaiming tax would be greater than the period available to HMRC for assessment. It was stated that there was a need for symmetry. Previously, there was symmetry in relation to the period of five years and 10 months, or of six years, and that has been reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para13"><a name="080701105000549">Taxpayers cannot be expected to possess the same knowledge of their tax position as a trained Revenue officer. There is an imbalance between the knowledge and expertise of HMRC and some taxpayers, particularly the low paid and the elderly. That problem might persist and even intensify, given that the 10p savings rate will continue although the 10p income tax rate has been abolished. We will therefore press amendment No. 4 to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para14"><a name="080701105000550">We have had constructive debates, but the point remains that the balance may not be quite right. We seek further reassurance from the Minister&#151;we have already received much reassurance from her&#151;particularly on the specific issue of tax reclaims for the low paid. We also seek to provide Parliament with an opportunity to debate these issues once it has had the benefit of seeing the guidance and of assessing how the promised change in HMRC culture has worked. If we do that, we will have a regime that will stand the test of time and this fundamental reform of HMRC&#146;s powers will be a success.</p>

We would not, of course, enjoy the public services and other aspects of public expenditure if that task were not performed collectively on behalf of us all, so I am not in the business of running down HMRC. It has an important job to do; nobody likes paying taxes, but I observe that nobody likes the withdrawal of the public spending consequences either. We thus owe a debt to HMRC for undertaking what is not always the most popular work on our behalf.</p>

10p tax rate and the wrath that it incurred among the electorate. Another contender for the moment that inflicted the greatest damage to the Prime Minister&#146;s reputation, however, is an action that was not specifically within his control but that summed up for many people the accident-prone nature of his premiership&#151;the loss of data on 25 million of our citizens when two tax discs went missing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para22"><a name="080701105000559">It is important that we recognise the seriousness with which our fellow citizens take the need to protect their individual data and private information.

If we think back to 10 or 20 years ago, it would have been difficult to distribute personal data about 25 million people&#151;even if one sought to do so&#151;without lorry loads of couriers to take the information to the required destination. Nowadays, all that can be sent on CDs or at the press of a computer button.

No, it is reasonable to say that they would not. Such problems will inevitably arise in private and public sector organisations, because that is the nature of human error and of the new electronic age in which we live. The only thing we can do is to ensure that the safeguards are constantly reviewed and improved, and I appreciate that the Government are trying to do that&#151;it would be odd if they were not. We encourage the Government to do even better in that regard.</p>

It is not a one-way street&#151;it would be helpful for employees of that organisation to know in greater detail and with greater clarity what they are allowed to do. I and the hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for Dundee, East raised hypothetical examples in Committee, and there are and always will be grey areas&#151;probably even more than in the past, because people&#146;s tendency to work from home, internet caf&#233;s or whatever will mean less distinction between the place of work and place of residence than even five years ago.

Many people who understand that HMRC has a job to do, and that a tax inspection regime must be in place, nevertheless feel that they are interfacing with an organisation that is sometimes heavy-handed and unsympathetic to what they regard as legitimate reasons that their tax was not paid precisely as HMRC had decreed. Those people feel that they have little right of appeal or recourse to rectify that perceived wrong. New clause 19 would therefore balance more formally the powers of the state&#151;which we recognise must exist in the field that we are discussing&#151;with the liberties of the individual citizen. It should not be assumed that HMRC&#146;s powers are always superior to those of the individual citizen. Taxpayers have rights just as tax collectors do.</p>

I am in constant touch with members of the Braintree Pensioners Action Group, and I feel that pensioners, people on low incomes and people with disabilities might still be hurt by the apparent direction of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para30"><a name="080701109000012">We have heard that the entitlement period for those trying to reclaim overpaid tax will be reduced from five years 10 months to four years.

with disabilities are perhaps not as efficient in understanding how, when and the means by which they can reclaim their overpaid tax. As we have heard from my hon. Friend, they might not even be aware that they have overpaid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80701-0014.htm_para31"><a name="080701109000013">In that spirit, I have three questions for the Minister. First, what is motivating the Government to reduce the period that some of the most vulnerable people in our society have to reclaim overpaid tax? Secondly, what discussions has the Financial Secretary had with the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group on the issue? I am sure that she has had many such discussions, because that group has clear concerns about the direction of the Government and HMRC. Thirdly, having listened to pensioners, the elderly, those on low incomes and particularly representative groups such as the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, what protections do the Government seek to put in place for those who might be hurt by that general direction?</p>

However, it is in part 7, as is the introduction of schedule 36 penalties, including paragraphs 43 to 47 and 50, which include the concealment or destruction of documents, failure to comply with time limits, and the tax penalty if a failure or breach continues after an initial penalty has been levied. I am sure that it is not the intention of the Bill or the Revenue, but given the debate on clause 112 in Committee, it strikes me that a penalty under schedule 36 could be levied for concealment, breach of time limits or a tax penalty thereafter, for non-compliance with an order to allow a document to be copied, extracted or removed from a computer wholly under the control of a third party, and not under the control in any way, shape or form of the taxpayer. What attracts me to new clause 5 is the reference to safeguards applying to taxpayers who might find themselves in the hideous position of wanting to comply but being technically unable to do so.</p>

 I shall deal with the Government&#146;s new clauses on set-off provisions before returning to the points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para4"><a name="080701109000021">As the House was told by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and as the explanatory note makes clear, new clause 16 is required as a result of a recent judgment by the Court of Appeal to protect the Exchequer from potential avoidance opportunities, and to ensure that tax is collected as Parliament intended. The hon. Gentleman asked me about the cost to the Exchequer. I approach the answer with some caution. It is extremely difficult to say how much would be lost if the Exchequer were to lose its powers and duties to set off outstanding liabilities against claims for overpaid tax, but it is clear from the value of claims currently lodged with HMRC that the revenue potentially at risk runs into hundreds of millions of pounds&#151;less than &#163;500 million, but nevertheless representing a considerable range. I do not wish to be drawn into too much detail, but there is a significant risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para5"><a name="080701109000022">Until the Court of Appeal judgment, HMRC had taken the view that only the person who overpaid the tax was entitled to make a claim for repayment. When a person makes a claim for over-declared VAT, HMRC is required to set off against it any outstanding liabilities of the claimant. For example, when a taxpayer submits a claim for &#163;10,000 but has a VAT debt on file of &#163;3,000, his eventual refund will be &#163;7,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para6"><a name="080701109000023">The judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, Commissioners for Revenue and Customs <i> v. </i>Midlands Co-operative Society, makes clear that the right to make a claim can be transferred by the person who overpaid the tax, namely&#151;this is where it becomes horribly legally complicated&#151;the original creditor, to another person, the current creditor, who then becomes entitled to make the claim to HMRC for repayment of the tax. The potential loss of tax arises because there is no provision under current law for HMRC to offset the liabilities of the original creditor when the claim for the overpaid tax is made by someone else. As a consequence, taxpayers can, through assignment of the right to make a claim, avoid the set-off procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para7"><a name="080701109000024">New Clause 16 seeks to address that avoidance opportunity by putting the current creditor in the shoes of the original creditor for the purposes of the setting off of liabilities. That is about as far as I, a non-legal person, can follow the details, but it is important to ensure that when a person who has overpaid his tax liability&#151;the original creditor&#151;transfers the right to claim that overpaid tax to another person&#151;the current creditor&#151;the current creditor will not receive from HMRC any more than the original creditor would have received had he made the claim himself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para8"><a name="080701109000025">Although the Midlands judgment was a VAT case, its application is not limited to VAT. As the current procedure for claiming overpaid VAT is replicated for all the indirect taxes administered by HMRC, the potential for avoidance and loss to the Exchequer exists for them all. HMRC believes that it may also exist in relation to claims for error or mistake relief in direct tax. I stress that the new clause does not empower HMRC to make the current creditor liable for the debts of the original  <br>

creditor. It simply ensures that the current creditor cannot receive any more tax from HMRC than the original creditor would have been entitled to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para9"><a name="080701109000026">It is not my intention that HMRC should rely solely on the new clause to recover the original creditor&#146;s liabilities. When the right to claim a repayment from HMRC is transferred, the set-off mechanisms in the new clause will not be applied to a payment to the current creditor until HMRC has taken all reasonable steps to recover any outstanding liabilities from the original creditor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para10"><a name="080701109000027">Amendments Nos. 24 to 28 make consequential changes to clauses 128 and 129. I am grateful to officials for their advice. This is one of those moments that occurred relatively seldom in Committee. I send my best wishes to the leader of an exemplary team of officials, and wish him many happy returns of the day on his 31st birthday. I am sure that he is enjoying spending it in our company this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para11"><a name="080701109000028">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked whether a motive test had been considered. The simple answer is no. The purpose of the new clause is not to prevent assignments that are genuinely commercial arrangements, or to make them impractical. It simply ensures that the Exchequer does not pay out any more than it would have had the claim been made by the original creditor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para12"><a name="080701109000029">The hon. Gentleman spoke of what he perceived as the danger of erring too far on one side of the balance between powers and safeguards. The package provides greater consistency across taxes: although there are some extensions of powers, they are matched by tightening in other areas and a strengthening of safeguards. Inevitably there will be tensions as we seek to ensure that HMRC has appropriate powers to work effectively, and that taxpayers have strong safeguards. The balance has changed, but in my opinion it has changed in favour of the taxpayer. The schedule contains 37 statutory safeguards to protect the taxpayer, at the heart of which is the need for all actions carried out by HMRC to be reasonable. We debated that at length in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para13"><a name="080701109000030">The hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the protections for ordinary, decent taxpayers who might otherwise be badly affected. As I have said repeatedly, if there is any evidence that the changes work detrimentally in the way that he described, I shall wish to act to address that. At the heart of all our proposed changes is the need for HMRC&#146;s actions to be reasonable. Guidance will support the safeguards, and will seek to ensure that taxpayers are fully aware of their rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para14"><a name="080701109000031">The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) said that he would press new clause 19 to a vote. In my opening remarks, I explained at length the interest in the taxpayers&#146; charter, and I want to present proposals in due course. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are in the early stages of consultation, and I prefer that approach to the one suggested in his new clause. The review of powers aims to include more safeguards in legislation where appropriate, and, as I have said, additional safeguards are set out in codes of practice and operational guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para15"><a name="080701109000032">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked how we could be sure that we would have a chance to scrutinise the guidance. HMRC set out the guidance in a timetable in the consultation response document that was issued at the end of March. The codes of practice and the examples were also published in both consultation  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 July 2008">

documents, providing much of the detail needed, and full draft guidance on record-keeping has been published. All those documents are public and can be scrutinised in Parliament in the normal way, although obviously not by means of a legislative process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para16"><a name="080701109000033">The hon. Gentleman suggested that taxpayers were not clear about what records to keep. Taxpayers have said that they do not want HMRC to be too prescriptive. Its largely generic approach requires records to be kept of income, sales and expenses, but it also allows taxpayers to decide exactly what they need to keep. They are best placed to decide, bearing in mind their own circumstances. What is important is for taxpayers to keep enough records to be able to make accurate tax returns or claims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para17"><a name="080701109000034">The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen in the event of a dispute. When there is a dispute the taxpayer can tell HMRC, and when there is genuine doubt HMRC will use the written information power that we discussed in Committee. That power would carry a right of appeal in most cases, or it would have to be pre-authorised by an independent tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para18"><a name="080701109000035">The hon. Gentleman asked why there is no right of appeal against the power to inspect premises. The law says an inspection must be reasonable, and guidance will set out examples of specific cases where an inspection would, or would not, be reasonable. If HMRC breaches that guidance, the taxpayer could either make a formal complaint or refuse to allow the inspection to take place, knowing that for a penalty to be charged HMRC must demonstrate to the tribunal that the inspection was reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para19"><a name="080701109000036">The IT enhancements planned by HMRC will improve the handling of individuals&#146; tax details and will allow HMRC to identify incorrect payments earlier. That will mean that many overpayments will be repaid automatically without the need for a formal claim. In many such cases, a refund is due whether or not the taxpayer makes a claim, so the time limits to which the amendment refers do not apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para20"><a name="080701109000037">I did not address amendment No. 39 in detail as we debated it in Committee. It might be helpful, however, if I make the following comments. The seven days in the proposed legislation is a minimum period of notice, and usually a longer period would be allowed if necessary. We were asked what would happen in the event of a holiday, perhaps of a fortnight. That would not be a problem, as the taxpayers would have a reasonable excuse for delaying a visit until the conclusion of their holiday. Therefore, based on the requirement for HMRC to behave reasonably, the problems described would not arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para21"><a name="080701109000038">The new aligned time limits have been warmly welcomed by external stakeholders. The application of the same time limits across taxes will be a useful simplification for taxpayers. They will also allow HMRC to work in a joined-up way across taxes when carrying out checks, which will reduce costs for taxpayers. Most welcome of all has been the earlier certainty for taxpayers that will be provided by reduced time limits as they relate to direct taxes&#151;HMRC will only be able to go back for six years when the taxpayer has not taken reasonable care to get their tax right. Six years is a substantial reduction  <br>

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 808</b><br>
from the 20 years that currently applies. HMRC will continue to accept later claims when the taxpayer has a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para22"><a name="080701109000039">I will keep the effectiveness of HMRC&#146;s publicity and the planned pay-as-you-earn system improvements under review to ensure that people are prepared for the new time limits from 1 April 2010. A considerable period of time will pass before the new powers take effect, which is sufficient for not only Parliament, but the representative groups of taxpayers who are also closely scrutinising this work to be satisfied that the powers are appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para23"><a name="080701109000040">The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about computer records. As I said in Committee, computer records are no different from paper records. If HMRC wishes to inspect any such documents, they must be relevant to the taxpayer&#146;s tax position, and must be in either the taxpayer&#146;s or the third party&#146;s power or possession, and if they are stored abroad, they must be made available in the UK. All those requirements would be necessary. I know the hon. Gentleman is particularly concerned about where the computer or website, for example, is outside the control of the individual. It would be possible to demonstrate that to HMRC. As I have said to him, HMRC would have to liaise with foreign authorities, perhaps in the jurisdiction where the records are sited, in order to obtain the information through a formal exchange of information. To that extent, the individual taxpayer would step back in order to allow a process of dialogue with the tax authorities in the other jurisdiction to take place. The application of penalties is also no different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80701-0015.htm_para24"><a name="080701109000041">The hon. Member for Taunton asked about what HMRC is doing to protect taxpayer data. I refer him to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Poynter reports. There is a long list of steps that HMRC is taking, and I encourage him to look at the reports in detail because they give the scope and nature of those improvements.</p>

 I am grateful for this opportunity to move the new clause and speak to the amendments, but I will not be pressing them to a vote because I have learned that the Conservative Opposition are not going to vote on them tonight, although we have the votes to win. I do not think that it is fair on Labour Members to ask them to vote against their Government just for the sake of it, when we cannot win. So the message can go out clearly to the country that we might well have got change tonight&#151;the Liberal Democrats and the nationalists were coming in with us&#151;but sadly, the Opposition votes have crumbled.

so it would be well worth listening. If my seat was marginal I would be desperate to find some good messages to impart to the electorate. Let us return to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para5"><a name="080701115000011">The law banning smoking has changed behaviour, and with civil partnerships we have rewarded the loyalty and faithfulness of couples of the same sex. When those measures went through we became a more civilised society on both fronts. The new clause would try to extend that approach for siblings who have made a home together, many of whom, as a result of the current duties paid on property at death, have to sell their home and start all over again. I did not table the new clause as a plea that such people should have special tax status or because they are siblings living together, they should be exempt from tax, but merely so that, as for married couples and those in civil partnerships, the tax would be delayed until the second sibling had died.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para6"><a name="080701115000012">Of course, it is right that the Treasury should be worried when well-meaning souls try to move amendments that sound very good on the surface but could be used for tax avoidance purposes. That is why the new clause includes a requirement that siblings would have had to live together for at least 10 years before the provision would take effect. Clearly, given people&#146;s ability to manoeuvre around the tax system, if there were no such bar, it would pay them to move in when they knew a sibling was dying. Nobody is in favour of that. We want to reward decent behaviour. Many siblings affected by the current arrangements would undertake civil partnerships if the law allowed them to do so, but it does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para7"><a name="080701115000013">I ask Labour Members who oppose the proposal to think back to the time before civil partnerships. There were Members on the Labour Benches, and certainly some on the Conservative Benches, who thought that passing such an Act was against a law of nature, but once it was passed it was extraordinary how quickly people thought of it as a normal arrangement. One should reward such arrangements through the legal or tax systems, as would have occurred if there had been enough votes to support my proposal to give siblings the right to keep their family home until the second sibling dies. That is the point of the new clause, and I hope that I have explained its objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para8"><a name="080701115000014">I fear that a message will go out from the Chamber that there are not enough votes to carry the proposal, but I believe it will be carried before too long, and I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister and the Conservative spokesman say. I think we may hear a slightly more progressive line from the Liberal Democrats. I commend the new clause to the House.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) on bringing about this debate and raising the issue of siblings and inheritance tax. As he has already suggested, we are not inclined to support the new clause. I shall explain why, but it is not because we do not appreciate the legitimate concern felt by many siblings who have lived together for a number of years. I suspect that he was most concerned about cases in which, as a result of the inheritance tax charge falling on the estate when one sibling died, it would be necessary for the surviving sibling to sell the property&#151;the joint home. That is an understandable concern; our party, and, I suspect, Members of all parties, have a great deal of sympathy for people faced with those circumstances.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that if, say, in 2010 the individual allowance were &#163;350,000 per person, and two siblings jointly owned their house equally, the house would have to be worth more than &#163;700,000 before inheritance tax even became an issue?</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="080701115000017"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew4"><a name="080701115000034"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 Yes, I do agree with that. Indeed, to some extent, the Minister anticipates my argument. I will set out why, although we have sympathy with the case&#151;from her tone, I am not sure that she shares that sympathy&#151;the new clause is not necessarily the right way of addressing it. The proposal is not the way in which we would address the issue, but we would address it, none the less.</p>

<p><a name="st_o242"><a name="080701115000018"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew5"><a name="080701115000035"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>
 As the hon. Gentleman acknowledges, the Minister is surely right that if the threshold were &#163;350,000, the house in question would have to be worth &#163;700,000. However, that would be just as true for a married couple, or a same-sex couple in a formalised partnership. The question that the Minister needs to answer&#151;the hon. Gentleman may choose to put it to her in these terms&#151;is: why should two women who have established a civil partnership be eligible for that relief, but not two sisters who choose to live together in a house worth more than &#163;700,000?</p>

<p><a name="st_o243"><a name="080701115000019"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew6"><a name="080701115000036"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, although I think that it will fall on both the Minister and Conservative Members to answer the question: why not treat siblings as a separate category, as we rightly do married couples and those in civil partnerships? Our concern has to do with the threshold, but what the Minister says is absolutely right. We are not talking about all siblings who live together; we are talking about those with a relatively large estate. However, equally, it would be fair to say that an estate of &#163;700,000-plus is not necessarily that unusual, and we are not talking about only the very wealthy. That point is worth bearing in mind with regard to inheritance tax more generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para9"><a name="080701115000020">As house prices have risen&#151;not so much in recent months, but over the previous 12 to 15 years&#151;many more estates are being affected by inheritance tax. That is a legitimate concern, and I congratulate the right hon. Member for Birkenhead on raising the issue. I certainly see that happening in my constituency: relatively modest houses are now above the inheritance tax threshold, so there is a legitimate concern. Of course, many people who do not have an estate above the threshold aspire to have such an estate. In many respects, because of the way in which inheritance tax has developed over recent years, it now affects far more families and people who hope one day to have an estate of that sort of size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para10"><a name="080701115000021">There is a legitimate problem with inheritance tax. The most prominent case is that of the sisters from Marlborough, Sybil and Joyce Burden, who have written to every Chancellor of the day since 1976&#151;some eight Chancellors so far, although one suspects that the turnover may increase in the next couple of years or so. The sisters have also taken their case to the European Court of Human Rights, where their application was recently rejected. I personally think that our tax law should be determined by the conclusions of our debates about such matters in this House, not by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. None the less, the sisters have raised an important issue, particularly in the context of the surviving sibling having to move out to pay the IHT liability.</p>

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 824</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para11"><a name="080701115000022">I suspect that the Economic Secretary may make two arguments in that context: first, that it is possible to pay off IHT over a period of 10 years or so, and one can defer some of the liability; and secondly, that equity release is available. Some of the equity in the property can be released, but given that many people have saved all their lives to own a property outright, there is, unsurprisingly, a great reluctance to do what essentially is remortgaging part of it to fund a tax liability. My concern with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal is about where precisely we draw the line. The line is currently clear with regard to married couples and civil partners, but what about, for example, long-term carers for elderly parents? The same case about protecting the family home could be made. What about adult disabled children who live with their parents? Again, a humane and reasonable case could be made for them. One is left with the question of where to draw the line.</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="080701115000023"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew7"><a name="080701115000037"><b>Lynne Jones:</b>
 If that is the case, why did the hon. Gentleman not consider tabling amendments that would have extended the provision to those groups? I do not think that we should have the provision at all; the money that has been spent on allowing the transfer would have been better spent elsewhere in the public sector, and particularly on free long-term care. The provision has been introduced, however, and people think it unfair that siblings and the other groups that he has mentioned should be excluded.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="080701115000024"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew8"><a name="080701115000038"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I am grateful for that intervention, because it takes me on to the point that I was going to make. The reason why we do not support the new clause is that it is not bold enough. Instead, we propose a very simple way of addressing such concerns. I notice from the press reports about Sybil and Joyce Burden that their joint estate is estimated to be worth &#163;900,000. Rather than provide additional exemptions for siblings and the other groups that I have mentioned, we propose simply to raise the inheritance tax threshold to &#163;1 million. It would address the concerns of the vast majority of siblings who are affected, because we would be talking about a joint estate of &#163;2 million. We would also be talking about the carers and the disabled adult children. Indeed, we would be talking more broadly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para12"><a name="080701115000025">Our proposal would address the essence of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and although we have sympathy with what he is trying to do, a simpler way of dealing with siblings, the other groups that we have mentioned, many other families who have acquired a relatively modest home in a part of the country where house prices have risen considerably, and people who have saved and built up a substantial estate, is to take them out of inheritance tax altogether, so that it becomes a tax for the very wealthy&#151;a tax on millionaires, not on fairly average families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para13"><a name="080701115000026">That is the policy that was announced at our party conference in October last year. It is clearly enormously popular, and it caused the Government to address the issue of inheritance tax in their autumn statement last year, when they announced the transferable nil-rate band. Like the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, the Government see that there is a problem with inheritance tax. However, if we want a Finance Bill that addresses those concerns, we may have to wait for a couple of years.</p>

 I understand why the new clause was tabled and I have some sympathy with the predicament that it raises. I should say in passing that the new clause may have a technical defect. I lived with my sister for 15 years, then I turned 18 and went to university. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has been in such a position, but my point is that there are young people who live together as siblings for more than 10 years. However, that is not why I am speaking against my right hon. Friend&#146;s new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para14"><a name="080701121000002">Last year, about 6 per cent. of estates&#151;about 34,000 of them&#151;paid inheritance tax. This year, because of the changes and the doubling up of husbands and wives and civil partners, it is predicted that about 4 per cent. of estates, or about 23,000 of them, will pay the tax. However, what is important is not just the absolute numbers but the principle of the issue. We need to start with how we got to this position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para15"><a name="080701121000003">One of my degrees is in sociology, and that colours how I approach this issue. In most societies, inheritance sprang up to bolster the family and pass property to children&#151;think of peasants and the issues in different European countries about whether there is primogeniture and so on. Our inheritance tax is part of a historical follow-through of that in respect of fostering family life. That is why there are exemptions between husbands and wives and now, quite properly&#151;as highlighted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead&#151;between civil partners. That is a welcome step forward, as it is to do with a relationship that, historically, most societies sought to bolster to a greater or lesser extent because of the involvement of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para16"><a name="080701121000004">Some civil partners have children and some do not; that takes us back to the debate on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which we will not go into here. However, a lot of that debate revolved around the provision of a social unit that had adequate means of providing a stable environment for the children. That was particularly significant historically&#151;a man might have been killed in the war and left a widow with young children, for example. For me, that is the historical background and how we have got where we are.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="080701121000005"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew10"><a name="080701121000037"><b>Mr. Frank Field:</b>
 On the historical background, I should say that the prayer book originally said that the purpose of marriage was to beget children. A more modern version says that it is for couples to form relationships. I am looking forward to the next stage of my hon. Friend&#146;s speech.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="080701121000006"><a name="80701-0017.htm_spnew11"><a name="080701121000038"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 It is to do with encouraging stable relationships. Historically, although not so much today, that issue revolved around children, whether in respect of procreation or the change in the wording that we now have. The same imperative does not apply to siblings. I stand to be corrected, but I take it that when we are talking about siblings in this context, we generally mean blood siblings or, because of the 10-year thing, foster siblings who have had a long-standing relationship. We are generally thinking of older people who have chosen to live together, such as Sybil and Joyce Burden. There is not the same social imperative to have a tax regime to bolster that kind of relationship, desirable as it may be for people to live in stable relationships.</p>

Do we take it to cousins&#151;blood relatives who have chosen to live under the same roof together for many years and do so until one of them dies? Do we take it to people who are best friends, albeit platonic? Carers have been mentioned. My initial reaction is that we might like to consider including those who care for elderly parents, because I regard it as desirable to encourage adult offspring to do that. However, when one of the parents died, if they were married or in a civil partnership the property would pass with no inheritance tax to the surviving parent, who would probably still need looking after. When the second parent died, it would not seem quite the same, although it could appear that way to the carer, who would then have to move out of what they regarded as their family home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80701-0017.htm_para18"><a name="080701121000008">My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead mentioned deferred tax. As I understand it, it is not just a question of that. We are talking about exemptions, as we have seen with the provisions introduced in the Bill on retrospective transferable allowances between spouses. I declare an indirect interest in that my mother, who has been widowed for 19 years, inherited the whole estate without paying inheritance tax, and that doubling up will affect what she passes on to her children. It is not just a question of deferred tax but of less tax being paid. The mere fact that less tax is paid is not a reason to walk away from something if the principle is right, but I am not sure that it is. The 10-year transition period to which the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire referred is an option that could be used. However, I am not so sure about equity release schemes, which are not necessarily something that we want to encourage. Although there can be good schemes offered by reputable financial institutions, there are a lot of horror stories about sharks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para0"><a name="080701121000011">I would say to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary that we should consider a form of deferral of inheritance tax. There is the classic example of two sisters who have lived together all their lives, or for the last 30 years of their lives. One is aged 80 and one is aged 70, and the 80-year-old dies. The 70-year-old might live for another 20 years, beyond the 10-year paying-off period for inheritance tax, and have to move out of a home that in some cases will have been the parents&#146; home. At the time that her 80-year-old sister dies, the 70-year-old might have lived in the house for 70 years and fully expect to live there for the rest of her life but be faced with an inheritance tax bill because house prices have gone up. That will involve only a small number of people, but we are looking at  <br>

the principles. There could be some tax deferral mechanism so that when the younger sister dies 20 years later, that is when the house is sold and the inheritance tax becomes payable, albeit perhaps with interest rolled up over that 20-year-period. It would be similar to the transitional arrangements for people who go into care and are selling their houses for that reason. We need to think about slightly more creative mechanisms to adapt to the ways in which people live.</p>

 They could apply to married couples, but there is a social imperative, to which I referred in a sort of pop sociology way, in the context of why society does what it does, and its being comfortable with what it does. In the case that we are considering, and in trying to square the circle, I am content with the exemption for spouses and civil partners. Perhaps it would be best to have an open-ended period&#151;things depend on the age difference between the siblings, the health of the older one, the one who dies first, and so on&#151;but it could be up to 30 years, in which the inheritance tax bill is deferred until the second sibling dies or sells the house, perhaps to move into a sheltered bungalow.</p>

 I wish to draw on a personal experience, which, although not directly relevant, is sufficiently relevant to illuminate our debate. My grandmother, who married Mr. Browne, was called Miss Gray&#151;we are a rather monotone family. She was the oldest of four children and she died in 2000 in the house in which she was born in 1913. There were four children&#151;two boys and two girls. Both sons were killed in the second world war and their names are on the war memorial in the church near the house, and my grandmother and her younger sister, my great aunt, survived.

However, I wanted to make the case because it is a perfect example of the sort of people whom the new clause would assist. Many women of that age did not get married and had to make different arrangements after the second world war that they would not have had to make in other circumstances, if such a seismic disruption to society&#146;s normal development in the United Kingdom had not occurred between 1939 and 1945. Those women made exceptional arrangements. Many were sisters who lived initially with their parents and then, when the parents died in the 1950s and the 1960s, lived together in the houses in which they had been born or brought up. The full implications are felt only when one sister dies many years later&#151;the social legacy of the second world war has lasted many decades.

I appreciate that the number of houses that are worth that sum is falling by the day. This Government are perhaps trying to tackle the problem of the inheritance tax burden in their unique way. There are probably betters methods, but they are doing their best. The threshold is not yet as high as &#163;700,000, but the moral case is no different for sisters who were born in a house that is now worth &#163;800,000 from that for those living in a house worth &#163;600,000. They did not choose to be born in a house of a specific value&#151;it is their home, the place in which they have lived for many decades, and they expect to live there for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para6"><a name="080701121000026">I should be interested to hear the Economic Secretary&#146;s intellectual justification for saying that there is a significant material difference between, to take a hypothetical example, two women&#151;let us say two 90-year-old women&#151;who choose to enter a civil partnership, and therefore immediately become eligible for those benefits, and two 90-year-old women who have not met in the past few months, but who have lived together in the same house as sisters for the past 70 years. Indeed, as I said in an intervention, such a civil partnership could have been motivated by tax reasons. That would be a shame&#151;although it would not be beyond our comprehension&#151;whereas it could not possibly be the case for the two sisters who had lived together for many decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para7"><a name="080701121000027">The Economic Secretary said that the situation would apply to very few people. Of course that is the case, but that only strengthens the argument; given that the costs are so minute, the Treasury need not worry unduly. In fact, the Treasury could be quite charitable and expand the scope of the scheme. The costs are so small that the Treasury could win a lot of good will from people who feel that they are unfairly penalised, at a small burden to taxpayers as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para8"><a name="080701121000028">There are a few points in new clause 2 on which it is worth reflecting. One of them concerns the 10-year living together period. I assume that 10 years is an arbitrary figure, although any figure will inevitably be arbitrary, because it is quite hard to come up with a figure that is based on anything other than an arbitrary assessment. Some people might think that 10 years is quite a short period of time, because we are typically talking about two sisters or two brothers who have lived together for their whole lives. With higher house prices, brothers and sisters are increasingly buying flats together, in London or other parts of the country, because they cannot afford a mortgage on their own, they do not have a relationship with a partner and they regard buying a property with their brother or sister as the most safe and stable basis on which to proceed. In some cases, therefore, 10 years may be quite a short period of time. The Government may be more accommodating if that period were longer, and we could rightly consider that.</p>

 The 10-year period was picked because I thought that there needed to be some ring-fencing of the new clause. There are no worthwhile figures as yet for how long civil partnerships last, but 10 years is longer than the average marriage. One might say that that is because so many marriages break up so early, thereby dragging the average down, but that is the average figure.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention, because he has helpfully said that the figure was as un-arbitrary as he could make it, even though there was inevitably an arbitrary element involved. It is obviously necessary to have a figure, because we do not want people exploiting the provisions for tax purposes, even though that might not be foremost in their mind as they approach their imminent demise. I only suggest that, were the figure to be higher, the proposal would probably achieve its objective in terms of the type of people that we all have in mind while providing an even greater safeguard against potential abuses.</p>

That is a fair point, and I hope that the Minister and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) will engage seriously with it. Stepbrothers and stepsisters, for example, would presumably come under the provisions. It would be strange if they did not, because it is increasingly prevalent nowadays for people to have stepbrothers and stepsisters rather than for all their siblings to have the same two parents. We could also consider other blood relatives. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) talked about cousins, but should we also consider second cousins? We could also consider people who have been adopted, carers and other categories of long-term cohabitants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para10"><a name="080701121000032">It is reasonable that the Government should look at all the implications of introducing a measure of this kind. However, it upsets people when the state appears to exercise an excessive and somewhat arbitrary power over individual citizens who are going about their business and who feel that they are being unfairly victimised. This has been a motivation for newspapers and other campaigners, and it has real resonance for people to whom the provisions do not apply. They instinctively feel that it is wrong for a very old lady to have to leave the home that she has lived in for perhaps 90 or 95 years because the sister with whom she has lived for most of that period has died.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para12"><a name="080701124000015">Two separate issues are involved, and perhaps it would be helpful to deal with them separately. The first concerns a point of principle; the second compassionate issues. Perhaps this will answer the point made by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne). It is worth saying at the outset that we all have huge respect and admiration for anyone who is able to sustain a long friendship and relationship, such as those that exist between long-term cohabiting siblings. There are many families in which such relationships break down, and I have huge respect for the kind of relationships that we are talking about today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para13"><a name="080701124000016">However, I do not believe that a parallel can be drawn between such relationships on the one hand, and marriages and civil partnerships on the other, as the latter involve particular legal and financial characteristics. The civil partnership issue is rather a distraction in this context. We are talking about marriage, including marriages involving same-sex couples, and the law and society view such marriages in a fundamentally different way compared with other close relationships such as blood relationships or close friendships.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para16"><a name="080701124000019">It went on to say that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para17"><a name="080701124000020">That is the crucial point. Our policy on inheritance tax recognises the special position of marriage and its equivalent for homosexual couples, and we think a line should be drawn at that position. We will thus resist the new clause and amendments proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para18"><a name="080701124000021">The hon. Member for Taunton was entirely right when he said that the cost of accepting the amendments would be low, despite the point of principle that I have set out, but the precedent from crossing the line could potentially open us up to far wider costs. We have already debated some of the issues, but if we accept the provision for long-term cohabiting siblings, where do we draw the line? Should it be extended to cousins, parents or grown-up children, for example? Why, then, for 10 years, and not for nine, eight or seven years; and why not for flatmates or any other long-enduring relationships or even business relationships? Once we had conceded the first point, the potential cost to the Exchequer could, I feel, be extremely large. That is the point of principle.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="080701124000022"><a name="80701-0018.htm_spnew12"><a name="080701124000096"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>
 Given that the Minister said in her opening comments that this provision would apply only to a very small number of people, because most do not have the good fortune to live in an expensive house, surely the costs would not be that large, even if she conceded quite a few different cases. By her own estimation, 96 per cent. would not be eligible for the benefit because their house would not be sufficiently valuable.</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="080701124000023"><a name="80701-0018.htm_spnew13"><a name="080701124000097"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 My point was that the overall costs would be far larger than simply the cost of accepting the particular amending provision. We have not costed it in detail because we have not looked at the number of long-term relationships that would be covered. My point was simple&#151;that the cost of implementing the amending provision might be low, but that by conceding the principle, we could open ourselves up to far wider costs. That is a secondary point, however, as it is the unique institution of marriage and its gay equivalent that makes the point of principle here.</p>

be forced to leave the home that they have lived in for many decades, perhaps even for the whole of their lives. Let me try to tease out some examples. I said earlier when I intervened on the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) that once the limit was raised in 2010-11, the estate would have to be worth more than &#163;700,000 before inheritance tax even became an issue. Let us think about an example where a house is worth &#163;800,000&#151;a round number, which makes it easier to work with. Let us suppose that such a house is owned equally by two siblings who have lived in it for a long time, perhaps having inherited it from their parents some time ago. If one of the siblings dies, the limit in 2010-11 will be &#163;350,000, so inheritance tax will kick in on the difference between that and &#163;400,000&#151;namely &#163;50,000. It kicks in at 40 per cent., so the inheritance tax bill is &#163;20,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para21"><a name="080701124000026">Two things could then happen. The bill could be paid over 10 years, which would mean &#163;2,000 a year. I do not know how that equates to the council tax bill on the house, but it might be possible for the individual to meet the additional amount. If not, various options would be available. If even an extremely elderly person was facing a charge of &#163;20,000 and owns an asset of &#163;800,000, it would be fairly easy to remortgage to get the necessary amount. Although on compassionate grounds I have sympathy for the individual on losing their elderly sibling, I am not sure that there are grounds for the state to intervene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para22"><a name="080701124000027">I want to touch on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West about deferring the charge, even beyond phasing it for 10 years. In a sense, by remortgaging to get the capital required, a person is using the private market to do exactly that. With regard to the extremely exceptional circumstances of an individual in a house worth about &#163;800,000 who is unable to access any of those possibilities, the HMRC inheritance tax manual allows situations involving genuine hardship or serious difficulty to be considered on a case-by-case basis. In extreme cases, therefore, there is a certain amount of flexibility, which would include postponing the payment of all or part of the tax due. Given the figures involved, however, there will not be many such extreme cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80701-0018.htm_para23"><a name="080701124000028">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that the subject under consideration affects &#147;average families&#148;&#151;he used that phrase. The median house price in England and Wales is &#163;180,000, so I do not know what his definition of average is, or what the average house price is in his constituency, but from where I am standing, a property worth &#163;700,000 is in no way average.</p>

 If inheritance tax affects only a tiny or very small minority&#151;I do not know what phrase the Economic Secretary would use&#151;can she explain why the centrepiece of the pre-Budget report, which was after all prepared at a time when the Prime Minister was considering going to the country, was changes in inheritance tax?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman completely misses the point. Our proposals related to what happens when property is passed down to children. That is not what we are discussing today. We are discussing whether the second sibling should be forced to leave the house. Of course, it has always been the case that no inheritance tax is paid when one spouse passes their part over to the other spouse.</p>

 I fully accept that the amendment relates to siblings, but as the Economic Secretary raises the point about inheritance tax being an issue only for the very wealthy, can she explain why the centrepiece of the Government&#146;s pre-Budget report last October, in the run-up to a potential general election, was changes to inheritance tax?</p>

<p><a name="st_o268"><a name="080701124000032"><a name="80701-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="080701124000101"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 I repeat that the hon. Gentleman misses the point. First, we raised the threshold up to &#163;350,000 from 2010-11, and made the commitment that it will continue to rise with inflation, including house price inflation. Secondly, we made it absolutely clear that the zero relief could be transferred when the second parent died. As I said, that is a different point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para0"><a name="080701124000033">The interesting thing that came out of the discussion on the pre-Budget report, as the hon. Gentleman has just confirmed, is that the Conservatives would raise the limit to &#163;1 million. I am absolutely clear that that is not a good use of taxpayers&#146; resources. I am not sure where he would find the money to pay for it. Effectively, the proposal would take at least &#163;1 billion and give it to people whose assets already make them millionaires. When a certain amount of public money is available, it is right to spend it on something that benefits genuinely average families, not millionaire estates as he proposes.</p>

 On a slightly tangential matter, I have a constituent who was widowed in 1969 and remains a widow, but who cannot do the doubling up, to use the vernacular, because she was widowed so long ago. She did not get real benefit from the inheritance tax provisions when her husband died, but she was adjudged technically to have benefited from them, because of their wording. I do not expect my hon. Friend to deal with that matter tonight, but I hope that she can look at it again. I do not know what the cut-off date is, but a small number of people, including my constituent, are caught.</p>

 My I endorse what was said by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)? We raised the point in Committee, and he is absolutely right. I know that the Government&#146;s proposals date back to some years ago, but it is the case that if the first spouse died before either 1974 or 1972, he or she will not benefit from the nil rate band. We urge the Government to reconsider.</p>

 I do not know whether that is yet another example of an unfunded spending commitment from the Conservatives, but we felt that 35 years was a fairly decent point at which to draw the line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para1"><a name="080701124000038">The point of principle is beginning to emerge. We want to make clear that there is something special about marriage that makes it necessary for a nil band rate to apply. While we have sympathy and compassion for elderly people who have been living together for the vast majority of their lives, we feel that in view of the value of the estates concerned, Government intervention is not required except in the circumstances that I have described.</p>

 I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity of having this Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para22"><a name="080701126000004">Many Members believe that economic strength and development is a fundamental building block for the people we represent. Those of us who witnessed when that did not occur in our constituencies are aware of the devastating effect it had on the people we represent and the communities we serve. It is crucial that we get that economic development and growth right, not only for existing generations but for generations to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para23"><a name="080701126000005">I want to concentrate on some of my constituency&#146;s local successes, and to talk about some of the challenges we face in a fast-moving global environment. Coupled with that, in no way do I want to underestimate the problems we have had in the past and the problems we still face now. Although this debate is about economic development in Houghton and Washington, East, it is fair to say that no one constituency, region or nation can address economic development in isolation from current events and the global economy, and the impact that that has on everyone we represent. When 10 years ago textile workers in my constituency working in a former mining village called Fence Houses lost their jobs because Marks and Spencer decided to source from emerging markets, that had an impact and it was a direct result of globalisation. When the Nissan car manufacturer moves towards medium and higher value cars, that is an impact of globalisation as well, because emerging markets are now starting to produce much cheaper cars; we have heard some of the announcements in India and other places, where cars can be built for $1,000 or $2,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para24"><a name="080701126000006">This global impact therefore affects us all, and the purpose of the debate is to raise some of the issues and to explain how I think we can respond. We must respond with a lot more creativity and flexibility than in the past, because the decision is not about whether we adapt to what is happening in the rest of the world, but how we adapt and what public policy we have, and what measures and mechanisms we put in place to make sure that the people we represent have a competitive advantage. Whether we like it or not, the train is leaving the station and we must be properly on board it. In my area and others, the growth and decline of traditional industries often took centuries, but I suspect that that will happen a lot quicker in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para25"><a name="080701126000007">The area I represent has learned a number of lessons that it is right I share with the House. It has learned and applied those lessons despite the dramatic loss of its core industries. It is hard to comprehend the devastating impact that the loss of those industries had, not just economically but socially, in a very short space of time. It is against that tough background that the city has made significant progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para27"><a name="080701126000009">It has grown by 73 per cent. in that time. Other references to the city&#146;s economy are especially apt for this debate:</p>
<a name="80701-0019.htm_brev26"><a name="080701126000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Sunderland&#146;s success has been in regenerating its urban sites, while at the same time capitalising on the growing trends in the service and knowledge economy. The city has come a long way in modernising its economy with a flourishing service sector with big names such as Barclays, T-Mobile and BT locating here.</p>
</ul><a name="80701-0019.htm_brev27"><a name="080701126000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">The engineering sector is also thriving with Nissan at its forefront, operating the most efficient car plant in Europe.</p>
</ul><a name="80701-0019.htm_brev28"><a name="080701126000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">Growth has accelerated in the last five years, driven by stronger activity in the knowledge sector&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para28"><a name="080701126000010">While the report endorses the city absolutely, it makes the obvious point&#151;and it is worth placing it on the record&#151;that some areas still require improvement. Public infrastructure is one such area, and improving it would attract more service-based companies to invest in the area. Public investment has come into the area in the past 10 years&#151;and there is more to come&#151;and that has helped us to narrow the gap year on year in a range of economic indicators according to which we lagged behind massively in previous decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para29"><a name="080701126000011">In a further endorsement of the city council&#146;s strategy, the 2008 Cities Outlook report specifically identified Sunderland as having one of the highest rates of employment growth. A Business Inquiry report showed that growth in employment was 9.4 per cent., compared with 6.7 per cent. in the region and 3.3 per cent. for the UK. However, worklessness in the city is still higher than the national average. It has fallen three times faster than the national average in the last 10 years, and in my constituency alone we have seen a substantial reduction of 12. 5 per cent. in unemployment in the last five years. There are many reasons for that, but the overall success of the British economy has contributed massively. Various initiatives have helped many thousands of people in my constituency get back into work, but more needs to be done, and I shall give one small example. Many people need a multi-agency approach to get them back into work, and the city council believes that there should be more data sharing and co-operation between agencies in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para30"><a name="080701126000012">It is to the eternal credit of the city council, past and present, that it recognised early that our core industries were not just declining, but disappearing. Early intervention through an economic strategy was the best and most secure way to prevent our city from becoming an industrial desert. The council worked hard to attract important inward investment and to promote small, indigenous companies in the city so that they could create jobs. Against a difficult backdrop, the council had the guts and determination to sell the city and ensure that it punched above its weight. It is not surprising that the city is an award winner many times over for its approach to economic development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80701-0019.htm_para31"><a name="080701126000013">The key is not only attracting investment in the first place&#151;which is difficult enough&#151;but ensuring aftercare for the companies involved. Local and national Government have to provide facilities and work with companies that want solutions to problems. It is not just about getting them to come in and then forgetting about them. It is about working with companies over a period of time.</p>

exception on this occasion. A leading former Sunderland businessman and leading Conservative, Sir Tom Cowie, feels that Sunderland&#151;</p>

 As I was saying, a leading Conservative and Sunderland businessman, Sir Tom Cowie, discussing economic development in the city, said in May 2008:</p>
<a name="80701-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="080701126000048"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You can&#146;t fault the council&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para3"><a name="080701126000018">That is a considerable endorsement from a leading member and supporter of and financial donor to Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para4"><a name="080701126000019">We have had some welcome high-profile announcements. The Nissan decision was great news for the constituency. It was announced that Nissan would build its new model at the plant, resulting in hundreds of new jobs not just at the plant but in the supply chain, which is often based around the area. I would also like to place on record my thanks to the Government for their financial contribution to research and development and for ensuring that Nissan had all the support it could possibly ask for from the UK Government. That is a tremendous endorsement and this week the plant announced that it will have to change its shift system because of the unprecedented demand for the models that it makes. That is great news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para5"><a name="080701126000020">There are many other good news stories. Over the past few years, some 60 international inward projects have come into the city. The projects have recently included Nike, the sports manufacturer, which has announced that its headquarters will be based in the city, accounting for about 15 per cent. of all jobs there. Although we have had setbacks, such as Northern Rock and other closures, in many instances they have been balanced by the additional growth and the announcements of new jobs in the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para6"><a name="080701126000021">Manufacturing remains hugely important. It accounts for 26.3 per cent. of all jobs, which should be seen against the backdrop of a national statistic of about 10.9 per cent. We also recognise&#151;perhaps learning from the past when there was a huge dependence on specific industries&#151;that in order to cope in a global environment we need resilience, a wide jobs base and a wide economic base, which will mean that we do not face some of the problems that we have seen in the past. As part of that strategy, Sunderland is internationally recognised as one of the top cities in the world for technology investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para7"><a name="080701126000022">A heavy commitment has gone into launching software city, an industry-led initiative supported by city council finance. Some &#163;7 million went into building the new Evolve centre in my constituency, where companies such as the home-grown international Leighton Group, under the leadership of Paul Callaghan, are based and produce innovative software. I visited the company a few weeks ago and was very impressed by what it was doing and by its work force, many of whom lived locally or had gone to local colleges and the university. They were employed in a dynamic and growing company. We were also successful in the UK Government&#146;s digital challenge bid, where we got &#163;3.5 million towards community-based projects that deal with technology.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="1 July 2008">

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 840</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para8"><a name="080701126000023">That has all helped to give us a competitive advantage. It is coupled with the partnership that we enjoy with the private sector. Many people talk about partnership and it is a very popular word, but in our case the partnership is real because it is based on trust. It has not happened in just the past few years, but has been ongoing in the city. We have also provided high-quality premises not just for large employers but for small and medium-sized enterprises, too. The latest of those developments is based at Rainton Bridge in my constituency. The 54-acre site will provide about 850,000 sq ft in space, with a potential for 4,000 jobs and about &#163;100 million in investment. Northern Rock was due to relocate staff there and we await Ron Sandler&#146;s restructuring plans, but we remain optimistic that the development will do well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para9"><a name="080701126000024">I spoke earlier about infrastructure projects, and the city council has submitted a revised business case for improving the highway infrastructure on the central route into the development. The companies on the site supply companies such as Nissan and therefore need good infrastructure. I urge the Minister to speak to colleagues in the Department for Transport to ensure that the council&#146;s revised bid gets early consideration and a quick answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para10"><a name="080701126000025">Planning permission has just been awarded to Barnston Holdings, part of Nissan Land Holdings, for another 600,000 sq ft site offering 4,000 jobs. Development land is important in many urban areas and I urge the Government to ensure that public bodies such as city councils can identify and purchase sites for development well in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para11"><a name="080701126000026">I also want to mention the effect that the full business rate on unused sites has on development. I understand the reasons, but the matter needs to be reviewed. We should not have detrimental fiscal policies that might act as disincentives to developers prepared to invest heavily, as part of a speculative venture, in new building in the hope of attracting jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para12"><a name="080701126000027">I shall conclude by saying that our record in these matters is a proud one. The achievements speak for themselves, but I pay tribute to the many companies that have come to my constituency and the city of Sunderland. They have put their faith in the area and the people who work for them. Ultimately, it is those companies that provide the jobs, whereas our job is to ensure that there is an excellent business environment for doing business. That is all about working in partnership and ensuring that companies know that we are continually improving our education facilities and skills base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para13"><a name="080701126000028">One lesson that we have learned is that foresight is very important, as we need to be able to predict, as far as possible, how things will turn out. In the past, economic changes that took 20 or 30 years now happen in five or 10, as many of the rules of the old economic order have gone out of the window.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para14"><a name="080701126000029">I have told the House before that I attended last year&#146;s &#147;State of the City&#148; debate in Sunderland, when a young man just leaving school asked me what sort of job he would have in 30 years&#146; time. That made me think, as I left a school in my constituency just over 30 years ago. If someone had told me then that, today, there would be no shipbuilding, that mining would be gone for ever and that the city would produce 400,000 cars a year, 78 per cent. of which would be exported to Europe, I would have been amazed. Indeed, some of the  <br>

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) on securing this debate about the economic development in the area that he represents, and on his thoughtful and thought-provoking speech. I know that he cares passionately about this subject, and since becoming the MP for the area he has been not just a very active but a highly effective MP for his constituency, particularly in securing the jobs, investment and development that are so important to the local economy. Given that strengthening regional economies is a key strand of the Government&#146;s policy, I very much welcome the opportunity to reflect on economic development in Sunderland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para16"><a name="080701126000032">As my hon. Friend said, his constituency and the surrounding city have been through hard times in the past, but he showed that a great deal of progress has been made and that the city has come a great distance in recent years. I was delighted to hear the good examples that he set out of progress towards future growth. In the first five years of this decade, average year-on-year growth per head was 3.2 per cent&#151;higher than the north-east as a whole, at 2.4 per cent., and the UK average. That has contributed to a significant increase in jobs in that period, to the tune of about 15,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para17"><a name="080701126000033">It is most encouraging to see that developments in recent years have meant that Sunderland has moved into new and exciting areas, functioning in a global context and competing internationally, as my hon. Friend said. At a time when being connected is more important than ever for individuals, cities and countries, people in Sunderland are leading the rest of the country in embracing digital technology as part of their everyday lives. Some 66 per cent. have broadband connections, compared with a national average of 57 per cent. He mentioned the digital challenge competition, in which the city was recently successful, and Doxford International is the first business park in the UK, outside London, to be awarded world teleport status. That demonstrates the development of broadband telecommunications and the information and communications technology skills of the local work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para18"><a name="080701126000034">The Government are investing in both the infrastructure and the people of Sunderland through a wide range of projects supported by European regional development fund and European social fund money, including community economic development, business support, capital investment and training. Many of those projects have been under the umbrella of regional support provided by the regional development agency One NorthEast, the Learning and Skills Council and others. I also echo the tribute that my hon. Friend paid to the positive and outward-looking city council that Sunderland has had  <br>

<notus-date day="1" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>1 July 2008 : Column 842</b><br>
in recent years. As he said, much of the progress in the area has resulted from the partnership between the city council and those other bodies. That has led to a strong local area agreement for the city and a wider multi-area agreement for Tyne and Wear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para19"><a name="080701126000035">Along with investment in buildings, the Government are investing in infrastructure. My hon. Friend has played a positive and important role in supporting the Sunderland strategic transport corridor, discussions on which are ongoing between my colleagues at the Department for Transport and Sunderland city council, and I will bear in mind what he said this evening. The region&#146;s interim regional transport board has recently confirmed its support for the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para20"><a name="080701126000036">The Government have also recently invested some &#163;20 million in the Sunderland aquatics centre, which is intended to be a training centre for the 2012 Olympics. I know that the development is warmly welcomed by my hon. Friend and other local MPs. The Sunderland urban regeneration company has delivered a number of physical regeneration projects in the city, such as the Sunniside project, for which a brownfield site containing many historic buildings is being developed into new residential, retail, food and drink and leisure opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para21"><a name="080701126000037">As my hon. Friend said, there is ongoing private sector investment, and he outlined the benefits at Rainton Bridge. The presence of its own back-up generators, uninterruptable power supply and fire suppression systems has created an ideal location for disaster recovery facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para22"><a name="080701126000038">The story of Sunderland in recent decades would be incomplete without mention of the role of Nissan, which has been critical to the local economy for more than two decades. Recent announcements by Nissan have provided encouraging signs of continued growth. The first of these, of course, is the new model that is to be produced. The Government were delighted to provide &#163;6.2 million in grant aid towards an overall investment for the car of more than &#163;55 million, split between the Sunderland site and suppliers&#146; plants. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform described the new car as &#147;a great British achievement&#148;. The second achievement is the success of the Qashqai, which has led to the recent recruitment of 800 employees, bringing the Sunderland total to 5,000. As my hon. Friend said, the plant is on target to make a record 450,000 cars this year, and has introduced round-the-clock production to the site. That record means that one in every five cars built in the UK is a Sunderland-made Nissan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para23"><a name="080701126000039">Quarterly economic reports that we receive from businesses in the region remain broadly optimistic, even in these more uncertain times. Of course, times are more uncertain, not just here but right across the globe. We have seen, for example, the impact of the international credit crunch on Northern Rock. Here, apart from the wider economic importance of the Government&#146;s actions, the region also required support in the form of decisive action from the Government. Managing the reduction in jobs and the related issues is, I know, an issue that Sunderland is currently addressing with the support of the regional development agency and other regional partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para24"><a name="080701126000040">So, for our part, continuing to invest in infrastructure, in projects to develop the skills of the people and to attract new businesses are the areas that we must focus on and I am pleased to see that these are being addressed.  <br>

Apart from economic issues, health issues have long been a challenge for the north-east, and it is heartening to see that as well as its impressive economic achievements, Sunderland council has been shortlisted in this category, as well as in reducing re-offending, for the annual Beacon awards. I am sure that this will only spur the council on to invest further in health improvements across the city. Sunderland has also had some success in testing new ways to help long-term incapacity benefit claimants off benefit and into sustained employment. That is critical to expanding opportunity for those who need it most. The city is 80 per cent. towards a three-year target of 500 benefit claimants into work by 2009. This is impressive, but as my hon. Friend said, it is also an ongoing challenge, with some 20,000 people in the area in receipt of the benefit as of last summer. So we have set ourselves and the north-east challenging targets to drive forward the social and economic regeneration agenda. It is encouraging to see the regional development agency playing a key role in progress in Sunderland. But  <br>

it is not just funding that will enable us to continue to make the progress that is necessary into the future. We also have to streamline the bureaucracy and increase delegation, and that is what we are doing through the sub-national review. The successes in the north-east give us confidence to delegate more to the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80701-0020.htm_para25"><a name="080701126000041">I am delighted that the area that my hon.

The leadership that they have shown will be all the more important as the city navigates its way through what will perhaps be more uncertain economic times. I am sure that my hon.
