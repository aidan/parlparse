sanitation. Sanitation itself is often under-valued. It is key to achieving many of the millennium development goals. Will he undertake to ensure that his Department&#146;s money goes to training and educating people in developing countries to enable them to deliver appropriately water and sanitation and to enable the millennium development goals to be achieved?</p>

 I accept the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I look forward to receiving the report when it is published. People tend to focus on water and to forget about sanitation. What we really need are taps and toilets. He is right that education is important. That is why, in investing in education, we ensure that we invest in toilets in schools. As we know, without toilets, girls will often not go to school as they get older. Those programmes include education about the importance of washing hands. On a recent visit to Malawi to see one such programme, we saw a brand new toilet block that we helped to fund with our development assistance. There was a big sign over the seat that said, &#147;Now wash your hands.&#148; That makes precisely the point that the right hon. Gentleman makes.</p>

 Further to that question and answer, may I ask my right hon. Friend to recognise the role of women in African villages in the management of water and sanitation projects? Will he in particular commend the health extension workers scheme, which the Select Committee saw in Ethiopia? We are prepared to provide much more money, but it is also necessary to encourage African Governments to make that a priority within their own spending Departments.</p>

 I could not agree more with my hon. Friend on the last point. One of the puzzles in all this is why Governments in some developing countries have not got the message more loudly about the importance of clean water and sanitation. In my experience, as she says, it is women in villages and elsewhere who are most concerned about that matter, not surprisingly, as they spend most of their day fetching and carrying water. If girls have to do that, one of the consequences is that they cannot go to school. We know the impact that that loss of opportunity has on the lives of girls. I assure my hon. Friend that we will continue to do all the things that she asks for.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. That is why, in answer to the original question, I said that we need to get the right structures in place. This year&#146;s &#147;Human Development Report&#148; was all about water. It was a cracking report. First, we need one every year to keep our eye on the ball. Secondly, we need the international community to come together and say,  <br>

&#147;What are the gaps? How are we going to fill them?&#148; Thirdly, directly relating to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, we are arguing that in each country there should be one UN body that takes the lead. As a Government, we will put our money through the one UN body that is nominated in each country. That would be a powerful incentive to the UN system to get its act together. It is good that all those bodies take an interest, but when it comes to helping countries to make progress, they need one plan, one body and one way in which the international community provides help.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will be aware from the correspondence that we have had of the concern of many of my constituents about water issues in developing countries, and I thank him for his response on water privatisation in particular.

 We have just published a further report looking at the total effect of our investment in water and sanitation, and in the last year for which the figures are available we spent bilaterally and multilaterally&#163;242 million. I have a lot of correspondence about water and sanitation, which I greatly welcome. When it comes to public, private or community-led provision, I am interested in investing more of our money in what works to bring clean water to people, and that is where we should put our effort.</p>

 The PPIAF is having a real impact, not just in relation to water but in other areas. The one example that I can think of is that it has helped to improve the availability of mobile phones in Afghanistan, which is good for helping the economy there to grow and develop. As I said a moment ago, in the end I am interested in investing money in what works. There are examples of private sector water provision that work and there are spectacular failures. There are examples of public provision that work and there are those that have been spectacular failures. The conclusion that I draw from that is that it does not matter so much whether it is one or the other, we should be putting cash, effort and time into what really makes a difference. I will assess our contribution to the PPIAF on that basis.</p>

 I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance. That is exactly why in Africa where the problem is greatest, as I told the House a moment ago, we will double and then double again our investment. We need more investment, but we also need to help countries to be able to spend it. Apart from rural areas, the big challenge will be to provide clean water and sanitation to the growing cities and towns of the developing world, because in the next 50 years, first in Asia and then in Africa, that is where a majority of people will be coming to live. Just as in the 19th century in Britain local authorities were responsible for providing the sewers and putting in the taps, we need to find ways of getting more funding to local authorities in developing countries to make the investment and to regulate the provision of water and sanitation, because it is on them that the burden of dealing with the problem will fall.</p>

 I have recently observed in Bangladesh that it is possible to make progress on water and sanitation, with,for example, microcredit schemes, enabling the manufacture of sanitation facilities in small, rural communities. The Secretary of State has admitted that DFID has not performed on the issue and has taken its eye off the ball. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) rightly pointed out, the UN has 23 unco-ordinated agencies working on water and sanitation, and the EU water initiative has been excruciatingly slow and mired in bureaucracy. For the sake of the 2.6 billion people who do not have access to water and sanitation, what steps is DFID taking to improve its performance, international coherence and donor co-ordination to ensure the replication of such schemes across the developing world?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman might give a bit of credit for the change that has been taking place over the past couple of years. It was the international community that took its eye off the ball, but that is beginning to change too. The World Bank is now investing more money, in part supported by our efforts, and we have a large programme in Bangladesh, which I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman had a chance to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="70328-0001.htm_para2"><a name="07032868000048">The EU water initiative has been pretty patchy. Much more impressive is the EU water facility, because that allows countries to bid for funding to invest in the kind of things that I was talking about a moment ago, both rounds of which have been oversubscribed. In the global call for action, I am now arguing that we should embed funding from the EU in an EU water facility on a permanent basis through the next round of the European development fund, because it is about increasing the quantity of investment and about putting the right structures in place. That is why at the World Bank spring meetings we will have a gathering, at which Paul Wolfowitz will be present, in order to make progress.</p>

The governance and transparency fund that we are establishing will in part be used to support parliamentarians in building their capacity to hold their Governments to account. The Public Accounts Committee and the work of the National Audit Office are really good examples of how to do that. We enjoy the benefit of their wisdom and experience, and occasional probing from time to time. I do not see why our colleague parliamentarians and Ministers in developing countries should not enjoy the same experience.</p>

In India, with the Dalit system, we have a situation in which individuals are paid just 80p a day and have to try to survive on that pittance. Does my hon.

 There is a series of practical steps that the Government can take, and are taking, to address modern slavery.

It is one of the reasons why Labour Members have spent so much time and effort trying to secure a debt relief deal. One of the benefits of such a deal is that debt relief in Nigeria will help to pay for an extra 120,000 teachers so that we can get another 3.5 million children in school.

However, in my view, it was entirely sensible that those on the spot conducted themselves and behaved in the way that they did. They were coming down off the merchant civilian vessel, having checked it, and they were then surrounded by six Iranian vessels, which were heavily armed. If they had engaged in military combat at that stage, there would undoubtedly have been severe loss of life. I think that they took the right decision and did what was entirely sensible. Of course, we always keep the rules of engagement under constant review to make sure that we are carrying out our functions and protecting our people properly, but my understanding is that those who were out there and patrolling these waters believed that the rules of engagement are right.</p>

That has been reversed over the past few years, and a combination of a strong economy, tax credits and the minimum wage have delivered, for the first time in years, real reductions in poverty.</p>

 Again, if I could ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to look at the matter in the round, over the past 10 years those families have seen their income rise in percentage terms by more than the top people. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The Tories may shout, but they opposed every one of the measures to reduce poverty in our country. As a result of the investment in tax credits, families with children, in particular, have benefited enormously over the past few years. I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we have to do even more. That is why the measures announced by the Chancellor will actually take an additional 200,000 children out of poverty. All the time, as the economy grows, we have to put even more resources into tackling child poverty. This Government are doing it; the last Conservative Government did not.</p>

 I did not criticise Sir George as a business man at all, but I criticised his view on independence, which I am entitled to do. Let me explain to the hon.

We are able to have a stronger Scottish economy with 200,000 more jobs and Scottish unemployment below the UK average for the first time in a generation. The hon.

That is the choice and I look forward to debating with the hon. Gentleman from now until polling day.</p>

 I would like to make a statement about the current situation regarding the15 British service personnel detained by Iranian forces on Friday of last week, and say that the Government are doing all they can to ensure that they are released immediately. I should say at once&#151;I am sure I speak for the whole House&#151;that our thoughts and prayers at this moment are with all our detained personnel in Iran and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07032868000154">I would like to begin by explaining the facts of what happened last Friday and the actions we have taken since, and to share with the House some of the details about the location of the incident on which the Ministry of Defence briefed this morning. At approximately 0630 GMT on 23 March, 15 British naval personnel from HMS Cornwall were engaged in a routine boarding operation of a merchant vessel in Iraqi territorial waters in support of Security Council resolution 1723 and of the Government of Iraq. They were then seized by Iranian naval vessels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07032868000155">HMS Cornwall was conducting routine maritime security operations as part of a multinational force coalition taskforce operating under a United Nations mandate at the request of the Iraqi Government. The taskforce&#146;s mission was to protect Iraqi oil terminals and to prevent smuggling. The boarding party had completed a successful inspection of a merchant ship 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when they and their two boats were surrounded by six Iranian vessels and escorted into Iranian territorial waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07032868000156">On hearing this news, I immediately consulted the Prime Minister and the Secretary State for Defence, and asked my permanent under-secretary to summon the Iranian ambassador to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We set out our three demands to the ambassador: information on the whereabouts of our people; consular access to them; and to be told the arrangements for their immediate release. Cobra met that afternoon, as it has done every day since. On 24 March my colleague the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Lord Triesman, held a further meeting with the ambassador to repeat our demands. He has had several such meetings since that date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07032868000157">At that first meeting the Iranian ambassador gave us, on behalf of his Government, the co-ordinates of the site where that Government claimed that our personnel had been detained. They were not, of course, where we believed that the incident took place but we took delivery of them as the statement of events of the Government of Iran. On examination, the co-ordinates supplied by Iran are themselves in Iraqi waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07032868000158">On Sunday 25 March, I spoke to Minister Mottaki, the Iranian Foreign Minister, as I did again yesterday. In my first conversation, I pointed out that not only did the co-ordinates for the incident as relayed by HMS Cornwall show that the incident took place 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters, but that the grid co-ordinates for the incidents that the Iranian authorities had provided to our embassy on Friday 23 March and to Lord Triesman on Saturday 24 March also showed that the incident had taken place in Iraqi waters. I suggested  <br>

to the Iranian Foreign Minister that it appeared that the whole affair might have been a misunderstanding which could be resolved by immediate release.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07032868000159">In Iran, our ambassador, Geoffrey Adams, has met senior Iranian officials on a daily basis to press for immediate answers to our questions. He has left the Iranian authorities in no doubt that there is no justification for the Iranians to have taken the British Navy personnel into custody. He has provided the grid co-ordinates of the incident which clearly showed that our personnel were in Iraqi waters and made it clear that we expect their immediate and safe return. I should tell the House that we have no doubt either about the facts or about the legitimacy of our requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07032868000160">When our ambassador and my colleague Lord Triesman followed up with the Iranian authorities on Monday 26 March, we were provided with new, and&#151;I quote&#151;&#147;corrected&#148; grid co-ordinates by the Iranian side, which now showed the incident as having taken place in Iranian waters. As I made clear to Foreign Minister Mottaki when I spoke to him yesterday, we find it impossible to believe, given the seriousness of the incident, that the Iranians could have made such a mistake with the original co-ordinates, which, after all, they gave us over several days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07032868000161">There has inevitably been much international interest in the situation, particularly given our personnel&#146;s role in a multinational force operating under a UN mandate. I have spoken to a number of international partners, including the American Secretary of State Rice, the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan and the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud. We have also been keeping other key international partners informed, and I am pleased to be able to tell the House that many of them have chosen to lobby the Iranians or to make statements of support. I am particularly grateful to my colleague Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who has confirmed publicly that the incident took place in Iraqi waters, and called for the personnel, who are acting in Iraq&#146;s interests, to be released.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07032868000162">The Iranians have assured us that all our personnel are being treated well. We will hold them to that commitment and continue to press for immediate release. They have also assured us that there is no linkage between this issue and other issues&#151;bilateral, regional or international&#151;which I welcome. However, I regret to say that the Iranian authorities have so far failed to meet any of our demands or to respond to our desire to resolve this issue quickly and quietly through behind-the-scenes diplomacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07032868000163">That is why we have today chosen to respondto parliamentary and public demand for more information about the original incident, and to get on the public record both our and the Iranian accounts, to demonstrate the clarity of our position and the force of the Prime Minister&#146;s words on Sunday 25 March when he said:</p>
<a name="70328-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07032868001143"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is no doubt at all that these people were taken from a boat in Iraqi waters. It is simply not true that they went into Iranian territorial waters, and I hope the Iranian Government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us. We have certainly sent the message back to them very clearly indeed. They should not be under any doubt at all about how seriously we regard this act, which is unjustified and wrong.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07032868000164">The House might also be aware that, even if the Iranian Government mistakenly believed that our vessels had been in Iranian waters, under international law warships have sovereign immunity in the territorial sea of other states. The very most that Iran would have been entitled to do, if it considered that our boats were breaching the rules on innocent passage, would have been to require the ship to leave its territorial waters immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07032868000165">We will continue to pursue vigorously our diplomatic efforts with the Iranians to press for the immediate release of our personnel and equipment. As Members of the House will appreciate, with sensitive issues such as these&#151;as with the recent Ethiopian case&#151;getting the balance right between private, but robust, diplomacy and meeting the House&#146;s and the public&#146;s justified demand for reliable information is a difficult judgment. I am very grateful for the support that the foreign affairs spokesmen of other parties, you, Mr. Speaker, and others in the House have given us over the past few days, and I hope that that will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07032868000166">As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday, however, we are now in a new phase of diplomatic activity. That is why the Ministry of Defence has today released details of the incident, and why I have concluded that we need to focus all our bilateral efforts during this phase on the resolution of the issue. We will, therefore, be imposing a freeze on all other official bilateral business with Iran until the situation is resolved. We will keep other aspects of our policy towards Iran under close review and continue to proceed carefully. But no one should be in any doubt about the seriousness with which we regard these events.</p>

<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="07032868000167"><a name="70328-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="07032868001348"><b>Mr. William Hague (Richmond, Yorks) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Foreign Secretary for her statement. When she demands the safe and swift return of our Royal Navy personnel, she has the united support of the House. We support the Government in the firm but measured approach that they have adopted so far, as well as the announcement that she has just made about the freezing of other bilateral business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07032868000168">Clearly the seizure of our personnel was unjustified, and the evidence that the Foreign Secretary and the Ministry of Defence have presented shatters the credibility of any claim that our personnel were operating in Iranian waters. The Government are right to use every diplomatic channel, and to have avoided early escalation of the matter beyond the publication of the evidence and what she has said in her statement. If this turns into a protracted dispute, this country is placed in the strongest moral and legal position by having approached the issue in this way. Is it not vital for Iran to understand that such actions only damage its standing in international opinion? This country&#146;s response must be one that increases its international support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07032868000169">I commend our forces for the difficult and dangerous tasks that they are undertaking in Iraq and its territorial waters, under a clear UN mandate, and in support of the stability of that country. I also welcome the Government&#146;s action to keep the families of those involved&#151;who are very much in our thoughts, as the Foreign Secretary has said&#151;fully informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07032868000170">Can the Foreign Secretary say what justification was given by the Iranian ambassador or Foreign Minister for their failure to provide consular access to our personnel, or to reveal their location? Is it not unacceptable that British officials have not been given access to them? Has she received any indication of when that will finally take place? Have the Government managed to ascertain exactly who is believed to be holding them in custody? In their communications with the Iranian authorities, will the Government make it absolutely clear that any repeat of the mistreatment experienced by the British marines held by Iran in 2004 will be viewed with the utmost seriousness in this country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07032868000171">The Government will be aware of speculation that some in Iran view the detention of British personnel as an asset that can be traded in for concessions. Have any demands been made by Iran&#151;the Foreign Secretary did not mention any in her statement&#151;in relation to their capture?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07032868000172">Can the Foreign Secretary indicate what effect, if any, the incident has had on the ability of British naval forces to continue to operate in Iraqi waters? On the rules of engagement, will she and the Defence Secretary be able to assure the House that any changes requested by those commanding our forces will be granted?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07032868000173">Three years ago, eight British personnel were seized by Iran from the Shatt al-Arab on the grounds that they had violated Iranian waters. Will the Foreign Secretary say what conclusions were drawn from that experience? In particular, was any understanding sought with Iran, or offered by it, about the waters in which British naval forces operate, and about the fact that such operations pose no threat to the Iranian state? Will the Ministry of Defence look again at its configuration of forces in the area, so that the forces undertaking these tasks are fully protected, or better protected, or better able to deter interference with their activities?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07032868000174">We support what the Prime Minister has said about British efforts moving into a different phase. If agreement to release the personnel is not forthcoming in the coming days, will not the correct way to pursue their release be multilateral and through the UN, since Britain is operating under a UN mandate? Will the Government take all necessary steps to ensure that if the situation endures we will have the maximum support from the UN Security Council and the EU, which has very extensive trading and financial links with Iran and our many friends in the region? In that way, the greatest possible degree of international unity can be brought to bear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07032868000175">Finally, the international effort to convince the Iranian Government to suspend their nuclear programme and return to negotiations passed an important milestone on Saturday, with the agreement of a Security Council resolution widening UN sanctions against Iran. Will the Foreign Secretary assure the House that that separate matter will in no way weaken our resolve, or that of other nations, to enforce those UN sanctions, so that nuclear proliferation in the middle east can be resisted?</p>

been given for withholding consular access and information about the location of our personnel, and so on. Nothing that I could call justification has been given. All that has been said is that investigations are continuing. I spoke to the Iranian Foreign Minister yesterday, and he said for the first time that consular access would not be given until the investigations were completed. Prior to that, delivery had been taken of the request for consular access, but no commitment had been given. We have been given no clear indication as to where or by whom our personnel are being held. I share entirely, as I am sure does the whole House, the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s observation about the grave concern with which we would view any mistreatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07032868000177">To date no demands have been made by the Government of Iran. What has been said is that this is a technical but very grave breach of Iran&#146;s borders, and that investigations into it are continuing. We do not judge that it will make a difference to how our people operate, but the right hon. Gentleman is right to say that if the commanders on the ground were to seek a change in the rules of engagement&#151;which they have not done&#151;that would be treated with the utmost seriousness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70328-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07032868000178">The right hon. Gentleman asked about a range of people.

He may be aware that the Foreign Minister of Germany, which has the EU presidency at the moment, recently made a statement on behalf of the EU. I therefore assure the House that we will pursue every avenue and channel to try to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

Our thoughts are with them and their families. It is outrageous that Iran has compounded its serious breach of international law by refusing even to confirm where the marines and sailors are held, never mind allowing the basic humanitarian requirement of consular access.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman, too, for his co-operation and that of his colleagues. There is no indication of whether this is a one-off event, or of the significance that it might have. We are not aware of any change in the pattern of Iranian behaviour in the Gulf. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) asked about the Iran nuclear file. The incident took place close to the vote in the Security Council but, I repeat, the Iranians have told us that they are not making a link between that and any other issue. I assure him and the House that that will make no difference to our determination. Indeed, it is a constant source of astonishment to me that it seems not to dawn on some of the authorities in Iran that behaving in that manner increases rather than diminishes people&#146;s concern about how they would behave if they had a nuclear weapon.</p>

The answer is: at every level we can&#151;official level and ministerial level. Everywhere where there are levers to pull, we are pulling them.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her remarks. I know that she speaks for her constituents. She is right about the environmental problems that could be caused by action in that part of the Gulf. However, as I am sure that she and other hon. Members know, approximately 85 per cent. of Iraq&#146;s gross national product passes through that gateway. That is why those involved are acting not only in the interests of the Government and people of Iraq but on behalf of the United Nations.</p>

 As our forces in the Gulf are operating under a United Nations Security Council resolution, Iran&#146;s action is a breach not only of international maritime law but of that resolution.

<a name="70328-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07032868001145"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to empower the National Assembly for Wales to make provision about transport opportunities for long-term incapacity benefit claimants who have gained employment; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07032868000230">A couple of weeks ago the Minster for Employment and Welfare Reform came to my constituency to speak at an employment summit. Everyone who attended recognised that the Government, in partnership with the Welsh Assembly Government, had achieved enormous success in reducing unemployment in the south Wales valleys. In Wales as a whole there are now more people in work than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07032868000231">However, everyone at that meeting also agreed that there was still a lot to do if we are to achieve full employment. The pathways to work programme underlines the fact that the central task is successfully to tackle the issue of economic inactivity. Unfortunately, in the south Wales valleys, because of the legacy of heavy industry, a huge number of people are languishing on incapacity benefit. Those are people who were written off by the Tories when they decimated the coal industry and now this Government have the task of breathing new life once again into communities and individuals who have been ignored for so long. Let me be clear: we are not talking about people who are lazy or workshy, as some of the Tories would have it. These are proud people who have been treated with contempt by consecutive Conservative Governments. Our task today is to work with our people to provide support, encouragement and real opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07032868000232">Nowhere in Britain is the problem of economic inactivity more entrenched than in the area at the heads of the south Wales valleys. Recently, the Bevan Foundation indicated both the scale of the problem and some innovative ways forward. Undoubtedly, one of the problems in helping people off welfare and into work is the topography of the area. From Blaengwynfi in the west to Blaenavon in the east, there are what the writer Gwyn Thomas once called the gulches of south Wales&#151;deep ravine-like valleys, running from north to south. The problem with such topography is twofold. First, it makes it very difficult for industry to locate, and secondly, it makes it very difficult for people to travel to work, especially if they have to travel east-west rather than north-south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07032868000233">In one of the Welsh Assembly's Committees that looked at economic inactivity in Wales, the lack of transport was correctly identified as one of the main barriers to work. Transport was also referred to time and time again at the employment summit that I referred to earlier. Only the other day, a constituent explained to me how he was faced with the difficulty of travelling from his home in the village of Graig-y-Rhacca across the Rhymney valley to his place of employment just south of Ystrad Mynach. That is a classic example of how just one individual had difficulty in travelling east-west rather than north-south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07032868000234">In many valley communities poor public transport is part of the fabric of life. A large number of communities do not have passenger rail links and in many cases buses do not service industrial estates and business parks. Where business parks are serviced, bus timetables rarely reflect shift-working patterns. Owning a car for many people is a practical necessity. Those unable to afford a car are frequently left immobile and isolated. Limited access to personal transport is a labour market barrier often cited by new deal participants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07032868000235">In the long term, the answer is to improve public transport, and the Welsh Assembly Government,  <br>

through their newly devolved powers, are working hard on that. In the short term, car ownership or access to cars is the only way to enable many people on benefit to secure employment. Of course we should be concerned about carbon emissions, but this is one of the rare cases where car ownership would have a positive social advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07032868000236">In that respect, Working Links, a public-private partnership, is engaged in truly path-breaking work. In the valleys of south Wales, Wheels4Work and Wheels2Work are two unique loan schemes that provide cars, commercial vehicles and scooters free of charge to people requiring personal transport to enable them to get work. Today, the two initiatives have some 80 vehicles and have helped over 400 people into employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07032868000237">There is also the question of helping individuals who want to work when they have particular disabilities or conditions. I cite the example of a constituent of mine, Anthony Wilson. Anthony is a young man who suffers from epilepsy. He found a part-time job in the next valley and was supported by Jobcentre Plus, but Jobcentre Plus was unable to help him with his transport costs. Because of his condition he needed a taxi to get to and from work. Working Links was able to provide assistance and 12 months later Anthony Wilson is still in work. Fortunately, in my area we have Working Links, which complements the work of Jobcentre Plus, but it does not have contracts everywhere, so there are gaps that need to be filled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07032868000238">One of the features of the past couple of years has been the increasingly positive partnership between the Department for Work and Pensions and the Welsh Assembly Government. My suggestion is that we need to consider how best to deepen that relationship; the will is there but we need to look into how the relevant legislation and regulations can be modified and fine-tuned to enhance the relationship. We need to consider in particular whether we need enabling legislation to allow the WAG to intervene in DWP programmes to provide more transport opportunities. Under the Government of Wales Act 2006, the National Assembly for Wales has the opportunity to propose legislation that can then be handled speedily by Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70328-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07032868000239">I hope that due consideration will be given to my proposals. Problems due to transport difficulties are more widespread in the south Wales valleys than in any other part of the country. Devolution is about finding particular solutions to particular problems. This is a problem particular to the south Wales valleys, which is why I propose that consideration be given to the Welsh Assembly&#146;s gaining the ability to intervene more proactively in the welfare to work agenda.</p>

The referendum had a massive turnout of68 per cent. of the total voting population of Canvey Island, and 99.5 per cent. of the people voted against the proposed liquefied natural gas plant. That is now going to appeal. I must write to all those people to tell them what happened to their petition and what they must do next to write to the inspector to make sure that their rights are upheld.

 As it happens, and as the hon. Gentleman knows, I know his constituency, including Canvey Island, well. There are probably a higher number of hazardous sites in his constituency than in any other constituency that I can think of, certainly in the south of England. We all need to be grateful, even though we do not realise it, to the constituents of Canvey Island, because it is through those sites that such vital services are provided to the rest of the country. I have been trying to do the mental arithmetic: &#163;7,000 should provide 21,000 or so envelopes, which would still cover his requirements. However, in addition the Members Estimate Committee makes it clear in its recommendations that, in such circumstances, he would be able to write to people who had written to him by way of a petition, and he would be able to make use of the communications allowance in so doing if he wished. Overall, it is a better and a clearer system. The problem about the paid-for envelopes was that their use just grew. There has been no proved  <br>

What if Members of one party, conscious of controversy surrounding a particular policy, were to seek to craft letters to go out to their constituents, perhaps en masse, that made no reference to another political party or its position, but were simply an attempt to trumpet the merits of that policy?

When the Leader was talking about spending more than the &#163;7,000 limit on pre-paid envelopes, I thought that I heard him say, with nods of approbation from others who might or might not be in the Chamber, that other allowances could be used to increase the spending on pre-paid envelopes beyond &#163;7,000, which would make the limit a nonsense.

 The hon. Gentleman is correct&#151;he says what I hope that I said. It will be possible for Members to use the allowance to pay for the postage of communications above and beyond the &#163;7,000 for pre-paid envelopes, but it will not be possible to use any other allowance to pay for additional envelopes over the &#163;7,000 limit.</p>

 We were advised that if we wanted the staff to have effective control, we would have to set the limit at &#163;7,000&#151;full stop. If the system does not work properly, I am sure that the House will be able to review it in due course.</p>

A few hon. Members have been asked to repay costs for pre-paid envelopes to the Serjeant, usually because of a misunderstanding about the rules.

It is not for party political advocacy or for Members to undermine the reputation of others. It is not to give incumbents an advantage over challengers. Accordingly, the report states that the allowance would not be used for fundraising, encouraging people to join a party, campaigning for or against a candidate, or advancing arguments to promote a particular political party or organisation. As I have said, the boundaries between parliamentary and party political work can be difficult to draw, but we all understand where they lie.  <br>

The MEC saw evidence of websites of Members of all three major parties that were not in accordance with the current rules. If those websites had been submitted as a hard-copy draft of an annual report, they would never have got past the Department of Finance and Administration. In fact, I do not think that anyone would have had the cheek to put them forward. However, the websites were in place and using public money for purposes other than parliamentary purposes.</p>

To ensure that there is much better control, we have decided to make the rules clear and to say that it will not be acceptable for Members to allow publicly funded web pages to be contained in another domain or website, and vice versa. Members will have a parliamentary website, and they may have separate websites if they wish to fund them from other sources. Parliamentary websites will close down when Parliament is dissolved after a general election is called.</p>

 Rather than the proposal being advantageous to Members, does the Leader of the House agree that our constituents might find it advantageous to them for us to tell them what is going on, keep them involved and give them another means of contact with us? Like me, he will know no Members who would knowingly abuse the system. It will be up to Members to use the system with good will. We are all honourable Members and we will all do that.</p>

Hendon (Mr. Dismore) is in his place in the Chamber, and we may well hear from him later on how he spent &#163;37,000 of taxpayers&#146; money on stationery. When we last debated the subject, he said in <i> Hansard</i> on 1 November 2006, in column 355, volume 451, that that was &#147;a matter of pride&#148; to him, and that that spending made him a good Member of Parliament. I look forward to hearing what else he has to say on the matter.</p>

It is a matter of pride to me that I have been a high spender, because it shows that I have been working as hard as I can to keep my constituents informed.

 I am happy to apologise to the hon.

I simply point out, as I did in the previous debate, that although he says that his communications with his constituents are gladly welcomed, turnout in his constituency at the election was just 58 per cent. In fact, he had a larger drop in his percentage share of the vote than Members in neighbouring constituencies did. Perhaps he might like to think about that, and reflect that his voters might like him a little bit more if they heard from him less.</p>

 As I say, I was not planning to speak in the debate.

It was about trying to keep constituents informed. Indeed, many of the people to whom I write are Conservative supporters and always will be. I have no prospect whatever of persuading them to vote for me, and I fully accept that, but it is part of our duty as Members to make sure that we keep in contact with all our constituents, of whatever political hue.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for giving way. She makes the point that the IEP enables us to communicate with constituents. Does she accept that for some Members, perhaps those in London or other areas with very high rents, the IEP is not sufficient to enable them to do that? It would perhaps be better to deal with those who suffer from that problem by providing a different rate of IEP for people with particularly high rent rates. That would be better than using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and increasing the expenses for everyone.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a valid point: many Members who represent constituencies similar to mine, Maidenhead in the south-east, find it difficult, within the IEP, to rent premises in the constituency and have sufficient funds available to do the other things for which the IEP is intended. That is a separate issue, and the Senior Salaries Review Body might well consider it an issue for Members of Parliament that is to be dealt with in an entirely different way.</p>

Of course we are all aware of cases that have come before the Committee on Standards and Privileges or the Serjeant at Arms on the potential misuse of stationery and envelopes&#151;that is, their use in ways that should not be paid for by the taxpayer. Indeed, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has said that the misuse of Members&#146; allowances is the most common accusation relating to sleaze. He says:</p>

little justification for increasing Members&#146; budgets. My personal preference is for Members to be given a single budget that would cover office costs, communications and stationery and for them to be free to choose how they spend it within the rules and within the budget. That would get round the rather strange situation that will arise, and to which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) referred, in which there will be a limit on the number of prepaid envelopes that can be used by hon. Members. However, they can use other allowances to communicate through the post with their constituents and to buy postage stamps for that purpose. Indeed, they can vire money from their staffing allowance to do so. I think that there is a reason for changing the rules, but I do not think that there is a reason for introducing a new communications allowance, which will enhance the role of incumbents.</p>

If Parliament does not sit in September, it is absolutely right that Members should have the opportunity to hold Ministers to account. The system for questions and statements last year was a welcome intervention, and I am sure that the House is grateful to the Leader of the House for introducing it. As with last year, this year&#146;s motion proposes that Members should table questions for three days for answer on three subsequent days. I see no reason why Members should not be able to table questions throughout the recess, and the Leader of the House should consider that. I hoped that the changes this year would extend last year&#146;s opportunities, and I am disappointed that they do not do so. As the party conference season evolves, the need for the House to have such a long recess may disappear. I would not argue that conferences themselves should disappear, although I gather that that happened to the Labour party spring conference this year, but I would certainly argue for a change of approach to them. Conferences are not a chance for a holiday, as some people have viewed them in the past, but an opportunity for healthy political debate.

We submitted a radical prospectus to assist the Leader of the House and colleagues on the Modernisation Committee in their inquiry into strengthening the role of Back Benchers. As part of that radical prospectus, we drew attention to the fact that the role of a Member of Parliament has changed out of all proportion in the past 20 or 30 years. In fact, when the Leader of the House skilfully bashed into the long grass the dreadful Roy Jenkins report on electoral reform, he drew attention to the figures&#151;the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) will be interested in this&#151;on right hon. and hon. Members&#146; postage. Those figures were drawn from the House of Commons Post Office itself, and are quite illuminating. In the 1950s, the average number of letters received by a Member of Parliament was in the order of 15 to 30 a week. As we all know, thanks to the delightful person who invented e-mail and thanks to all the other electronic devices, as well as a general increase in demand from constituents, that figure is now between 300 and 500 a week.</p>

What we are talking about here is something different. The hon. Gentleman is speaking of allowing MPs to engage in reactive communication with constituents, which I am in favour of.

Councillors in my constituency and across the country are perfectly within their rights to ask the Member&#146;s secretary to mail out, at council tax payers&#146; expense, a survey about a particular issue in their area.

 I have two points in response to that rather poor intervention.

A speech is recorded with the same validity as an intervention. Many of us with relatively high postage bills are assiduous in our correspondence with Ministers when taking up issues on behalf of our constituents, and get a lot more information as a result of writing letters and presenting an argument than we ever will from a parliamentary question.

 I am sure that there are, but I am wary of suggesting that that should be the case because there are sometimes very good reasons why a number of questions need to be tabled.

imbalance between the cost of providing office space in different constituencies was not reflected in the present allowance structure. That needs to be addressed, as it curtails the amount of money available to somehon. Members in pursuing their constituency or parliamentary work, simply because so much of their budget is pre-empted by office accommodation costs that they cannot avoid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70328-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07032868000431">The proposed communications allowance represents a significant sum of money. The last time we discussed the matter, my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire was absolutely right to mention the amount of &#163;6 million; as we have heard, the Leader of the House pooh-poohed her suggestion that it would be anything like that amount. My hon. Friend has repeated today that it is to be &#163;6 million, and the Leader of the House has invited us to do some elementary arithmetic, apparently without having noticed that &#163;6 million is the discounted figure. It is the figure associated with the normal take-up of allowances and is therefore the figure that the taxpayer is likely to have to stump up.</p>

There is a nagging suspicion among many of us that the proposal is partly a reaction to the massive overspend on postage by certain Members. I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation of how some of the figures mentioned in relation to the spending on postage by individual Members can possibly be reconciled with the present rules. Obviously it must be possible; otherwise, the Fees Office and the Serjeant at Arms would have investigated, and there would have been consequences. I find it difficult to understand, however.</p>

If he can give the kind of service that he described for that figure, it is hard to understand how a multiple of six or seven times that amount can still be within the rules. I am not accusing any hon. Members of abusing the rules. I am simply saying that I cannot understand how such amounts can be reached.</p>

to achieve exactly the same result. This is a Humpty-Dumpty situation in which the words mean exactly what we want them to mean.

 My hon. Friend mentioned that this is apparently a cap, but in real terms for most Members it will represent an increase in what they are able to spend on stamps. The booklet says that the proposals will limit annual expenditure to a maximum of &#163;4 million, but I am not sure who has done the maths on that. If we multiply &#163;7,000 by 646, we get a figure of just over &#163;4.5 million, so perhaps &#163;4 million is a more accurate estimate of what would be spent, if we base it on people spending up to 90 per cent. of the allowance. If we were to spend &#163;4 million as opposed to &#163;3 million, that would represent a 33 per cent. increase in postage costs, apparently in a bid to try to clamp down on some of the worst abuses or overspends. This is just another example of additional money being put forward that the taxpayer is going to have to fund.</p>

reinforce incumbency. Clearly, it is a given that it reinforces incumbency, but the question is whether it should do that in order to allow Members to do their job more effectively. One&#146;s views on that will be almost entirely coloured by whether one is a Member of the House who uses the resources or a prospective candidate who does not have such access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70328-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07032868000452">I reject, however, the claims made by some Conservative Members of an easy equivalence between this and the abuse of funding in party political campaigning reflected by the massive influx of funds from third parties or central offices into local constituencies, particularly marginal ones, between elections. That is wrong, and I hope that we will address that in our debates on party funding. The issue under discussion, however, has nothing to do with that. There is no equivalence at all. One can argue cogently against the provision without accepting for one moment such off-balance-sheet party funding to local parties, which is against the spirit of our election law.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has just argued against third party funding to allow those in opposition to campaign against a sitting MP, but incumbent MPs have&#151;to pick a number out of the air&#151;&#163;100,000-worth of state support to be seen to be performing their role, and their members of staff work with constituents. MPs have an enormous advantage. In comparison with the sums under discussion, the sums of money guided to target seats by other parties are minuscule. It is right and proper in a democracy that the activities of those who want to challenge incumbent MPs can be funded.</p>

 I find it difficult to understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, because I do not see any campaign funding going to hon. Members to enable them to do their job as MPs. I do not see the people who work in my office, whom he includes in his figure, as campaigning when they answer letters about the Child Support Agency or the Rural Payments Agency. I do not see the provision of that office and my nine surgeries each month as campaigning opportunities, and I hope that he does not do so either. I hope that, if he really thinks about it, he will not see the money that goes to support Members of Parliament to do their job as campaigning money. Under the rules, we are not allowed to campaign using the funds available. If this money is granted by the House, one hopes that the reputations of those Members who use it will be enhanced, although, in some instances, I suspect that that will not be the case. To that extent only, it is money used in campaigning. It cannot be used, however, for openly party political purposes.</p>

I would have liked clear assurances that the rules will be applied much more stringently than they are at present. I notice the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee nodding vigorously at that point, because he and I have experience of trying to police such matters in the House.</p>

According to paragraph 12 of the report, hon. Members will be able to use the communications allowance to meet thecost of &#147;questionnaires and surveys&#148;. According to paragraph 14, however, the allowance cannot be used to meet the cost of petitions, surveys or questionnaires if they are</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70328-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07032868000460">It is naive to a high degree to believe that the questionnaires and surveys issued will not somehow tie in with national campaigning issues for every Member who uses the money to meet that cost. If a party is running a massive campaign on health service cuts, for example, a survey that may relate to local health service provision will nevertheless tie in with that. If we are to allow that sort of material, which is questionable, let us openly accept that within a national campaigning profile its use will be ambiguous.</p>

That is simply nonsense, and a misreading of what the House is for. We take decisions, express our opinions and vote. Once the matter has been voted on, however, individual Members, whether they thought a proposal was a good idea or not, have a duty to their constituents to use the funds available. <i> [Laughter.] </i>I make the point in all seriousness. I might disagree with a lot of provisions. I sometimes vote against them and do not, if they would be to my personal advantage, take them. For instance, I voted against the pension enhancement, and refused to take it. I know that many Members voted against it and still took it. This issue, however, does not relate to my or any other Member&#146;s personal position, but to the service that will be provided to constituents. Therefore, I hope that accusations of hypocrisy will not be made against hon. Members who choose to vote against the proposal today.</p>

Without wishing to spend any more money, we will have to claim under the communications allowance, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that there is no implication of hypocrisy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70328-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07032868000467">We debate these allowances for ourselves after spending four days debating the Budget, which involved very tough decisions on public expenditure for some important public services, including education and the Home Office. People outside the House will want us to make a very good case for increased public expenditure on our services, given the background of the Budget debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70328-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07032868000468">When he introduced the debate, the Leader of the House used the argument about disconnect to support the communication allowance. That argument can be stood on its head: we could argue perfectly well that it is our voting for more money for ourselves in this way that adds to, rather than solves, the problem of disconnect. One of the jobs of the House is to examine claims for increased expenditure. We are sent here to see how money extracted from constituents is spent. When we are the conduit for that increased expenditure, we need to be even more vigilant and demand an even higher standard of proof.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70328-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07032868000469">The motion before us is the next stage in a debate that began on 1 November, in which a number of those present today took part. When we considered the matter then, it was on a motion from the Leader of the House, and no document had been brought forward. The idea had not been examined by any Select Committee or by the independent outside body charged with determining our allowances. The SSRB is, at this very moment, looking at our salaries and allowances. In a passing reference in the previous debate, the Leader of the House said:</p>

allowance is a new one. That is true, but a lot of the activity that it subsumes is catered for already.The right hon. Gentleman would have been on much better ground if we had waited for the SSRB&#146;s recommendations and come forward with a much more robust case than the one that he presented this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70328-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07032868000471">There is another reason why I believe it injudicious to proceed at this moment. As various hon. Members have noted, a fortnight ago Sir Haydn Phillips published his recommendations on party funding, with no agreement having been reached between the parties. There are a number of outstanding issues, one of which is a proposal for a new cap&#151;one that does not exist at present&#151;on what can be spent locally by a political party. That is of particular relevance where that local party is challenging an incumbent, and I quote what the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) said in our earlier debate:</p>
<a name="70328-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="07032868001168"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Were I a candidate for Parliament running against an incumbent who was using public funds to publish and distribute what looks to most people like campaign literature, I would be mightily upset.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 1 November 2006; Vol. 451,c. 350.]</p>

With an average spend of &#163;3,500, &#163;7,000 leaves a substantial amount of head room for the majority of MPs. I hope that we can stick at that level for some time.

My view remains that if we are to have a communication allowance as proposed, a far stronger case for it needs to be made than we have heard so far.

Those of us who oppose the allowance do not say that ensuring that we are in touch with our constituents, reporting back and making sure that people in our constituencies are engaged in politics are not important parts of a Member of Parliament&#146;s job. Far from it. My problem is the cost that the taxpayer will incur. Through interventions, I have already expressed my disappointment that the communications allowance will cost an extra &#163;6 million, with a perhaps an additional &#163;1 million in increased postage costs. That means that the taxpayer must bear the brunt of an additional &#163;7 million.</p>

on doors to communicate directly with individuals is perhaps one of the most potent ways of engaging people in politics. There is a role for leaflets, too. As a Liberal Democrat, I would say that. I have spent many a happy hour delivering leaflets and I shall do much more of that in the next few weeks. I enjoy doing it&#151;it is good exercise.

We should consider the cases of Members who have problems with their office rent costs, which means that they cannot use their current expenses for incidental provision, but a total blanket increase of &#163;7 million, even for those who do not suffer the problem, is excessive.

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="70328-0012.htm_brev16"><a name="07032868001186"><ul><p class="tabletext">That the draft Gambling (Geographical Distribution of Casino Premises Licences) Order 2007, which was laid before this House on 1st March, be approved.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07032868000981">On 30 January, the casino advisory panel, following extensive public engagement, published its recommendations relating to the 17 local authorities that should be permitted to issue the one regional, eight large and eight small casino licences. The panel&#146;s recommendations on the large and small licences have, I believe, gained general acceptance within the House and outside. However, the panel&#146;s conclusion on the location of the regional casino has proved controversial. The source of that controversy is the strength of feeling from two quarters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07032868000982">First, there are those who hold a moral objection to gambling&#151;a view that I entirely respect and is held by many on both sides of the House and beyond. It is in recognition of the many downsides of gambling that we constructed in the Gambling Act 2005 one of the most rigorous regulatory and protective regimes in the world. Secondly, there are those, led with great passion and effectiveness by my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), who believe that the regional casino should be located in Blackpool. I understand that view, too. Their constituents can be in no doubt about the power of their advocacy on behalf of the people they represent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o287"><a name="07032868000983"><a name="70328-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="07032868002010"><b>Mrs. Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood) (Lab):</b>
 My right hon. Friend well knows the strength of feeling in Blackpool, and it links the two issues that she mentioned. Minimising gambling was part of Blackpool&#146;s bid as a resort casino and yet Professor Crow admitted to the Merits Committee in the House of Lords that he did not take that into account. He made it virtually impossible to award the regional casino to a resort such as Blackpool. Perhaps the Secretary of State will comment on that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="07032868000984"><a name="70328-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="07032868002011"><b>Tessa Jowell:</b>
 Yes. I have had a discussion with my hon. Friend about precisely this point. Having carefully studied the Merits Committee&#146;s conclusions, I have to say that I do not agree with them on this point. She will know that the overriding objective of the Gambling Act, which has within it the provision for the 17 new casino licences, is public protection, which involves keeping gambling crime free and ensuring that gambling is fair. In interrogating all the applicant local authorities, Professor Crow sought to ensure that each could conduct a test of social impact.</p>

 I accept the distinction that my right hon. Friend makes. However, does she not think it rather perverse when one part of the process is set up to produce a particular emphasis, while another part is set up to produce a different one? Does she not think that that inevitably undercuts one of the key principles of the Gambling Act, which was preventing harm and the expansion of problem gambling?</p>

 My hon. Friend has made that point several times. Let me make it clear that Professor Crow was asked to consider the applicant local authorities in the context of three tests on social impact, the capacity for regeneration and the willingness of the local authority to license. Hon. Members will be aware that we made specific provision in the Gambling Act for local authorities that did not wish to have any casinos&#151;this is rather at variance with the belief that casinos are being foisted on an unwilling public who do not want them&#151;to apply a blanket ban. During the process, several local authorities opted to take that course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07032868000987">My hon. Friend has given this matter an enormous amount of thought on behalf of his constituents. The matter before the House and Ministers is one of judgment, given Professor Crow&#146;s report, the report of the Merits Committee and the objectives of the legislation. However, he should be in absolutely no doubt that the overriding concern of Ministers when reaching conclusions is the capacity of authorities to conduct a proper test of social impact and thus express the public-protection objectives of the Act.</p>

 This is a short debate and many hon. Members wish to speak. In fairness to the House, I will take a limited number of interventions, but I wish to set out the arguments as quickly as I can so that they can make their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07032868000990">As I have said, many local authorities wanted to explore the possible benefits of regeneration from casinos. When Professor Crow&#146;s panel invited bids for new casinos, 27 local authorities put themselves forward for the single regional casino licence. A total of 68 authorities put themselves forward as candidates for the 17 new licences. Our policy allows for a limited number of new casinos because of our precautionary approach to gambling. Those 17 developments should essentially act as pilots&#151;a series of test beds to judge the impact of these new casinos in the context of the public-protection measures in the Gambling Act and the three criteria I have set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07032868000991">We made it clear that we would ask an independent panel to make recommendations to Ministers, rather than have Ministers originating recommendations. Until, to everyone&#146;s surprise, the panel recommended Manchester, not Blackpool, as the authority for the regional casino, there was broad consensus across the House on the approach. In the time since the policy was established and during the long process of developing the legislation, I do not think that any significant disagreement was expressed.</p>

That is why I have not simply overturned the panel&#146;s recommendation and inserted Blackpool instead of Manchester. It would fly in the face of the evidence to  <br>

do so, and such an approach would have been grossly unfair to every other local authority that took part in a published and agreed process in good faith. That is the principal reason I am presenting the order in such a form today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07032868000995">Let me go through some of the other reasons behind the recommendations. Our intention is to evaluate the impact of this pilot before taking any decisions about the future number and location of any new casinos. That precautionary approach has two immediate consequences. The first is the composition of the order: the locations of the 17 new casinos have been chosen to give a mix of locations to measure impact accurately. Secondly, it means that there can be no new casino licences for at least the lifetime of this Parliament, until the clear assessment, based on rigorous evidence, is carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07032868000996">I shall now turn to the other issues that have exercised hon. Members. There have been calls for the order to be split, with a separate order for the regional casino. The Government have resisted those calls, because&#151;as I have set out&#151;the package of 17 new casinos forms a package. If I had split the order from the outset, I have no doubt that the accusation would be that the Government were manipulating Parliament into substituting another area in order to pursue political or other motives. I say that because until the panel&#146;s report was published on 30 January and the recommendations took everyone by surprise, we had daily reports about how the Government were nobbling various casino operators to ensure that the regional casino was sited at the dome. The process demonstrated the integrity of the panel&#146;s approach.</p>

<p><a name="st_o295"><a name="07032868000997"><a name="70328-0012.htm_spnew8"><a name="07032868002018"><b>Mr. Evans:</b>
 The Secretary of State of State has said that the package is being presented to us today because it is a package, but that is a self-fulfilling argument. Surely the best approach would be for the controversial decision to be put separately from those that are not controversial in the slightest. People would then at least have an opportunity to have their say on the controversial one, which&#151;as she says&#151;came as a shock to everyone. On the issue of regeneration alone, Blackpool should have got it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o296"><a name="07032868000998"><a name="70328-0012.htm_spnew9"><a name="07032868002019"><b>Tessa Jowell:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman and I had full exchanges on precisely that point at the Select Committee, where I made clear, beyond any doubt, the approach I would take. I have sought throughout the process of this controversial legislation to be clear and consistent at each stage. As I have explained to the House, I have sought to do the same on this decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07032868000999">Much has been made of the Merits Committee report in the other place, which expressed reservations on two grounds&#151;on how the panel interpreted its remit and on the issue of destination casinos. Both points have been raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood. I have placed on record and in response to the Committee my view that its concerns were misplaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07032868001000">The primary consideration that we set for the casino advisory panel in making its assessment was to identify locations that would provide the best possible test of social impact. We did not ask the panel to identify a location that would reduce problem gambling as such,  <br>

because our wider policy is the legislation itself, and it is the responsibility of the Gambling Commission to implement the most rigorous regulation to ensure that problem gambling is anticipated, acted on and contained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07032868001001">The Merits Committee also reflected a claim made by some that it is perverse to locate the regional casino in deprived, residential east Manchester. East Manchester is deprived. On the basis of official figures, it actually ranks as more deprived than Blackpool. One of the panel&#146;s considerations was to identify areas in need of regeneration, so it is not surprising that some of the candidate areas are very deprived. The panel&#146;s job, however, was to recommend a local authority area rather than a specific site, and it is possible to locate a regional casino in east Manchester without putting it in the very poorest residential area. After all, that will be what the local planning system is for. The same would apply to Blackpool or anywhere else. Blackpool&#146;s own bid placed the casino in the town centre, next to what I understand is judged to be a deprived ward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07032868001002">Let me move on to the questions that have been raised about destination casinos. The argument is that the panel has failed because it did not recommend a seaside resort to host the regional casino and has ignored the Joint Scrutiny Committee&#146;s recommendations. That is to misunderstand the concept of a destination resort. Manchester is in its own right a significant tourist destination. Apart from 2002, when it came fourth, in each of the years between 2001 and 2005&#151;the figures bear this out&#151;Manchester was the third most important overseas tourist destination in the UK, behind London and Edinburgh.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70328-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07032868001003">Such a view also fails to reflect the Joint Committee&#146;s intentions. The Committee expected regional casinosto be large-scale entertainment complexes offering gambling alongside a wide range of non-gambling facilities. Anyone who has been to Manchester in the past 10 years can see that the city is at least as compatible with the concept of a leisure destination casino as anywhere else. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

However, in addition to giving Members of both Houses an opportunity retrospectively to examine the panel process, while recognising that the creation of the Joint Committee and its terms of reference are a matter for the House authorities, let me state now that the Government would like the remit of any Joint Committee to be forward looking and not just retrospective.</p>

afternoon. That is clearly not the case. Let me remind the House that we need not be considering one order this afternoon. We offered the Secretary of State the opportunity to put forward one order covering the16 large and small casinos, which we would support. She rejected that offer. Her approach remains &#147;all or nothing&#148;, and it is designed solely to put pressure on her Back Benchers and to steamroller the decision through without proper scrutiny.</p>

We are voting against the order, but it is not a vote against the casino advisory panel or a vote against Manchester. It is a vote for further parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

The right hon. Lady referred to the congratulations that my colleagues and I offered to Manchester and the 16 other locations in the hours after the advisory panel made its announcement. Those congratulations were genuine. We had no intrinsic opposition to Manchester or any other individual location, but given the surprise choice of Manchester&#151;the right hon. Lady conceded that even for her, it was a surprise choice, not least, I suspect, as it had risen from the bottom of the casino advisory panel&#146;s ranking table to the top&#151;it is right for us to have used the time since then to look in greater detail at the report and to listen to the concerns that are now in the public domain.</p>

 I am about to tell the hon. Gentleman all my doubts. If he had allowed me to proceed, our exchange might have been more interesting. I congratulated Manchester that day, as did my hon. Friends. The city won a competition. One hopes that the regenerative benefits will be as envisaged, although there are all kinds of reports, such as the Hall Aitkin report and another report from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which suggest that the regenerative benefits of the regional casinos are not all they are cracked up to be. If the hon. Gentleman read the exchange between the Chairman of the House of Lords Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee and Sir Stephen Crow, he would see that there are serious doubts about the regenerative benefits of some of the regional casinos.</p>

The Government are asking us today to make a leap of faith based on the recommendations of the casino advisory panel, but the Secretary of State&#146;s attack on the Opposition would have carried more weight if the Government&#146;s own stance had been clearer. We are voting this afternoon on the biggest change to gambling law in memory, yet only a week ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was imposing a new 50 per cent. tax rate on these casinos, because, we are told, of his personal distaste for gambling.</p>

If the Secretary of State does not have the support of her own Cabinet colleagues, how can she expect to have the support of Parliament?

 I say to the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) that if it looks like opportunism and smells like opportunism, it almost certainly is opportunism. I also say to him and to the Liberal Democrats that a vote against the order will be interpreted as a vote against Manchester, and it is important that we establish that.

I repeat to the House, however, that Manchester still has enormous need. Opposition Members should consider that Manchester is still suffering from the 100,000 manufacturing jobs that it lost when the Thatcher Government were in power and did so much damage. Recently, Barclaycard has decided to move 600 jobs away from Manchester, and Ciba-Geigy has closed down a plant that has been there for 100 years, taking away another 400 jobs. Therefore, perhaps Opposition Members&#151;who even now do not understand much about the economic geography of the north of England&#151;will understand that a city such as Manchester constantly needs to replace the jobs that it loses. That is why we need these hospitality industry jobs. As the Secretary of State has told the House previously&#151;this was met with guffaws&#151;Manchester is the third most popular tourist venue for day visitors in the country. That might astonish Members, but it is a matter of basic fact.</p>

We want the casino to be based there&#151;the general public in my city are overwhelmingly in favour of it. That is an important endorsement.

However, I emphasise that gambling and its problems exist in our society and that it is better for them to be regulated. I guarantee that the regional casino in Manchester will be examined more often and more closely than any casino that currently exists. We will know in a short time whether we can make the casino work for regeneration and job creation and whether we can minimise the impact of problem gambling in a way that should reassure those who argue, however speciously, that they support an experiment and nothing more.</p>

We believe that it should be reconvened and that we should not go ahead with a vote on the CAP&#146;s recommendations without the Joint Committee's views on two specific issues. First, it should consider the impact on the CAP&#146;s recommendations of the recent and significant changes in gambling ecology in this country.

Although, belatedly, the gambling industry has now contributed &#163;3 million voluntarily to support the work of the excellent Responsibility in Gambling Trust and has promised more, we are still way behind other countries. We spend approximately &#163;10 per head on problem gambling support, but it is significantly less than the amount spent in New Zealand, Canada and Australia, where it is &#163;44, &#163;40 and &#163;26 respectively per problem gambler.

The Secretary of State said that there will be no more casinos until the next parliamentary Session, but in the Gambling Bill Committee it took many weeks even to get clear information about how many existing casinos we have&#151;139 at the time, as it turned out. Then the Minister confidently stated:</p>

By imposing a new high 50 per cent. top rate of tax, the new super-casino&#146;s profit margins will be reduced and its ability to contribute to regeneration, wherever it is located&#151;Manchester or anywhere else&#151;will be diminished. Surely concerns about the explosion of internet gambling, the failure to provide adequate support for problem gamblers, the likely higher than expected number of casinos, the impact of a possible judicial review and the higher than expected super-casino tax are all matters that a reconvened Joint Scrutiny Committee would want to, and I believe should, consider.</p>

Frankly, the panel was dealt an unfair hand, and the process by which it came to its conclusions has led to a range of criticisms, not least, as we have heard, by the Merits Committee. In its report, the CAP declared that the central tenet of its assessment of the bids was its quest to find the best test of social impact. Last week, as we have heard, the Secretary of State wrote to Lord Filkin in response to the damning findings of the Merits Committee. In it she said:</p>
<a name="70328-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="07032868001211"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the criteria by which the Panel would assess submissions were set out in the national policy statement&#148;.</p>

In fact, the remit on which the panel based its decision changed significantly from the one outlined in the national policy statement&#151;something that the House had the opportunity to debate&#151;to the one outlined in the terms of reference issued much later by her and not subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. Despite placing the best test of social impact as the panel&#146;s guiding principle, the Government never defined it. The panel was left to determine it for itself. It is not surprising that it admitted that seeking the best test of social impact was &#147;a peculiar problem&#148;. It certainly is. One of the UK&#146;s leading experts on gambling, Peter Collins, has vehemently argued that the very idea of finding a best test of social impact is an impossible task, not least because there are numerous interpretations of such an ambiguous term.</p>

 Manchester is bound by the legislation; it was not Manchester&#146;s choice. The leader and the chief executive of the city council made it absolutely clear that they could only reconsider the Eastlands site on the basis of a bid that demonstrably proved that it would do everything covered by the present bid but better, so that there would be more jobs, more regeneration and a better framework for social responsibility.

 I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is not entirely correct. Although I accept the integrity of the chief executive and members of the council, and would never call it into question, I hope that he will accept that the letter was specific&#151;Manchester could choose any location in the city. He also knows that under the requirements of the legislation there must be a competition for the new casino. During that competition, it would be perfectly possible for other areas to make claims about regeneration and the prevention of social harm, so he cannot say with such certainty that the casino is bound to be in an east Manchester location.

That shows yet again that one part of the remit usurped the other. Destination casinos had clearly been preferred by the Joint Committee and experts on problem gambling, but the panel had to rule them out. The dice were loaded before they were rolled.</p>

 We cannot underestimate the shock, anger and disappointment in Blackpool when the casino advisory panel made its announcement. That anger has not dissipated since the announcement was made&#151;just the opposite. The people of Blackpool are determined to fight for their future, and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) and I are determined to fight within this Chamber for their future. On Monday, we accompanied the editor of our evening paper,<i> The Gazette</i>, to bring down and present to No. 10 a petition signed by more than 11,500 people. That shows the strength of feeling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70328-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07032878000008">That strength of feeling has existed for a long time. Blackpoolers have been involved in this debate forseven years. This was our future. This was the new21st century Blackpool. The people of Blackpool are wonderfully innovative. We put the tower up in the19th century and developed the pleasure beach and lots of other attractions in the 20th century. Let us remember that what we are talking about is a huge entertainment complex including a conference centre, hotels, restaurants, theatres&#151;everything. This was the big idea for the21st century and I say to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that we are not giving up on it&#151;and we are certainly not giving up easily. We are going to argue the case until the end of this debate and beyond, as she well knows.</p>

Friend said at the beginning of her address that it would have been wrong for her to present an order in which she had taken out &#147;Manchester&#148; and inserted &#147;Blackpool&#148;. We have never asked for that. We asked for two orders so that the eight large and eight small casinos could be considered separately from the other casino. I say to colleagues in the Chamber whose constituencies have been allocated a large or a small casino, I want them to get them. It is not my fault that we are voting for the whole lot&#151;I am in the position that I am in. I want Great Yarmouth to get its large casino, which I am sure will be hugely successful for the constituency of my hon.

down Manchester. I want the debate on the regional casino to be properly considered. I tabled my early-day motion, which was supported by my hon. Friendthe Member for Blackpool, South and Opposition Members representing neighbouring seats on the Fylde coast, because this affects not only Blackpool but all of us, given the regeneration potential of the super-casino. I have to say that it seems absurd to talk about a regional casino when there is only to be one. If the Secretary of State will forgive me, I will call it a super-casino, because that is what it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70328-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07032878000010">I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Bill that became the Gambling Act 2005. I can see no relationship between the casino advisory panel&#146;s report and what we debated in Committee. I must acknowledge the excellent work of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport on that Committee. When we debated the new casinos, we expressed concern about the proliferation of gambling and the problems that that might bring. However, we also discussed the regeneration potential of casinos. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House backed the Bill only because of its regeneration potential for disadvantaged communities. I will put it even more strongly: they backed the Bill only because a debate had started on the regeneration of our seaside resorts, which, as we all know, have suffered over the past 20 years due to changing patterns of holidaymaking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70328-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07032878000011">When we considered setting up the casino advisory panel during our consideration of the Bill, I supported it&#151;I can say that quite honestly. However, I supported it in the context of the criteria we were considering: eight regional casinos, eight large casinos and eight small casinos. Things changed when the number of regional casinos went down to one. The panel should have been given further guidance on how to examine that new super-casino. It was not the panel&#146;s fault that it had to examine a range of criteria as part of its task. How could it determine what was Parliament&#146;s priority if the Government did not state what the priority was? When we debated the spread of casinos that would allow the impact of gambling to be properly assessed, we talked about having a spread of geographical locations for each of the categories. However, as soon as there was to be only one regional casino, we could not say, &#147;We&#146;ll have part of it in a city, part in a resort and part in the middle of the countryside.&#148; Professor Crow had to try to make sense of the complex remit that he was given, so I cannot blame him for coming up with what he thought was the right answer. However, I can question whether, even within the rules that were set&#151;by and large he set them for himself&#151;he came up with the right answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70328-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07032878000012">My early-day motion, which was supported by many colleagues, highlighted the fact that we needed a proper investigation before we made a decision on the single regional casino. That did not happen. I congratulate the Merits Committee in the other place because, in a short time, it has highlighted serious deficiencies in the casino advisory panel&#146;s report. If we in this House had had the opportunity to set up a Committee to consider the report, we could have highlighted other matters that could and should have been properly discussed. Nevertheless, I have to accept that that scrutiny was not performed, except by the Merits Committee, and we should address some of the points that it made.</p>

What nonsense. If we are trying to minimise problem gambling, we should celebrate that here we are pleading for a super-casino in a resort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07032878000026">Time is passing, Madam Deputy Speaker. Professor Crow did not allow Members of Parliament to speak in the public evidence sessions, and this is the only opportunity that I have to speak on this issue. Although I thank the Secretary of State for extending the time, it is not long enough. We were denied the opportunity in Blackpool by Professor Crow&#146;s own decision, and we are now being denied the opportunity here because of the limited time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07032878000027">I shall make two further points. For Blackpool, this issue is the single catalyst for regeneration. Manchester is a glorious, thriving city. I acknowledge everything that my hon.

The excellent report on coastal towns published by the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, which all of us should read, features evidence presented from the north-west. Councillor John Joyce, the then chair of the North West regional assembly, and Keith Barnes, regional director of the Government office for the north-west, gave evidence.

However, we have in front of us a combined order that I did not want to see; no scrutiny of the casino advisory panel; a disregard for regional planning guidelines; and no opportunity for us to separate out the order or say to the large and small casinos that we back them and want them to proceed, but want a more detailed examination of a unique opportunity, through the super-casino, to regenerate whatever area it is in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07032878000030">That decision should have been taken with much more care and consideration, so with huge sadness I have to tell the Secretary of State that I cannot support the order in its current form. It is wrong to present it in that form, and I hope, even at this late stage, that she will withdraw it.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), who made a powerful speech. She referred to the early-day motion that she tabled, which was in the Order Paper, and to the fact that a number of north-western Members on both sides of the House had signed it. I represent a coastal town, too, but I suspect that it is as far away from Blackpool as it is possible to be. However, I was happy to sign her early-day motion, because she presents a persuasive case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07032878000032">I begin by expressing some sympathy for the Secretary of State. Those of us who were involved in the debates during the passage of the GamblingAct 2005 always suspected that she was never that enthusiastic about the legislation. Certainly, the passage of the Bill was dogged by disaster throughout. Almost weekly, the Minister for Sport had to make an announcement of Government policy to the Standing Committee that was almost in direct contradiction to what he had argued the previous week. Then in the Bill&#146;s final stages in Parliament, the Secretary of State was forced to reduce the number of proposed regional casinos from eight to just one. That cannot have been easy for her, but I suspect that she must have sighed with relief when the Bill finally received Royal Assent. She could not have anticipated that not so long afterwards, she would be back in the House of Commons having to defend this order, and facing possible defeat.</p>

I want to reflect on some of the arguments that I presented at the time, and to say why I believe that the position outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) is entirely consistent with all the points that we made during the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07032878000034">There was much in the Bill that we always supported. We believed that there was a strong case for introducing a regime to regulate online gambling, and we supported the abolition of the 24-hour rule and the removal of the ban on advertising. The problem with the Bill was always regional casinos. They represented an entirely new form of gambling that had never before been seen in this country. They would introduce category A gaming machines, too; the proposal was, and is, that each of the regional casinos should have 1,250 of them. There was a real fear that that would lead to an increase in problem gambling. The Government&#146;s problems on that score began when they ignored the recommendation in the report of my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who chaired the Joint Scrutiny Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07032878000035">Initially, the Government had proposed no real limit on the number of regional casinos, but my hon. Friend&#146;s Committee came up with a sensible scheme, under which we would use an economic mechanism that would limit the number. The Government did not accept that recommendation, but instead, halfway through the passage of the Bill, they had to come up with a cap of eight casinos, which flew in the face of what they had previously argued. It was never entirely clear to us why the number should be eight. It was even less clear why, just a few weeks later, they came back with further caps of eight on the number of large casinos, and on the number of new small casinos. Certainly, in the case of regional casinos, we felt that the figure was too large and should be reduced. In the end, we argued that there should be just one, and the Secretary of State was forced to accept that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07032878000036">In arguing about where that one regional casino should be located, we were entirely happy to accept the Secretary of State&#146;s decision that the decision should be given to an advisory panel. However, we have always made it clear that we share the Joint Scrutiny Committee&#146;s view that the impact on problem gambling would be minimised if the location werea destination resort. We strongly supported the Committee&#146;s recommendation that the regional casino should not be located in close proximity to residential properties. At the time, we said that that should be the overriding consideration, and while we certainly were not in a position to say that it necessarily should go to Blackpool, we recognise the strength of the case that Blackpool made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07032878000037">The Secretary of State said that no one objected to the panel&#146;s terms of reference, which is correct. However, they are extremely brief:</p>
<a name="70328-0016.htm_brev6"><a name="07032878000038"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The criteria against which the panel will assess these submissions were set out in the government&#146;s national policy statement on casinos...The primary consideration will be to ensure that locations provide the best possible test of social impact.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07032878000039">As previous speakers have said, it was extremely unclear precisely what that meant, and the panel clearly had great difficulty interpreting what was meant by social impact. It was clear to us, however, that the national policy statement, which was issued when it was proposed that there should be eight regional casinos, rather than one, nevertheless set out at the very outset that the Government&#146;s first objective was to protect children and other vulnerable people from harm. It was not unreasonable to believe that that would be one of the guiding principles of the advisory panel&#146;s work.</p>

Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) has sought to argue that Professor Crow has since said that he did accord importance to social impact and problem gambling when making his decision. However, the panel plainly states that it did not consider that that was a matter for it. Its interpretation of the test of social impact appears to have been to look at the various applications and decide which one was most likely to lead to an increase in problem gambling, and choose it, because it would offer the best test, which is an entirely perverse interpretation of the way in which most people thought that it would undertake its task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07032878000042">When the Secretary of State wrote to Lord Filkin after the publication of the advisory panel&#146;s report, she stated that minimising harm from gambling was not &#147;the primary consideration&#148; that she set for the panel. That leads us to believe that the panel conducted its own inquiry in the light of its terms of reference, but that the Government set it terms of reference that excluded from consideration what we always believed to be the most important issue. On that basis, the panel&#146;s report is flawed, as the Government misled the panel about the issues and criteria that it should have used to make a judgment by excluding what we in the House had always considered to be the most important issue when determining the future location of any regional casino.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07032878000043">It is on that basis that I continue to believe that the recommendation is flawed. My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon has argued that we do not have a problem with the recommendation for the locations of the eight large casinos, or, indeed, for the eight small casinos. Certainly, it would have been preferable had the Secretary of State separated the two issues and put before the House two orders, so that the 16 locations that are likely to benefit from large or small casinos could proceed without being delayed while the matter was re-examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07032878000044">The location of a regional casino is extremely important. There is a real risk that if we get it wrong, that will lead to a significant increase in problem gambling, which is what we have always sought to avoid throughout the consideration of the legislation. If that risks exists, it is worth pausing, as my hon. Friend said, and referring the matter back to a Committee which can take account of the concern about problem gambling, rather than to the advisory panel, which seems to have excluded that issue from its consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07032878000045">For that reason, I hope the House will vote not against Manchester, as some have suggested, but in line with the recommendation in the House of Lords that the matter should be referred back to a Scrutiny Committee.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this important debate. Like every other speaker so far, I shall focus on the most controversial aspect of the order&#151;the choice of Manchester before Blackpool in the Crow report. I was one of the serving members of the pre-legislative Joint Scrutiny Committee under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). I found that a very positive experience. We should look to more pre-legislative Committees to pave a smooth way for Bills through the House. The Government should take heed of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07032878000047">The pre-legislative Scrutiny Committee went on a couple of site visits. One of the most interesting visits that we undertook was to Blackpool, and another was to Great Yarmouth, of course. In Blackpool we could see the commitment of the council and the people to a super-casino. As a member of the Education and Skills Committee, I was impressed by the range of vocational courses being provided by Blackpool further education college ahead of the possibility that the super-casino might be located in Blackpool. There were not only good catering courses, but courses to train croupiers and so on. That was extremely positive and I hope that that facility will be used anyway, no matter what the final location of the super-casino.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07032878000048">As well as examining the evidence, the Joint Scrutiny Committee considered the term &#147;destination casino&#148;. Then we moved to &#147;resort casino&#148;. I was quite happy with those definitions, but when we got to the definition of a &#147;regional casino&#148;, I was less happy. I prefer the term &#147;super-casino&#148;, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) suggested, to the title &#147;regional casino&#148;. Many, if not all, Members of the Joint Committee supported the principle of a super-casino on the basis that it was a way of regenerating a town on the periphery of a region that had few alternative strategic options available to it from a regional perspective. In that regard, Blackpool would have been an ideal choice. Many, if not all, members of the Scrutiny Committee would agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para28"><a name="07032878000049">Such a location would have the added bonus of potentially reducing significantly the possible social impact of problem gambling, because most people would have to travel some distance to visit the casino, rather than having it on their doorstep. The spin-off, in regeneration terms, would be the overnight stays that would result, providing a big multiplier effect in regeneration terms.</p>

Barnsley and Doncaster&#151;the other town that I serve&#151;are examples of the city regions model that is being developed in all the regions, with the aim of successful regeneration. Barnsley, for example, is on the periphery of the Sheffield city region and the Leeds city region. It is always more difficult for towns in such  <br>

peripheral locations&#151;the Barnsleys and Blackpools of this world&#151;to be regenerated as successfully as big city centres such as Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para30"><a name="07032878000051">In settling on Manchester, the Crow report placed too much emphasis on the need to be able to test the social impact of a super-casino, and not enough emphasis on regeneration factors and the multiplier effect that comes from choosing a location such as Blackpool. Paragraph 116 acknowledges that factor in relation to the Blackpool bid:</p>
<a name="70328-0016.htm_brev8"><a name="07032878000787"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact that most customers would come from outside Blackpool and have to travel would be a deterrent to ambient problem gambling. The proposed central location for the regional casino appears to us to be a good one for it, and conducive to local regeneration&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70328-0016.htm_para31"><a name="07032878000052">The super-casino represents a possible flagship regeneration project for a region. I would have thought that two of the major players in terms of regenerating a region would be its regional assembly and its development agency.

The Government did not accept all the recommendations of that independent report, but cherry-picked. I would say to Ministers that we must be consistent as regards recommendations from the independent panels that we set up and ask for reports. We must accept their recommendations en bloc or cherry-pick&#151;one or the other. We are not doing that at the moment.</p>

Members legitimately trading comments about which was the better city, one could begin to see how divisive the process has become.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07032878000058">One of the biggest and most worrying issues raised by our sub-group is the connection between debt and family break-up. I did not used to be so aware of it, but I am now, as the report shows that debt is the single biggest cause of family break-up. Family break-up in the United Kingdom is at record levels and when compared with every other country. We know that many of the problems in inner-city areas result from dysfunctional and broken homes and that one of the main drivers of debt is gambling, particularly among the lower socio-economic groups. I shall come back to that in a minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07032878000059">Putting aside my objections to the increase in gambling that this order will continue, I would have to say with respect to Members representing Manchester that if we had to locate a super-casino anywhere I cannot think of a worse place than Manchester. There are already a number of casinos&#151;10, I believe&#151;and I am not aware that they have contributed massively to regeneration in that city. Let me go through some of the relevant figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07032878000060">We know that Manchester has the highest number of robberies and the second highest level of vehicle crime among the four towns in the top 10 in that region. The same four make up one of the highest-crime cities. We know that 50 per cent. of the population are economically inactive and totally dependent on the state; that life expectancy for men is seven years less than the national average and four years less for women; that unemployment in the area where the casino is to be sited is 5.6 per cent. of the working age group compared with 2.8 per cent. in the country as a whole; and that 13.3 per cent. of the population of working age are on incapacity benefit compared to4.5 per cent. in England and Wales as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07032878000061">I make those points because our findings have shown an intriguing and worrying feature: problem gambling and socio-economic disadvantage are hugely linked. The figures boil down to the following characteristics of a typical profile of a problem gambler: someone who is male; who has a parent who is or has been a problem gambler; who is separated, divorced or a product of a broken home; who is likely to be unemployed, in poor health and poor housing; and who has low educational qualifications. The order&#146;s objective is to place a super-casino right smack bang into an area inhabited by people with all those serious problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07032878000062">I simply cannot understand what this so-called independent committee was doing when it looked into the matter. It clearly failed to take into consideration any of those points. If we had spent a little longer and asked the many people who are now really worried about the increase in problem gambling in Britain, we might just have begun to realise the difficulties that are going to erupt as a result of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07032878000063">We also know from the report that we are working on that there is a close correlation between problem gambling and other addictive activities such as drug and serious alcohol abuse. I remind the House that, right now, the UK is in the grip of an alcohol epidemic. We have a very high number of alcohol abusers and it is rising. We know that the connection between children  <br>

who imbibe serious levels of alcohol&#151;last year about5 per cent. of children under 13 admitted to binge drinking once a month&#151;and drug addiction is almost certain. We know that gambling, alcohol abuse and drug abuse are closely correlated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07032878000064">I am particularly concerned about the sort of organisations that get involved in this level of gambling, and I must say to colleagues on both sidesof the House that I cannot conceive of why we would want to get too close to many of them. The reality is, as we have seen from the behaviour of members of the Government, how insidiously corrupting so many of the people involved in this process ultimately become to those who are legitimately trying to seek some form of regeneration. We have seen that in relation to the proposals for the dome, and I guess that we shall see more of it as time goes on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07032878000065">The connection between problem gambling and other addictions is deeply worrying. More worrying in regard to the report that we have produced is the way in which the most vulnerable, including the very young, are affected. The recent BMA report suggested that age is now a determining factor in this addiction. The group most likely to experience problems with casino-based gambling consists of single unemployed males under the age of 30. Adolescent gambling in the UK is also a grave issue for concern. We have not begun to tackle the problems surrounding internet gambling, even as we begin to expand the whole idea of gaming through these centres. The BMA report mentions a number of studies that identify a figure of between 5 and 6 per cent. of pathological gamblers among adolescent fruit machine gamblers, and states that that figure is three times higher than that identified elsewhere in the adult population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07032878000066">I am now more opposed to this headlong rush into expanding gambling than ever before; I am very worried about it. Many decent, reasonable colleagues in the House are grasping at the idea of regeneration and at the huge promises that have been made, yet there is absolutely no evidence that these casinos will add anything constructive to the lives that people should and could be living, particularly in areas such as Manchester, which have serious levels of deprivation. Such a casino would be a disaster for that area. I wonder what has happened to us if we are genuinely considering regenerating and rebuilding our cities by placing this kind of nonsense in their midst to attract people into the most destructive behaviour in the most destructive areas. I shall vote against the order tonight because I now genuinely believe that this expansion is wrong in any cause.</p>

Regeneration is already taking place there on the basis that we have received the go-ahead for the casino and for a new harbour scheme. Other people are now investing in the town, and we can already see a great renaissance there, compared with 10 years ago. Huge amounts of regeneration money from the Government is supporting the private sector money that is coming into the town. We see the casino as an opportunity in that regard, but the bids that are coming in illustrate that this is not just about the casino; it is about the other facilities that will be added to those attractions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07032878000070">On the Blackpool and Manchester issue, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) and for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden). I understand their concerns and reservations about the order. I, too, would feel pretty aggrieved and I would certainly have wished the casino to have been in Blackpool. What I get annoyedabout, however, is the political opportunism of the Opposition&#151;certainly the official Opposition. They see an opportunity to give the Government a bloody nose. What they will actually do, however, is delay at best, and scupper at worst, the chances of others towns such as Great Yarmouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07032878000071">It is great that the Opposition have had yet another change of heart. The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) has indicated his opposition to gambling as a whole. I would therefore question the Conservative party&#146;s acceptance in 2001 of &#163;5 million from Stuart Wheeler of IG Index. Given the Conservatives&#146; new view, perhaps they will donate that &#163;5 million to the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, run and chaired by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). Once again, double standards are being seen in the Chamber. I would like to think that Members would support the order, and accept the proposals considered by the other place to set up an independent committee to consider such matters in future.</p>

If we consider the previous initial evaluation, and the points awarded, we see that Great Yarmouth was awarded54 points, Manchester 57 points and Blackpool65 points. In the final evaluation, however, Great Yarmouth was pushed to the side to top the large casino ratings, while Blackpool was overtaken by Manchester. A number of other towns and cities up and down the country also had a different initial evaluation. Canterbury, for instance, initially received 51 points in the large and small casino ratings, but got nothing in the second evaluation. What would stop those towns and cities challenging the premise that towns such as Great Yarmouth were above them in the  <br>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright), who was a distinguished member of the Joint Committee. As Great Yarmouth has been allocated a large casino, I can understand that he wants to see that development go ahead. I remember the visit to his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07032878000075">I must confess, however, that I am disappointed and somewhat dismayed at the direction that policy on casinos has taken. It was my wish that the publication of two unanimous reports by the Joint Committee, on both the Bill and casinos, would enable both Houses to proceed with the implementation of the GamblingAct 2005 by consensus. If we are to have a policy that will last for 40 years, as the previous one has done, genuine cross-party agreement is critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07032878000076">It is also important to understand that today&#146;s vote is not a rerun of the vote for or against the Act, but simply a vote on the order, and on whether we yet have sufficient information on which to make a judgment about the panel&#146;s selection. Some of us have been dealing with this matter for more than five years. The Minister for Sport and I probably agree about the need for closure: this issue has gone on long enough, and it is time for us to draw a line under it. I have spent most of the past five or six weeks suggesting that that is what we should do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07032878000077">However, I must make some criticism of my party. It was a huge mistake to insist on having just one pilot regional casino. I do not see how a research project, as recommended by the panel, can have only one pilot. The tensions that exist now stem from that judgment. There was an opportunity to have more than one regional casino, but the House seems to lack the necessary courage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07032878000078">I hear what my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) says, and there are clear objections to expanding gambling in any way. However, resort-type destination casinos have been developed in other jurisdictions, and it is clear that we have missed a golden opportunity to regenerate places such as Blackpool, Cardiff and Glasgow, all of which were big bidders for the one available licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07032878000079">I accept that problem gambling is an issue, and I shall say a little more about it later in my speech.

There is an obvious tension between ensuring that the statutory objective to  <br>

protect children and the vulnerable was paramount in the panel&#146;s recommendations, and the panel members&#146; apparent belief that they had to recommend a location that would provide a strong test of social impact. They interpreted that to mean that they could measure the problem gambling that resulted from establishing the casino. That complete contradiction flies in the face of what we have tried to do in promoting the Gambling Act 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07032878000080">That was of real concern to the Joint Scrutiny Committee, which recommended that the super-casino should be a resort destination casino drawing its clientele from an extremely wide area and providing a national&#151;or, indeed, international&#151;attraction. As a result, in our casino report published in July 2004, we recommended that the generic term of reference &#147;regional casino&#148; should be dropped and that the casinos should be called &#147;destination resort casinos&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07032878000081">At the time, that suggestion was dismissed perfunctorily by an official of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I am not even sure the extent to which Ministers considered it but, given that the Crow panel has said that a destination casino could not provide a social impact test, it seems to me that by calling them &#147;destination resort casinos&#148; from the start we could have avoided the problem that we have now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07032878000082">I make no judgment about the competing claims of all the possible locations for the regional casino. I am not looking for more work, but I am pleased and relieved that the Secretary of State has said that she is willing to reconvene a Committee. I may not be invited to be a member, but there needs to be a bit more clarity about what the Committee would be asked to do. What are the terms of reference? How will they be determined? Tony Banks, who died, and Richard Page, who retired, were members of the previous Committee. I am sure that we could fill those vacancies&#151;the enthusiasm that the debate has revealed for the topic suggests that there would be several volunteers. However, if we reconsider the matter, I cannot believe that we would expect to settle the issue by simply having one regional casino.</p>

My concern is that that is the opposite of the statutory objective to protect children and the vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70328-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07032878000084">The tax rate of 50 per cent. that the Chancellor announced last week calls the regeneration opportunity into question. The Joint Committee constantly asked what the tax rate was likely to be. It is critical in the equation for whether such projects make sense. The tax rate is bound to have an impact on what can be done in some of the small and large casino locations.</p>

We have achieved &#163;3 million funding in the current year and we have been promised &#163;4 million and &#163;5 million from the industry for the next two years as a result of a seminar that the Minister kindly addressed.

 When I was a child in the 1960s, my parents used to take me to Blackpool, where trains arrived at the old central station every three or four minutes and when Blackpool could still attract the cream of stage, screen, TV and radio at the north pier shows and throughout the constituency. That was the golden age&#151;if there was ever one&#151;of the British seaside. However, like so many other seaside towns, Blackpool&#151;perhaps more than others because we were always the biggest and, we argued, the best&#151;suffered from slow decline and the gradual change in the structure of holidays.</p>

Much of that truth is embodied in the predicament of British seaside towns today. The report that the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, which my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) chairs, recently produced on coastal and seaside towns provides eloquent testimony to that. It also eloquently outlines some of the resolutions that I and other hon. Members who represent seaside towns, including my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para0"><a name="07032878000092">That is the key. The regeneration and job-creation boost in Blackpool would be proportionately much greater than in Manchester. That was one of the factors about which the House of Lords Merits Committee specifically talked about. There we have it. That was our pitch. Of course, any panel was bound to disappoint someone. Of course, as Blackpool MPs, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and I spoke up for our constituencies. How could we not have spoken up for the people of Blackpool who have given such tremendous support to the bid over the past six to seven years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07032878000093">There were 11,500 signatures on the petition. Those were from people not just in Blackpool, but across the north-west. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) is entering the Chamber. May I say that 400 people from Manchester signed it? The reason was that they saw the Blackpool bid as a bid for the whole of the north-west. Obviously, we were going to be disappointed whatever happened. However, what has fuelled the anger, the sheer determination and the dogged persistence since 30 January in this House, in Blackpool and in the north-west has been the lack of coherence and accountability that went with the process and with Professor Crow's report. From the moment it was announced, there was criticism that the various elements of it did not add up. Crow failed to make himself available to a press conference. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood has already referred to his sneering remarks about managed decline. I sometimes wonder whether there may not be an afterlife for Professor Crow as a motivational speaker somewhere. I do not think that Churchill in 1940 or Mrs. Thatcher in the Falklands in 1982 would have thanked him for his observations.</p>

Because there had been no detailed scrutiny of the measure. The Secretary of State brought the measure and the panel's recommendations to the House six and a half hours after that report was received and said that she was minded to accept it. In a subsequent meeting, Members of both Houses, including members of the Joint Scrutiny Committee, who did such an excellent and eloquent job, asked her to review the situation before laying the order. She did not. It was left to the Merits Committee to drag a reluctant Professor Crow to the House of Lords, where the Committee echoed all the misgivings that had been put to it already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07032878000095">In a letter to their colleagues about the matter, Baroness Golding and Lord Lipsey said that it was a case of &#147;sentence first, verdict afterwards&#148;.

Yesterday, in reply to a question asking how the panel reached its definition of social impact and what discussion there had been, I was told that there had been no discussion between the Department and the chairman of the CAP since the publication of the panel&#146;s report on 30 January. Does that mean that the DCMS was entirely satisfied with the processthat the House of Lords Committee had said was narrow and flawed, or does it mean that it was so entirely hands-off that it abdicated all responsibility for the process?</p>

It is not an anti-Manchester matter at all. I rejoiced when Manchester got the Commonwealth games and did such a fantastic job with them. My hon. Friend and I, as secretaries of a departmental Committee, wrote a strong letter to the chief executive of the BBC urging that it should move to Manchester and Salford, so let it not be said that this is an anti-Manchester thing. We did not see this as a parochial decision. But if, on the basis of this precedent, independent planners are allowed to drive a coach and horses through the planning  <br>

recommendations in regions, what does that do for the process of regeneration and for regional strategies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07032878000105">All along, I believe that those of us who have been concerned about the order have tried to put forward alternatives. I have no desire to block large and small casinos and they would have to be reconsidered, as has already been said, in any order that came back. We suggested splitting the order. None of this has been properly taken on board. I have better reason than most in the House to know that the Secretary of State has worked hard over a long time to try to accommodate all the various elements of the twists and turns of the process. However, I say to her very gently this evening, as was said in the House about a Minister on another occasion in 1940, that she must not allow herself to be turned into an air raid shelter to shield the bad advice and incoherence of officials, advisers and unelected planners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07032878000106">That brings us to the heart of things. The reason why the debate has taken off is not just the fair play issues and affection for Blackpool, but that the matter goes to the heart of Government and parliamentary process, and is a key question for us as Members and Ministers. We have always had advisory panels&#151;good and bad&#151;and the Government do not have to accept their recommendations, as we saw only last week with the recommendations in the Lyons report on the bed tax. The debate has generated such concern because it taps into a vein of feeling across the House&#151;that we are in danger of acting as technocrats and not as politicians or representatives. It gives me no pleasure this evening to point that out to the Secretary of State and to Ministers&#151;nevertheless, it has to be said. I and many of my colleagues who have grave doubts about the process do not believe that the order or the recommendations of Professor Crow represent either our party policy or Government policy on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07032878000107">A few days after the decision was made Steve Richards wrote about its implications in <i> The</i><i> Independent</i>.

It is her Department and her Ministers who have been receiving the anger of my constituents&#151;not Professor Crow, who has gone back to the anonymity from which some of us thought he originally came. In those circumstances, it is right for me to say that I am genuinely grateful to my right hon. Friend for everything she has tried to do to accommodate the concerns of Blackpool and of people who are anxious about the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07032878000109">I welcome the fact that there will be some form of scrutiny process, which was one of our central demands. However, as we have heard, that is something for tomorrow. I am talking about something for today&#151;something that reflects on what has brought us to today. Ministers are not in this place simply to be messengers or rubber stamps, nor are we. I am grateful to the Secretary of State and to our Chief Whip for giving us time to debate the order properly, albeit not as lengthily as we wanted, but I am in no doubt about where my duty to my Blackpool constituents lies&#151;it is  <br>

 This has been at times a passionate debate, with heartfelt contributions from both sides of the House. I am sure that over the past few weeks many hon. Members&#151;like me&#151;will have been bombarded by letters, reports and e-mails from Manchester, Blackpool and a whole host of organisations that are lobbying for and against different locations. However, the debate tonight is not about one location or the other; it is about getting the right decision. It is about Parliament getting the right decision and having the opportunity for full and proper scrutiny of the casino advisory panel&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07032878000116">There is one sentence in the Lords Committee report that resonates not only around the House, but among the many organisations that have concerns about gambling. The report states:</p>
<a name="70328-0018.htm_brev7"><a name="07032878000797"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Adding maximisation of profit into the consideration...seemed to have a greater weight on the Panel&#146;s recommendations than minimisation of harm.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07032878000117">The Government cannot feel comfortable reading those words when reducing harm and protecting the vulnerable were a crucial element of the GamblingAct 2005and central to their aims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07032878000118">We heard a number of contributions. In his opening remarks, my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) raised the interpretation of the casino advisory panel remit, the concerns of the Church, the uncertainty of the outcome of the regional casino in terms of regeneration and social impact, the casino advisory panel methodology and the changing and shifting of the criteria as the process went on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70328-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07032878000119">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) raised issues about the Secretary of State&#146;s last minute offers to her Back Benchers. Those offers do nothing to address the issues relating to the scrutiny of the order. He also spelled out the fact that, despite the Government&#146;s intentions to try to do something about the huge concerns over remote and internet gambling&#151;I have heard Ministers address this matter before&#151;clearly we still have no progress on that. Indeed, it is going to be difficult for any Government to do anything about remote or internet gambling.</p>

has spent a considerable amount of time on the issue. He pointed out that the Government&#146;s problems began some years ago. There is a sense that, because the issue has gone on for years, the Government simply want the decision over and done with, thus denying Parliament the opportunity for proper scrutiny.</p>

He was joined by the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who added their considerable insight to the debate. My hon. Friend pointed out the important difference between a destination casino and a casino that relies on ambient gambling, and the important difference in the impact that they have on local people and on the harm that gambling can do. My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) pointed out early on that the Secretary of State had a choice tonight: she could have split the order.</p>

The comments made by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood were particularly fair and measured, bearing in mind her interest in a casino for Blackpool. She asked only for proper scrutiny, as she went to some lengths to explain. I am not quite sure what the Government Whips were promising her during the debate, but good for her for sticking to her guns, not just for her local constituents, but for Parliament. In contrast, the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) persisted in telling us about Manchester&#146;s needs.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is easy for Ministers to point the finger and say that we are being politically opportunistic.

 I am not aware of the shadow Chancellor recommending anything. None of us are recommending anything. We are simply asking the Government to stop. What on earth is the rush? The Government have spent so long considering this issue that I fail to understand why they need to rush ahead now. If they were intent on listening to Parliament, they would listen to what they have heard tonight and in the previous few weeks: Parliament wants more time. There is no reason at all why they should not give Parliament more time. The Secretary of State and her Ministers could then be satisfied that Parliament had scrutinised the matter and that the decision was robust. Hon. Members, not least Labour Back Benchers, would then be a great deal happier.</p>

Last Friday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who happened to be working in New York, got a telephone call from the hon. Member for East Devon, in which he said &#147;We have changed our minds. Why have we done that? Because the boss has told me to change my mind.&#148; The shadow Chancellor is running around and telling Manchester, &#147;I&#146;m very sorry indeed; I&#146;ve got to change my mind.&#148; I have never seen such inconsistency, and these people are asking to be elected to government. They cannot even sort anything out in eight weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70328-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07032878000154">Quite honestly, I think that the hon. Member for East Devon has spent 50 per cent. of his time trying to dig himself out of a hole that he dug in his comments on 30 January. Does he want me to give way? I am offering to do so. I think that he has been trying to justify his actions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o374"><a name="07032878000158"><a name="70328-0019.htm_spnew11"><a name="07032878000875"><b>Mr. Swire:</b>
 If we are revealing conversations between a Minister and a shadow Minister, I think that it is only fair that I should reveal that in a previous conversation, the Secretary of State was all for letting her right hon. Friend the Minister conduct this entire debate, because she was so terrified that she was being hung out to dry by her Back Benchers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o375"><a name="07032878000159"><a name="70328-0019.htm_spnew12"><a name="07032878000876"><b>Mr. Caborn:</b>
 There are many things that the hon. Gentleman can accuse my right hon. Friend of, but running away from the Dispatch Box is not one of them. I can tell him that anybody who has got to work with my right hon. Friend knows that she does not run away from problems&#151;far from it. In fact, she has created a few problems for me from time to time, if I may say so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70328-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07032878000160">Let me return to some of the questions that were raised. On destination casinos, I remind the hon. Member for Ryedale of what he said in his report:</p>
<a name="70328-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="07032878000804"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Committee is minded to suggest that the term leisure destination casino more suitably describes the Government&#146;s proposals and reflects the Committee&#146;s thinking.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70328-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07032878000161">That is important, because there has been an argument about destination casinos. We worked in conjunction with the Joint Scrutiny Committee. I believe that we worked in concert, and that is why we got ourselves to this position. Nobody can deny that Manchester is a destination. It is the third most popular destination for inward-bound traffic in the United Kingdom, behind London and Edinburgh. In that sense, we worked with the Committee, and we were right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70328-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07032878000162">I say to my hon. Friends that I have seen some political opportunism in my years in the House, but going into the No Lobby tonight would underline the position of a not only opportunistic, but unprincipled and tarnished Opposition who have used one of the best manoeuvres that I have seen in the House in many years. I ask my hon. Friends not to give that lot credibility by going into the No Lobby tonight, as the Opposition will do so out of nothing more than political opportunism. I ask my hon. Friends please to think again. We should remember what three of the most senior members of the Opposition said several weeks ago. They have reversed that opinion and have produced a piece of political opportunism. I say one word to my hon. Friends: principles. I ask them to vote for the order.</p>

 The Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) will probably be feeling a sense of d&#233;j  vu, because it was almost a year ago that I called an Adjournment debate in the House on the same subject, and the hon. Lady was answering on behalf of the Government, as she will this evening. My reason for holding the debate last year was to raise local concerns about the performance of the local ambulance service, the then Gloucestershire ambulance trust, which has since merged to become part of the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07032878000721">Last year&#146;s debate followed a specific set of local incidents that highlighted the lack of ambulance cover in the Forest of Dean, which was of great concern to my constituents. We focused in particular on the trust&#146;s use of a matrix system to allocate resources, the result of which was to take ambulances out of the Forest of Dean and other rural parts of the county, and to focus on the urban centres of Gloucester and Cheltenham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07032878000722">Since then, one of my towns, Cinderford, has been given a higher priority in the matrix, which is a positive feature. Unfortunately, however, that has not improved ambulance response times in my constituency. In last year&#146;s debate, I expressed my concern about the impact of the merger on the services that would be delivered in rural areas, and the Minister said that the merger was occurring</p>
<a name="70328-0020.htm_brev14"><a name="07032878000819"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;against a background of weak performance in relation to response targets from all three trusts.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07032878000723">Most importantly, she went on to say:</p>
<a name="70328-0020.htm_brev15"><a name="07032878000820"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are confident that, while recognising the local issues, larger trusts will deliver a better, more responsive, more efficient service, which people have a right to expect.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 7 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 229-232WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07032878000724">Unfortunately, the position has got worse since then. In my constituency at that time, about 48 per cent. of category A responses&#151;that is, calls dealing with life-threatening cases&#151;hit the Government&#146;s eight-minute target. A few months later, at the time of the merger, that figure had gone up to 53 per cent. That was still pretty appalling, but at least it was better. Since the merger, the performance has worsened, and the figure is now only 45 per cent., which is unacceptable. When we compare the performance in my constituency with that of Gloucester and Cheltenham, we find that 85 per cent. of the responses in Gloucester and 82 per cent. of those in Cheltenham are within the target eight minutes. That disparity is unacceptable. My constituents pay their taxes just as those in the urban areas of the county do, and they deserve excellent services.</p>

Minister will be aware that I raised the matter at Prime Minister&#146;s Questions on 21 March. In response, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="70328-0020.htm_brev16"><a name="07032878000821"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In fairness to the ambulance and paramedic services in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, I think that he will find that they will tell him that they have improved considerably over the past few years. Massive investment is going into our ambulance services and paramedics, although of course we always have to improve on it.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 21 March 2007; Vol. 458,c. 810.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07032878000726">Unfortunately, performance is not improving, and I have written to the Prime Minister to point out that fact. I suggested that he might like to use the opportunity presented by this debate to set the parliamentary record straight, and the Minister now has the opportunity to do that. The Prime Minister&#146;s answer did not accurately characterise the situation. I am sure that that was inadvertent and due to the briefing that he had received, but it clearly did not accord with what the ambulance trust has said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07032878000727">To be fair, the ambulance trust is grappling with one of the issues that the Minister and I discussed in our debate last year, namely, the growth in the emergency call volume, which is rising by about 10 per cent. a year, and in the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust by about 13 per cent. I am not clear&#151;and, to be fair, I do not think that that trust is either&#151;about exactly what is driving those increases. It cannot be the case that we are suddenly experiencing many more emergencies. Indeed, I have received anecdotal reports from the paramedics that my constituents in the Forest of Dean are quite reluctant to call 999. On the whole, when they do so, they have a serious problem. They do not tend to call an ambulance at the drop of a hat or in inappropriate circumstances. The evidence that I have seen suggests that that happens less in my constituency than in the urban areas. I would like the Minister to tell the House why the Government think that the call volume is rising. If it carries on rising at 10 per cent. a year without any increase in resources, it will be difficult for the ambulance service to cope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07032878000728">Anecdotally, paramedics have suggested to me that the change in out-of-hours services&#151;whether real or perceived by constituents&#151;has led to an increase, particularly at night, in parents with sick children and people looking after elderly relatives in distress calling an ambulance because of the lack of a speedy alternative response. I would be interested to know whether the Government think that that analysis is accurate, and what they propose to do nationally to address the growing call volume.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07032878000729">Because of the difficult geography of Gloucestershire, with the River Severn running through the middle of it, the interaction between the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust and those operating in Wales is also an issue. In my constituency, Sedbury, which is the other side of the River Wye from Chepstow, is quite a long way from where the ambulances are based, and also has a significant number of emergency call targets missed. The area is difficult to cover from the rest of Gloucestershire, and I would be interested to know the extent to which liaison between the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust and the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust is possible and can be increased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07032878000730">To inform myself better, I spent a 12-hour shift with a paramedic crew last year. Watching their performance on the front line, I was impressed by the skill with which they handled calls, and by the effort that they put into responding quickly and safely to them. They are put into a difficult position when, through no fault of their own, they turn up after a significant period of time&#151;between 20 and 50 minutes&#151;and have to bear the brunt of the dissatisfaction of understandably distressed relatives or patients who expected the call to be answered more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07032878000731">Another issue raised last year was the extent to which savings would result from a merger of the three ambulance trusts, and whether that money would be available to invest in front-line services. The Minister will be aware that deficits in the NHS were a significant issue last year. My understanding is that some of the savings from management reductions, rather than being invested in the front line, have effectively been used to plug deficits. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70328-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07032878000732">The change undergone by the ambulance service has also had an impact on the feelings of ambulance staff, particularly in Gloucestershire. The evidence of meetings and letters, and of a blog that they have set up, suggests to me that a number of them are unhappy and disillusioned with the way in which the system is being managed. Let me share with the Minister one or two quotations from the staff blog, which, if she is interested, can be found at greatwesternambulance.blog.co.uk.</p>

They should enable faster response times by being based more locally in the forest.</p>

The scheme has been running for some time, and does not seem to have improved performance to any great extent. I support the idea, but my caveat is that it must be in addition to the existing service. It should not be used to replace ambulance cover where that is appropriate, and nor should it be used to massage the figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07032878000747">I turn now to performance measurement. The current system for measuring response times is misleading because it overstates, rather than understates, the ambulance trust&#146;s performance. That may be surprising, given the appalling performance that I have outlined but, at the moment, the clock starts running when three pieces of information have been received&#151;the nature of the complaint, the address of the patient, and a contact number.</p>

trust&#146;s performance. Most constituents start measuring the wait for an ambulance from the minute that they get through to the call centre after dialling 999. Although the new system will provide more realistic figures, the performance will look even worse than it does at present.</p>

whose condition or location prevents them from travelling easily to access health care services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07032878000757">We all appreciate that the sort of services that ambulances provide&#151;and others such as emergency care responders and community care responders&#151;are a long way from those that were available 20 years ago. People who need treatment want it to start as soon as the ambulance arrives. They do not necessarily want to wait until they get to hospital for treatment. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07032878000758">Clearly, resources are also important. Spending on ambulance services has increased, with ambulance trust expenditure reaching &#163;1.45 billion in 2005, compared with just under &#163;620 million in 1997. That is a rise of 135 per cent., which has helped improve services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07032878000759">The Government have set a standard that at least75 per cent. of all ambulance trust 999 calls from patients with immediate life-threatening conditions should have an ambulance respond to them in eight minutes. I am pleased to tell the House that the planned resources for the Forest of Dean area for 2007-08 will mean an increase in staff from 29 to 39 full-time equivalents. There will be an increase from three ambulances working 24/7 in 2006-07 to four daytime ambulances and two night-time ambulances in 2007-08. Six emergency care practitioners will also be provided. I hope that that shows that what I said in the previous debate about planning and using resources is happening. The plans will take effect from the next financial year, despite some of the challenges posed by deficits in the area. As we know, performance has improved over recent years, but we cannot be complacent. We also know that 98 per cent. of patients are overwhelmingly satisfied with the care that they receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07032878000760">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern that response times in his constituency to immediately life-threatening calls are currently too low. The Department collects data at trust level rather than by geographical area. Ambulance trust directions issuedin July 2006 required each trust to ensure that information in respect of its performance is recorded, collated and published for the trust and each of the trust's local areas. That ensures a level of not only transparency but accountability, which is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07032878000761">Our latest published figures for the trust indicate that, as at 2005-06, 74 per cent. of immediately life-threatening calls were met by the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust, but as the hon. Gentleman has said, the response rate in the Forest of Dean has been low. It appears that it has gone in a slightly different direction from the lower figures that he mentioned in the previous debate. However, there are plans to raise performance across Gloucestershire to the national target levels by September this year.</p>

 I was particularly concerned, having looked at the figures for the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust across the three areas&#151;Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Avon. The most worrying thing in the move between 2005-06 and 2006-07 is that the performance has deteriorated across category A, B and C areas. It does not seem that there is a problem just in the Forest of Dean. There is a problem across the trust in meeting its targets.</p>

 I am sure that those responsible for services in the area are mindful of that. That is why I would like to explore as part of my contribution what is taking place not just in the Forest of Dean but in the area as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07032878000764">The hon. Gentleman said that the new system under call-connect will give a greater sense of what is or is not happening at the most local level. Changes to clock start will be implemented from 1 April 2008. That is important. It will mean a better experience for patients, shorter waits for the phone to be answered and help to arrive and, I hope, improved outcomes, meaning more lives will be saved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07032878000765">Ambulance trusts have embarked on a programme of service improvement. I understand that the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust is changing its resource deployment. I mentioned earlier the increases in staff, ambulance provision and emergency care practitioners for the Forest of Dean, but of course that is being looked at across the trust as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para20"><a name="07032878000766">In rural areas the trust is moving to embedding ambulance practitioners within the Community, and I am advised that the Forest now has dedicated emergency care practitioner resources in Lydney. A second scheme is due to commence later in 2007 in Cinderford. Deployment of that type of resource allows for increasing numbers of patients to be treated nearer to home, avoiding long and unnecessary journeys to hospital. It also enhances the quality of the experience for the patient. Emergency care practitioners are also able to forge closer links with local general practitioners and community health teams further to enhance emergency and urgent care in communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para21"><a name="07032878000768">The changing model in urban areas will see increased use of ambulance practitioners as solo responders, deployed proactively to identify priority locations. That increase in solo capacity will reduce the need to utilise Forest-based resources in the urban areas. That point was of concern to the hon. Gentleman in the previous debate. I think that that has been taken on board as a way of improving and modernising services. That will support the improvement required in the Forest, as well as in the high-activity areas. That model has commenced in the past two weeks and has produced the anticipated improvement in response times, with Gloucestershire reporting over 75 per cent. for three consecutive days last week. Clearly, we cannot be complacent about those figures and we must recognise that there are still issues around the low performance rate in the Forest of Dean, but that indicates a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07032878000769">Resources are important. To support trusts with improvements such as those, the Department made&#163;25 million in capital available to trusts this year to enable them to fund service delivery and infrastructure changes to go further and faster in improving performance. Underpinning all that is a developing work force who are being used to the best effect, and who are at the very heart of realising true transformation in the way care is delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para23"><a name="07032878000770">Driving that forward requires a different blend of skills and experience. For some staff, that will involve change, but it is about recognising the changes that are necessary to deliver the best service for everyone, not forgetting that sometimes staff may need those services  <br>

and will want the best for themselves as patients, as well for the patients whom they serve. But again, contributing to that draws on the creativity of front-line staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para24"><a name="07032878000771">Community responders are clearly also a way of saving lives. New ways of working and modernisation can contribute to further improvement. Community responders are trained in basic life support and first aid and equipped with defibrillators. With emergency care practitioners, they can do more faster, and in some cases better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para25"><a name="07032878000772">In order to improve first response performance, the trust has launched two community responder schemes at Coleford and Lydney in partnership with Gloucestershire fire and rescue service. I am informed that those schemes went live on 6 December 2006. They are trained in special access techniques such as line rescue, which further enhances the joint capability within the Forest. I understand that community first responder teams have also continued to expand with a further 15 responders being trained this month. The two teams that I mentioned in my last speech have gone live in Cinderford and Newent, so I am pleased that something that I said last time round has actually happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para26"><a name="07032878000773">The trust is also concentrating on business and leisure facilities, as well as schools, in order to embed life-saving skills and automatic external defibrillators into these environments. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is a good way to consider how we can differently provide better services for the future, particularly in places such as the Forest of Dean. Community defibrillation officers in the former Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire area were awarded funding of &#163;90,000 over a three-year period, and received 201 automated external defibrillators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para27"><a name="07032878000774">The reconfiguration of ambulance trusts has meant that we are in a position to start accelerating planning and delivering a better service. It will give trusts the capacity and capability to improve standards and deliver world-class services. However, delivering change on the scale that is needed takes time. NHS ambulance trusts have more money than ever before with 135 per cent. more resources than in 1997. Now that the new management teams and structures are in place I am confident that services will improve. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will look in detail at what planning  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07032878000775">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the matrix system, which also came up in our last debate. That has proved helpful, but parts of it have clearly acted against some of his concerns, particularly about rural areas. An improved computer-aided dispatch system went live today and automatic vehicle location systems will come on line in June. That will provide better real time evidence about the volume of calls and the demands on different services, which will allow the planners better to match what is needed in different parts of his trust&#146;s area. Additional response cars have been provided in Gloucester and Cheltenham to support the matrix system and prevent resources from being constantly called out of the Forest of Dean. Again, that was a concern in our last debate, since when progress has been made, which I am pleased and reassured about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70328-0021.htm_para29"><a name="07032878000776">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that improvements have been made at both national and local level.

Gentleman to continue his support for his local NHS services in their commitment to deliver and maintain high quality service, and join with those who have to make the positive argument that change is not always bad.
