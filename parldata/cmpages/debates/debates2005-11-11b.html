<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51111-01_spnew0"><b> Mark Lazarowicz  (Edinburgh, North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I shall begin by declaring an interest. The Sustainable Energy Partnership has provided me with support in the preparation and development of the Bill. I also thank the 40&nbsp;or more organisations, too numerous to name, that have given their backing to the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Hon. Members across the House will know that climate change is probably the biggest issue we face in the world today. I do not propose to repeat the arguments and facts that are well known to Members across the Chamber. Although most Members and, increasingly, the general public recognise the extent of the problem we face in tackling climate change and many want to do something about it, I have often found that there is increasing defeatism about climate change precisely because it is such a big issue. People sometimes feel resigned to the idea that things will get worse and believe that as individuals they can do little about it. It is important to show them that they can do something and that, although it is essential to get action from Governments and at an international level, individuals can do something to help tackle climate change.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">My Bill seeks to link the action taken by the national Government and at an international level with the actions that can be taken by individual citizens&#151;measures that, taken together, can make a significant contribution to reducing emissions and tackling climate change. The Bill is basically about seeking to engage and recruit the public&#151;individuals, families and communities&#151;in that effort.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51111-01_spnew1"><b> Robert Key  (Salisbury) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way so soon. Does he agree that local authorities have a vital role to play? Some of them, including, I am sorry to say, my own district council, think that if there is a climate change problem, it has to do with sunspots and nothing to do with the intervention of man. Therefore, they are reluctant to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>support the Bill, a consequence of which will be increased expenditure by local councils. What would he say to my district council? How could he prove to it that there is a link, which it is not sure about, between mankind&#039;s intervention, rather than sunspots, and the climate change problem?
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51111-01_spnew2"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I suspect that the hon. Gentleman can persuade his district council about the reality more easily than I can, but my Bill will certainly place responsibilities on local authorities, so that they cannot escape from recognising that link and cannot fail to do something about it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51111-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 Is not part of the problem with the climate change debate that those of us who want action to be taken on environmental issues are depressed by the Government&#039;s record, because the fact is that carbon dioxide emissions were falling before they came to power and have been rising since?
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51111-01_spnew4"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a party political point, which he is entitled to do. I think that this Government&#039;s record in seeking to tackle climate change has been excellent, but I want us to work on an all-party basis on practical issues that can take the issue forward. I suggest that he concentrate on that aspect of the Bill today, rather than on other agendas.
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51111-01_spnew5"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the almost unique aspect of micro-generation is that it can give individuals responsibility to produce energy in their own homes? For example, they can have photovoltaic cells producing energy on the roof of their house. Virtually all traditional forms of energy production rely on large power stations many miles away from people&#039;s homes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51111-01_spnew6"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 Indeed. Had I waited a little longer to give way to my hon. Friend, I might have come to that particular section of my speech, which will now be somewhat shorter as a result. However, he makes a valuable point. Micro-generation, which is at the heart of the Bill, is simply the generation of energy&#151;heat or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electricity&#151;by individual householders or small groups of householders. That can of course include photovoltaic installations, micro-combined heat and power systems, micro-wind, heat pumps, solar thermal systems, fuel cells and micro-hydro systems. A range of systems can be installed in individual homes making it possible for individual householders or groups of householders to generate their own energy.

</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51111-01_spnew8"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I shall give way in a second if my hon. Friends will allow me to make a little progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The key point to bear in mind is that micro-generation has immense potential. It is not an activity that needs to be restricted to the select few or that applies only to certain parts of the country. The estimates from the most reputable scientific sources suggest that between 6&nbsp;million and 10&nbsp;million homes across the UK could be involved in micro-generation of some form. Clearly, for some communities and households, some technologies will be better than 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 585</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>others, but if we look at the whole package, micro-generation can make a major contribution to the country&#039;s energy needs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51111-01_spnew9"><b> Joan Walley  (Stoke-on-Trent, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the housing market renewal programme taking place throughout the country gives the Government a wonderful opportunity to ensure that what he is talking about is at the heart of new building, and the building of sustainable communities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51111-01_spnew10"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I agree absolutely. One of the advantages of micro-generation is that as well as contributing to the country&#039;s energy needs, it can help to tackle fuel poverty. If houses can produce their own energy and make maximum use of energy efficiency and energy conservation devices, people on low incomes will gain more from that. Particularly in rural areas, where houses are not linked to the grid, micro-generation has a real part to play&#151;although that also applies to the larger urban areas, of course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51111-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 It would be helpful for the House if the hon. Gentleman could put this in context. Has he made any estimate of the contribution that micro-generation, even at the top end of his estimate&#151;the 10&nbsp;million homes&#151;would make to total energy generation in this country? That figure would help us to put the idea in perspective.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51111-01_spnew12"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are a whole range of estimates, but it has been suggested that the proportion could be as high as 10&nbsp;per cent. I am not sure whether I would go as far as that, but micro-generation can certainly make a substantial contribution to the country&#039;s energy needs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51111-01_spnew13"><b> Mrs. Janet Dean  (Burton) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend mentioned rural areas. Does he see a role for parish and town councils in bringing communities together to try to develop micro-generation schemes?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51111-01_spnew14"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 Indeed I do. Part of my Bill deals with the promotion of what is described as &quot;community energy&quot;. I shall come to that part later, and I hope that it will meet some of my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Micro-generation and micro-power types of technology have clear economic and environmental advantages, but the market is small, which makes it less viable than it should be for households that wish to take advantage of that technology to do so, and for companies to invest in the technology necessary to manufacture micro-power units. The problem is that the installation costs of micro-generation can be quite high, and the payback period is relatively long. That makes micro-generation a niche product, available only to the better-off&#151;although even now, prices are coming down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Opinion across the industry and in the non-governmental organisations is that we need to get into a virtuous circle, in which prices come down so that the market increases in size, which would lead to further reductions in the price of the product so that we can really take advantage of the potential of micro-generation.
</p>

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51111-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend mentioned companies and manufacturing. Does he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>agree that the Bill gives us the opportunity to come to the aid of a beleaguered manufacturing industry? Renewable energy technologies are labour-intensive, and international concern about climate change would provide huge opportunities for export markets, too.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51111-02_spnew1"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 Absolutely. One of the things that I have found out in working on the Bill, as I have developed my own research and organisations have contacted me, is how extensive employment in the renewables sector is already. I suspect that if they inquire, most Members will find that tens or even hundreds of people in their constituency are already involved in the industry in some way. The reality is now large, and the potential is even larger.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51111-02_spnew2"><b> Andrew Selous  (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this country will have the moral authority to tackle India and China and encourage them to reduce their carbon emissions only if we can turn round the situation here? Does he agree that clause 2&nbsp;of his Bill is a good way of bringing that about?
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51111-02_spnew3"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I certainly support clause 2&nbsp;of my Bill! Yes, we must ensure that we meet our international targets if we are to call on others to do the same. The hon. Gentleman also highlights another opportunity&#151;the fact that there is a market out there which could be immense, and which we could take advantage of if we had a strong domestic micro-generation market on which we could build export potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">We need a kick-start for the micro-generation industry in the United Kingdom. That is an important feature of my Bill, as well as of another Bill to be debated later; I must not speak about it at this stage, but it too will have a bearing on this issue. The essential element in my Bill is that by setting targets to encourage the installation of micro-generation we would give a clear signal to the market and the industry that the Government are serious about micro-generation. The industry would then put in the investment to allow prices to come down, and create the virtuous circle of price reduction and greater take-up. The Government have already made a good start, with a micro-generation consultation, and the Bill will allow us to build on that in the most effective way.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51111-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again; he has been very generous, and I agree with what he is saying. In my part of the world, one of the schemes that I have strongly supported is hydroelectric micro-generation. However, some of the people who have brought water mills into use and contribute a very small amount of energy to the grid, as well as supplying their own needs, are now concerned that they might be assessed for non-domestic rates on that small production. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister could put their minds at rest by clearly stating that such schemes will not be assessed for business rates, so that there will not be a further disincentive to installing them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51111-02_spnew5"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I have heard of that concern, and it would be extremely unfortunate if there were a disincentive to micro-generation as a result of that feature of the local rating system.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 587</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_7">That leads me to the next point about micro-generation in the Bill. One of the measures is designed to make it easier for householders and groups of householders who produce electricity by micro-generation to sell to National Grid. This is not just a question of individuals&#039; own energy needs; in some cases, surplus energy will be produced. That can be sold on, which makes the cost of installation more viable. Clearly, it is important that there should not be disincentives such as the hon. Gentleman described. Some electricity is already being sold back to the grid, but I understand that there are difficulties in certain areas, and the Bill will address those.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51111-02_spnew6"><b> David Lepper  (Brighton, Pavilion) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I represent a constituency where there is a great deal of interest in renewable energy, but many of my constituents who are most interested in it live in conservation areas. My hon. Friend has talked about the importance of households and groups of households taking forward what is proposed. Does he agree that it is important that the Minister for Energy, who is on the Front Bench at the moment, should liaise with the Minister for Housing and Planning, who has been in the Chamber this morning already, to examine the regulations that may be putting obstacles in the way of the developments that he suggests?
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51111-02_spnew7"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and I am sure that it has been heard by the Ministers responsible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51111-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Nick Hurd  (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his Bill. Does he acknowledge that there is a structural problem with the payback on investment in micro-generation, in that we have a habit of moving home regularly? Will he share with the House any views that he might have on the level of Government support required to bring the costs of the technology down to offset that factor?
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51111-02_spnew9"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I shall have to decline the hon. Gentleman&#039;s invitation, because to do so would take more time than I would want to spend on that subject today. It probably relates to a Bill to be dealt with later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_8">The key point of my Bill is to bring about reductions in the price of the technology by promoting the mass market. Many measures need to be brought into play to allow micro-generation to take off. My Bill concentrates on the target, the link to the grid and the ability of those who make use of micro-generation to get green energy certificates, which are especially important in making the installation of the technology viable for households for which it would not otherwise be viable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51111-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Peter Ainsworth  (East Surrey) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing this important Bill before the House. Does he agree that, if micro-renewables are to make the contribution that we all want, it is important to have stability in respect of a Government framework behind them and consistency of policy and funding? What does the hon. Gentleman make of the recent changes announced by the Department of Trade and Industry towards the funding of micro-renewables and the time scale over which it is likely to be provided?
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51111-02_spnew11"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that consistency is important, but if he does not mind, I 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 588</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>shall have to decline his invitation to comment on areas of policy that, though relevant to my Bill, would take us down a much longer road. I agree, however, that consistency is important and having targets allows us to show the industry and consumers that we have a clear strategy over a period of time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51111-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Andrew Dismore  (Hendon) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that, when it comes to practical action on the ground, cities are very much centre stage? Does he welcome the Mayor of London&#039;s initiative to launch a dedicated London climate change agency, which will work in partnership with the private sector to tackle greenhouse gas emissions in London? That is particularly important for the Olympics in 2012, as we want to ensure that the project is sustainable both environmentally and socially.
</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51111-02_spnew13"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 Indeed, the Mayor&#039;s initiative is remarkable and provides lessons for other cities and communities throughout the UK. It is important, however, to ensure that opportunities are available for all types of communities&#151;from rural areas to urban areas and the largest cities. My Bill is thus designed to encourage the development of community schemes whereby local communities can set up their own renewable energy systems that give them a stake in local energy projects. Such projects are more likely to be accepted than if they are viewed as being imposed on communities from outside. Communities can sometimes be unhappy about certain aspects of those developments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51111-02_spnew14"><b> Andrew Stunell  (Hazel Grove) (LD):</b> 
 I strongly support the Bill, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that this is not a London or city-centric issue. To my knowledge, some 21&nbsp;local authorities&#151;including my own of Stockport, which is also represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)&#151;have expressed strong support for the Bill. There is considerable support for the Bill among the local government community as well as here in Parliament.
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51111-02_spnew15"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and for his support. I am pleased that local authorities throughout the UK have contacted me to express their support for my Bill.

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51111-02_spnew16"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 My hon. Friend was dealing with community energy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) said, the Bill provides a good opportunity for rural areas that are not on the gas mains to avoid being compelled to buy oil for their heating. They will now have access to renewable energy for their community energy systems.
</p>

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51111-03_spnew0"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b>

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51111-03_spnew3"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and congratulate him on introducing the Bill. It represents an important step in ensuring that we try to meet our Kyoto commitments. He was just talking about the benefits for rural areas and earlier he mentioned the economic and employment benefits of promoting the renewable sector. I particularly welcome the Bill&#039;s commitment to renewable heat. If we can promote renewable heat in rural areas, it will also provide an outlet for farming communities that are having to make a transition in their economic activities. It is also important for the forestry industry, which faces the economic problem of what to do with the &quot;thinnings&quot;. That problem is undermining the good management of the forestry, so I greatly welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s attempts to promote renewable heat.
</p>








<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51111-03_spnew4"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. One of the clauses indeed enables the Secretary of State to introduce a renewable heat obligation. The hon. Gentleman is right about the immense potential of renewable heat in rural as well as urban areas. It can play an important role in combined heat and power, for example. Given the very welcome renewable fuel obligation announced by the Government yesterday, it is appropriate for a renewable heat obligation to be the third pillar of the package. It could make a huge difference.
</p>








<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51111-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 I particularly commend the hon. Gentleman for his words on community ownership and community benefit. He will be aware of the Viking Energy project in Shetland, which is a significant community development of significant scale. However, it risks being thwarted by the transmission charging regime operated by Ofgem. The cap in energy legislation is not proving to be adequate in practice. The Bill could be a vehicle for an amendment to the Energy Act 2004. Has the hon. Gentleman heard from the Government whether they would be prepared to support such an amendment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_39"><a name="51111-03_spnew6"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 It is for the Minister to speak for the Government, but I am pleased to say that the Department has approached me about using the Bill as a vehicle for dealing with part of that problem. I hope that it will prove possible to do so. The issue is important not just to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s community, but to the whole of the UK. Evidence shows that the Scottish islands could contribute as much as 1&nbsp;per cent. of the country&#039;s entire energy needs if the renewable sector fully reached its potential.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing his Bill before Parliament. On the renewable energy clauses, has he made any assessment of the contribution that biomass could make to increasing the market for bioethanol products in this country? Our position on that is very low compared with the United States, for example. Clearly, another element of the Bill can contribute to the diversification of work available in rural areas.
</p>

 I am in my place to support the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Bill today. He is discussing the renewable heat obligation, which is by far the most controversial and most complex aspect of the Bill. Progress cannot possibly be made without Government support. Has the hon. Gentleman heard from the Department of Trade and Industry about its attitude to that particular measure?
</p>








<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51111-03_spnew10"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I have had an indication, but let us see what the Minister says about that. The debate about how best to progress renewable heat obligations is still ongoing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51111-03_spnew11"><b> John Hemming  (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</b> 
 One difficulty is the fact that the Inland Revenue frequently seeks additional sources of revenue. From time to time I have heard about the possibility of the Revenue obtaining national non-domestic rates from domestic micro-generation. I note that one clause deals with fiscal incentives, but one hopes that the Bill will also deal with preventing fiscal disincentives, perhaps looking for a threshold level at which generation rates become free.
</p>








<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51111-03_spnew12"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a very important point. If I can make some progress, I may be able to say a few words about that part of the Bill later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_9">I want to deal with community ownership. The United Kingdom has an opportunity to take advantage of developments that are already evident in other parts of Europe. In Denmark, for example, 50&nbsp;per cent. of the country&#039;s wind power capacity is owned by individuals or co-operatives. Similarly large schemes exist in Austria and Germany&#151;and even in the US. We should try to promote community energy here in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-03_para1">
<a name="stpa_10">As I said in reply to earlier interventions, the Bill is designed to promote renewable heat, but it also recognises that micro-generation must be part of a wider agenda and overall Government policy. That is why the Bill has 12&nbsp;important clauses that place a duty on the Government. The first relates to maximising the use of fiscal incentives. We have already seen a number of valuable measures in that respect, but a whole array of&nbsp;measures could further encourage energy efficiency and micro-generation. They include council tax rebates for householders who install energy-saving devices, stamp duty rebates for house purchasers, measures to encourage the purchase of energy conservation materials for houses, and so forth. Many measures could be taken and it is important to examine them collectively across government. That is what the Bill is designed to do.

 The hon. Gentleman is being generous in giving way and I am delighted to be able to support his Bill today.

One of the big attractions of micro-generation is that, because electricity generation takes place far closer to where the electricity is actually used, it automatically improves efficiency of energy delivery.

<a name="stpa_17">The Government&#039;s climate change review, coming up shortly, gives them an opportunity to recognise what has gone right and what has gone wrong, to take stock and to come forward with measures that may differ from what they have advocated before in order to meet the Kyoto target this country has set itself and the domestic target of a 20&nbsp;per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions. They will not do that successfully if they rely on pulling the same levers as they have used in recent years. Without wishing to appear partisan on a non-partisan Bill, I may say that it is a matter of fact that carbon emissions are rising in this country, and we therefore need a step change in how we approach them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_18">The Bill successfully and innovatively challenges the basis on which energy is delivered in this country. Hitherto, energy has been about big sources of power in certain strategic locations, with huge swathes of power lines taking power from those sources to where it is needed elsewhere in the country. That has been the case with coal-fired power stations, oil-fired stations and nuclear stations, and the same principle is, arguably, being applied to wind farms. The Bill rightly turns that on its head, saying that there is a better way to meet our energy needs in the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">One way to do that is undoubtedly energy efficiency; that is, in an over-used clich&#233;, the low-hanging fruit yet to be picked by the Government. A huge amount could be done to tackle carbon emissions if we had a sensible energy efficiency strategy. Another way to deal with it would be to promote micro-generation. It makes no sense to have an electricity grid, with all the investment that requires and with power lines stretched across the country, simply to meet winter peak demand. That energy grid is simply not being used at capacity, except on a few occasions over the year. Yet we carry on building the grid, building power lines and disfiguring the country with pylons.

Some 3.5&nbsp;per cent. is lost in transmission and distribution, leaving 35&nbsp;per cent. that actually gets somewhere, of which 13&nbsp;per cent.&#151;roughly a third&#151;is wasted through inefficient end use.

 Action to tackle climate change is a vital global challenge and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) on introducing the Bill. I am very pleased to be listed as one of its supporters and I hope&#151;the signs are encouraging&#151;that it will have enough support from other hon.

<a name="stpa_25">As we have heard, the Bill would encourage and facilitate domestic micro-generation, the promotion of community energy, and the development of a renewable heat obligation. All that makes very good environmental sense and very good economic sense, but I want to say a word on why it also makes such good political sense. That is not only because it responds to a growing concern among many of our constituents that if climate change is really such a threat, we should do more about it. It is also because people are enthusiastic to do more about it in their everyday lives.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51111-06_spnew5"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has had an opportunity to open his post this morning. I have of course opened mine, as I do every morning, and studied it carefully. By coincidence in today&#039;s post, I received the results of a survey conducted by MORI on behalf of EDF which asked what the most important issues were for the people of this country. Global warming and climate change came a poor seventh in the list. I point that out because I do not want the House to run away with the idea that everybody has global warming and climate change at the top of their personal agendas: they do not.
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51111-06_spnew6"><b> Mr. Smith: </b> 
 One can draw whatever conclusions one wants from surveys that arrive in the post. All I can say is that in my regular street surgeries in Oxford, one of the main issues raised recently was not the Terrorism Bill, nor even the NHS or education, but climate change, the importance of plastics recycling and the environment in general. In my surveys of young voters in particular&#151;I am sure that other hon. Members have had similar experiences&#151;climate change, and the need for more local action, are consistently some of the top issues raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_26">It is crucial that such matters be not left to G8&nbsp;summits and world conferences, but that people see what they can do in their own homes and neighbourhoods. Micro-generation enables people to think globally and act locally. I am pleased that the Bill includes a duty on the Secretary of State to promote community energy. In Oxfordshire, at Watchfield, we have an exciting project to build Westhill wind farm&#151;the first in south-east England. One of the reasons it will be the first is the difficulty that community renewable energy schemes face. Projects with a capacity below 5&nbsp;MW and a significant community buy-in are unattractive to conventional developers, who prefer the wholesale energy market. Advice and risk finance are difficult to obtain. The Bill will help by allowing the Secretary of State to allocate funds to promote investment in community energy schemes and provide them with advice. A lot could be achieved with modest amounts of money including, for example, for grants that could be repaid by successful schemes.
</p>

<a name="51111-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_27">A conference will be hosted in Oxford next April&#151;the world&#039;s solar cities conference&#151;where local authorities and local initiatives across the world will share ideas and expertise. I hope colleagues will encourage constituents to take part, and I shall circulate details. It would be great if delegates from the UK were able to tell others what a boost progress on the Bill is giving micro-generation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_28">If we are to give the Bill a Second Reading, we need to keep our remarks brief so I shall mention only a couple of barriers that I am glad that the measure addresses. Obtaining green energy certificates for micro-generation can still be difficult and expensive. In some cases renewable obligations certificates cost more than a micro-generator is worth. Ofgem should tackle the regulatory burden of the certificates by making them accessible for the householder, so that micro-generators can benefit from Government support for renewables. I welcome the provisions that would minimise the cost and administrative burdens of domestic micro-generation.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_29">Like community energy schemes, micro-generation suffers from the structure of the traditional energy market. Unlike large generators, householders are not in a position to undertake complex commercial negotiations with energy suppliers. I especially welcome clause 7, which takes a crucial step forward in requiring energy suppliers to offer to buy micro-generated energy from householders at the market rate. Household energy generation would be put on the same terms as household energy supply&#151;a straightforward and commonsense approach which empowers consumers who are producers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_30">Taken together, those steps and other aspects of the measure would ensure that micro-generation makes a significant contribution to hitting the 10&nbsp;per cent. target for energy from renewable sources by 2010. As other Members have pointed out, the Bill offers real opportunities to address fuel poverty, as well as benefits to poor countries through technology transfer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_31">In conclusion, climate change, energy conservation and sustainable energy are vitally important, as more and more of our constituents recognise. This is a crucial time for taking the decisions and action necessary to determine how to meet our commitments on climate change and put the future of UK energy production on a sustainable basis. The Bill tackles regulatory and financial barriers that hold back community energy and the potential of micro-generation. It will promote sustainable energy, improve community involvement and encourage people to save energy. Passing the measure will help to ensure that climate change and sustainable energy are at the very top of the political agenda. Its provisions are good for the environment, good for the economy and will enable people to combat global danger with local action. I commend the Bill to the House.

 I add my support for the Bill. I have received more letters on climate change than on any other subject.

I commend the students and their head of geography, Mrs. Christine Lunt, who lobbied me on climate change on their own initiative, not in response to any campaign. As the right hon.

<a name="stpa_32">I am disappointed that we should be forced to discuss these issues in private Members&#039; time. If the Government were really serious about tackling climate change, they would have already adopted the proposals in the Bill and presented their own legislation to the House in Government time. It is disappointing not only that we are retreating on our carbon emissions targets, but that the Government have yet to demonstrate that they are taking the issue seriously. The Bill&#039;s proposal that the Government come to the House once a year to present a report on how they are tackling carbon emissions would be a welcome addition to the transparency of the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_33">I am particularly excited by the idea of extending renewable obligation certificates to individual householders to export their electricity to the local distribution network. That could become the new green pound. It would not force people to take up micro-generation but would act as a powerful financial incentive for those who wanted to implement such schemes. Once the idea caught on, it could become extremely popular. The Bill has tremendous potential to help our local farming communities, many of whom in the Kettering constituency have written to me on the subject. Farmers could grow crops to turn into electricity that would supply local communities.

 I want to make a few points, but first I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) on such a good Bill. In his remarks, he concentrated on micro-generation, but I want to say something about the renewable heat obligation, as it is a vital part of the Bill.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_35">I am aware that Sir Ben Gill&#039;s taskforce recently came out against renewable heat obligation, but I also note that the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended such an obligation. Furthermore, as I mentioned in an intervention, a report from the Scottish Executive showed that biomass could not only contribute to reducing climate change, but create about 2,000&nbsp;jobs in rural areas of Scotland. Our farming and forestry industries face tough times so that would give them an important boost.

<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 602</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>can only be described as glowing&#151;the first time it has ever done so for a Government policy. That just goes to show what those obligations can do for industry in rural areas, in England as well as in Scotland. The renewable heat obligation would not only tackle climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but would stimulate the biomass industry and help with energy security. We worry about having to get supplies of gas from places such as Kazakhstan and Russia, and we worry that coming winters may be extremely cold; the measure would do more to assure energy security with supplies from small-scale developments in our own nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_37">The Bill mentions fuel poverty, although not in great detail. A worrying thing in Scotland is that a rising number of people are suffering fuel poverty as the cost of energy increases. All the energy companies recently announced high hikes in both gas and electricity prices, which puts thousands more Scots, and other people in the UK, in fuel poverty. Renewable fuel obligations would help to diversify energy supply and thus tackle fuel poverty. However, when considering all such schemes, we must bear in mind the fact that costs are important. To reduce fuel poverty, we must reduce the cost of electricity to consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_38">We should not get carried away by micro-generation. Renewable energy also means that we have to feed into the national grid. The Minister will not be surprised to hear me mention transmission charges; my colleagues and I have tackled him on that subject on many occasions, going back to the Standing Committee on the Energy Act 2004. It is something that we are very concerned about, because the transmission charge regime proposed by Ofgem will be a huge detriment to the development of renewable energy in the north of Scotland&#151;an area that is particularly suited to the development of renewable energy. The 10-year cap is too short to allow a payback on many of these developments, and of course they only get the full 10&nbsp;years if they are up and running when the cap comes into being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_39">This is a serious issue. I know that the matter is out to consultation. I do not expect that the Minister will have anything to say about that today, but it is an important arm in dealing with renewable energy. The Bill will go a long way to help the provision of renewable energy, but there must be action on transmission charges to ensure that we get the benefit from the massive potential from wind, wave and tidal power that there is in Scotland, and which may well be crippled by the transmission charge regime that is currently proposed.

 My hon. Friend knows my concern&#151;we discussed it earlier. The Braintree scheme is admirable, but there are parts of the country where, owing to the nature of historic building construction, many householders do not have the option of installing cavity wall or similar types of insulation. If a local authority, on its own initiative, offers a council tax rebate to those householders who install insulation, those householders get a double benefit&#151;they save some fuel costs and they get their council tax rebate. However, without support from the centre, that council tax rebate is effectively funded by other members of the community who are not fortunate enough to be able to make the energy saving. Will my hon. Friend address that point?
</p>








<p><a name="st_108"><a name="51111-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Newmark: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I believe that the scheme extends to loft insulation, as well. Councils throughout the land are increasingly having what we would all refer to as green agendas, and that scheme is very much part and parcel of an excellent green agenda for Braintree council.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, and the intervention on him was particularly interesting. He mentioned loft insulation. Does he accept that thatched cottages offer tremendous insulation? He will have noticed, for example, that when there is snowfall, the snow evaporates quite quickly from conventional tiled houses, whereas it remains on thatch. Could it not be argued that there ought to be some financial incentive for people with thatched houses, too?

The science is clear that climate change is happening and that it is being affected by man&#039;s intervention, but there is a point that gets less coverage. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) for drawing to my attention the very excellent report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs entitled, &quot;The Economics of Climate Change&quot;, which I have had the opportunity to study in detail. The Select Committee draws attention to the fact that although climate change no doubt exists, the conversations about it and policy making are very much focused on the environment and science and have, to date, paid much less attention to the costs of climate changes and of the many measures that can be taken to deal with it.

 Just before we were very valuably interrupted, I was touching on Government energy policy. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith said that he would not go as far as to suggest that 10&nbsp;per cent. of our energy capacity should come from micro-generation, but a number of us are concerned by what will happen to our other generating capacity. No doubt, the Minister for Energy will comment on that. Something like 23&nbsp;per cent. of our energy needs are supplied by nuclear power and many in the House will know that that figure will fall tremendously over the next 20&nbsp;years.

Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) drew attention and who have taken part in community micro-generation and driven up renewable energy generation in this country, will be disappointed if fossil fuel generation comes in to fill the gap because decisions are not taken about the renewal of our nuclear capacity. That would negate all the work that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith suggests that we do. I hope that the Minister will comment on where the Government&#039;s review of energy policy has reached and when he might bring forward to the House thoughts on where the Government stand, particularly on their plans for nuclear generation and whether they see that as having a role. The cross-party Committee that drew up their lordships report said:

<a name="stpa_59">The only technical point that I shall make relates to something that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said. Many Members have drawn attention to the range of technology solutions that are referred to in the Lords Committee&#039;s report. Table 8&nbsp;on page 46&nbsp;contains a whole list of emission-reducing technologies that Professor Dennis Anderson of Imperial college, London, has put together. It refers to a whole range of things, including the biofuels that have been mentioned by hon. Members and the photovoltaic solutions that are possible in micro-generation. The report says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Given the wide array of potential technologies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we are surprised that the Government&#039;s Energy White Paper should place such emphasis on just one technology, wind energy.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the breadth of energy solutions that the Government are considering. What contribution does he think that micro-generation could make to our total energy requirement and how does the cost of that compare with other solutions?

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="51111-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Is my hon. Friend convinced that the costings of all the alternative methods of producing energy, such as the building and maintenance of windmills and the production of photovoltaic cells and their disposal after their working life, have been fully considered?

 My right hon. Friend makes a very good point. I do not think that that has been done. One of the concerns that their lordships raise comes down to the public&#039;s scepticism about politicians. If we do not run through all the solutions, include all the costs and have a full and frank discussion with the public about the costs of climate change and of dealing with it, their lordships argue:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;Ultimately, a public that is not adequately informed may react adversely to the discovery that more and more cost burdens will fall on them, and on their children, in the name of warming control.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_61">Their lordships refer briefly to the fuel protests in 1999&nbsp;and 2000&nbsp;as an illustration of what happens and how sensitive the public are to even relatively modest increases in the cost of energy. I hope that the Minister will give us an idea of how the Government see the costs of energy panning out over the next few years and how the proposals in the Bill might impact on that.

<p>
<a name="51111-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_62">Having dwelt for a few moments on climate change and the thoughts of their lordships, I now want to turn to the Bill and make a couple of comments about it. The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) referred to targets in his speech and my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked him whether a strategy of having targets and reports had been very effective. I am a little more sceptical than the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith about the likely success of such a strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_63">The most important provision in the Bill appears in clause 2&nbsp;on an &quot;Annual report on greenhouse gas emissions&quot;. Clause 2(1) lays

<a name="stpa_64">That just asks the Prime Minister to lay before the House a report, even though, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has suggested, the Government are past masters at producing reports, documents, working parties and all sorts of other groups. When difficult decisions need to be taken in local government, we know that they set up a report under an eminent person. When the report is produced and a tricky decision is needed&#151;I am sure that decisions on climate change will be the same&#151;yet another report under the same eminent person is commissioned and the issue is kicked into the long grass. Just asking the Prime Minister to produce a report without imposing any further duties on him is an excuse to lay before the House lots of documents and hot air, with not much progress being made towards the targets.

I understand why the Government might be attracted to the concept of setting a national target and having every local authority in the land set a local target. However, nationally and locally driven targets have not been remarkably successful in any other area. The centre can be too prescriptive about its targets, and if such targets were to drive people in one way or another, despite the rapid pace of technological change, valuable changes in generational technology could be missed because people would be sent off in a different direction. Given the lack of success of Government targets in other areas, I am a little sceptical about the targets in the Bill.

 I briefly remind my hon. Friend that the beauty of Braintree district council&#039;s proposal is that it is inexpensive and simple and has an immediate pay-back. One pays &#163;170&nbsp;for the insulation and the energy savings are approximately &#163;100&nbsp;per annum, so there is pay-back in less than two and a half years. The amount that is paid is not so expensive. We need a general broad set of targets, perhaps set by Government, and a light regulatory touch coupled with strong fiscal incentives.

<p><a name="st_131"><a name="51111-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point but he slightly misunderstands my point. I was not talking about his scheme but considering the burden on local authorities. Braintree council&#039;s scheme gives a council tax rebate. The problem is that, if a local authority gives, without support from the centre, a rebate to one citizen, it is a burden on all the other citizens in the local authority area. If we burden local authorities and do not support them through central Government grant, thus driving up council tax, that will be detrimental to those in the poorest communities. They may find that they have even less spare funds available to purchase necessary fuel. Perhaps the Minister for Energy would like to comment on that later.

If we made a success of the approach that we are discussing, and millions of people throughout the country had their own micro-generation capacity and produced electricity that they wished to sell back to electricity companies, the Bill obliges the energy companies to purchase the energy at market rate. Hon. Members of all parties have welcomed that. I have a concern, which the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) also mentioned, about transmission charges.

 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. One of the key points about the Bill is that, for it to work, consumers must be able to offset some of their energy costs with the revenue that they get from producing surplus electricity and selling it back to electricity companies. That works only if some of the costs involved are not borne by those consumers. If, consequently, we load lots of costs on to electricity companies, which they have to pass on to other consumers, some consumers might be a little more entrepreneurial than others, participate in the excellent local schemes and thus benefit&#151;the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith said that six to 10&nbsp;million homes might benefit from the measure.

I am always a little suspicious when a group of business people gets together to make joint statements.

<a name="stpa_79">It is a little unusual for Labour Members to be willing to give protected markets and guaranteed returns to business people who can then invest substantial sums at no risk.

It is unreasonable that that requirement impacts on all suppliers, however small, and forces them to diversify into the supply of renewable energy. I counsel caution in applying that provision too widely.

<a name="stpa_83">The technology involved in micro-generation offers a wide range of opportunities to contribute to what is arguably the most important of all global challenges. On thermal heating, household wind turbines, and fuel cells&#151;to name just some of the technologies available&#151;the Bill can make a real impact through the encouragement that its measures offer householders.

<a name="stpa_84">It is not just the technology that appeals to me. There is plenty of evidence in my constituency that the public take their responsibilities to the environment very seriously. That is why the local authority that covers my constituency has the highest levels of household recycling of any metropolitan authority, and it is why the constituents to whom I speak are eager to do even more to conserve energy and protect the environment. The measures in the Bill would tap into the enthusiasm and commitment of the public in a positive way, and in a way that simply does not exist at present. The Bill offers carrots to the public and sticks to the Government, because it is clear that this Government and Governments across the world need to move more quickly on this most important matter.

<p>
<a name="51111-11_para16">
<a name="stpa_93">There has been lots of talk, but not much effective action. Despite the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003&nbsp;and the energy White Paper of February 2003, carbon dioxide, pre-eminent among greenhouse gases, has increased since 1997&nbsp;by 4.7&nbsp;per cent. Since the introduction in 2001of the climate change levy, which was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have seen greenhouse gas emissions increase. The Kyoto protocol requires us to ensure that our greenhouse gas emissions are 12.5&nbsp;per cent. below 1990&nbsp;levels. Considering that the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, his high profile and the importance that he attaches to climate change, it is only right and proper that he should present to the House the annual report on greenhouse gas emissions and his Government&#039;s policy.

<a name="stpa_96">This Bill reiterates the need for the Secretary of State to produce a strategy, and requires that the Secretary of State make an annual report to the House about the progress of the micro-generation strategy produced. Like the Prime Minister&#039;s report that the Bill advocates, the Secretary of State&#039;s report will serve to make the Government more accountable to Parliament for both their successes and their failures. This Bill goes further than section 82&nbsp;of the Energy Act 2004, as it makes statutory provisions for the Secretary of State to set targets for the take-up of micro-generation in Great Britain. The stability for the industry that such a target would offer could reduce prices by as much as 50&nbsp;per cent.&#151;those statistics come from the hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh, North and Leith. Microgeneration has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;huge advantages. The Sustainable Development Commission argues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;Microgeneration technologies, in particular micro-renewables, have the potential to make a significant and prolonged contribution to efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is hard to envisage a scenario whereby on-site generation of both electricity and heat will not play a major part in future energy supply.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_97">The locality and individual input of micro-generation demonstrates further advantages for its use. The fact that it sources energy locally means that on-site electricity generation substantially reduces the transmission losses that can account for 7&nbsp;per cent. of total output. That information comes from the Sustainable Development Commission and answers some of the questions from Members who spoke of the loss through the National Grid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">Microgeneration plainly has economic and environmental advantages. It empowers individuals to make a visible impact on climate change. Research has confirmed that when individuals are using micro-generation, their awareness of the environment and energy use increases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">In October 2005, the Sustainable Consumption Roundtable reported:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;The installation of microgeneration had a profound effect on many individuals across the samples, in homes and schools. Instead of being invisible and unengaging, they could now see the creative process of energy being made and powering their buildings. The emotional benefits from the energy, such as warmth, comfort, light, entertainment, cooking and cleanliness, were now strongly associated with the energy source and made people feel good about their own technology.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="stpa_102">Clause 7&nbsp;will enable consumers to sell the surplus energy that they produce back to the grid. That economic incentive should prompt more people to install micro-generation. I believe that there are already plans to use hydropower energy production on the River Thames to meet about a third of the energy demands of Windsor castle, and there are individual projects such as those on the River Stour in Dorset. There is, however, a massive lack of Government support for those measures.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;Since 2003, we have seen two primary initiatives aimed at encouraging the installation of microgeneration technology&#151;Clear Skies2, and the Major PV Demonstration Programme&#151;but the extent of these programmes has been limited, with total funding over four years of around &#163;42.5m. This has helped to create a domestic solar PV installation industry (and the UK&#039;s first manufacturing plant in Wales), and has dramatically increased the growth of other microrenewables. But it has not led to the creation of mass-market status, and in most cases microgeneration companies are small, and operate in a niche market.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_104">I hope that the Minister will talk more about the Clear Skies 2&nbsp;programme. He shook his head following an intervention about the time lag and the continuity of the programmes. If he has some good things to say I shall be grateful, because he needs to explain why the micro-generation industry is not happy and has been complaining.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_105">Our economy is the second largest in Europe, yet the United Kingdom accounts for only 2&nbsp;per cent. of Europe&#039;s installed thermal capacity.

At the end of 2004, our installed capacity of photovoltaic energy production represented a mere 8.2&nbsp;MWe out of an EU total of 410.5&nbsp;MWe.

<a name="stpa_116">When we talk about micro-generation, we are talking about a range of technologies: solar power to heat water and produce electricity; harnessing the wind through individual micro-wind turbines; and using the earth&#039;s heat to heat our homes through ground source heat pumps. Energy efficiency involves a closely related family of measures, including, as was confirmed today, the thatched cottage, and it was useful to be reminded of that important example by the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant). We have an array of technologies that can make a significant contribution to our long-term targets for reducing carbon emissions. By exploiting our own natural resources, increased levels of micro-generation would reduce our reliance on imported fuel and contribute towards our objective of secure energy supplies. That issue requires more debate in the months to come, and I think that we shall achieve more debate.

<a name="51111-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_117">The Government have long recognised the potential of micro-generation, which is why I announced only last week a &#163;30&nbsp;million low-carbon buildings programme to support these technologies. In announcing the details, I was anxious to bridge any gap in funding that was of concern to the industry. That brings total Government funding for micro-generation installations to &#163;83&nbsp;million since 2002. Creating a sustainable market for those technologies will not be done solely through capital grant programmes, which is why we are developing a strategy for the promotion of micro-generation technologies to remove some of the wider barriers preventing widespread take-up.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51111-13_spnew12"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 My understanding is that business rate valuations do include renewable energy installations, but that business can benefit from the financial gains associated with renewable obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates. <i>[Interruption.]</i> On the domestic side&#151;no, householders&#039; own micro-generation would not make those individuals or households eligible for business rate.

Many people watching their television screens and hearing about global warming could be forgiven&#151;although I am saying that they should not be&#151;for thinking that the future of the planet is by definition an issue for big people, such as presidents and prime ministers, and big institutions, such as the UN, the G8&nbsp;and the rest. Of course it is an issue for those big players, but what my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said is also important. He was once my Secretary of State, and I am rather in the habit of agreeing with him, so I am happy to agree with him on this important point. To use his phrase, this is about thinking globally and acting locally.

<a name="stpa_119">When an individual or a community organisation&#151;a school, a church or a community centre&#151;starts to invest in photovoltaics, say, or a micro wind turbine, they are not only making a contribution to their own energy supply but sending out a signal that they are taking responsibility. All of us as individuals&#151;that would certainly be the case for us in the House&#151;are more part of the problem of the misuse of carbon than the solution, but micro-generation enables us, locally and as individuals, to start becoming part of the solution.

 That is right. The technologies are at the stage where television was, perhaps, in the first few months of production.

 The fact that the Prime Minister makes the report is one of the most important aspects of the Bill. The Minister will be aware that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has stated:

<a name="stpa_125">Clause 3&nbsp;requires that Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury produce a fiscal and economic strategy for micro-generation and energy efficiency. As hon.

 I do not wish to take up too much time, but I want to return to the point about the Prime Minister.

It is important to aim for cohesion and accountability across government. That is why the Prime Minister&#039;s involvement is an important aspect of the clause.

 The Government could not be more joined up, Mr. Deputy Speaker, on issues surrounding climate change, energy efficiency and the rest.

<a name="51111-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">Clauses 4&nbsp;and 5&nbsp;relate to the setting of national and local targets for micro-generation. Let me remind the House that the Government already have two targets to

<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 624</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which micro-generation contributes: 10&nbsp;per cent. of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;GW of combined heat and power capacity installed by 2010. A formal requirement to set targets for micro-generation would be premature at this stage.

 Fuel poverty is a crucial issue. In the context of the Bill, one of the issues that I wish to explore in detail over the coming months is how best to use micro-power to help to address the fuel poverty agenda. They are often seen as different subjects, but I do not think that they should be. We have heard about areas that may be off the gas mains and having to pay higher costs. We need to explore further how micro-generation and energy efficiency can play a part. I am rather with the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">Clause 7&nbsp;gives the Secretary of State a duty to establish a scheme enabling the sale of electricity by domestic micro-generators. Such a scheme could then require electricity suppliers to buy at the market rate the electricity produced by their domestic customers by micro-generation. Micro-generators can already sell their electricity, so legislation is not required to achieve this. To require suppliers to buy that electricity at the market price risks distorting the electricity supply market and would be incompatible with our liberalised arrangements. This Government would like more suppliers to engage in the market for this exported electricity, perhaps through an obligation on them to offer terms, in a manner similar to their obligation to offer terms for supplying electricity to householders. So we are looking at this issue and I am anxious to make some progress on it, but I am unable to accept the clause as drafted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">Clause 8&nbsp;appears to put a duty on any public authority, including Ofgem, to have regard to the needs of micro-generators when carrying out any function relating to various green energy certificates. I have some concerns about imposing a specific duty on Ofgem in

<br>&nbsp;<br>respect of micro-generation. It already has a clear set of duties that govern its work, including a duty to contribute to sustainable development. A requirement to have specific regard to the needs of micro-generators would inappropriately skew its focus toward this still relatively small section of the energy market. But the Government support the general thrust of this clause, in so far as it would encourage actions that help micro-generators to gain access to the benefits associated with green certificates, such as renewable obligation and levy exemption certificates.

Since then, I have had an opportunity to consider these matters with many hon. Members and a welcome chance to visit delegations from those islands. As things stand, the power in the Energy Act enables us only to adjust charges until 2014, but the long lead time for developing projects on the islands mean that they will not be in operation until early in the next decade and would derive only minimal benefit from a scheme ending in 2014. Extending the scheme to 2024&nbsp;would provide additional support to island projects and bring environmental and economic benefits to those important island communities.

I would be content for the Bill to receive a Second Reading as it will be important for the Committee to give thought to what the Minister has said&#151;it certainly attracted me&#151;and we can spend productive time on Report and then decide whether to let the Bill make further progress.

Members. I shall first set the scenario&#151;a much loved word by environmentalists&#151;for the debate and then move on to some consideration of the Bill.

<a name="stpa_140">I shall start with an excellent letter, which I received in reply to one that I had written on behalf of a constituent, from the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, joined at the hip as he is to the Minister in his place today. They are undoubtedly inseparable. The letter mainly concentrates on the effects of climate change on sea levels. The first thing that caught my eye was the statement:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;Relative sea level in the Thames estuary will continue to rise by between 26&nbsp;and 86&nbsp;cm by the 2080s.&quot;</p>

Although it is fashionable in such Bills&#151;generated, as they usually are, by rather narrow single-interest groups&#151;to try to solve many problems by legislation and to try to pin the Government of the day down to the certainties that many people want, the reality, as the Minister pointed out, is that life simply is not like that.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_152">That is why I felt that this letter was very timely. Indeed, it is absolutely hot off the press; it is dated 7&nbsp;November. It even says &quot;Dear Eric&quot; at the top, so although I cannot claim to be quite as close to the Minister of State as is the Minister with us today, I am obviously on pretty intimate terms with him. He has written to me very warmly, and he has even signed it &quot;Yours, Elliot&quot;. So he and I are obviously very much at one in all of this, and I am most grateful to him for writing to me just in time for today&#039;s debate. It has been very timely and very useful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_153">Because I do not want to sound at all negative today, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;you know that that would be completely uncharacteristic of me on a Friday&#151;I want to continue to be warm and positive about the Government. The Minister is starting to look slightly uncomfortable, but I shall ladle on a bit more praise just to rub it in. The hon.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;The Government set up the UK climate impacts programme in 1997&nbsp;to encourage private and public sector organisations to assess their vulnerability to climate change so that they can plan their own adaptation strategies.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_154">I could not have put it better myself. That is the sort of approach that we should be encouraging, not the heavy-handed approach that we get so often&#151;bring in a Bill, pass a law, introduce targets, make regulations, introduce penalties&#151;which is an approach apparently so much beloved of everybody, including, I am really sorry to say, my own friends on the Front Bench. I am sorry that they should reach so readily for this sort of approach to a problem so widely perceived, instead of the imaginative and positive approach that the Government adopted in 1997, which talks about encouraging the public and private sectors to plan their own strategies. That strikes me as reflecting much more of modern Conservatism than the heavy-handed legislative approach that we have before us today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_155">My next text, having skimmed lightly over the Minister&#039;s letter, is the House of Lords report. So that there is no doubt anywhere, it is the Select Committee on Economic Affairs second report of Session 2005&#150;06, entitled &quot;The Economics of Climate Change&quot;. I recommend it most highly to Members of the House and people beyond.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 631</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_156">I should like to offer to the House a number of key passages in the report because they bear very much on the thrust of the Bill. The first is from paragraph 45, which says that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;nearly all of the public debate on global warming is about mitigation&#151;reducing emissions&#151;rather than about adapting to climate change and assisting the most vulnerable societies in the world to adapt to the risk they may face.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_157">In today&#039;s debate we have heard the cosy unanimity of people no doubt wound up by single-interest groups and postcards from certain organisations&#151;there is nothing wrong with that at all, provided we put them very much in context. But the debate we should be having today is about mitigation versus adaptation, particularly with regard to the developing world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_158">The excellent Professor Lomborg made a point on this very effectively. He has argued at great length&#151;I am tempted, but I probably will not quote too much from him, you may be relieved to hear, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;that attempts at mitigation, in other words controlled emissions and all that go with that, are at best a very long-term strategy and may or may not be effective, whereas adaptation can be done much more quickly and much more efficaciously, certainly in terms of, for example, flood protection. He says, as did the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment in his letter, although I did not quote that bit, that we are used to adaptation in this country. One only has to ask the good people of the Netherlands about adaptation; they have been doing it for centuries. That makes the point that it is often much more effective to seek to adapt to the effects, claimed or actual, of climate change over a long period than it is to mitigate through the sort of Kyoto approach that we are all supposed to have signed up to. So there is the first very important contribution that the House of Lords report makes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_159">Then, because most of what their lordships talk about is the link between economic activity and emissions, they point out at paragraph 51&nbsp;that any analysis of that has to encompass all the following factors:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;population change, rates of economic growth, the stage of economic development&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_160">that is, whether heavy industry or service-based&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;the type of energy used to &#039;fuel&#039; the economy, energy efficiency&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and technology.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_161">That is a formidable array of variables, which we should take into account when making our analysis. I have heard nothing of that today. All that we have heard today is the suggestion that we should make a glib assumption about the source of emissions and their alleged causal effect on global warming and nothing of the required analysis of the vital links that their lordships point out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_162">Their lordships go on to tell us something even more worrying. Paragraph 72&nbsp;states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;We received a significant amount of evidence on the realism of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. emissions scenarios, and doubts were raised, particularly about the high emissions scenarios. The balance of this evidence suggests to us that the high emissions scenarios contained some questionable assumptions and outcomes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para16">
<a name="stpa_163">Again, that takes us into the important area of considering which of the very sophisticated computer models and analyses we choose to believe or should believe. Those things are important because the range of variation is considerable. For example, estimates of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 632</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increase in sea level can range from 1.5&nbsp;cm to 4.5&nbsp;cm. That very wide range of possibilities can lead to all sorts of different conclusions, depending on which estimate one chooses to believe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para17">
<a name="stpa_164">Their lordships return to that theme over and again. For example, I return to paragraph 13, where they say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;No one disputes the fact of temperature rise in the last 100&nbsp;years or so. No one disputes that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and few dispute that it has an enhanced &#039;greenhouse effect&#039;. What is disputed, albeit by a minority of scientists, is the scale of this effect.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para18">
<a name="stpa_165">They go on to say that some of the scientists suggest that the models on which the predictions are based &quot;are biased upwards&quot; and


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;while warming will occur, it may well be at the lower end of the IPCC spectrum that is relevant, not the upper limits&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para19">
<a name="stpa_166">So there is an important difference of opinion among the scientific community about what is the reality of the predications of global warming that results from emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para20">
<a name="stpa_167">In all those important ways, we have considerable work to do in establishing beyond doubt exactly what is the cause of global warming and what its extent will be, and, crucially, what our reaction to it should be. In that context, I have grave doubts about the Bill because I am not convinced that it necessarily addresses the right problem or that it does so in the right way. We are entitled to be somewhat sceptical about it. That deals with mitigation versus adaptation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para21">
<a name="stpa_168">I want briefly to touch on the other very obvious fact that we must take into account: multilateral versus unilateral action. As has been said already, it is assumed that although we are a small country in the global context, if we do all sorts of sexy, interesting, exciting, good and heat-warming things about emissions, we will surely have either an effect on global warming itself or some sort of influence on other countries to do the same. Sadly, there is not much evidence to that effect so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-16_para22">
<a name="stpa_169">I share the scepticism that has been expressed about the Kyoto arrangements in any case. However, the fact that countries as important as the United States and Australia have not signed up to those arrangements anyway and given that it is almost certain that the bulk of emissions in the foreseeable and distant future will be caused by economic growth and development in China, south-east Asia, India and, probably, Africa as well, it should give one pause for thought about how effective what we are doing in this country is likely to be.

 My right hon. Friend might perhaps have been as concerned as I was recently during the informal European summit at Hampton Court a few weeks ago, when the Prime Minister referred to putting much more emphasis in our energy policy on working with European partners. The reason why I am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerned&#151;particularly in this multilateral, international context&#151;is that it is very clear that the European Union constitutes one of the brakes on having a successful trade negotiation because of its attitude to the lack of agricultural reform. I would be very concerned, given the importance of persuading countries such as China and India, if too much of our energy policy were dependent on getting the whole of Europe moving in the same direction, given the negative effects that we have seen in our trade negotiations.

<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 633</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br><a name="51111-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, who refers to other factors that will inevitably be crucial. We must make a series of important decisions. The first is: what is the best vehicle by which we can try to take decisions and move the issue forward? Is it us alone, is it us through the European Union, is it us with our English-speaking friends, is it us with the Commonwealth or is it in some more global context?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_170">For example, should we be seeking to link the issues of adaptation to climate change to trade negotiations or to technology transfer? Surely spending more resources in the wealthy world on research and development is key to developing the technologies that would enable us and, crucially, developing countries to respond to the problems caused by climate change. All those factors are crucial. Like, I suspect, my hon. Friend, I see no sign of any of that taking place. Instead, our country is acting in an uncharacteristically blinkered, inward-looking and narrow way. We congratulate ourselves on what we are doing, but neglect all the other factors that will eventually be much more crucial. Why are we not having a debate about what we should be doing in terms of technology development, technology transfer and helping the developing world to look more to adaptation as much as to the mitigation of climate change through considering emissions? There is a whole policy area that we have barely touched on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_171">Whether the technologies that we are talking about make sense is another issue for consideration. Too many rather easy assumptions are made about the efficacy of different types of technology. Unusually today&#151;perhaps because they are not explicitly referred to in the Bill&#151;we have not heard too much about some of the more exotic technologies. However, I have always had severe doubts about a range of possibilities in renewables and how efficacious they will be. I will touch on that point when I consider the Bill, which I shall come to shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_172">I wonder whether the focus is necessarily right. One of the great problems in this debate is that, as with many other things, one gets trends and then trendy ideas. Things emerge that are made to sound attractive and people latch on to them. We then make a great mistake in that they are portrayed as being the answer to the problem or one of the answers to it. Sadly, that rarely turns out to be the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_173">I remember when I still worked in the real world back in the 1970s. I was involved in a small company that was trying to play its part in developing solar energy in this country. Of course, the technology was in its early stages then, but it became fairly obvious that, in a climate such as ours, solar energy was probably unlikely to be the answer to the problems as we saw them at the time. The technology has moved on but, sadly, our climate has not changed very much at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_174">That raises another intriguing possibility that I shall touch on in passing and that is not often discussed. There can be positive effects of global warming in a number of interesting and different ways. Global warming is nearly always portrayed as being negative, as having the most horrendous effects in all sorts of areas. However, most of the analyses seem to demonstrate that&#151;whether in terms of agriculture or, in many

<a name="stpa_178">Why do we talk about fuel poverty, but not about food poverty, clothing poverty or other aspects of poverty? Households have an income. Many households have an income provided solely by the state. People in households have to make decisions about how they dispose of that income, such as whether to spend it on clothing, food, cigarettes, beer, bingo, or fuel. It is bizarre to single out an alleged problem with fuel, but not those other discretionary expenditures.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 635</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_179">The situation is even more bizarre when one considers the huge variation in the circumstances that must inevitably exist in households and the difference in people&#039;s attitudes to such matters. For example, some people might keep their heating turned on all the time, or too much of the time, and thus waste fuel. I know of no sensible way of measuring each person&#039;s use of fuel, whether that is responsible or not. I know of no means through which even this intrusive Government can measure people&#039;s individual lifestyles and the way in which they choose to spend their money on different aspects of discretionary or necessary expenditure. The whole concept of fuel poverty is thus total nonsense, so why we persist in including it in legislation is completely beyond my comprehension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_180">Before anybody springs up and says, &quot;But what about the fuel handout that people get from this generous Government?&quot;, let me point out that that payment is even more ridiculous. I suspect that many households do not spend the fuel handout on fuel at all. I will not ask hon. Members to reveal too much of what they know about how some people spend their Government, or taxpayer, fuel money&#151;let us not go too far into that; suffice it to say that the payment itself was an absurd response to a perceived, yet completely false, problem. My first difficulty with the Bill is the fact that it repeats the nonsense of fuel poverty yet again and claims to provide a response to it.

 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s view and I worry about the propagandisation of our young people by teachers, whether through Make Poverty History or climate change and so on. I worry that teachers appear to be all too willing to express their views to young and impressionable people, get those young people to sign petitions or whatever and thus give them expectations that will inevitably be disappointed, probably leading to the effect that my hon. Friend described. I could not agree with him more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_185">Clause 2&nbsp;led to an interesting divergence of view between the promoter and the Minister for Energy. I am rather on the Minister&#039;s side. It is not right to imply that any Prime Minister should be so involved in the detail of every Department&#039;s work that he has to answer for it. I should declare an interest: in the dim and distant past, I was a junior Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry and I therefore have a sort of affection for and loyalty to it. Partly because of that, I believe that Departments should be prepared to stand up for what they do. Secretaries of State should be responsible for their actions and those of their Departments. They should be the ones to account&#151;if account is necessary&#151;to the House. Attempts to draw in the Prime Minister and, even worse, to give him a sense of omniscience and omnipotence, which he knows that he has but the rest of us now know that he does not possess, are not the right way forward. I am therefore with the Minister on the matter and I hope that the Bill emerges from Committee without that aspect.

<a name="stpa_187">Could that be a zero report? Could it simply state, &quot;None&quot;, and leave it at that? I am sure that the implication of the provision is that a report can have meaning only if it says something. Worthy officials in Departments are often tasked by Ministers with writing about something that the Department has achieved in the past year. A 10-point action plan usually emerges&#151;that used to be the favourite in my day, although I do not know whether inflation has had an effect over the years. The first one or two points were barely credible and the following eight were almost laughable, but the 10-point action plan was supposed to get the Minister and the Department off the hook. My fear about clause 2&nbsp;is that it would give rise to that phenomenon all too readily. That would be regrettable.

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="51111-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 It is interesting that clause 2(1) has two paragraphs. It provides for the Prime Minister or whichever Minister to report on the steps that have been taken&#151;the inputs&#151;and the levels of emissions of greenhouse gases, which constitute the outputs. In most Government policies, Ministers tend to focus on the

<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 637</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>inputs and spend much less time on the genuine outcomes that affect our constituents. Is not the danger that a report of that nature would have lot of content about such activity&#151;as my right hon. Friend says from his great experience in government, civil servants are good at making those parts of the report lengthy&#151;and would probably say little about the reality that affects our constituents?
</p>








<p><a name="st_204"><a name="51111-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 That is a good point, but the position is more difficult. A mere global report on UK emissions, however measured&#151;about which I always have some scepticism&#151;says little to my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents or mine. Surely we must talk about regional if not local variations. I am sure that emissions in central London are rather different from those in Forest of Dean, for example.

 As my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position, he would hope so. Nevertheless, if we want to have the effect that he has described, the reporting, if we are to take it seriously, would have to be much more detailed than that suggested in the Bill. Perhaps a positive amendment can be made to the Bill in Committee to have reporting at a local or &quot;community&quot;&#151;which is a much more trendy words these days&#151;level, to make it more meaningful to all those people out there who are literally gasping for information on the subject.

<a name="stpa_188">Clause 2(2) gets even murkier. Under it, the Prime Minister must lay the report before Parliament and make a motion for a resolution to approve it. I am all for endless reports being laid before Parliament&#151;it gives MPs something to do and to read. I benefited enormously from the report from their lordships to which I referred earlier. Who am I to criticise reports laid before Parliament? I wish that they were all as good as that one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_189">We get into difficulties, however, if it is suggested that the report should give rise to a motion for a resolution of approval. That implies a number of things. There would have to be a vote on the report. Would that be subject to whipping? A huge advance has been made recently in parliamentary accountability, as we now know that whipping, even on Government Members, is much less effective than it used to be. Therefore, perhaps the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) hopes that if a report of this kind emerged to which he and his hon. Friends did not give much approval, they would feel free to vote against it, even if his hon. Friend the Minister said, &quot;I want you to approve of this report because it indicates my 10-point action plan, which I hope will gain your approval.&quot; But if the hon. Gentleman said, &quot;No, I&#039;m not fooled by that, I want to vote against it&quot;, would it be a whipped vote? Would there be rebels on the Government Benches? Would it be another occasion for Government embarrassment? I do not know.

There will be no Division, and this part of the proceedings will be finished well before 2.30, so if he wants to engage in dialogue, I invite him to do so. What would happen, however, if both Houses voted against the report, or one voted for and one against? I have never seen where that takes us in terms of dealing with climate change, emissions or anything else in a parliamentary sense. I do not see how it would even concentrate the Government&#039;s mind much. We might consider the provisions critically in Committee, and examine whether another mechanism can be found, such as a report, by all means, or even referring it to a Select Committee, by all means, but putting such a provision in a Bill that has pretensions to be a statute is not very helpful or productive.

 Someone of a mischievous turn of mind might even think that a motion for a resolution in both Houses is probably not helpful.

Are we content that individual householders will have sufficient knowledge or experience to manage the technologies and the potential hazards of micro-generation in their own properties?

In its place, it would be valuable no doubt, but when we are talking about a contribution of that limited nature, we are duty bound to look at the possible negative effects, particularly when talking about households, private property, children and other vulnerable people, who may not be able to handle what would be required in making such a contribution.

What is the Secretary of State supposed to do&#151;pass another law making the targets mandatory? Introduce fiscal incentives? Introduce penalties for not doing the right thing? I have no idea; nor, I suspect in my heart of hearts, has the promoter of the Bill.

<a name="stpa_223">Let us suppose for a moment that overall carbon emissions went up, due to various other factors, but that micro-generation made a small contribution to bringing them down. How are we to tease out from an overall increase that offsetting reduction, which might have taken place, thanks to micro-generation? I do not know the answer and I have a strong suspicion that neither do the people who drafted the Bill. They want to say those sorts of things because it makes them feel better. There is nothing wrong with that, except that I am not sure whether we should use the law to make people feel better generally. There are many other ways of doing that, but we need not go into them at this stage.

<p>
<a name="51111-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_224">Slightly more plausible and feasible, perhaps, is the notion of the report identifying the contribution of micro-generation towards the alleviation of so-called fuel poverty. That might be easier to do. If we took it household by household, looked at income and lifestyle and judged how much was being spent on cigarettes, beer, central heating or a coal fire&#151;lo and behold, there may even be a windmill in the roof&#151;perhaps we could fulfil the requirement of clause 6(c)(ii). That is my attempt to be positive, so take it for what it is worth. Other than that, clause 6&nbsp;presents a bit of a difficulty and the Minister will doubtless light upon that fact in Committee.

I am all for incentives and encouragement, but when we get into penalties, it is a sad day. I wonder whether full thought has been given to what those penalties might be and on whom they would fall. Would it be reasonable that they fell on the people concerned, and what would happen if they did not pay? Hiding behind that, presumably, although it has never been spelled out, lies the threat of custodial sentences&#151;who knows?&#151;for contempt of court, or the like. Before we go down the penalties road, I urge colleagues to think carefully, including the Minister&#151;and, indeed, the other members of the Committee, since I must not keep assuming that the Minister will have some sort of hold on the Committee. Of course he will not, and it will be up to him to persuade the Committee of his view, which he set out so ably earlier, and for the members of the Committee to respond to it. Then it will be for those of us present for Report to assess the state of the Bill after Committee. Today is just a preliminary canter across the broad provisions of the Bill.

I have touched briefly today on the excellent work of their Lordships and the excellent book by Mr. Bjorn Lomborg. There is the important question about climate change, but there is also the issue of the extent of the causal connection between climate change and emissions, the breadth of possibilities that that gives rise to and the differential between the effects that it might have on temperature and on sea levels. That in turn gives rise to the important question of mitigation versus adaptation, although unfortunately that went unmentioned by hon. Members today. However, it must be of key importance to the effect that the policies in the Bill are likely to have on the standards of living of our people, the prospects for economic growth and the costs of mitigation. By implication, and more importantly, those policies will have an effect on the developing world, which is not only likely to be the main generator of emissions and the main cause of global warming, but is also much more likely to suffer from the effects of that warming. That is where technology development and transfer, and adaptation, come much more into play.

<a name="stpa_252">Those developments in domestic power have been likened to the early days of the personal computer revolution. People once assumed that they would sit in front of a dumb terminal connected at some distance by cable to a vast mainframe.

Those ways to heat and power homes will become commonplace in 10&nbsp;years&#039; time, with the enormous benefit of possibly reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by a huge amount, thus benefiting people&#039;s fuel bills and domestic energy security.

 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s enthusiasm for the important initiative of promoting micro-generation. In trying to make micro-generation as commonplace as he describes, would it not be an exciting initiative to try to find out whether more social housing&#151;provided by housing associations, arm&#039;s length management organisations and others, such as Cheltenham Borough Homes in my constituency&#151;could incorporate micro-generation, because that would have a double benefit? Not only would it help the environment, but reduce in the long term fuel bills for some of the least well off in our society.

<p><a name="st_238"><a name="51111-23_spnew1"><b> Dr. Whitehead: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point and anticipates exactly what I shall come to in a moment: the idea that such devices could be installed in future homes so that, at the flick of a switch, their occupiers could save on their fuel bills and compensate for increasing fuel bills by generating their own energy in their own homes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_239"><a name="51111-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Has the hon. Gentleman made any estimate at all of the likely on-cost of all those goodies, how much might be added to the price of new homes with all that built in, and the effect that that could have particularly on first-time buyers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_240"><a name="51111-23_spnew3"><b> Dr. Whitehead: </b> 
 Yes. The right hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that I have made such an estimate. Indeed, I have discussed with members of the National Housing Federation what their reaction might be in respect of creating a level playing field for building homes in which those new devices are placed. For example, the cost of installing a combined heat and power boiler is not significantly greater than installing a condensing boiler, especially if it is installed when the house is built. Putting on solar PV tiles that are embedded in the roof is far cheaper than retrofitting them there. So the extra cost of building a house is marginal when introducing those devices, but the payback and benefit from doing so when a house is built can be enormous over a considerable period.

 My hon. Friend makes important points that perhaps ought to be picked up in the energy review. Is not one of the things that we should examine an equal VAT rate as between new and old homes?

 What the energy review says in total is a little outside the purview of the Bill. Nevertheless my hon.

It is important that the energy review consider such issues.

I do not want to stop such estimable work progressing by introducing the provisions in the Bill in such a way that that happens while new directions are incorporated. I am also aware that the wording of private Members&#039; Bills is rarely, if ever, exactly right straightaway, which is of course why if such Bills achieve their Second Reading, it is necessary to examine their clauses closely and perhaps amend them in Committee. If my Bill receives its Second Reading, I am sure that we will want to do just that.

We also might want to consider how any legislative requirement to empower the Secretary of State to make new building regulations would sit best with the new code on sustainable building. When that code is developed, I understand that it will strongly guide developers on the minimum standards to which they will be expected to build. It will herald the emergence of future revisions to building regulations to incorporate such guidelines. I would want any provision in my Bill to work with that code, not against it.

It might therefore suit the Government to have a wide availability of technologies that enable energy suppliers to cope more easily with not being able to produce to previous peak demand levels.

It also means that householders&#039; heating and fuel bills will be reduced. We need to go further, however. The Bill shows the way towards the lifting of unnecessary planning restrictions, which will allow the retro-fitting of micro-generation technologies for existing houses where appropriate.

<p><a name="st_268"><a name="51111-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Forth </b> 
: I am a little worried that somewhat concealed in the words that the Minister has just used, although I am sure that it was not deliberate, was the implication that national standards would be applied. Does she not want at least to pay lip service to the new doctrine of localism and to allow much more flexibility for local planning authorities to be more aware of local conditions in applying the things that she has just talked about?
</p>








<p><a name="st_269"><a name="51111-25_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is right that there is a range of areas in which local discretion is important. It is an important principle within the planning system. There is a range of areas where local decisions need to be made to take into account local circumstances. There is also a national planning framework. A range of things are already included within permitted development to ensure that the planning system at local level does not get clogged up by unnecessary applications for very small-scale developments. That is the way in which the permitted development system has worked for a long time.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_278">Where we have concerns with the Bill is that it involves additional piecemeal amendment of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development Order) 1995. One of the reasons we have patchy interpretation of the order at the moment, including around renewable energy, is that parts of it have become unnecessarily complicated, including piecemeal amendments over a long period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_279">We have already begun a major review of permitted development to simplify the system and to allow appropriate minor development to be taken out of the planning system. We envisage consulting on possible amendments to the general permitted development order next year. That would allow proper consultation to take place about the right balance and safeguards that need to be in place. We believe that that is the right opportunity to look at taking forward the ability of householders to install a range of small renewable energy developments without specific planning permission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_280">Therefore, we would like to discuss in Committee the right relationship between primary and secondary legislation on this issue. Permitted development is generally dealt with in secondary legislation, so that we can have the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and technology. The Government support the need to promote better energy efficiency and the use of things such as micro-generation and renewable energy in new developments and new homes.

<p><a name="st_270"><a name="51111-25_spnew2"><b> Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods  (City of Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving me a chance to put on the record my support for the Bill. Does she accept that the use of micro-renewables promoted by the Bill could help the Government to comply with their statutory duty under the Housing Act 2004&nbsp;to increase domestic energy efficiency by 20&nbsp;per cent. by 2010?

<br>&nbsp;<br>existing stock and new stock. That is why we think that the Bill raises some important principles. It also raises the issue of building regulations. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test is aware that we have certain concerns about the way in which that matter is dealt with in the Bill. We agree that building regulations are an important tool for improving energy efficiency and cutting carbon emissions. However, generally they do not specify particular technologies or ways of achieving standards. Instead, they specify outcomes and allow builders and developers flexibility about how to achieve those outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_281">That is an important principle, because it encourages innovation and it does not prevent competition if new technologies or approaches come forward. It means that regulations do not hamper the take-up of new technologies that may not yet have been anticipated. Therefore, we would be uncomfortable about being committed by this Bill to specifying particular approaches, as opposed to specifying outcomes, within the building regulations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_282">We also believe that there are additional ways we can promote micro-generation, such as through the code for sustainable buildings, on which we will consult shortly. We have just announced higher standards in building regulations on energy efficiency, too. Clearly, regulations need to be based on what is achievable in practice. We also propose to consider micro-generation as part of the review of existing building regulations that has just commenced. We believe that any concerns can be resolved in Committee, and we hope that we can have further discussions on the detail, including that aspect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_283">We welcome the emphasis in the Bill on promoting dynamic demand technology and we are happy to support its Second Reading. It raises important issues and will contribute to improving energy efficiency in buildings and promoting new technologies to protect the environment. We look forward to discussing it in Committee.

 Almost half Britain&#039;s 161.2&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions come from buildings. Despite all the rhetoric about the importance of joined-up government, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no statutory obligation to take action to improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon dioxide emissions or mitigate the impact of climate change. I shall keep my comments short because I very much want the Bill to receive a Second Reading.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_284">Last December the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;We will not, on the basis of current policies alone, achieve our ambitious goal of a 20&nbsp;per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_285">The Secretary of State has admitted the obvious fact that the Labour Government will not reach their target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 20&nbsp;per cent. below the 1990&nbsp;level, and that makes it clear that we need firm action and new policies. That is why the Opposition welcome many aspects of the Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_286">The Bill is short and concise, and I am sure that it will make a difference to the environment. It contains practical measures that will reduce emissions, help to sustain the environment and save money. Indeed, the

<br>&nbsp;<br>Micropower Council says that one of its provisions will eliminate the need for planning permission for micro-power plants generating 10&nbsp;kW or less. Those wishing to install such systems would save about &#163;265. The reduction in red tape and costs that the Bill offers will make micro-generation all the more attractive for Britain&#039;s millions of home owners and thousands of small businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_287">Dynamic Demand estimates that the changes promoted by the Bill could lead to savings of about 2.1&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or more than 1&nbsp;per cent. of the total carbon dioxide emissions that we produce.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_288">I hope that if the Bill makes further progress, we shall consider including geothermal power as a source of energy within the remit of the Bill. In addition, the Bill could set a higher capacity for micro-generation than that in clause 2(4). Households consume on average between 3,500&nbsp;and 5,000&nbsp;kWh per year, and if we empower the public to generate more of the energy for their homes through micro-generation renewables, that would be economically incentivising them&#151;this is the most terrible English; I shall rephrase that. It would give them an economic incentive to sell the excess produced to the national grid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_289">The Bill will make a positive difference to the environment.

My enthusiasm for the Bill sometimes amounts almost to a sense of desperation, because we need such Bills so much. It is a worthwhile Bill, but it will make only a small contribution to tackling the enormous problem of climate change, and in particular, the urgent need to reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions here in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_291">The fastest growth in carbon dioxide emissions comes from commercial premises, from transport and from the biggest wasters of energy&#151;the domestic sector. It is a constant puzzle that most of us are responsible for more carbon dioxide emissions from our houses each year than from our cars, yet this place spends tremendous effort and political energy on restricting the use of the car, and practically none on restricting carbon dioxide emissions from our homes. If we did that, we would reduce our bills and improve our home comfort levels, as well as reduce carbon dioxide and slow the rate of climate change.

<a name="stpa_292">On the whole, we have had a non-partisan debate today, which is most welcome. Speaking as someone who steered a private Member&#039;s Bill through to Royal Assent in 2004, I have to say that it is good to have a broad consensus, but strong, firm Government action is also required. It is disappointing that, 14&nbsp;months after my Bill gained Royal Assent, it has still not been implemented. That is my word of caution to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test: getting a Bill passed is difficult enough, but getting it implemented can be even more difficult. As far as I know, there is not yet a consultation document on the Bill that I steered though. I cannot even get confirmation that the working party to draw up the document has yet met. I look forward to hearing the Minister reassure me about that on another occasion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_293">The fact remains that the Bill provides a modest but valuable step on the road to tackling climate change. It seems to have the good will of the Government, albeit perhaps a little grudgingly given in some respects. Perhaps there is more trouble ahead in Committee. However, I say to both the Government and the hon.

<a name="stpa_301">Because all debates such as this stand alone, Madam Deputy Speaker, and we cannot possibly have regard to any previous such debate, that gives us the opportunity to rehearse the question of the meaningfulness of regular reports to Parliament. Sadly, I have yet to be convinced that obliging a Secretary of State to make regular reports to Parliament will move forward in a meaningful way any area or issue of policy. Yet again, however, here we have such a bureaucratic requirement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_302">I have no doubt that imposing such requirements makes people feel good about themselves and the issue that they are espousing, but I have never been too sure what Members think that laying such a report before Parliament achieves. I must admit that it is tempting at this stage to make a purely political point and to say that, of course, there is great benefit to be gained by forcing a Government to produce such a report, which would inevitably embarrass them. Very rarely do such reports suggest that Governments have made great progress, or that the objectives envisaged in the legislation in question will be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_303">So I am tempted, politically, to say, let us have any number of reports forcing the Secretary of State to come to the House and admit that, almost inevitably, the various targets, aims and objectives have not been met. But something inside me says that I should not succumb to that temptation, because to do so would be over-bureaucratic and over-regulatory. In theory, at least, my party is pledged to not being bureaucratic or regulatory, although I increasingly have my doubts about that. So right at the Bill&#039;s beginning&#151;clause 1(1)&#151;I am at odds with it and rather unhappy about its provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_304">Clause 1(2) then tells us what the report is supposed to inform us about:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">&quot;The report must specify the impact of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. progress on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide; and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the alleviation of fuel poverty.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_305">That immediately raises the question of what happens if the report says that no progress has been made in the reduction of CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. Are we to assume that something will happen as a result, or that this will simply embarrass the Government? If nothing will happen, what is the point of producing the report? There are not too many examples in recent political history of the mere production of a report showing that the Government of the day have failed to meet a certain set of objectives in turn leading to rectifying action by that Government. So the assumption made in many of the Bills that come before us on a Friday&#151;Bills that, regrettably, few colleagues are here to consider&#151;that such reports themselves produce good results is very much open to challenge, to say the least.

The places we visited included Abbotabad, Mensera, Bagh, Balakot and the Chathara plain, and the scenes were unbelievable. The stark facts speak for themselves. More than 73,276&nbsp;are dead; more than 69,260&nbsp;people are wounded; 3.3&nbsp;million people are homeless; 1.3&nbsp;million have lost their livelihoods; 15,000&nbsp;villages, hamlets and townships are devastated; 6,000&nbsp;schools are destroyed; 364&nbsp;medical facilities are destroyed; and I could go on.

Grandparents have been traumatised by seeing their entire family&#151;children and grandchildren&#151;wiped out. Ancestral homes have been destroyed. Children and adults are still in a physical state of shock more than three weeks after the earthquake, because of what they witnessed. Aftershocks have caused roads that had been cleared to be blocked again by landslides. Again, I could go on.

President Musharraf has announced that Pakistan will postpone the purchase of F-16&nbsp;aircraft from the USA in the light of the disaster facing Pakistan and the region. We have also seen continued improvements in relations between India and Pakistan, which have led to the line of command being opened at five separate places. However, as I said earlier, the disaster is quickly and surely turning into a catastrophe.

<p>
<a name="51111-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_315">The British and other western media have lost interest and I am concerned that the full scale of the horror will not become known in the western world. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that the number of casualties continues to rise as new areas are accessed. Up to 30&nbsp;per cent. of the earthquake affected areas remain inaccessible. Some 250,000&nbsp;people are above the snow line and face a life-threatening situation.

<a name="stpa_316">UNICEF estimates that more than 32,000&nbsp;children may have died and that there are tens of thousands of children who are now in peril due to deteriorating weather, injury and illness. There are 120,000&nbsp;children in the mountains still waiting for help, of whom 10,000&nbsp;could die of hunger, hypothermia and disease within the next few weeks.

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing an Adjournment debate on this important subject and on the words that he has addressed to the House. Does he share my concern about the lack of helicopter airlift capability in this and other disasters? That has meant that we are only just discovering the true horror of the earthquake in the region, because no one has been able to get there. The recent UN humanitarian response review report looked at the issue of improving airlift capacity. Will the hon. Gentleman join me in urging the Government to have an urgent review of this country&#039;s ability to provide helicopters?

<p><a name="st_291"><a name="51111-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 I am grateful for that intervention. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and my hon. Friend the Minister have ensured that the UK Government have done their share. For example, I met the pilots of three Chinook helicopters who were doing three sorties a day, which was way more than their counterparts. The hon. Gentleman raises an important point about ensuring that we are prepared for future disasters, and my hon. Friend the Minister will have heard his concern.
</p>

<a name="51111-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_317">Islamic Relief also expressed concern about the disaster. It said that the prospect of a second wave of death looms over the survivors as thousands of injured people remain stranded without access to food, shelter and sanitation. Helicopters play a vital role in alleviating some of that suffering.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the days and weeks afterwards were. It is useful to compare and contrast the present disaster with the tsunami disaster that occurred almost a year ago, on Boxing day 2004, but I should point out that I do not criticise the help that we or the international community gave to those affected. The tsunami affected 1&nbsp;million people: the Pakistan, India and Kashmiri earthquake has made 4&nbsp;million people homeless. The tsunami affected flat coastal areas that were easy to reach: the earthquake was in rugged, mountainous terrain. After the tsunami, there was moderate weather in all the areas affected: temperatures in the earthquake zone have already dropped to freezing point and snowfall has started. In the case of the tsunami, 4,000&nbsp;helicopters were made available by foreign countries in days: the earthquake region has received 70, and the Pakistani Government and the UN can no longer afford the fuel to make optimal use of them. In the case of the tsunami, 80&nbsp;per cent. of the aid pledged by the international community to the UN was realised in two weeks: more than four weeks after the earthquake, Pakistan has received 12&nbsp;per cent. of the promised aid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_319">There is a stark contrast in the scale of the international response to the UN appeal in each case. I said that I was angry and ashamed and I shall explain why. After the tsunami, international donors pledged more than $700&nbsp;million for immediate emergency relief in the first two weeks alone; 79&nbsp;per cent. of the UN appeal was met within two weeks, whereas more than a month after the earthquake, only $131&nbsp;million had been pledged&#151;only 24&nbsp;per cent. of the UN appeal. Unless the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government take a lead in the international community, I truly fear that children, adults and elderly people will die from starvation, cold and disease&#151;avoidable deaths.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_320">Pakistan needs help. India, because of the numbers affected, is coping well by herself. Pakistan needs tents, other shelter, food, medicine, blankets, helicopters, fuel and more. In addition to the specialist help that DFID is giving, I have been advised that the best thing we can do is to provide urgent cash assistance so that the relief experts and agencies on the ground can spot-purchase what is required locally.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Will he join me in congratulating UNICEF on its efforts to ensure that collections are co-ordinated? Although the media have not pursued things as vigorously as we would like, should not we appeal to the public to continue to collect funds and maintain a co-ordinated approach through UNICEF?
</p>








<p><a name="st_293"><a name="51111-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend; she is right. The relief agencies are amazing. I met people who should be treated as heroes: UNICEF, Save the Children, Islamic Relief, Helping Hands and others are doing a fantastic job. But we have never seen a disaster on that scale, so even with the best will in the world and the best planning and organisation it was impossible to be as organised at the outset as we should have liked. It is now five weeks later, however, and we know the scale of the disaster so it is important to try to take steps to address it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_321">What can we do? In the short term, the priorities are clearly the emergency rescue and relief that have been mentioned. We also need early rehabilitation and

<br>&nbsp;<br>reconstruction help, and I shall explain how I hope that our Government can help. First, on 19&nbsp;November, a donors conference will be held in Pakistan. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, will attend and will ask for help from the international community. I hope that our Government do as they have always done and take the lead in putting pressure on other Governments to do more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_322">Secondly, eight weeks are left of our presidency of the European Union and of the G8. Over the past few months, we have seen how much we could do, by leading from the front, to make poverty history: an example of Britain using her influence and expertise to persuade other countries to do more. I urge our Government to use the influence and reputation that they have gained as president of the EU and the G8&nbsp;to do much more; for example, we could persuade the EU to include Pakistan in its generalised system of preferences plus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_323">Thirdly, we could offer the same type of trade concessions as were rightly given to the areas affected by the tsunami disaster. We need to ensure that we help Pakistan stand on her own feet. Yes, Pakistan needs help immediately, but her people want fair trade. They do not want handouts; they prefer to earn their way out of the crisis. Every billion dollars of exports translates into 300,000&nbsp;jobs in Pakistan, which has an impact on 1.5&nbsp;million people, and shows how people can help themselves to recover from catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_324">I subscribe to the view that a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. As a member of the international family, we should be judged by how the victims of the earthquake disaster in south Asia are treated. I sincerely hope that DFID and the Government will lead the way in showing just how civilised and just we are.

<p><a name="st_294"><a name="51111-28_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) on securing this important debate. I also congratulate him and other hon. Friends on taking the time to visit the region to see for themselves the scale of the tragedy that is unfolding in Pakistan, and for ensuring that the attention of the House continues to be drawn to the disaster, even though international media attention may have begun to diminish. I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the generosity of the British public and the many British-based non-governmental organisations operating in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_325">Since the earthquake struck, with such devastating effect, on 8&nbsp;October, the scale of the tragedy has become starkly and increasingly clear to us all. The Government of Pakistan&#039;s latest figures report that more than 73,000&nbsp;people lost their life&#151;other estimates put the figure higher, at some 87,000&#151;with some 69,000&nbsp;people suffering injury. In Indian-administered Kashmir, the death toll is reported at over 1,300&nbsp;people, and some 4,500&nbsp;people are reported to have been injured. In total, some 3.5&nbsp;million people are affected, of whom 2.5&nbsp;million have lost their homes. The 200,000&nbsp;people living in difficult-to-access areas, including those above the snow line, are, as my hon. Friend rightly said, at

<b>11 Nov 2005 : Column 670</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>particular risk as winter approaches. The priority now must be to ensure that those who survived the disaster receive the assistance that they require to support them through the winter months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_326">The principal objective of our response to the earthquake so far has been to support the immediate survival needs of the affected population and to continue the support into the spring, or longer if necessary. To date, we have allocated some &#163;33&nbsp;million of assistance for the immediate relief effort. We recognise the need for the international community to do more. Overall, I have to say, international assistance for the relief phase to date has been disappointing. We are the second largest donor to the relief effort. We are prepared to provide additional assistance while also urging other donors to increase their support to the relief needs at this critical point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_327">Our immediate assistance has included search and rescue teams; indeed, the first international search and rescue team to arrive in the affected areas was a British-based NGO whose visit we helped to fund. In addition to search and rescue, we have provided priority relief materials including tents, blankets and tarpaulins. We have helped to fund air transport, including helicopters, and programmed support to various United Nations agencies, to the Red Cross movement and to a series of non-governmental organisations. As part of our support to NGOs we have been funding flights for the UK&#039;s Disasters Emergency Committee. Indeed, to date we have funded some 65&nbsp;flights for agencies of the DEC, costing some &#163;3&nbsp;million. In addition, &#163;3&nbsp;million of the &#163;5&nbsp;million that we have given to NGOs has gone to DEC agencies. Our aim is to ensure that the funding raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee from the British public, which I was pleased to learn today has risen to some &#163;37&nbsp;million, is spent on material and direct assistance rather than the commercial cost&#151;which we are meeting&#151;of the flights to send supplies to the affected region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_328">As I said, I greatly appreciate the valuable efforts made by the public and concerned people the length and breadth of Britain who want to respond to this terrible disaster. Wherever possible, we have sought to use available space on the aircraft for other agencies, and we have encouraged the Disasters Emergency Committee to collaborate with other charities that want to send support. By way of example, we provided support to Islamic Relief, providing it with the funding for some 10,000&nbsp;tarpaulins, 20,000&nbsp;blankets and 1,000&nbsp;winterised family tents from the supplies of the Department for International Development, and have funded two Islamic Relief flights under the DEC airlift support that I alluded to earlier. Islamic relief is just one of many British-based NGOs doing a fantastic job in responding to the disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_329">The European Community&#039;s Humanitarian Office has contributed about &#163;9.2&nbsp;million to the relief effort and the European Commission has already pledged some &#163;54&nbsp;million towards longer-term rehabilitation and reconstruction. The UK&#039;s share of that assistance is around &#163;11&nbsp;million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para9">

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for talking about what we have done so far. People in the communities in my constituency have spoken to me about the plight that my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) has outlined today. My anxiety relates to the fact that we have all read in the newspapers about the escalating current need and how the money that has been pledged will simply not save those people. What more can we do in the House and outside to take the aid that is so desperately needed to those families and children?

<a name="51111-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_332">It is crucial, however, that we continue to support the UN in the development of the humanitarian action plan to meet the immediate needs of those in difficult-to-reach communities. That plan, as well as what I have indicated already, includes the construction of 30&nbsp;camps, the repair of vital damaged water supply systems and the installation of latrines, the establishment of temporary schools and the provision of heating and cooking facilities for 150,000&nbsp;people in camps. Given the difficult access considerations, the plan also sets out the critical logistics requirements to reach affected populations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_333">One of the things that hon. Members can continue to do to help the relief effort, as well as urging their constituents to continue to consider whether they can give support to the appeal made by the Disasters Emergency Committee, is to focus the attention of the House and, we hope, the media on the continuing needs of the people of Pakistan devastated by the earthquake. We need to continue to try to do everything that we can to keep international attention focused on the disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51111-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_334">We have pledged &#163;5&nbsp;million to the United Nations flash appeal, but we are doing much more to support the UN. We have already provided about &#163;10&nbsp;million of direct and in-kind assistance to the UN, and we will provide further support in key sectors. Our support to the UN ranges from health, shelter, water and sanitation interventions, as well as supporting camp management, to vehicles, logistics, co-ordination and, importantly, helicopters.
</p>

<a name="51111-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_335">Our military has been providing crucial logistical assistance. The Ministry of Defence, as the House will know, has provided three Chinook helicopters and airlifted rations and water from Kabul, using a C130&nbsp;aircraft, as well as 40&nbsp;tonnes of vegetarian rations from Britain via NATO. The MOD has also helped to airlift two Puma helicopters from Spain to Pakistan in
