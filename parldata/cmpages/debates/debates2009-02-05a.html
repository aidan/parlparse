 We want all businesses with a turnover of up to &#163;25 million to benefit from the Government&#146;s enterprise finance guarantee and the other schemes and bank lending that are available. Under the enterprise finance guarantee, companies will be able to borrow anything from &#163;1,000 to &#163;1 million. There are generous repayment terms, and loans can be repaid over up to 10 years. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that only today RBS-NatWest has announced &#163;3 billion in extra funding for small and medium-sized enterprises through new regional funds. Significant support packages are available now, which can be accessed though Business Link.

guarantee scheme? I share the reservations expressed by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor). The Forum of Private Business says that the scheme is not working effectively and that bank managers do not know about it. In my constituency I have a very worrying case in which a man has been made ineligible for the scheme by the arbitrary behaviour of another bank. There are real questions about the scheme that need to be addressed urgently.</p>

 We will investigate any problems that the hon. Gentleman says have been encountered, but I ask him to bear in mind the fact that the scheme was launched on 14 January. It is open for business now and is providing real support. There may be some teething problems at an individual banking level, but that might be expected with any scheme. Some companies will be turned down because they do not meet the criteria, but the business community as a whole has welcomed the flexibility to get a loan of between &#163;1,000 and &#163;1 million, with a 75 per cent. Government guarantee. I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about the Federation of Small Businesses; we are happy to work with it to make sure that the scheme is effective. It is properly designed, and it is open for business. It should be welcomed by the Opposition, as it provides support for the business community.</p>

 In his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), the Minister said that the scheme came on top of the finance already available&#151;but does the Minister think that the banks are playing ball? A small business&#151;well, it is not actually that small&#151;contacted me: RBS has found any excuse to restructure its loan, and has charged it 1 per cent. for doing so. It is a profitable business that is looking to expand, but it finds it very difficult to get what would, in normal circumstances, be classed as normal finance. It feels that it is being taken for a ride by the bank.</p>

 Obviously, I cannot comment on those individual circumstances. On the general situation, hon. Members will be aware that through the lending panel, we are monitoring lending by the major banks extremely closely. A lot of lending into the banking system by foreign banks has disappeared, so there is a credit crunch affecting the UK economy. Our major banks are continuing to lend, and we continue to push them to make sure that they do, which is why I welcome the announcement by RBS-NatWest today. Obviously, we expect normal commercial loans to have been exhausted as a possibility before companies are eligible for schemes such as the enterprise finance guarantee scheme; that is the right thing to do when providing a taxpayers&#146; guarantee. The schemes are up and running. They are working, and they are providing real help for business now.</p>

Instead of producing a series of measures in a panic-stricken way, as the Government have done in recent months, would it not have been better if they had speedily adopted our policy of a &#163;50 billion loan guarantee scheme for businesses of all sizes, and had shown some competence in getting it into practice at the speed required?</p>

 No, it would not have been a good idea to implement an uncosted, untargeted scheme. What the Government have done is to introduce the enterprise finance guarantee, which is specifically targeted at companies with a turnover of up to &#163;25 million. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will be aware of the working capital scheme that we are also introducing. It will provide working capital support for businesses in the economy. That will apply to a portfolio of companies with a turnover of up to &#163;500 million. That is real support for business, and it is working. We need to do more to market existing products to the business community. I would like to think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman and I shared an interest in wanting to do that, and in wanting to get the maximum possible publicity for the real support available to companies to help them through the recession.</p>

All Members have heard evidence from companies: banks have failed to advise them of the scheme, and failed to help them to access it&#151;and those are the very banks that the country now largely owns.

I know of many cases in my constituency where companies are aware of the scheme and are talking to their banks. I expect that the lending figures for companies participating in the enterprise finance guarantee will quickly start to build strongly. After just over two weeks, we think a good start has been made and we expect to see significant progress in the use of the scheme in the future.</p>

The posted workers directive operates throughout the EU and the recent report from the European Commission showed that there were 47,000 UK posted workers in the rest of the EU&#151;three times more than the 15,000 posted workers from the rest of the EU working here in the UK.</p>

Once we do that, we can stop the Lindseys of the future and deal with the matter in the Common Market as well.</p>

 I do not believe that agency workers were a factor in the Lindsey dispute. My understanding is that in that particular part of the construction industry the workers are directly employed by the subcontractors on the site. I have also been told that the subcontractors all have to pay the agreed rates. However, I agree with my hon. Friend that it was right to reach an agreement on the agency workers directive which suited the UK labour market. We did that on the basis of an agreement between the TUC and the CBI which was then reflected in the text of the agreed directive. The Government will bring forward a consultation on the implementation of the directive here in the UK.</p>

 We have been in discussions with Jaguar Land Rover for a period of time. We are certainly aware of the company&#146;s situation, and we have been supportive by encouraging it to go to the European Investment Bank for finance. The measures that we announced last Tuesday will provide guarantees for any loan that JLR secures from the EIB, but the company has other requests and we will continue our dialogue with them. The key thing to stress is that we are talking about taxpayers&#146; money, and we need to ensure that that money is used in the most effective way possible. We will continue to do that.</p>

 The announcement of aid last week came four months after the Minister first promised to help, but even today, as we learn that car sales have fallen again, the industry still does not have the details it needs to plan. There is no plan to help with consumer demand and loans, and the Government have now admitted that they have not even cleared their plans with the European Commission. Given that most of our competitors have already injected finance into their car industry, what is the problem? Do not Ministers understand the urgency, or is it just a matter of incompetence?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman ought to welcome the fact that we have announced a &#163;2.3 billion package of loan guarantees to the industry. May I provide some of the details that he seems studiously to ignore? We will be guaranteeing EIB loans of more than &#163;200 million for non-investment grade companies, which we need to do to ensure that they can get access to the necessary finance, as soon as those loans are approved. We will also guarantee up to &#163;1 billion of new lending to companies looking to borrow more than &#163;5 million.

We are getting on with the process of discussing what sensible lending might be made available to them now, rather than waiting for EU state aid approval.</p>

 Yes, it is important that big companies look to do what they can to support their supply chain during these difficult times. In the automotive industry, for instance, I am aware of a number of car manufacturers actively working with their supply chain and paying earlier than they normally do. Particularly in a time of lean or just-in-time production in the supply chains of the automotive industry and many other sectors of our economy, big companies have a direct interest in ensuring that small companies continue to survive. Many of them are already taking action to do that. Of course, the action that the Government are taking to stimulate credit in the economy will also help those small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90205-0003.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000161">A great deal of pressure has been exerted on the Government, not only by the Church but by the Scout Association, which has campaigned on the issue. Only yesterday a petition from former sports stars Brian Moore and Mike Gatting outlining the impact on sports clubs was received by the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The pressure is on the Government, and what we want is for the Government to respond. If I may use a biblical phrase, let me say: those who have ears, let them hear.</p>

 Is the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is right, in that the matter lies with Ofwat; and therein, I suspect, lies the dilemma of Ministers. How do they intervene with Ofwat? How do they intervene on behalf of the Church or in relation to the Scouts Association? How do they intervene on behalf of all the small concerns that are the lifeblood of our country and act in their interests? That is a dilemma for the Government to which they should respond and on which they should reach a conclusion that is favourable to the Church&#146;s interest and also robust. We want no tinkering with the system and no filibustering here or there; we want a clear decision that is in the interests of the organisations to which I have referred.</p>

There are many programmes of modernisation working their way through the system for which we can thank the Modernisation Committee&#151;for example, those on pre-legislative scrutiny, post-legislative scrutiny and having Bills in plain English. The Modernisation Committee&#146;s work runs alongside that of the Procedure Committee. Because of ministerial appointments, there have to be new Members on the Modernisation Committee.

I do not know what the hon. Gentleman was doing on Monday but, as far as I was concerned, as Leader of the House it was business as usual. He talked about snow, ice and grit. The Highways Agency is working with the Government, the Department for Transport and the Local Government Association to ensure that there is proper distribution of salt and that we can keep as many of the roads open as possible.

He said that there would be a mortgage deferral scheme; two months later, it is not there.

 In a week when a devoted community nurse was suspended from her duties for wanting to pray for one of her patients and then the BBC, which is even more misguided than that nurse&#146;s health authority, dismissed an eminent broadcaster for a remark made in the green room, while retaining the odious Jonathan Ross on &#163;6 million a year, is it not time that we had a debate on the utter absurdities of political correctness?</p>

 May we have a statement or a debate&#151;or even, if we cannot have those, an expression of opinion from the Leader of the House&#151;on the improper use of written statements as a substitute for ministerial statements made on the Floor of the House? I have in mind the written statement made on the postponement of the building programme for the two aircraft carriers. I know that the right hon. and learned Lady did her best to promise us that we could raise the issue in the armed forces debate held a week ago, but in the end, Mr. Speaker quite understandably decided that we could not. Will she at least try to send a signal to Ministers that, in future, when there is an important matter to be announced to the House, we should be able to question them, rather than the announcement being sneaked out as a written statement?</p>

 I do not think that there is any intention to sneak out information by way of written statements. If information is put in a written statement, it is laid before the House, so it is not sneaked out at all; it is put in the public domain. Ministers and I, as Leader of the House, have to share the decision on whether time is needed for the Second Reading of an important Bill, the remaining stages of a controversial Bill, or Opposition day debates. There has been an unprecedented number of statements, not least because of statements from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Treasury on the economic situation, as well as a number of statements from the Home Office. We have to be careful to ensure that the main business of the House is not too squeezed by statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90205-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000256">It is a question of striking a balance. I know that the hon. Gentleman takes such matters seriously, so I will be prompted by his question to review the balance between written and oral statements, and the balance between oral statements and the rest of the business of the House, to make sure that we get both right. I absolutely assure him that we are proud of our procurement from the important industries that provide for our armed services. There is no way that we would want to sweep that under the carpet.</p>

 The Leader of the House will be aware that I raised a point of order last night about the dwindling supplies of salt and grit in the country. Gloucestershire is in a particularly difficult situation: it has a 72-hour contract with Salt Union, but has been told that it may not get another supply next Tuesday, so it is severely rationing the number of roads that it can salt, which has implications for road safety. Will the Leader of the House guarantee to bring that to the attention of the Secretary of State at the DCLG today? If conditions deteriorate over the weekend, will she ask the Secretary of State to come and make a statement to the House? Clearly, we cannot have a situation in which the country is running out of salt.</p>

 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement to the House on the case of Mr. Binyam Mohamed, following the judgment handed down yesterday in the High Court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000277">The fundamentals of the case are as follows. Mr. Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian national formerly resident in the UK, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002. In 2004 he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay. Until August 2007, the Government had taken responsibility for the release and return of British nationals from Guantanamo Bay. In August 2007, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I wrote to then US Secretary of State to seek Mr. Mohamed&#146;s release from Guantanamo Bay and his return to the United Kingdom, along with four other former UK residents. Over the past 18 months, we have mounted what the Court has called a strenuous effort to achieve that objective. We have throughout kept Mr. Mohamed&#146;s family and lawyers informed of his situation and our efforts to resolve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000278">The United States brought terrorist charges against Mr. Mohamed in May last year before a military commission. Mr. Mohamed subsequently brought proceedings against the British Government in an effort to secure the disclosure to his legal counsel of any material held by the British Government that might assist the defence of his case before the military commission. Having looked through all the material that we held across Government, we provided through the appropriate legal and statutory mechanisms a great deal of both classified and unclassified UK information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000279">Among the information we held, however, we identified some highly classified US intelligence material. We took the view that the material was potentially exculpatory and ought to be disclosed to Mr. Mohamed&#146;s legal counsel. As this was sensitive US Government material, we informed the relevant US authorities of our view; we also informed Mr. Mohamed&#146;s counsel. We have worked since then to ensure that all the material was, indeed, made available to Mr. Mohamed&#146;s legal counsel by the US Government through their own procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000280">Across the four judgments handed down by the High Court since last August, the Court has explicitly recognised the efforts of the Government both to secure Mr. Mohamed&#146;s release and return, and to ensure that the material that we considered ought to be disclosed to him was, indeed, disclosed. The latter objective was achieved some time ago, when the US Department of Justice disclosed the material to Mr. Mohamed&#146;s counsel in the course of proceedings in the US federal courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000281">At the heart of Mr. Mohamed&#146;s case have been allegations that he was tortured by foreign Government officials in a number of locations. It is the longstanding policy of this Government that we never condone, authorise or co-operate in torture. I repeat that commitment today. We also take very seriously all allegations of torture and investigate them fully. Allegations have been made in the course of these legal proceedings that the UK is in some way complicit in the alleged mistreatment of Mr. Mohamed.</p>

wrongdoing to the Attorney-General. That question is now being considered by the Attorney-General. That is, as the Court acknowledged yesterday, the proper democratic and legal process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000283">Yesterday&#146;s judgment was not about that, however. It was about whether an English court should, in the interests of public debate and understanding, order the disclosure to the general public of sensitive foreign intelligence shared with our own intelligence agencies on the strict understanding that it would not be released. As anyone who has read the judgments will appreciate, in circumstances in which Mr. Mohamed&#146;s access to the information relevant to his defence had been secured, the sole question for my consideration concerned the publication of classified material received from a foreign intelligence service&#151;in this case, the US.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000284">The question at issue was whether intelligence provided on a confidential basis by one state to another, in absolute trust that it will be kept secure, may be disclosed to the public by order of a foreign court, or whether instead, the breach of trust would be so grave as to endanger intelligence-sharing relationships and therefore affect national security. In this case it was US intelligence and an English court, but it could just as easily be British intelligence in a foreign court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000285">I had before me the clear and unanimous advice of all key UK Departments and agencies. As the Court observed yesterday,</p>

It is a fundamental part of that trust and confidentiality which lies at the heart of the relationship with foreign intelligence agencies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000286">Our intelligence relationship with the United States is vital to the national security of the United Kingdom. It is essential that the ability of the United States to communicate such material in confidence to the UK is protected. Without such confidence the US will simply not share that material with us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09020541000287">The same applies to our intelligence relationships with all those who share intelligence information with us. And what applies to them also applies to us. We share intelligence with a large number of countries. We do so to protect British citizens, and we do so on the basis that the material will not be put into the public domain against our wishes. To state the obvious, were our own classified information to be disclosed in such a way, it could compromise our work, our sources and therefore our security. It therefore was and remains my judgment that the disclosure of the intelligence documents at issue, by order of our courts and against the wishes of the US authorities, would indeed cause real and significant damage to the national security and international relations of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90205-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000289">For the record, the United States authorities did not threaten to &#147;break off&#148; intelligence co-operation with the UK.

Many of us have criticised the use of extraordinary rendition and the possibility that it can sometimes lead to torture in a third country.

 The right hon. Gentleman is right that the House is united in respect of the closure of Guantanamo Bay, action against torture and the rejection of extraordinary rendition. The Government have taken practical steps to put that into practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000311">The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s first and seventh questions related to our engagement with the US Administration about what he called &#147;this case&#148;. I want to be absolutely clear: I did indeed raise the case of the remaining Guantanamo detainees with British residency status when I met Secretary Clinton on Tuesday. I confirmed and reiterated to her that we remain determined to secure their release and return. The right hon. Gentleman may have slightly misspoken; the previous Administration had acceded to that request and the current Administration are continuing to commit themselves to the request for release and return. So Mr. Mohamed will indeed be coming back to the United Kingdom, and that raises precisely the questions of security and the arrangements for that that the right hon. Gentleman led into. I assure him that we are going to make sure that the return of Mr. Mohamed&#151;after eight years, as the right hon. Gentleman says&#151;is done in full accordance not just with his rights but with British security considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000312">In respect of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s quotation about the &#147;arguable case&#148;, I should say that the investigations of the US system are continuing. The system is, of course, very complicated. First of all there are the military commissions, then there are the federal courts and then there is the decision of the Obama Administration to wind up Guantanamo and the system of military commissions. The right thing to say is that those investigations remain at the heart of cases in the US system and of cases being brought in our system. Those investigations continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000313">In respect of the allegations of British complicity, those matters, as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made clear on 23 October, are now with the Attorney-General, who is consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000314">The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s fourth question was about the representations that we have made in respect of allegations of torture. He cited one particular case from 2002, and before I answer specifically on that I want to go back to make sure that we give him exactly the right answer. However, our representations in respect of torture have always been clear in public and in private. I give him the example of the debate last year about the question of whether water-boarding constituted torture. We were absolutely clear in public and in private that in our view it did constitute torture, and that it was reprehensible on that basis. I can assure him that the British Government have remained fully engaged on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000315">In respect of the unique intelligence-sharing relationship, that is indeed very important. The Intelligence and Security Committee has commented on the value of that relationship at various points. I think that the word &#147;threat&#148; was used by the Court of Appeal. Given the facts that I described&#151;that the intelligence-sharing relationship is based on confidentiality, that if another country gave away our secrets that could not but have an implication for the way in which we judged the amount of material to share with it, and that the Americans have made it clear in public documents that they would see serious and lasting harm from the disclosure  <br>

in our courts of their information&#151;it is clear that the relationship would be affected; but it is the Court that used the word &#147;threat&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000316">Finally, there is the question of an American decision about what to disclose in public. I emphasise that it must be an American decision. Only they can make a decision about whether sources&#151;their own or others&#151;are compromised by the disclosure, in the same way that only we can make decisions about whether our information, disclosed to the public, would involve the compromise of sources. To that extent, I am not going to join a lobbying campaign against the American Government on this decision. It is a decision that they have to make given their knowledge of the full facts about the sources on which they depend and do not want to compromise. I am clear that our decisions are for us and their decisions are for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09020541000317">To that extent, this case hinges not on the content of the redacted paragraphs but on their nature, which is that they are American paragraphs&#151;American evidence&#151;in the same way that our intelligence sources are our property. We have approached the issue on that basis, which is the only basis on which to preserve the confidentiality and trust on which such a relationship depends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000319">The Foreign Secretary rightly says that his judgment is on the line&#151;whether to take a threat, and it was a threat, of non-co-operation on future intelligence sharing from our closest ally seriously, or whether to allow information on criminal acts of torture to be published. Will he confirm that the Court makes it clear that the publication of the summary of intelligence reports under question would not have created a security risk to the United States&#151;that it would not have revealed the name of any agent, the location of any secret establishment, or the methods of any intelligence gathering? The truth is that the question of the publication of this summary was not about security and intelligence but about whether to cover up torture, and United States interest in avoiding political embarrassment and potential criminal investigations against its security services. So we have the bizarre situation that this is not a threat to our security from terrorists, but a threat to our security posed by our closest ally over an issue relating to democratic accountability and the rule of law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000320">Have the British Government not just rolled over in the face of a scarcely credible threat from a friend? Have both this Government and President Bush&#146;s Administration not confused intelligence with abuse, security with the rule of law, and secrecy with cover-up? Why did the Foreign Secretary not make it clear to our American friends that this country&#146;s opposition to torture meant that we would have nothing to do with intelligence gathered that way? Is it not our international legal duty not only to refrain from torture but to bring those who torture to justice&#151;that this country&#146;s long-term security is best protected when we uphold human rights and the rule of law, and when it comes to upholding the values that Britain and America are supposed to share, this country will not be bullied into shabby and shady compromise?

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000324">First, the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but I am sorry&#151;justice is served by the individual in question having his rights to a proper trial, and that is served by his having full access to the 42 documents that are at issue. The 42 documents that are referred to were given to the defence counsel for Binyam Mohamed in significant part as a result of the representations of this Government. That is the way in which Government are served. When the hon. Gentleman talks, as he did in his first few seconds, about a cover-up of torture, he is neglecting the fact, first, that Binyam Mohamed&#146;s lawyers were given that documentation, and secondly, that the Attorney-General is looking in detail at whether there is anything complicit about the United Kingdom&#146;s role in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90205-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000327">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman said&#151;it is worth the House looking at this when <i> Hansard</i> is published&#151;that the threat to our national security came not from sources that we debate often in this House, whether terrorism or elsewhere, but from our closest ally, which the Intelligence and Security Committee has said is critical to saving British lives because of the intelligence that it provides. When he has had a chance to look at his remarks, he will realise that one cannot on one hand quote President Obama&#146;s inaugural speech, and deny on the other hand what his National Security Council says. I am happy to stick by what President Obama said. The National Security Council, which sits in the White House, speaks for the US Government&#151;</p>

It is based on the nature of the relationship that we have, and the nature of that relationship is not dependent on one cable or another, but on the fact that if another country cannot have confidence that its secrets are safe with us, it will not share its secrets with us in an open and transparent way with the relevant authorities.</p>

That is not correct.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Until the end of 2005&#151;certainly throughout 2005&#151;the Government&#146;s focus was on bringing back the nine British citizens. We wanted to work hard to take that experience into account before moving to the separate class of issue to do with the former residents. In that context, the Home Secretary and I were presented with the work that had been done when we took office at the end of June 2007. Five weeks later, we were able to apply for their release.</p>

Member for Ashford (Damian Green)? It is important to bear in mind that concern is not by any means confined to the Opposition.

 Further to that point of order. Two issues are now clear. First, as Mr. Speaker said, privilege&#151;the protection that Members of Parliament enjoy&#151;is a matter for the House. Secondly, it is clear from the conduct of the investigation that those carrying it out for the Metropolitan police are well aware of that because they appear to have been contacting the House and its servants to ascertain what might be privileged and what might not. Given that the decision ultimately falls to the House, is not it a strange state of affairs that the House is being denied the opportunity of getting the advice that it needs to make a reasonable decision? There has been no reference to the Standards and Privileges Committee, which has been set up for that express purpose. Could you please ensure that the Speaker is aware that the way in which the matter is developing gives rise to serious concern?</p>

Fighting has continued even within the Government-declared safe zone, and on Sunday a hospital that had been declared a no-fire zone was shelled three times. Further shelling has taken place this week. The United Nations reports that at least 50 civilians have died at the hospital and that many more have been wounded, including women and children. There are more civilian casualties every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90205-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000426">Those attacks are serious violations of international humanitarian law. Any attempts, including by representatives of the Sri Lankan Government, to defend the shelling of the hospital are frankly unacceptable. We expect and urge the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate any allegations of abuses by their forces. We would support a full investigation into the shelling of the hospital and into other civilian deaths. The primary burden for investigation rests on the authority against whose forces allegations of war crimes are made, and we expect such investigations to be undertaken.</p>

They jointly called for a no-fire period to allow civilians to leave the conflict area and to allow humanitarian agencies access. There is no doubt that there is also concern in the United Nations about the safety and well-being of civilians caught up in the conflict, as the Secretary-General made clear in his statements of 26 and 30 January. We fully support the Secretary-General&#146;s sentiments and endorse his call for both sides to the conflict to abide by those important humanitarian obligations.</p>

Reaching a political solution now is in the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s interests. We also urge the LTTE to renounce terrorist methods and to demonstrate a genuine commitment to participate in a democratic political process to resolve the conflict. The LTTE should be doing all that it can to protect civilians at a time when Sri Lankan Tamils are suffering the worst effects of the conflict.

We continue to be concerned about the use of child soldiers by paramilitary groups, the culture of ethnic discrimination and the reports of abductions, disappearances and extra-judicial killings of civilians. The fact that prosecutions for such abuses are rare is feeding a dangerous culture of impunity. The Government of Sri Lanka clearly have a direct responsibility to tackle all human rights violations. Only by ensuring that full and thorough investigations into such violations are followed by successful prosecutions of those responsible will the Government strengthen the rule of law and tackle this corrosive culture of impunity.</p>

 I concur with nearly everything the Minister said. One of the most depressing aspects of this debate is that the war&#151;and it is a war&#151;has been going on since 1983. I suspect that the Sri Lankan Government are probably their own worst enemy, as was suggested earlier. They might believe that this final military campaign will end the war and they will achieve total victory, but our own history is littered with far too many examples to show that, although there will be a military victory and they will occupy the last areas held by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, we will then see a new form of war that will probably be conducted in a much more ferocious and violent way. It is up to us, who regard ourselves as friends of the Sri Lankan Government, to persuade them of the undoubted errors of their ways.</p>

 I welcome the bipartisan approach that is being taken here today. That is different from the debates that we have had in the past. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this is a matter not only of achieving a ceasefire, but of commencing a peace process immediately afterwards? Does he also agree that Britain has an important role to play, as we have in the past, in ensuring that the peace talks get going as quickly as possible?</p>

 I agree absolutely with the right hon. Gentleman. Indeed, the history of the conflict is one of stop-start peace negotiations, during which it is possible to allocate blame at different times to both sides. The House will know that my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), when he was a Foreign Office Minister in 1997, actually brokered a ceasefire and an agreement, which held for a considerable period. There are examples from both sides of the House of attempts to get the ceasefire moving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90205-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000462">My assessment is that, at the moment, it is not in the narrow military interests of Sri Lanka&#146;s Government to allow what everybody has been asking for. They genuinely believe that the war will be finished within the next two or three weeks, so they are going to endure the pressures, the criticisms and the pleas from the international community, and particularly the British Government, to accede to the suggestions that have been made, whether it be to let in the international media, to allow humanitarian aid, or whatever. It is in the Government&#146;s interests not to do that, whereas it is obviously in the LTTE&#146;s interests desperately to hope for a ceasefire to prevent, as it were, the final endgame.</p>

 Is not the fallacy in the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s position the fact that the legacy of enmity and bitterness created in the north of the island and the polarisation of opinion will militate against the conditions in which a peaceful settlement can actually be agreed?</p>

 I fear that the hon. Gentleman may well be right, but I also want to put on record, as I suspect did the Minister, the view that dreadful wrongs have been done on both sides. In trying to take a view on who is right and wrong, we should remember that at different times, both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government have decided to end a ceasefire. However noble the cause that the LTTE sees itself as defending, it  <br>

needs to be recognised that it has indulged in some appalling terrorist atrocities: it is an incredibly effective terrorist organisation, which has provided an example of terrorist methods for many other such organisations. However much it believes in its cause, we must remember that the LTTE assassinated a Sri Lankan president and was involved in the assassination of the Prime Minister of India, so the fear and loathing felt by the majority population is understandable. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90205-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000465">My only hope lies in the possibility that if, at the end of two or three weeks, the Sri Lankan Government see that they have won a victory, there will be some voices within that Government calling to open up new negotiations. However, I could well understand it if the LTTE, having suffered such a humiliating defeat, decided not to engage in them and ratcheted up the terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90205-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000466">The objective of all of us and of the British Government is, as the Minister said, to put as much pressure as possible over the next two or three weeks on the Sri Lankan Government to carry out the humanitarian action that is required. Indeed, it is in that Government&#146;s best interests to do so, as they will eventually have to come to terms with international opinion. Secondly, we should protest as much as we can when the media are attacked or intimidated by either side; we must make certain that we have an absolutely fair balance. Finally, we should spell out to the Sri Lankan Government the types of ultimate sanction that the international community could impose. A number of organisations could do that.</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend is a military historian. It is important to be clear that, however the Sri Lankan Government see the position militarily, there can be no international credibility in a purely military victory&#151;indeed, that will not be a victory. Anything that happens militarily must be accompanied by solutions that involve suffrage for the Tamil community. Should we not say to the Sri Lankan Government that the model established for the eastern provincial council elections, whatever its imperfections, provides a way forward, in that it involves the Tamil community in the suffrage process?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Our history and the history of the world are littered with instances where majorities have tried to impose an undemocratic system on a minority. There is ultimately a solution, as history shows: it involves driving the minority out completely. That, I suspect, will prove impossible in Sri Lanka, and I think that some elements within the Sri Lankan Government and within the majority recognise that. Although the situation is dark and one has great reason to be pessimistic, we should nevertheless continue our best efforts to reach a solution that successive British Governments have worked so hard to achieve.</p>

They do not know what has happened to their loved ones, or even whether they are alive, injured or, worse still, dead. We have a real responsibility because of our history with Sri Lanka, because we speak for our own constituents and a huge Tamil community of British citizens, and because of our deep concern about the current situation.</p>

It flies in the face of earlier guarantees and clearly contravenes international law. The Sri Lankan Government have made it clear that civilians should move to the safe zone, but, as we have heard, civilians are not safe in the safe zone and we know that they are not being enabled to move to the safe zone. We have also heard reports of attacks on both civilians and international aid workers in the safe zone.</p>

 I am delighted that we are speaking as one in the House today. The message to the Sri Lankan Government must be loud and clear: British parties of all colours demand a ceasefire, demand justice for the Tamil people, and demand that humanitarian assistance be allowed through. A very welcome voice is being heard from the House today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90205-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000494">Let me first praise the right hon.

I also praise the Minister for the strong words that he used, and, indeed, praise the words of the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson). I disagreed with the hon. Gentleman on only one small issue: I still think that we need to argue for the ceasefire. He may be right in saying that the Sri Lankan Government will not heed our calls, but I nevertheless believe that we should make them loud and clear. Unless we do so, there is a danger not just that more civilians and soldiers will be killed, but that there will be massacres in the Vanni region, where there are hundreds of thousands of civilians and troops.</p>

However, I urge the Government to go further. As I said in a letter to the Prime Minister recently, they should go to the United Nations Security Council. We need the whole international community to speak as one. We need to work for that, because the Sri Lankan Government should be in no doubt about how the international community feels. I am aware of the dangers involved, because it is always difficult to get a resolution through the United Nations Security Council. That is why I think we should call on some of our international colleagues to recognise the significance of the situation.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but it is also true that we are one of the big players in the United Nations. Even if we do not get a resolution through, it is important that one should be raised at the Security Council.</p>

 I agree, but let me identify some of the challenges that the Government face in trying to secure that resolution. The first comes from China. Britain and others have rightly reduced aid to Sri Lanka because of our opposition to some of its Government&#146;s measures, not just recently but over a number of years, and the Chinese have filled the vacuum. They are now sending &#163;500 million of aid to Sri Lanka. We must tell them that it is not acceptable to give that amount of aid to a Government who are breaking international law. We must tell them&#151;presumably quietly&#151;that what they need to do in order to make amends is vote for a Security Council resolution. I believe that, with the Chinese and the Americans, we will bring the French and the Russians along as well.</p>

The fact that the Iranians are sending &#163;900 million of aid in soft loans, grants and cheap oil should tell us everything that we need to know about the current Sri Lankan regime: its biggest friends are in Tehran. Does Sri Lanka really want to put itself in that position? Does it want to isolate itself along with Iran? It used to be a fantastic country. It used to be more democratic. It used to uphold the rights of individuals and minorities. Now, through the way in which it is behaving both to its own people and internationally, it is putting itself in serious jeopardy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90205-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000499">Last March, the State Department of the United States issued a report accusing the Sri Lankan Government of attacking civilians and practising torture, kidnapping, hostage-taking and extortion with impunity.

 One of the biggest obstacles, in my view, is Sri Lanka itself. On the last occasion when President Rajapaksa came to the United Kingdom, I was privileged to have an opportunity to ask him about the human rights situation there. He told me that national human rights organisations were simply a front for the Tamil Tigers, and that international human rights organisations were simply gun-running for the Tamil Tigers. With that psychology, he must realise that we have a major impediment to overcome.</p>

In international discussions, there are too many countries who hide behind the idea that they are democracies; they think that as they have elections and voting, they are somehow beyond the law, but they are not. Democracies are not beyond the law, particularly when they abuse the rule of law, allow minorities to be attacked and attack civil liberties and human rights. In my view, that makes them non-democracies. Sri Lanka has a proud history as a fantastic democracy and country. In the early &#146;70s, it was not just a beautiful island&#151;many parts still are beautiful&#151;but it reduced infant mortality and increased adult literacy to levels not seen even in our country. In the past, democracy in Sri Lanka produced fantastic achievements. That is why what is happening now is so tragic. It is betraying its own history, as well as its own people.</p>

 Since the end of last year, the eyes of the world have been on Gaza and southern Israel. There have been humanitarian aid appeals, debates in the House and statements from Ministers. However, while everyone focused on that area, a nasty, vicious, unremitting offensive was launched in north-east Sri Lanka at the end of last year, and I, like other Members who represent Tamil communities, have been inundated with letters and e-mails demanding that our Government take action. An appalling humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded almost unseen because the Sri Lankan Government have forbidden journalists to go there to report it. There has been a full-scale war with little or no respect for the human rights of the civilians, all of them Tamil, who are trapped in the battle&#151;a battle for survival for the LTTE, and a battle for conquest for the Sri Lankan Government.</p>

Jaffna. People have repeatedly been displaced with inadequate food, shelter or medicine. Civilians face extreme risks in the safe zones from indiscriminate fire. On 28 January, the American Ceylon mission at Suthanthirapuram was bombed; 17 people were killed and 39 injured, including three orphans. At the time the Government of Sri Lanka had declared the area a neutral zone. On 30 January, the UN Secretary-General called on the Sri Lankan Government to ensure that civilians fleeing from Vanni were treated in accordance with international standards.

We have heard about the 75,000 people who have been killed&#151;the figure I had was 70,000, so I am distressed to hear of the reassessment to 75,000&#151;and the 250,000 people who have been displaced. Non-governmental organisations must be allowed into Sri Lanka now. I welcome the suggestion made by Labour Members that a new special envoy should be appointed to replace the right hon.

As I have said in debates on other issues and other conflicts around the world, any loss of innocent life, on any side, is a tragedy. We are duty-bound to do something about this. What really holds fear for me is the fact that hospitals are being bombed and innocent people are being caught in the middle of a conflict.

It is vital that this debate of such importance has taken place; I, too, feel that the Leader of the House should be complimented on providing time for it.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this much needed debate. It gives me the opportunity to tell the House of the terrible circumstances in which the Tamil people of Sri Lanka are living.

It has been difficult to get the message to a wider audience, but through this debate, the continued demonstrations and campaigning by UK Tamils and the increased awareness of the world&#146;s media, the appalling situation that innocent Tamil civilians find themselves in is becoming clear and the pressure for an immediate ceasefire and a long- term, just and peaceful settlement of this conflict is growing.</p>

After 25 years of conflict, it is clear that there is no military solution. A peaceful negotiated long-term settlement that enshrines the rights of the Tamil people in a federal constitution that devolves real power to the Tamils is desperately needed. All parties need to agree to an immediate ceasefire and get back to the negotiating table. Norway, the broker of the 2002 to 2005 ceasefire, and India, Sri Lanka&#146;s neighbour, need to be brought back into the picture to help bring about a lasting peace. I have used my own contacts with the Indian Government and Parliament to help in this regard and will continue to do so. It is in the interests of India and all the other neighbouring countries for there to be a resolution of this long-running conflict and for there to be regional stability.</p>

 What I recognise in this debate compared with the Adjournment debate that took place at the end of the Session before Christmas is a very changed atmosphere; unfortunately, our tolerance towards what has being going on with the Sri Lankan Government has come to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90205-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000534">Many hon. Members representing London constituencies &#151;south London constituencies in particular&#151;attended two separate meetings, one with the Foreign Secretary and the other with the Prime Minister. I was genuinely impressed by the Government&#146;s very real concern to secure, by any appropriate means, a ceasefire in Sri Lanka; there was realism as to the leverage that the Government have and the need to work, and importance of working, with European partners and other powers around the world. It was prescient of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to have those meetings with us before that large crowd of 100,000 British people marched past this place last Saturday. It is no wonder that there should have been such a strong showing of concern. The attendance was much greater than the Metropolitan police had anticipated, but 100,000 is their estimate of the number who attended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90205-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000535">No wonder so many turned up when we hear stories of the Government of Sri Lanka suggesting that civilians move to so-called safe zones where they are then killed by actions by the Sri Lankan army. No wonder people are concerned when hospital compounds that include paediatric wards and intensive care units are shelled. In those circumstances, it is no wonder that so many Members of Parliament are in their places today and are keen for the appropriate leverage to be applied. Appropriate work has been done with our European partners on suspending European Union grants, but other sanctions may be required to ensure that further action is taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90205-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000536">The Sri Lankan Government still appear to be of the view that they can secure an unconditional surrender. The use of that term makes me very concerned about what the next steps will be in the treatment of the Tamil population in Sri Lanka. There is a real danger that some dreadful retribution will be meted out by the Government on the Tamil people&#151;Tamils who are not terrorists, but simply the fellow countrymen of the Sri Lankan Government, who have pursued the foolish policy of waging war on their own people.</p>

The Government do not seem to care what else happens as they try to do that. That is why we see the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of areas that the Government know contain huge numbers of civilians. Even though a safe area was declared, there was no way for people to reach it, so it was an utterly pointless declaration. The Government are not interested in a ceasefire, because they see this as an opportunity, and that is why pressure from outside is so important.</p>

Enormous pressure needs to be applied from outside. We know the history of arbitrary detentions and disappearances, and other human rights abuses that have gone on and on without anyone being held responsible. That is why, in the end, we need a political solution that recognises the rights of the Tamil people. Without outside pressure and influence, that will not happen. We have to keep the need for a political solution high on our agenda, and consider what we can do through an envoy or mediation. We cannot impose a solution, but we should do whatever we can to encourage it. The message to the Government of Sri Lanka should be clear: they need to make progress towards a political solution.</p>

It is supported by the Hope Outreach UK charity, which is run by a Tamil GP in Milton Keynes, Dr. Sam Muthuveloe. After it was damaged in the tsunami, the orphanage was rebuilt thanks to contributions from many people in Milton Keynes. It is managed by the Anglican Church, but was bombed by Sri Lankan air force bombers, fortunately after the girls had been evacuated to another area.

Sri Lankan Tamils elsewhere in Sri Lanka, at least with the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s collusion if not their active participation, the civilians in the north do not feel that they can trust the Government with their safety. That is part of the reason they are not coming out. Of course they are not safe under bombardment, but they are not confident that they would be safe in the hands of the Sri Lankan Government either, particularly since my understanding is that almost all the men who come out are suspected by the Sri Lankan Government of being actively involved with the Tamil Tigers and are therefore under particular threat of harm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90205-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000553">It is incredibly important that the Sri Lankan Government understand that they have to be seen as a protector of all their citizens and should not just assume that every Tamil is in league with the Tamil Tigers, because they are not, even though all Tamils would, of course, want their individual rights to be respected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90205-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000554">My second point, which has not yet been made, is about the way the Sri Lankan Government had clearly been planning this onslaught for some time and had, for several years, been indulging in what might be called a massive shopping spree to upgrade their arms so that they were ready to take on the Tamil Tigers. Members of this House have been asking our Government for some time why the Sri Lankan Government were spending so much money on accumulating arms. We have asked them to look at the arms export process and to take into account what one might call disproportionate military expenditure, which might lead one to suspect that a Government were intending to use those arms for external aggression or internal repression. I know that such an approach is more difficult than dealing with it when it is going on, as it is now, but I would be grateful if the Government could take this point away and think about using their military intelligence, if I can put it that way, to try to perceive when a Government might be trying to build up their capacity to be used in a way that we would not support&#151;the Sri Lankan Government have done so.</p>

Members who speak out in this House on this issue do so to condemn equally the atrocities committed by both sides, to further humanitarian aid ambitions and to ensure that there is a peaceful solution? We do not condone terrorism: we are implacably opposed to it.</p>

 Absolutely. Many of us have been accused of being supporters of the Tamil Tigers, but I have never supported terrorism as a way forward in Sri Lanka. My appeal is to the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to renounce arms, but the Tamils will do so only if they have confidence that they will be protected. Just as the Sri Lanka Government may not have confidence in many Tamils, for reasons good or bad, so many Tamils will not have confidence in the Government. I am afraid that that is the position on the ground, and that is why the international agencies and organisations such as the UN&#146;s Commission on Human Rights, UNICEF, the International Committee of the Red Cross and others need to be present. Only with them there can there be any confidence in the north of Sri Lanka that there can be fair treatment.</p>

The very people who are coming out of the troubled areas are kept in open camp with barbed wires around with no proper shelter. They are not allowed outside, nor are any relatives able to contact them or take them away to be looked after. The injured children are taken to the hospital but the mums are not allowed with them. They are crying out for help. This reminds me of the Hitler days and the pictures I have seen on films.

Unless Tamil people have a proper part in the future, and can determine their own part and their level of autonomy, there will not be peace. My call, and that of colleagues, is for the people of Sri Lanka at home and abroad to make it clear that the current politics of the Sri Lankan Government will never succeed. The Sri Lankan Government should realise that they need to be as magnanimous as other failing dictatorships have been; and that until they are, they will not have peace on their island. This is probably the most important issue facing the Commonwealth, and one of the most important facing the United Nations.</p>

on both sides of the Chamber who speak far better and far more knowledgeably than I, but with every word uttered, I become more frustrated on behalf of all the UK Tamils who live in my constituency and the constituencies of other hon.

Walking down the high street, we had the chance to meet some people who lived there. It is absolutely clear that Jaffna is, to all intents and purposes, a prison camp.

pressure at the UN and the need for an envoy, but the Sri Lankan Government must commit to an immediate ceasefire, too. They must ensure safe passage not only for the poor innocent people currently affected by the conflict, but for those who come to the ceasefire table and for the UN human rights mission.

 May I add my voice to those heard from all parts of the House, including from the Minister, calling in the strongest possible terms for the Sri Lankan Government to do everything they can to minimise the humanitarian disaster that we are beginning to see unfolding in the north of the island? Yesterday, according to the UN, 52 innocent civilians died. Many hon. Members have spoken about the 250,000 Tamils trapped between opposing forces. We have heard about the so-called safe area, yet all the evidence suggests that that is currently being bombed, with excuses for that being made on both sides. Even the one hospital available for those innocently wounded in the conflict has been bombed and has had to close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000577">The Sri Lankan army seems determined, as many hon. Members have said, to eradicate the LTTE. That is perhaps not surprising, given the history of the conflict. However, that appears to have blinded the army and, more important, the Government to the plight of innocent civilians in that part of the country. On the other side, Amnesty is reporting today that a convoy of 300 innocent wounded civilians, including 50 children, was prevented from leaving the area by the LTTE. The first thing we all need to agree on is the urgent need for humanitarian relief. That should combine a corridor to allow innocent civilians to get out of the trap in which they are caught with a UN assistance mission to provide food and medicines to people in the north of the island.</p>

people have died in mysterious circumstances or have left the country because of the climate of intolerance, and we hear daily of the abduction, detention and disappearance of people on the island. I urge the Minister to raise the issue at the highest level. There must be independent investigation to root out why such human rights abuses are happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000579">Everybody has asked whether there will be a military victory. One is undoubtedly possible, but the important point is that that would not be the end of the violence; all independent opinion tells us that. The Sri Lankan Government have not dealt with the underlying causes of the conflict: the real grievances felt by the Tamil community and the aspirations that are rarely discussed in Government circles. I have been saddened that the call for a ceasefire has not been met with any support from either side, but I am particularly sad that the Government have rejected the opportunity to negotiate with the other side so that the situation could move forward from being a military conflict to being a peace settlement. That needs to happen, otherwise there will be guerrilla warfare again and terrorist activity might even intensify. The reality is that the conflict will not occur only in the north of the island; it will be taken to all quarters of it, and that cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000584">This is an important moment for this debate. Pakistan is struggling to deal with its turbulent tribal areas, and Afghanistan faces presidential and provincial elections this year. As NATO approaches its 60th-anniversary summit in April, it faces important questions about its performance and rationale.

A mix of violent extremist groups poison the tribal belt on both sides of the Durand line. There are intimate connections between the insurgency in Helmand and that in Waziristan, and between the criminals, spoilers and terrorists who operate in Kandahar and Quetta, Peshawar and Nangahar. A combined and comprehensive approach is needed. However, the responses in each country have to be different. In Afghanistan, a UN-mandated, NATO and EU-supported international effort&#151;military and civilian&#151;helps the Government. In Pakistan, the international community must play a different role in supporting the new, democratic Government in their response to violent extremism.</p>

 I would say two things about that.

If people have any sense of inflated expectations, which has not come from this country, I would invite them to visit Afghanistan and Pakistan and realise what the real agenda is.</p>

 If the right hon. and learned Gentleman means that we should withdraw from our commitments to Afghanistan, I do not agree with that fundamental reassessment. It is clear from my experience, and that of everyone I have talked to, that the withdrawal of British and other international forces would lead to the collapse of Afghanistan&#146;s first democratic Government and to the overwhelming of the Afghan state, with very serious consequences. After all, Afghanistan is the incubator of choice for al-Qaeda. For that reason, we have a central national interest in sustaining the ability of the democratic Government in Afghanistan to defend themselves. The critical point, as I shall try to explain, is that we are not in Afghanistan to create a new colony; we are there to enable the Afghan people, the Afghan Government and the Afghan state to defend themselves.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will know that the Foreign Affairs Committee is about to begin an inquiry into Pakistan and Afghanistan; no doubt he and Ministers will give evidence to us in coming months. He mentioned the Durand line. Does he agree that one of the fundamental problems in the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is that the Afghan Government do not accept that border and there is almost open movement between the two countries, which makes it almost impossible to deal with the problem of terrorism and insurgency on both sides?</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="09020541000601"><a name="90205-0013.htm_spnew13"><a name="09020541001403"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 I would certainly say that disputes over the Durand line get in the way of the sort of co-operation that is necessary. However, as I shall say later, the fact that President Karzai and President Zadari have broken the taboo of the past eight years and are now working together, rather than pointing fingers at each other, is one of the important steps forward that has happened in the past six or seven months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000602">Having outlined what I see as the objectives, it is important to pay tribute&#151;with the support of the whole House, I am sure&#151;to the soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and women who risked their lives for the mission in Afghanistan. It is also important to recognise the efforts of British diplomats and aid workers who have risked their lives, although under the protection of the armed forces. The armed forces in Afghanistan serve with unflinching courage and professionalism, which I have seen for myself, and they are a credit to the nation. It is right to salute not just their courage but their sacrifice. Some 143 members of the armed services tragically lost their lives in Afghanistan. Their friends and family need to know that the country will never forget them or their loved ones. It is also important to recognise the sacrifices of the Afghan army and police, and of the Pakistani army and frontier corps, as well as the thousands of ordinary Afghans and Pakistanis who have lost their lives in the conflict.</p>

The insurgency is changing its shape, but not receding. In parts of each country, the sense of security for ordinary people, as well as for coalition forces, is deteriorating. In Afghanistan, the insurgents are increasingly relying on asymmetric tactics. There has been a fourfold increase in the use of improvised explosive devices in Helmand province over the past year. The Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies reported more than 2,000 terrorist, insurgent and sectarian  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09020541000604">In Afghanistan, corruption is widespread and is not receiving the treatment it needs. Elections have been set for August, but political uncertainty remains over that debate. Our commitment is to support credible elections in Afghanistan. In that context, I am pleased to commit a further &#163;10.6 million to support the elections, predominantly funded by the Department for International Development, in addition to the &#163;6 million that we have already provided. Our contribution will support election operations run by the independent election commission in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09020541000605">On the economic front, Afghanistan remains an extremely poor country. Despite growth in recent years, more than half the population still live on less than $1 a day, and last year Pakistan saw its currency tumble and inflation soar. There is, however, another side of the ledger. As I indicated, the lead of Presidents Karzai and Zardari has led to improved cross-border co-operation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. I heard for myself from General Kayani about the new co-operation between coalition forces and the Pakistani forces in the northern part of the FATA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90205-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09020541000606">Over the past year in Helmand, we have seen the Afghan authorities, with our support and encouragement, retake three districts: Musa Qala in the north, Garmsir in the south, and Nad-e &#146;Ali in the centre. The number of districts under Government control has doubled, and more than half the population of the province are now under the jurisdiction of the legitimate Afghan Government for the first time. A dynamic new Interior Minister, Hanif Atmar, has been appointed and is at last starting to deal with the state of his ministry and critically, the police service that it supervises.</p>

The number of poppy-free provinces has risen to 18, covering more than half the country&#146;s provinces, and the legal Afghan economy continues to grow, helped by the record $21 billion of assistance pledged in Paris last June. The benefits of that growth are still very patchy, but today 6 million children are in school, compared with only 2 million in 2002. Many more people have access to basic health care and child mortality rates are falling.</p>

With the new wish to engage in Afghanistan on the part of the United States, it is the time to work. We are seeing some straws in the wind, with the US beginning to see the UK approach as more effective in the delivery of aid in the more stable parts of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000611">As it happens, I talked to Ambassador Holbrooke this morning about the wheat distribution programme that has been developed by Governor Mangal in Helmand, which I saw for myself when I visited Garmsir last year. That programme is helping farmers to choose legal production rather than opium production, which is significant. I also spoke to Secretary Clinton, who has bold ideas about how she wants to reconfigure the US aid effort. I think that I am right in saying that there are a large number of funding streams to Afghanistan from the US development effort, and we certainly want to work closely with the US as it reviews that matter.</p>

 Did Secretary Clinton mention anything about reconciliation and bringing the Taliban and organisations such as Hizb-e-Islami into the political process? Is it true that President Karzai called for a jihad against us in a Cabinet meeting recently?</p>

 I have seen no report to that effect, and whenever I meet President Karzai he tells me that he is very committed to the partnership between Britain and Afghanistan. However, one must acknowledge that although he rightly has a fair degree of anger about civilian deaths, that sometimes spills over into rather more generalised attacks on the role of coalition forces that could give a different impression. The hon. Gentleman asks about reconciliation. I shall certainly address it, as it is an important part of the agenda. I assure him that I will come to that, and if he does not feel that I have covered it, he should intervene again.</p>

 The civilian deaths have been a formidable obstacle to our attempts to win hearts and minds. We have heard of a British officer being brought home for allegedly giving information to Human Rights Watch about the extent of civilian deaths. Human Rights Watch claims that there were about 1,600 such deaths last year, and the United Nations Association puts the figure at more than 2,000. What is the Foreign Secretary&#146;s estimate of the number of civilian deaths that were caused last year?</p>

 I am not going to make an estimate today, but I am happy to write to my hon. Friend with the best estimate that we have. He is right to say that civilian deaths are a major cause of disaffection among the local population. I hope that he will be reassured that one thing that we are working actively on with NATO command and our American and other coalition partners is how to minimise coalition deaths and promote openness and transparency with the Afghan Government when such tragedies occur.</p>

civilian deaths as a tragedy, one is saying that one does not just regret them but regrets them deeply, both for the sake of the individuals concerned and for the message that they send more widely. One of the first principles of British action anywhere in the world is the need to minimise civilian deaths, not just because it is a legal obligation but because there is a moral obligation. It is also a material factor in whether the coalition effort succeeds.</p>

<p><a name="st_o312"><a name="09020541000618"><a name="90205-0014.htm_spnew7"><a name="09020541001412"><b>Mr. Chris Mullin (Sunderland, South) (Lab):</b>
 Does not much of the problem with civilian deaths arise from the fact that part of the American force is not part of the NATO operation? Those forces do not appear to co-operate. That part of the American force is careless about what it gets up to. Three times, it has bombed wedding parties.</p>

 It is for that reason that General McKiernan is now in charge of both the NATO operation and Operation Enduring Freedom. That is an important step forward and speaks to the need for co-operation between the two forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000620">As for Pakistan, the &#163;7.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan that it secured last November has helped to plug the hole in its balance of payments, and it is making progress in implementing the accompanying economic reform programme. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I, along with many others, have urged faster and further action against those associated with the Mumbai attacks, and prosecution and then punishment for those found guilty. Clearly, however, the fight cannot be won by military means alone. Military action needs to be backed by a comprehensive political and economic plan, and that is the prospect that is now held out in the Holbrooke review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000621">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear in his statement to the House on Afghanistan in December 2007, and again a year later, the key to our policy is helping the Afghans stabilise and govern their country. Let me highlight today three important issues for the future, including reconciliation, which the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway) mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000622">The first principle of our policy is to build the capacity of the Afghan state to root out the insurgency and provide basic security and justice for its citizens. By building up the Afghan national army&#151;now around 60,000 or 65,000 strong&#151;and creating an Afghan national police force worthy of its name, we are working to strengthen indigenous Afghan capacity for the long term. In creating systems of governance and of justice, at district, provincial and national level, we are trying to ensure sustainability by working with the grain of Afghan tradition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000623">The Department for International Development&#146;s work to reform the civil service and ensure transparent allocation of Government funds will help make the state more credible and more effective at delivering basic services. By supporting 18,000 community development councils, and providing small business loans to more than 280,000 Afghan women, the Department is empowering some of the poorest communities to take more responsibility for their security and development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000624">The second element that I want to highlight is political reconciliation. Al-Qaeda draws its support from being part of a wider insurgency that seeks to usurp the authority of the state. However, the insurgents are  <br>

neither strong nor united. They have different motivations and come from different backgrounds: ideological Taliban, $10-a-day Taliban, fighters from beyond the region, criminals and narco-traffickers, warlords and wannabe local power brokers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000625">The insurgents are not popular. In poll after poll, the people say that they have tried Taliban rule and detested the experience. However, they dread their return, and doubt the local authorities&#146; ability to resist them, so they hedge their bets. They support them out of fear rather than free will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000626">Our strategy is to help the Afghan Government divide the insurgency, and co-opt those who are prepared to renounce al-Qaeda, obey the laws and accept the principles of the Afghan constitution. Equipping the Afghan authorities with the means and the authority to conduct such reconciliation activity both nationally and&#151;critically, in my view, locally&#151;is key to the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000627">Thirdly, there is military force. By pressurising those who refuse to co-operate with the Afghan state, and protecting those who do, it can directly support political reconciliation. By enabling the Afghans to secure and stabilise their territory, then delivering aid and promoting development, the military show not only that the insurgents can be defeated, but what is possible once they have gone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000628">There is no purely military solution to the problems of insurgency and disorder in Helmand or across Afghanistan generally. However, equally, there is no non-military solution. That is why our approach&#151;creating a combined civil-military mission in Helmand, staffed by some 65 civilians and some 55 military officers, and led by a civilian&#151;has been so important, and, I believe, right. It is also why, when I say that Britain is in Afghanistan as part of an international effort, I refer not only to the NATO-led military force of some 41 nations, but the civil alliance, which encompasses some 60 nations and international organisations.</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="09020541000629"><a name="90205-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="09020541001414"><b>Paul Flynn:</b>
 My right hon. Friend is being generous in giving way. Does he recall that we had a military surge in Helmand province, as a result of which the number of British deaths increased from seven in 2006 to 143 now? Will not any military surge by NATO be met by an even bigger surge by the Taliban?</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="09020541000630"><a name="90205-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="09020541001415"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 It depends. If my hon. Friend is saying that a military surge must be accompanied by a political and an economic surge if it is to succeed, he is right. That is the essence of what we are trying to do. Before we went there, Helmand was ungoverned space&#151;certainly, it was not governed by the Kabul authorities. Although my hon. Friend is right to point to the high number of deaths on the British side, it is also right to say that, for the first time, more than half the province is being properly governed&#151;not by us, but by Governor Mangal. That must be a step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09020541000631">The Government are determined to improve donor co-ordination, and to strengthen the role of the excellent UN special representative of the Secretary-General and his mission. We talk a lot about improving Afghan governance, and it is important to put on record our commitment to improving international governance, too. The Afghan authorities are right when they say that too much of the international effort is confused or confusing, and too much of it fails to get maximum, optimum benefit&#151;</p>

 I am most grateful to the Foreign Secretary&#151;I will make best use of it. As we are putting the international house in order, may I suggest that the Government put their house in order and open up the discussion that is needed between the military and DFID about how our military forces can use cash instead of military force to achieve the effects that they want?

They resort to force when they need to. They are the first to say that their success depends on close work with DFID and Foreign Office diplomats. The civilian-military mission, and in particular the way that it brings together the British Government&#146;s different resources in the south, points the way forward.</p>

When I visited Islamabad last month, it was clear that both the civilian and the military leadership now recognised the severity of the threat from violent extremism. It is vital that we and other members of the international community support the democratic Government at this time, because a sustained focus on the terrorist threat requires Pakistan to take ownership of the struggle against violent extremism.  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>5 Feb 2009 : Column 1040</b><br>
It also requires determined action to root out existing terrorist networks across the country and prevent new ones from emerging. That means a comprehensive plan to increase security, improve governance and promote economic development in the federally administered tribal areas, FATA&#151;60 years after the creation of the state of Pakistan, the female literacy rate there is below 3 per cent.&#151;in order to complement the military actions being taken there. A sustained focus on the terrorist threat also means working with the Government of Afghanistan on a joint plan to address the insurgency on both sides of the border.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000642">To support that work, the UK is providing extensive bilateral counter-terrorism assistance. As well as providing training to build the Pakistani Government&#146;s counter-terrorism capacity, we have an active campaign to counter the ideology of extremism that feeds support for terrorism. International moderate Islamic scholars and ordinary British Muslims have taken part in the efforts to tackle al-Qaeda&#146;s distorted and divisive message, through public meetings and multi-media campaigns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000643">We are also providing long-term development assistance, with bilateral aid of some &#163;480 million to help poor and vulnerable people in Pakistan. Over the next three years, Pakistan will become one of the UK&#146;s largest aid recipients, because we believe that tackling poverty and exclusion are key to addressing the underlying causes of the conflict and insecurity in that country. DFID is expanding its assistance in education, for example. We will be increasing our development work in the areas bordering Afghanistan and we recently began work to strengthen the police in Pakistan&#146;s most troubled North West Frontier province. We are also supporting the Pakistani Government&#146;s attempt to stabilise and reform their economy. It is also vital that we mobilise practical and political support for Pakistan from across the international community, for example through the international Friends of Democratic Pakistan group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000644">I mentioned international co-operation and want to say a word about the regional context of our work in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Stability and development in both countries requires the active co-operation and engagement of neighbours and the broader region. A strong relationship is being built between Presidents Karzai and Zardari; there is Iranian investment in western Afghanistan and infrastructure development linking central and southern Asia. The countries of the region have a clear stake. The narcotics trade has hit Iran and Russia particularly hard, and conflict and instability are undermining the trade relationships that could strengthen regional economies and help lift people out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90205-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000645">The challenge is to build on existing links and turn political will into real change for ordinary people. Afghanistan and Pakistan should use the new excellent relations between their Presidents to build a broader working structure that can deliver concrete progress. Iran must decide that it will focus on positive engagement, rather than using Afghanistan as another opportunity for confrontation with the west. Pakistan needs to show its neighbours that it is determined to address the terrorist threat, and Afghanistan must secure the engagement of the broader region, involving Chinese investment, Indian development assistance and increased Russian engagement.</p>

Our choice, at great cost, has been to help them to meet them. We do so out of a clear view of our national interest in working with other countries to address terrorism at root. This is the rationale of our mission and, with the majority of terrorist plots against the UK linked back to Pakistan alone, no one believes that the threat is not real.</p>

 Does the Foreign Secretary not feel, particularly after his conversations with the Americans, that we can now either go left or go right? We can go the way that we have gone so far, which is leading us to disaster, or we can be a bit more intelligent and work very hard for a political settlement, backed up by force if necessary.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman would expect me to say that it is always better to be more intelligent than less intelligent in the way we approach these problems. The burden of my speech today has been to say that there is an opportunity to review what is going right and what is not, and to change what is going wrong and reinforce what is going right. A regional focus is now emerging, which includes Pakistan and not just Afghanistan. That is something that Britain has urged for a long time. There is also a stress on Afghanisation, which was a feature of the Prime Minister&#146;s statement here in December 2007, and an emphasis on civilianisation and localisation. These form a package that can unite not only the coalition but, critically, Afghans and Pakistanis on this difficult and long-term issue.</p>

In the coming months, the organisation of the international effort, its focus and its balance will be renewed. The military and civil approach will be addressed, and international co-operation with the Afghan and Pakistani Governments and people will also be reviewed. However, the strategic commitment to build the capacity of the Afghan state will remain, and strengthening counter-terrorism in Pakistan will be essential. That is the only way to tackle the insurgency. The UK will enter the discussions in the months ahead with clarity about our insights from the past and determination to see a coherent and focused international effort for the future. On that basis, I look forward to taking into these discussions the ideas and views expressed today.</p>

 May I begin by welcoming the Government&#146;s decision to hold this all too short debate on one of the most pressing and intractable foreign policy challenges of our time? The Foreign Secretary has spoken of the decisions and reviews that will take place over the coming months. When we come to look back in future years, we are likely to find that the decisions that are made in the coming weeks will have been of decisive importance to the war raging in parts of Afghanistan and in Pakistan&#146;s tribal areas. The strategy now being worked on by General Petraeus and the Obama Administration is likely to be the one that leads either to eventual success&#151;however we define that&#151;or to the failure of our hopes for this deeply troubled part of the world.</p>

The Foreign Secretary will know that, for some time, we have argued for regular, detailed, quarterly reports to the House when British troops are engaged in prolonged action, with an explanation and assessment of objectives set and attained, and of the policy intentions and resources allocated for the future. In the absence of such reports, the Government have sometimes elided one stated objective into another less ambitious one, without much formal acknowledgment to Parliament. I will give the Foreign Secretary some examples, because he is looking a bit doubtful about that. For instance, the lead role for the United Kingdom in combating the Afghan narcotics trade was clearly trumpeted in our original objectives. However, the conversion of that lead role into a lower-key partner nation role emerged only in answers to written parliamentary questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000654">As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) has pointed out, we have recently seen a change of tone in how the objectives are spoken of by the US Defence Secretary, in a probably inevitable move away from idealism to realism that we should welcome. However, it was only through written parliamentary questions that we discovered that 17 British officials have, quite rightly, been working with, and effectively embedded within, the American strategy review.</p>

 Yes, it is very good, but perhaps Parliament should be informed of these things, without the information having to be elicited all the time through written answers.

I say to Ministers, however, that it is not clear from outside the Government what form that review will take or why the periodic assessment was not complete at the end of last year. From what one can tell from outside the Government, there are several overlapping processes going on rather than a single review. They include a process that the Prime Minister chairs in person but irregularly, trilateral meetings between the three relevant Departments chaired by the Foreign Secretary, an Afghanistan strategy group separate from that, a separate senior officials group and three separate strategy teams within the relevant Departments. I would be happy to be told that matters are better co-ordinated than that sounds, but it puzzles me why this work does  <br>

not take place as a single integrated review under the auspices of the National Security Committee that the Prime Minister announced in July 2007. A Downing street website lists the responsibilities of that Committee as discussing</p>
<a name="90205-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="09020541000662"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all issues relating to defence and counter-terrorism, including international defence and security&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000663">but the setting up of separate reviews of Afghanistan policy suggests that the Committee is not working together as an integrated departmental forum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000664">I make those points because the way government functions is fundamental to the consistent pursuit of a sound strategy and because there have undoubtedly been difficulties in co-operation between the relevant Departments in previous conflicts, which is one reason why I believe there are important lessons to be learned from the circumstances of the war in Iraq and why there should be no further delay in establishing an inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000665">Turning to the situation in Afghanistan now, it is clear to all of us who have visited that country in recent times that British servicemen and women&#151;and, indeed, the diplomats and aid workers to whom the Foreign Secretary referred&#151;do a job that is often little short of heroic and sometimes literally heroic, fighting in conditions of extreme heat or cold, spending long periods in close proximity to the enemy and using equipment often not originally designed for such situations or terrain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000666">In the last year, according to international security assistance force officials, there has been an increase of a third in the number of attacks against coalition forces, and of course a huge increase, to which the Foreign Secretary referred, in the number of improvised explosive device attacks in Helmand province against our own troops. All that is in the context of a truly vast country with huge deserts and dramatic mountain ranges. Seeing such terrain with one&#146;s own eyes brings home how difficult it is for relatively small numbers of troops to control that sort of formidable terrain. As the noble Lord Ashdown pointed out last week in an article in <i> The Times</i>:</p>
<a name="90205-0015.htm_brev4"><a name="09020541001019"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are trying to win in Afghanistan with one twenty-fifth of the troops and one-fiftieth of the aid per head than in Bosnia. And... Afghanistan is much more difficult.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000667">In Helmand province the scale and difficulty of this challenge have meant that our forces have only relatively small areas under permanent and secure control&#151;a situation that has made the delivery of aid and reconstruction projects extremely difficult and the eradication of the narcotics trade, for the moment, impossible. Our troops do a wonderful job not only in relations with local communities but, of course, in military terms, winning every tactical encounter and often inflicting sustained and serious damage on their enemy. But as we all know, that is not the same as controlling the ground or achieving a strategic victory.</p>

It is to confine our forces in Helmand and other NATO forces in difficult areas near their bases, while attacking NATO&#146;s supply lines and beginning to make life more difficult in Kabul itself, so that it starts to feel being closed in on. Following the destruction of a bridge in the Khyber pass in recent days and the apparent intention of the Government of Kyrgyzstan to deny the United States the use of the Manas air base,  <br>

Ministers may wish to expand at the end of the debate on the outlook for NATO&#146;s supply lines and assure the House that the operations of our troops will not be endangered by any disruptions to military and civilian supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000669">History teaches us that embarking on an attempt to conquer Afghanistan would be a foolish exercise, and military experts would tell us that any such attempt would require many times the level of forces that the United States and the rest of NATO have committed. But that, of course, has never been the objective. Our purpose has been to permit the people of Afghanistan to decide their own future in a way that enhances their own security and livelihoods without presenting a danger to the rest of the world. Success has therefore been predicated on popular support rather than military force on its own, for none of us has ever believed that there was a purely military solution to this conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000670">The great problem now appears to be that support among the Afghan people on a sufficiently widespread basis that the Taliban and its allies would find it impossible to prosecute the war depends on at least four factors being in place. The first is visibly effective reconstruction of the Afghan economy and infrastructure across the country; the second is effective government that is respected and not seen as arbitrary or corrupt; the third is relative security for Afghan families and communities; and the fourth is a perception of inevitable success rather than uncertainty about the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000671">I think it fair to say that the reason our troops are having such a difficult time in realising the vision of a peaceful and democratic Afghanistan is that at present none of those four essential requirements for their success is in place. The result is, at best, a strategic stalemate, and that is what the current review of strategy, particularly that taking place in Washington, must obviously set out to break.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000672">It is hugely welcome that President Obama has said all along, and said throughout this election campaign, that he would bring an urgent and fresh focus to Afghanistan, and has also said something confirmed by the appointment of Ambassador Holbrooke: that the United States will regard the issues of Afghanistan and Pakistan as an integrated whole. That General Petraeus, whom the Foreign Secretary will talk to later, is at the centre of Washington&#146;s strategic review is enormously encouraging, because he has shown in Iraq a keen sense of the need for political and military progress to run alongside each other. We now await details of the action proposed when the review has been completed. We hope that Ministers here will make a fresh statement in parallel with any announcements made in Washington, rather than the British Parliament&#146;s hearing about what is to happen on CNN one afternoon when we are not expecting it.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman quoted President Obama, who said just before his election &#147;Afghanistan is a priority for me. The solution to Afghanistan is not achievable without the help and involvement of Pakistan, and to secure some stability in Pakistan we must address the Kashmir issue.&#148; I note that the Foreign Secretary did not mention India or Kashmir&#151;probably rightly, as far as he is concerned. I wonder what the shadow Foreign Secretary, who has a freer remit, has to say about that. If he has nothing to say, I shall address the issue in my own speech.</p>

 The Foreign Secretary probably feels that he has said enough about Kashmir for the moment, and that we are all familiar with his views. Of course we all look forward to the day when India and Pakistan can together find a way forward on that issue. We know that they are often quite resistant to the idea that they can be told from outside what that way forward may be. So rather than expanding on the subject today and getting into difficulties similar to those experienced on the Government Front Bench recently, I will avoid the temptation and continue with the rather interesting points that I thought I was making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000675">The United States is considering an increase in its military presence in Afghanistan. Indeed, it has announced some increase, which we assume to have been a subject of discussion with United Kingdom officials. In the light of that, may I ask the Minister who will wind up the debate what the Government&#146;s assessment is of the number of additional troops that will be arriving in Afghanistan in 2009. How many of those troops will be operating in Regional Command South, and more specifically in Helmand province, and&#151;crucially for us&#151;what will be the command relationship between US and UK forces operating in Helmand province as part of ISAF?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000676">If the Government are to propose that the level of British forces in Afghanistan should be increased&#151;and there is much rumour of that at the moment&#151;we hope that Ministers will have at the forefront of their minds the serious overstretch of our military resources in recent years, in both human and material terms, as well as the huge contribution that British forces have already made. Conservative Members have long argued for a more rapid increase in the number of helicopters available to support our forces. Some changes appear to have been made, but they have largely related to an increase in flying hours rather than in actual helicopters, with the result that the number of helicopters that was servicing 3,000 soldiers at the beginning then had to service 8,000. We welcome the fact that some of the Merlin helicopters from Iraq will eventually be transferred to Afghanistan, but there remains a serious time gap before this new capability arrives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000677">I hope that when the Government present to Parliament the result of their review&#151;or the Washington review, perhaps, or a joint review&#151;they will ensure, especially if they are to propose an increase in our British troop levels, that that proposal is accompanied by a clear explanation of the military necessity and purpose of such a deployment. I also hope they will ensure that it is part of an overall strategy encompassing further improvements in the co-ordination of international aid&#151;we have been drawing attention to that for some years, and the Foreign Secretary joined us today in that&#151;and accompanied by a readiness by other NATO allies to increase their effort and, if necessary, to engage in actual fighting, and that it will give some indication as to how the better governance that is central to military success will eventually be achieved. It must be a civil, political and military strategy so that the people of Britain&#151;and, indeed, normal, peace-loving people in Afghanistan&#151;can have some confidence that it will succeed. I do not underestimate how formidably difficult it is to bring such a strategy together and execute it, but even for those of us outside the Government who do not possess all the necessary information and advice, it  <br>

seems clear that a new strategy must, as a minimum, have all the attributes I have listed, and I hope Ministers will also feel able to say that it must have all those attributes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000678">In addition, it is obvious to all that one of the key differences between defeating the insurgency in Iraq and the insurgents in Afghanistan is that in the latter case it is possible for them to take refuge on the territory of another country&#151;in the tribal areas of Pakistan. That is one of several reasons why the future stability and success of Pakistan as a nation are fundamental to our security and that of the wider world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09020541000679">Members in all parts of the House pay close attention to the affairs of Pakistan. We have all expressed the hope that the return of democracy will be for the long term, so that the repetitive cycle of democratic experiment and military intervention that has plagued Pakistan for decades comes to an end. For Pakistan, and for the future of the entire region, this is now a time of great opportunity, but of equally great danger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09020541000680">It is a time of opportunity because a new, democratically elected Government have come to power, and by all appearances that Government have made a serious effort to improve relations with Afghanistan and understand the importance of combating terrorism. The scale of the attacks on Pakistan itself&#151;most notably and tragically in recent times the bombing of the Marriott hotel in Islamabad&#151;has underlined the fact the Pakistan has no choice as a state but to try to root out terror from its territory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09020541000681">The danger lies in the sheer scale of the challenge. The federally administered tribal area alone covers more than 27,000 sq km, is not covered by national legislation, and has an impoverished and isolated population. Worryingly, power in recent times seems to be shifting from the traditional assemblies of tribal elders&#151;the jirgas&#151;to militant or neo-Taliban groups. Danger also lies in the economic condition of Pakistan, which is currently facing depleted foreign exchange reserves and an International Monetary Fund loan package but with every prospect of a continuing financial crisis. There have also been serious concerns about the role of elements of Pakistan&#146;s own internal security services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90205-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09020541000682">Our response to this must be serious, large scale and determined. We must do everything we can to help to entrench democracy for the long-term future in Pakistan, to encourage its leaders in their struggle against terrorism and to give financial assistance.</p>

 Does the right hon.

 It would undoubtedly have been one of the objectives of those who carried out those terrorist attacks to make relations between India and Pakistan worse and to reduce the effectiveness of their security co-operation. That is why all of us in the House look to the leaders of India and Pakistan to work together on a range of issues and to co-operate closely on the security challenge that they face.</p>

 My right hon. Friend began by saying that we have to tease answers from this Government to understand what is going on. There is no clearer illustration of that than the answers that came back highlighting the fact that there are no Pakistani army representatives in Helmand province and no British Army representatives on the other side of the border, in Pakistan. Pakistan&#146;s army is now making an effort to deal with the insurgency, but because it cannot communicate on the other side of the border, things are going via Kabul. Is that not one example of the fact that there is not a lot of communication? So much more could be done if that situation were improved.</p>

 I believe that Pakistan&#146;s armed forces have been making a considerably improved effort to deal with these matters in recent months. I have not looked at the particular point to which my hon. Friend refers but, undoubtedly, if that effort is to be effective, good communication across that border will be required. I shall certainly look at that point, and I hope that Ministers will do so too.</p>

The Opposition support that emphasis on assistance to Pakistan. We are very concerned about what has been happening in the border areas. We receive a lot of letters and e-mails from visitors and those with family in these tribal areas, who are appalled by the increasing radicalisation of young people and by last year&#146;s destruction of 150 government schools, most of them for girls, in the North West Frontier province. We therefore hope that a great deal of that money will go to help in those areas, if that can be done in a secure way; otherwise we will find that a whole new generation of children have been raised under Taliban-style control.</p>

In my view that is too pessimistic, but it is beyond doubt that we need an improvement in the situation in this region in the coming year. If all the factors of which I have spoken are addressed at the same time and with great energy by the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan, by our Government and that of the United States, the opportunity to get these things right will more or less be upon us in the coming months, and the importance of that is underlined by the likelihood that it will not easily recur.</p>

I recognise the huge achievements of our troops in Afghanistan, which are not mentioned enough. Women no longer come to my constituency fleeing from Afghanistan because of the persecution of women by the Taliban. The emancipation of women since British troops went to that country is one of the huge achievements of our intervention there and the sacrifices of our troops.

That democracy was initiated when the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, sat in the Gallery of the House of Commons listening to debates and learning that democracy was the best way for the country that he wanted to found. It is essential that our Government and the US Government in particular work sustain the parliamentary democracy that has returned to Pakistan and is the legacy of my good friend, Benazir Bhutto.</p>

We must do all we can to make it a top priority to solve the world&#146;s oldest unresolved dispute&#151;the 61-year-old dispute over Jammu and Kashmir. I have visited Jammu and Kashmir on many occasions&#151;both the Pakistani side and Srinagar on the Indian side&#151;and everywhere I have seen unnecessary suffering that could be eliminated if only rationality prevailed. Both Hindus and Muslims have suffered, and the situation is a tragedy for all the people who live in that beautiful but troubled province.</p>

As I say, I have been on both sides of the line of control. I have visited a school destroyed by an Indian bombardment and I have visited the Indian military post that bombarded the school. Both sides believe that they are right, and that is the great tragedy in any such dispute. We have to do all we can&#151;much more than we have been doing&#151;to assist in the solution to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir. We have to put it high on the international agenda. After 61 years, it is essential that the voices of the people of Jammu and Kashmir are heard.</p>

 It is a huge error to believe that the issue is marginal or peripheral in some way. Indeed, not paying serious attention to it is a prime strategic error in the context of what my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and the shadow Foreign Secretary have been talking about. First, as I say, it is essential that we act because the voice of the people of Jammu and Kashmir has not been heard for 61 years. If one goes to Muzaffarabad or Srinagar, one meets a disfranchised people. When I went to Srinagar, the Indian Government made a Government house available to me and invited people who had matters that they wanted to raise with me to come and see me. I sat there for seven hours while people told me of their woes and troubles. On a human level, the issue is extraordinarily important.</p>

understand that our time is restricted because of the other business before the House today, but we will need to return to these matters regularly as the situation develops. I hope that, as they have today, the Government will be generous in making time available for us to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000715">The problem of Afghanistan requires a regional diplomatic solution that includes Pakistan and, importantly, Iran. The developments over the past couple of days with the British Council have been especially worrying, but we should try to see them as an opportunity to engage with Iran. It is not in that nation&#146;s interest to have a lawless void of a country on its doorstep, and the problems of the drugs trade and the impact that it is having on Iran have been mentioned already. It is essential that we bring Iran as well as Pakistan and the other neighbouring countries into the discussions. In the Balkans, peace was secured on a regional basis through the Dayton agreement, and we should look at adopting a similar approach in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000716">I very much welcome the willingness that President Obama has shown since his election to engage diplomatically with the countries that are Afghanistan&#146;s neighbours. He has rejected the rhetoric of the war on terror, which undermined some of our diplomatic efforts by lumping everyone into being either with us or against us. It is easy to think of the Taliban as one entity, but that catch-all name covers a wide variety of people. Some of them are al-Qaeda sympathisers and very hard core, but others are more moderate, seeing the Taliban as a way to provide a degree of stability and security. We need to be able to engage and have discussions with them to see whether we can forge a way forward. That is something that our Government should definitely be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000717">I echo the Foreign Secretary&#146;s welcome of Richard Holbrooke to his new role in Afghanistan. I very much enjoyed the letter that my noble Friend Lord Ashdown sent to him through the pages of <i> The Times</i> earlier this week. In the paragraph that stood out for me, my noble Friend talked about the priorities for Afghanistan. He said:</p>
<a name="90205-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="09020541001022"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We need a clear plan and some ruthless priorities. When I was going to Afghanistan in 2008 they told me we had 15 priorities. But if you have 15 priorities, you have none.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000718">He is quite right: we need to focus on a few priorities and fulfil them properly, rather than do 15 things badly. In his letter, Lord Ashdown outlines three priorities&#151;human security, the rule of law, and governance&#151;that I think have merit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000719">In relation to human security, if the people of Afghanistan are continually threatened by violence as they go about their daily lives, and if they have no jobs or access to basic essentials such as electricity, water and health care, the ingredients for conflict are present and easily stoked up. However, if we can provide those basic necessities of human security, citizens will have a stake in peace and&#151;crucially&#151;a reason to support the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000720">Perhaps it goes without saying that the rule of law is essential but, if we do not create faith in the Government and the rule of law, the prospects for peace look very dim. However, securing peace will involve tackling the corruption that has been rife in the Karzai Government.  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>5 Feb 2009 : Column 1052</b><br>
To put it mildly, the international community is losing some faith in that Government. New elections may be the solution to that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000721">There is the issue of how the rule of law can be enforced, particularly in the short to medium term. Obviously, we want to move to a situation in which the police force is &#147;Afghanised&#148;&#151;a term that has been used. More troops may be necessary, and Obama has talked about a surge and sending in new troops. It is certainly possible that the UK ought to be prepared to add to the troops there, although given the overstretch that we already face in the military services, the number of additional troops committed would have to be small. Perhaps we should redouble our efforts to encourage our EU partners, and other countries that recognise the vital importance of Afghanistan, to play their part more seriously, and provide the military support that is required if we are to meet our objectives. As I am sure the Foreign Secretary will appreciate, the issue is not just the number of troops; it is also the strategy. Continuing in the same vein as before is unlikely to yield results. Although I support additional troops, I very much hope that the Foreign Secretary will look, with our international partners, at a change in strategy in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000722">The third priority is strengthening governance. It is easy for us, sitting in our traditional Parliament, to think that the style of democracy that evolved here is the only one that can work, and that we must impose it on other countries. The western style of governance may not be the right answer for Afghanistan. Indeed, there has been more than a century of foreign invasions in that country and attempts to overrule the tribal structures on which Afghanistan is based. History tells its own story; those adventures have not been successful. Trying to go against the grain of the country has not led to success. We really need to consider whether working with existing tribal structures and strengthening them democratically is a better way to approach the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09020541000723">Of course, the Foreign Secretary and shadow Foreign Secretary were right to pay tribute to all the members of the British armed services, and the civilians and aid workers, who are risking their lives in Afghanistan, as well as those from other countries around the world. When the House of Commons takes the difficult decision to engage in a conflict such as that in Afghanistan, we have a real responsibility to give the young men and women whom we send to that country the support that they need. The military covenant, which has worked well for many decades, is coming under increased stress because of the lack of support that many serving members of our armed forces have felt in recent years due to overstretch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para21"><a name="09020541000724">As has been mentioned, 143 British personnel have been killed in Afghanistan in the past eight years, and nearly 100 more have been seriously injured or wounded. In our constituency surgeries, people who served in Afghanistan tell us stories about the lack of equipment. It has certainly touched my heart to hear of the fears surrounding the use of armoured vehicles, particularly Snatch Land Rovers, which have caused the death of seven of our personnel. It is welcome that the Government have finally announced that there will be 600 new armoured vehicles going to Afghanistan. However, they took too long to come to that decision. It was evident a  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>5 Feb 2009 : Column 1053</b><br>
very long time ago that the Snatch Land Rovers were not adequate and sufficient equipment for our troops serving there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09020541000725">I hope that the announcement will be properly backed up, and that the 600 vehicles will arrive on time. Back in 2007, 96 new armoured vehicles were promised, but according to <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, only 16 were delivered on time. I hope that we have learned lessons from that experience, and that we can make sure that the new armoured vehicles get to the brave soldiers who need them. The shadow Foreign Secretary mentioned helicopters, which, in a country such as Afghanistan, are vital, as it is very difficult for any foreign army to deal with the terrain. Of course, the enemies there know the terrain and their homeland much better than we do, so helicopters, allowing swift movement of troops, are absolutely vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09020541000726">The other point to make about honouring the military covenant is that we should ensure that the troops whom we send to war zones have adequate time in between tours to recover, to spend with their families, and to have the semblance of a normal life. That has not been happening to the extent that it should, because of the overstretch. That should be borne in mind when the troops come home from Iraq later this year. They cannot immediately be sent to Afghanistan. We need to take into account their health and psychiatric care needs. That is why a large increase in troop numbers from this country will not be possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09020541000727">With regard to opium and poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, clearly the building of a legal economy with secure incomes for citizens is essential. The economy that has developed over the past couple of hundred years has thrived on the trade in weapons and narcotics. As a result, the incomes of many people have relied on the instability in the region, which totally undermines what we are trying to achieve. I read recently that the opiate industry in Afghanistan produces exports equal in value to half of the rest of the Afghan economy, so there is obviously a huge challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09020541000728">Various responses to that challenge have been suggested. The US has often favoured spraying the poppy fields, but that could undermine our efforts to build relationships with individuals and would not be helpful in diplomatic terms. Others, including some hon. Members, have suggested that we should buy up the entire poppy crop and use it for the legal trade in morphine, but again, that would not necessarily do us any favours in building relationships.</p>

As was mentioned, the resulting number of poppy-free provinces increased from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008, and particularly in the north-east of the country the scheme has had some success. It is vital that that continues, because the narcotics trade is fuelling corruption, which undermines the rule of law and governance.</p>

Often, when we talk about Afghanistan, we naturally think about Helmand and about our troops who are there, but a more strategic overview is needed. I hope DFID can contribute to that. Oxfam has suggested that the uneven spread of aid is contributing to insecurity, so I hope the Government will take up the issue and ensure that the aid programmes to which all the various international partners contribute are properly co-ordinated to reflect the national priorities, not just the regional priorities, in Afghanistan.</p>

There were 30 such deaths last year which, as I am sure the House would agree, is a very worrying development. It takes us back to the initial priorities of securing people&#146;s ability to go about their daily lives and ensuring that the rule of law is respected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para30"><a name="09020541000733">I turn now to Pakistan. It is just over a year since we were having various debates in the House following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto so shockingly on 27 December 2007. There was a cautious optimism in the House at the time that the elections would go ahead and proceed peacefully. At the same time there was an acceptance that the situation was fragile and could go horribly wrong. As we look back one year on, it is welcome that elections took place fairly peacefully and that there is a coalition Government and a return to democracy between the Pakistan People&#146;s party and the Pakistan Muslim League. Obviously, that is welcome progress, although we are not quite there yet as there are still major challenges, particularly in the Pakistani Government&#146;s relationships with the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence and the military, and in respect of where the true power and control within the country lie.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90205-0016.htm_para31"><a name="09020541000734">It is vital that we involve the Pakistani Government in any of our diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Afghanistan, particularly when it comes to the border regions and the federally administered tribal areas. I had read about the problems in that region, but I was still momentarily stunned by the statistic read out by the Foreign Secretary: female literacy in the region is just 3 per cent. When we discuss international affairs, intense poverty and great problems, we sometimes get away from the human and the individual. However, a statistic such as that makes us start to appreciate how dire the situation is and how much progress needs to be made. There is a whole range of different indicators. We can see the link between the education of women and the economic development and progress of countries; that literacy situation means that the economic future of the region is also under great threat.</p>

those goals. None of that will be easy; the challenge for us and our international partners is incredibly difficult. India has been mentioned. There is little time to go into the issue in great detail, but the relationship between Pakistan and India has clearly been hugely shaken by the Mumbai bombing; that, of course, was the very objective of those attacks. Understandably, there have been very strong words from the Indian Government, but so far there has been no form of retaliation. I think that that is a positive sign that the two Governments recognise the importance of getting their relationship back on track.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady accept that the Mumbai attacks against innocent people have damaged the relationship between India and Pakistan? Both countries are victims of terrorism and we must urge them to work together with the international community to defeat terrorism. Pakistan must do its best, using evidence, to bring to justice the perpetrators who are taking refuge in the country. On the other hand, India must accept Pakistan&#146;s offer of a joint investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He is right, and the international community should do anything that it can to support the efforts of India and Pakistan to work through the difficulties caused by the attacks. Proper investigation is certainly part of that, and bringing to justice the people responsible would be incredibly helpful.</p>

However, I should say that our action in Afghanistan is to uphold human rights and the universal values that the terrorists seek to undermine. Stooping to practices such as torture would fatally undermine our own case. I welcome the Government&#146;s statement that we never condone torture or allow the practice of it; clearly, there can be no justification for torture under any circumstances. If there is evidence that Binyam Mohamed was not tortured, we need to see it. If there is evidence to the contrary we equally need to see that, so that those who knew about it and were responsible can be held to account under international law.</p>

Business as usual will not provide us with the right way forward. We need new and clearly articulated priorities.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in a debate on a matter that is so close to my heart and to which, owing to my origins, I am so deeply connected. I should like to begin by highlighting the strong mutual relations that exist between the United Kingdom and Pakistan arising from their long-standing historical association with one another. I was fortunate that in my youth, when I was growing up and studying at university, Pakistan was a modern, liberal state run according to modern democratic and Islamic ideals in which traditional Islamic values were reconciled with modern, liberal ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000742">However, there was a dramatic change shortly after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Government viewed the conflict as an integral part of their cold war struggle against the Soviets and so saw it as being in their interests to provide assistance to any Afghan-led resistance movement regardless of its fundamentalist and extremist elements. Such support, although successful in achieving the immediate goal of a Soviet defeat, afterwards served only to strengthen the extremists&#146; hold over Afghanistan and Pakistan. As soon as the Soviets were defeated in Afghanistan, the Americans abandoned the people of Afghanistan, leaving the different factions to fight among themselves. No assistance was given with the rebuilding of homes, schools and infrastructure that could have helped the people of Afghanistan to recover and to create a stable and secure democratic nation, capable of countering extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000743">Similarly, after the tragic events that took place on 9/11, which triggered the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, no prior plan was ever conceived to deal with the aftermath. The US-led force devastated what was left of a very poor country that had already been ravaged by war, and yet made no real efforts to invest in it and help it to recover. The people of Afghanistan never saw any visible benefits of change after the defeat of the Taliban. Instead, they have been let down once again by the west, which, halfway through the invasion, shifted its attention towards the invasion of Iraq. That is a mistake which the United States has made before, and we must not allow it to happen again. I therefore thank my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister for having made Afghanistan one of the UK&#146;s top foreign policy priorities. I also commend the Government for the substantial development and stabilisation aid that is to be delivered to Afghanistan over the next few years.</p>

My colleagues and I were tremendously impressed by her passion and commitment to the fragile democracy of Pakistan. Those we met were eager to see Pakistan flourish as a democratic Muslim nation, and emphasised their commitment to rid the country of the scourge of terror. They also expressed their gratitude for the substantial aid and investment package the United Kingdom Government have offered them to help to redevelop the education system and health care, and to counter the influence of militancy.</p>

He was extremely grateful to the British Government, particularly the British high commission in Islamabad, for their support when he and others were subjected to political victimisation. That made me and all the members of the delegation feel immensely proud. However, all the people that we met were extremely concerned and angry at the continued use of drone attacks by the United States, which they felt were not only counterproductive to their attempts to tackle terrorism, but were actually harnessing extra support for extremist groups. Such attacks are a violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan and we must urge the United States to bring an immediate halt to their use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000747">We need to understand and appreciate that Pakistan is also the victim of terror, and that it is going through difficult and challenging times, especially bearing in mind the recent assassination of the former Pakistani Prime Minister, Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto&#151;the terrible loss of a great leader. It is estimated that Pakistan has so far lost more than 1,000 soldiers in fighting militants on the border with Afghanistan. At the same time, both countries have been subject to numerous suicide bombings&#151;in the last year alone, more than 2,000 civilians in Pakistan have lost their lives to such bombings.</p>

 Any student of Afghanistan&#151;the word &#147;Taliban&#148; translates into Pashto as &#147;student of Islam&#148;&#151;will know that there are two permanently dominating factors. One is size, and the other is psychology. When the British Raj was seeking what in those days was called a &#147;forward policy&#148; on the North West Frontier, now called the tribal districts, the great Lord Salisbury, when he was Foreign Secretary to Disraeli, used to send messages to the viceroy urging him to study a larger-scale map. Of course, the viceroy&#146;s failure to do that led to the second Afghan war, which contributed to the fall of the Disraeli Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000754">The size of Afghanistan is critical. It is an enormous country of breathtaking beauty&#151;not really a country at all but a huge geographical area occupied by about 40 tribes, many of them of different ethnic backgrounds. They have only two characteristics in common. One is that they hate each other, and the other is that they hate foreigners even more. When they cannot kill each other, they turn to killing foreigners&#151;or vice versa, actually.</p>

The Russians and the British tried to win their hearts and minds by every conceivable method for 200 years. We had an immense number of devoted Old Rugbeians who spoke all the local languages and could pass unnoticed in any bazaar as devoutly Islamic. They knew all about Afghanistan being the home of the cloak of the Prophet. But nobody has ever won the hearts of people in Afghanistan, and nobody is ever going to, because they hate foreigners. It is precisely the intervention of foreigners that is making the problem so bad. The more troops we send there, the worse the situation will get.</p>

I were both friends of Benazir Bhutto.

The next time that I met him was after he had come out from many years in prison under General Musharraf, and I took them both out to lunch. Benazir Bhutto&#146;s mother was the widow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was murdered by General Zia, and Benazir&#146;s widower is now President of Pakistan.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell), who has been the voice of history and the voice of sanity on the subject of our debate for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09020541000771">There were many omissions from the Foreign Secretary&#146;s speech. He inadvertently gave a wholly misleading impression when he suggested, in answer to an intervention, that we have only two choices: to carry on what we are doing or to cut and run. Those are not the only choices&#151;there are many others. As has been suggested, it is possible to do deals. Subtle and complex deals, which are not straight deals with those who are pro-Karzai or pro-west, have been done successfully. That is the way forward. If we do not do deals, we might end up with the retreat from Vietnam by the Americans or the retreat from Kabul by the Russians. There is a way we can defend and consolidate some of the gains. Those gains are greatly exaggerated, but there have been some in education and in the position of women in Afghanistan. Unless we do a deal, we might lose them all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09020541000772">The Foreign Secretary did not mention the surge, which is very much on our minds. Let us go back to what happened in this country. There was universal support, including from me, when we went into Afghanistan, although I did not think that the aims were attainable, particularly the ones to do with drugs. There is no consolation there, in spite of what the Foreign Secretary said. In the past three years we have seen the three largest drug crops ever and the price of heroin on the streets of Britain and France is lower than it ever was. There has been no success there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09020541000773">We are talking about a country that is hugely divided, as the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle said. I have a constituent who describes himself as the King of Baluchistan. Baluchistan is never talked about, but when Karzai sent in 12 emissaries to bring the Baluchs under control, their reaction was to behead them. Afghanistan is a huge, complex country that has been divided for millennia by tribal jealousies, as the hon. Gentleman described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90205-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09020541000774">Let us look at the idea of putting in the military. Nobody says there is a military solution on its own, but there is nothing else to go with it. We can talk about construction, but although there was great celebration when a turbine was taken to a power station site, it took 3,000 soldiers to guard its passage there over many weeks. We know that the Taliban&#146;s first roadblock is 15 miles outside Kabul, and Kandahar is under their control, apart from a few square miles of compounds controlled by NATO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09020541000775">I believe that we are mistaking the view of the Afghan people. They were fed up with the Taliban and certainly welcomed us when we went in in 2001. However, the mood now is very different. What we are offering is eternal war&#151;an American in the Pentagon told me that we would be there for generations. If that is the prospect for the Afghan people&#151;either they bring the Taliban back or the Taliban take control, or there is a war in which Afghanistan loses 2,000 civilians a year as a result of bombing&#151;they could move to the view that life might be more tolerable under the Taliban, so we are in a very weak position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000776">The great worry that we all have is about the extension of the war to Pakistan. Indeed, America is bombing sites in Pakistan now. The battle to win hearts and minds has gone terribly wrong. We should think back to the debate that we had in Westminster Hall in March 2006 and what all the parties to it said. There were interesting contributions from Opposition Members in that debate. As I mentioned in an earlier intervention, at that time only seven British soldiers had died, mostly as a result of accidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000777">The Government were warned that going in to Helmand province was like stirring up a hornets&#146; nest, because we were the Ferengi&#151;the foreigners&#151;against whom there would be jihad again. The view of many Afghans is that their sublime motive in life is to die in jihad, as their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers did. We are sending troops in as targets for people who are looking for their pathway to paradise. When we began our intervention, the hope was&#151;this was said at the time and it cannot be unsaid&#151;that we could go into Helmand province and stay there for three years without a shot being fired. We know now that 4 million shots have been fired, and we will be there possibly for 30-plus years if we continue with this foolishness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000778">I urge the Government to look again at what is happening. I urge them to take the intelligence of the new US President and General Petraeus, who are clearly subtle thinkers&#151;we are not dealing with George Bush now&#151;so that we can follow in the slipstream of Obama and his policies and look to a solution that is based on negotiation and doing deals. We cannot get rid of corruption. Corruption has been the lubricant of business and politics in Afghanistan for centuries and it will remain so. At the moment the corruption runs all the way up to the family of the President. There are a significant number of new millionaires in Afghanistan as a result of our presence and our spending there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000779">We have already spent far too much in Afghanistan, in blood and in treasure. We must look to the future. We cannot send our young men and women over there to die in vain in a war with impossible aims that cannot be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000780">The message that should come from the Chamber today is that there should certainly be no surge. There should be no increase in the number of British troops there; it is madness to believe that that would make any difference. Russia had 100,000 troops there, and there were 150,000 Afghans under arms. The Russians lost 6,500 of their own troops. They were there for 10 years and spent billions of roubles, but they ran away when 300,000 mujaheddin surrounded Kabul. We must ensure that we do not get ourselves into that position.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that the best way of ensuring that the lives of British and other soldiers will not be lost in Afghanistan is to work with the people who want to build a properly functioning state with a properly functioning police force and army, rather than simply to give up, walk out and leave the people of Afghanistan to deal with their enormous difficulties on their own?</p>

 The Foreign Secretary mentioned the police force, although I do not know whether it was in his original speech. He talked about a police force that was worth the name. The police force in Afghanistan is corrupt. Its officers are unpaid, and their only source of income is to put up roadblocks and collect tolls from the people going through. The situation is far worse now. I have been to some of the presentations given by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) when groups come over here. Of course, there are certain groups and individuals in Afghanistan who have done very well. They look forward to our staying there for a long time, because it is good for them. They have power that they never had before, and they are far more prosperous than they ever were. It is ironic to think that, for every British life lost in Afghanistan, there is almost certainly one additional millionaire in Kabul. That is not the way forward, and we must recognise the seriousness of the position and the hopelessness of the case. We are constantly in denial if we believe that there is a way forward and a solution waiting round the bend.</p>

Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) fairly set out four aims, and said that none of them was attainable. He said that we were not going forward on any of them. Sadly, however, at the end of his speech, he bottled out and came up with an optimistic ending. I urge Opposition Members&#151;many of whom have spent time in Afghanistan, including serving in the Army, and are very well informed&#151;to make their voices heard to ensure that we do not go ahead with a disastrous military surge that would be answered with a vast surge by the Taliban. The bloodshed among our soldiers and among the civilians would only multiply.</p>

 Listening to the thoughtful speech by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) and the splendid speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell), I could not help but reflect on my own first ministerial visit to the region in 1982, when I was an Under-Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. At that time, the Soviets were in occupation in Afghanistan. While in Peshawar, I visited an Afghan refugee camp. When the Afghan refugees heard that a British Minister was present, I was required to make a speech. I spoke to 10,000 Afghan refugees, with their rifles and bandoliers, and I said the kind of things that one would expect me to say. I said that we looked forward to their achieving their freedom, and to the day when the Soviet Union would return to its own country.</p>

having said. It said that the visiting British Foreign Office Minister had called upon the Afghans to continue the jihad against the Soviet infidel. I was not so worried about what the <i> Peshawar Times</i> had said; my concern was that Mrs. Thatcher, back home, might get a report of it. On further reflection, however, I thought that if she did, she might think that the Foreign Office was not quite so wet as she had previously assumed.</p>

 Perhaps I could continue my remarks for the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000790">Of course, the British and western presence in Afghanistan is of a quite different order to the Soviet occupation, and it is important to remind ourselves why we went there. We did not go there to eradicate the poppy trade, to introduce democracy or to give women greater rights&#151;entirely desirable though they be. They were no more the reasons why we went into Afghanistan than why we ever sent our troops into many other countries around the world. We went there because the Taliban Government had given sanctuary to al-Qaeda and had every intention at that time of continuing to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000791">This is crucial. Despite what the Foreign Secretary tried to suggest, the reality is that in the earlier years of the western presence in Afghanistan, as seen in all the speeches made by Ministers, both American and British, we appeared to be giving equal weight to nation building along with the eradication of the Taliban and the political control of the territory of Afghanistan. That was always a very foolish set of assumptions because nation building, although highly desirable, is a matter that will take at the very least a generation to achieve and it will certainly depend on cultural and social factors as it simply cannot be implemented by military means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000792">The risk that we followed by taking that approach was, until relatively recently, twofold. First, of course, it could not be achieved, so the consequence was failure. Secondly, we risked&#151;as we still do&#151;losing public support in this country and other NATO countries because we did not seem to be delivering the democracy, the freedom from corruption and the end of the poppy trade, which we claimed were our objectives. I noted that Robert Gates, the American Defence Secretary, said three weeks ago that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000794">If we are to see the continuing elimination of Afghanistan as a base for terrorist activity, we should first realise that we have already achieved that objective. For the year since NATO arrived in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda has not been able to use that territory as a base for its vicious terrorist activities; and our objective should be entirely concentrated on how we ensure that that continues to be the case in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_o365"><a name="09020541000795"><a name="90205-0018.htm_spnew7"><a name="09020541001465"><b>Mr. Sarwar:</b>
 Since the time when the right hon. and learned Gentleman was in power and the mujaheddin were fighting against the Russians, who was it who found, funded and armed Osama bin Laden?</p>

<p><a name="st_o366"><a name="09020541000796"><a name="90205-0018.htm_spnew8"><a name="09020541001466"><b>Sir Malcolm Rifkind:</b>
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but it is not as good as he thinks it is. The fact remains that while the Soviet Union was in effective occupation of Afghanistan, the international community of course used whatever means were available to eliminate the Soviet presence from the country&#151;and it succeeded. The fact that some of the individuals in the mujaheddin&#151;some, not all&#151;went on to be international terrorists is not a matter for which either the United States or anyone other than the individuals concerned can be blamed. I think that the hon. Gentleman would recognise that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000797">The objective is, as I have indicated, to maintain, not to achieve, a position whereby al-Qaeda is no longer able to operate from within Afghanistan. We know that the single greatest problem at the moment is that both al-Qaeda and the Taliban can take sanctuary in the frontier area&#151;in the hills and caves on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The question is therefore how we can improve that situation and assess why it is proving so difficult. It is not a new problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000798">I mentioned being in the country in 1982 and I remember going to the Pakistan part of the Khyber pass at that time. As I entered the area, there was a sign on the road which effectively said that the Pakistani Government would not accept responsibility for anything that happened more than 100 m off either side of the main road. There has been a long period of uncertainty and lack of effective control, but what has made it worse is that deep Pakistani neurosis that both India and Afghanistan are seeking the ultimate dismemberment of their country. That may be a grossly unfair accusation&#151;it probably is grossly unfair accusation&#151;but Pakistan is, of course, an artificial state. I hope I will not be misunderstood in saying it, but it was a state created for a specific purpose at a specific time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000799">We know that, as has already been mentioned, Afghanistan has never, since 1948, recognised the Durand line as the legitimate international frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Of course that gives rise to elements within the Inter-Services Intelligence, within the armed forces in Pakistan and possibly within the Government who say, &#147;Actually, we would rather have the Taliban than anyone else, because however evil the Taliban may be, they are not particularly nationalist in their ideology.&#148; Nationalism is not what interests the Taliban; what interests them is Islam, of a particular mediaeval kind. From the Pakistani point of view, while all Afghan Governments have not been particularly useful to them, the Taliban were more acceptable&#151;in the past, when they were in charge&#151;because they did not seem terribly interested in frontier issues.</p>

If Karzai is not willing to do that, he must recognise that he cannot expect the kind of support that he would be entitled to expect otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000801">Those are important issues, but let me comment on two other matters. Of course it is the case that, in many respects, President Karzai has proved to be a serious disappointment. He is thought to be corrupt, inadequate and unable to govern in an effective fashion. We constantly hear the question, &#147;Should the international community dump Karzai because of his inadequacies?&#148; We need only give that question a moment&#146;s thought, however, to realise what a grossly improper suggestion it is. One of the arguments employed by the west&#151;the international community&#151;is that Karzai is the first elected President in Afghanistan&#146;s history. How can we possibly be seen to be involved in seeking to remove him? That must remain a matter entirely for the Afghan people. They will decide in their own way&#151;and let us hope that they have the means to express it in a proper way&#151;that they will have either Karzai or some alternative President, if that is their wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000802">Finally, I want to say something about the role of the Taliban. I said earlier that our objective in Afghanistan was not primarily to bring about democracy, the end of corruption or human rights, desirable though that is. Again, I do not wish to be misunderstood, but at the end of the day we do not mind who runs Afghanistan, including the Taliban, as long as they do not give support to al-Qaeda&#151;as long as they do not provide a sanctuary for that or any similar terrorist organisation. I detest the Taliban as much as anyone because of what they believe in. I detest many organisations and peoples around the world with unacceptable views, but that is not a matter that need result in a military intervention in the country concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000803">Whether we deal with the Taliban depends on whether the Taliban as a whole, which is unlikely, or substantial elements within the Taliban, which is much more probable, either are prepared or may become prepared to negotiate with the Afghan Government either on a coalition or on something of that kind. Let me respond to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell) by saying that the relevance of our military presence is that if we want to ensure, as I am sure my hon. Friend does, that al-Qaeda or other terrorists cannot use Afghanistan, it is highly desirable for us to involve at least a proportion of the Taliban in the political process if they are willing to co-operate in that objective. I do not consider it to be an unrealistic objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90205-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09020541000804">The reason why I shall be perfectly happy if we have more NATO troops in Afghanistan is that it will help to convince the Taliban that while we may not be able to achieve a complete military victory, nor can they. A political solution will therefore become increasingly attractive to a substantial proportion of the Taliban, and may then enable a political solution to be achieved which will help us to deliver our fundamental requirement: no terrorism ever again emanating from Afghanistan.</p>

They&#146;ll only be there for a short time.&#148; Then, not so long ago, I think it was one of the senior generals who said, &#147;They could be there for 30 years.&#148; I want to know this: what is our strategy? Does NATO have a strategy? Does the United States have a strategy? I do not seriously expect a full answer to this question tonight, but it must be posed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09020541000812">There is a clearly expressed ideology of militant Islamist fundamentalism that not only wants to kill, but rejects all the values that uphold democracy&#151;the rule of law, open economies, freedom of expression&#151;as well as the rights of those of other religions and women and gays to live their lives as they wish. It is not just western countries who suffer from this ideological assault. Al-Qaeda&#146;s number two, Mr. al-Zawahiri, has stated that the Pakistani Government are &#147;apostate&#148; and should be overthrown. It is time that we drew a much clearer distinction between Islamism as an ideology and the faith of Islam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000813">We must also recognise that there are great forces around the world with a strategic interest in seeing NATO, the United States, Great Britain, the west and the Euro-Atlantic community defeated. There is an open-ended supply of arms from Iran and other parts of the region to the people who are seeking to kill our soldiers. We can send as many helicopters there as we like, but as the Russians will tell us, helicopters do not do the trick. We can bomb as much as much as we like, too&#151;in 2007, the US air force had almost 3,000 strike hits&#151;but that has not decreased the violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000814">Kyrgyzstan is shutting down its supply base for America, so if the Khyber pass is choked off&#151;as seems to be the case&#151;land supplies can come in only through Russia. I do not wish to make comments about Russia in this debate, but putting NATO and America at the mercy of Mr. Putin does not seem strategically wise, so we need to think in a different way. The player that we have to bring in is India.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000815">So far this century, we have sent more than &#163;1 billion to India in development aid, yet India is rich enough to plant its flag on the moon and, as has been described, to be a nuclear-armed power. It is spending up to a reported $1 billion in its own development programme in Afghanistan. Thus, Pakistan feels encircled. There are 500,000 Indian troops in Kashmir and 70,000 Kashmiris have died since the Indian army moved in nearly 20 years ago&#151;far more than all those killed in the middle east. The bulk of the Pakistani military has to focus on that. A country cannot have 500,000 troops actively engaged in training and manoeuvres on its frontier and not take appropriate precautions&#151;there is no example in history of that happening. So we have to say to India that it should de-escalate a bitterly emotional dispute.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary was right to repeat the then Senator Obama&#146;s absolute hyphenation between Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. To get things going, we have to discuss the Kashmiri issue. When my right hon. Friend came back, he was trashed in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i> Daily Mail</i>&#151;all those papers that just seek to score cheap political points. Let the right hon.

 This debate rightly focuses on both Afghanistan and Pakistan because, although there is an established international border between the two countries, in many remote places it is virtually ignored by local tribes, who move freely back and forth. I propose to concentrate my remarks on Afghanistan and to focus primarily and perhaps rather narrowly on what is needed to promote the creation of wealth. We all applaud efforts to build schools and hospitals and to provide for other social needs, but if wealth is created the country will not have to depend for ever on international aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000819">The security situation in Afghanistan has to be sorted out before the creation of wealth can begin. The military are currently expected to provide the security, with civilian contractors following up with reconstruction projects, but until the population are convinced that life is better than it was under the old regime, there will continue to be flare-ups&#151;many Afghan men will still have a rifle concealed under their dishdash ready to exploit any situation, and the re-infiltration of Taliban forces will continue to bring about failures in the security situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000820">I would like briefly to pursue two themes: power supply and the road capacity. The Taliban want neither to succeed; they do not want capacity to be enlarged or such facilities to be made more efficient. They would prefer to continue to rely on the heroin trade and the restrictions on society that we in the west find so abhorrent. The Afghan Energy Information Centre tells us that Afghanistan has 18 hydroelectric power plants, with a generating capacity of 263 MW, and 15 thermal plants, which are run on imported diesel and generate 88 MW. It says that a further 296 MW is imported from 13 sources in neighbouring countries. Afghanistan has a total capacity of more than 600 MW, although output is estimated to be around 400 MW, and about 20 MW per 1 million people is provided. That is insignificant when compared with UK provision, which is 1,000 MW per 1 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000821">There is no national grid in Afghanistan because of the security situation, and distribution is limited to businesses and individuals located in the major cities or those close to the sources of power generation. That severely limits Afghanistan&#146;s ability to establish wealth-creation projects, although it has tremendous assets such as coal reserves of 400 million tonnes&#151;no doubt destined to fuel China&#146;s coal-fired power stations&#151;and gas, oil, copper, iron ore and many other minerals. In addition, it has the ability to grow crops in its rural areas which, if storage areas and transport facilities were developed, could be exported to the west or elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000822">The construction and maintenance of much needed roads appears to be a hotch-potch international affair with very mixed results. India, for example, has just completed a 135 mile road linking the province of Nimroz to the Iranian port of Chabahar, thereby opening up a new trade route. That has attracted some sniping  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000823">In late 2001, approximately 16 per cent. of Afghanistan&#146;s roads were paved, compared with more than 80 per cent. in neighbouring Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The percentage of paved roads has now increased to 29 per cent. and they have the advantage of being faster for communication, security and the movement of goods. It is also more difficult for insurgents to plant mines and IEDs in roads than in dirt tracks, but maintenance is a continual problem, especially in the mountain areas where damage is caused by the melting of the winter snows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09020541000824">The Afghan Government and the USA and other donors consider road construction to be a top development priority and almost 20 per cent. of the US Agency for International Development&#146;s $5.9 billion assistance to Afghanistan has been for roads. However, detailed information on this subject has been difficult to obtain, particularly on provincial and rural roads.</p>

 Can the hon. Lady confirm that 80 per cent. of US aid is actually spent in the US, paying American salaries and buying American goods, not in Afghanistan itself? The money would be best spent sur place in Afghanistan.</p>

 That is a good point and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000827">One way to secure a dramatic improvement in road building and power distribution could be achieved by putting the military in charge. It would need to be given the tools and finance to get on with the job, with the transfer of money from other Department&#146;s budgets if necessary. If that is not done, it is the Army that will suffer in the long run as it is placed in an impossible &#147;no win&#148; situation. Reconstruction of the infrastructure is very slow&#151;over the past two years the Royal Engineers have repaired, reconstructed or built just 25 miles of road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000828">There is also a military advantage to such a strategy. At present, members of the Taliban choose their ground and can evaporate and re-emerge at will. They are present everywhere, but are indistinguishable from the local population. Afghanistan is far too large and complex a country for the Taliban to be destroyed by the military alone, but the one thing that the Taliban could not tolerate is for infrastructure improvements to win support from the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000829">A good road network would bring in its wake prosperity, thereby generating income for social projects. With the military in charge of the road-building programme the Taliban would be identified, tied down and drawn into an area where ISAF and Afghan forces could take them on, knowing full well when to expect them. The co-operation of local people is essential if we are to succeed in Afghanistan, and there is no better way to ensure that that is achieved than by improving prospects, in both security and potential prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000830">Although progress is undoubtedly being made, it is far too slow and sporadic. The British Army in Helmand province, by changing its tactics and strategy, could make a lasting and dramatic improvement in the lives of the people of Afghanistan that would augur well for eventual peace.</p>

 Let me start by protesting at the absurd shortness of the debate, which is totally inadequate even for the sprinkling of Members present. Why are so few people here? It is because so few people will get the opportunity to speak. I blue-pencilled my speech to fit it into the time available, and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway) who has spent days working on his speech, drawing on his enormous experience, will be reduced to a few scraps. It is intolerable and I hope that the Government will take that to heart and give the House more time to discuss these vital issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000832">I agree with much of what has been said and, most worrying, I find myself agreeing with those who are most doom-laden. Our soldiers continue to win battles against the Taliban in Helmand but the politicians in Afghanistan and the west seem incapable of taking advantage of the time and space won by the blood of our brave troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000833">The story is the same across Afghanistan. We went to Afghanistan, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) pointed out, solely with the objective of toppling the regime that sheltered al-Qaeda. However, we have finished up nation building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000834">Our problems in Helmand are a microcosm of the wider difficulties that the international security assistance force is experiencing: lack of military and civil capacity, a vacuum of governance, overstretch and a complete lack of strategic direction. I met a senior non-commissioned officer who was back from Afghanistan just before Christmas, and he told me, &#147;We are there to help them but they just don&#146;t want to be helped.&#148; That reinforces the central message of James Fergusson&#146;s excellent book, &#147;A Million Bullets&#148;, which is that much of what we have found ourselves doing in Afghanistan seems to have been counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000835">Our armed forces are brilliant and brave, but their tactical successes seem to contribute little towards strategic success. They merely stir up a hornets&#146; nest. Lord Ashdown went even further in a remarkable interview on the &#147;Today&#148; programme on 24 January. It pains me to repeat him, but he said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09020541000836">That is a serious charge to bear for us as politicians responsible for the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09020541000837">We would do well to recall the greatest Chinese military thinker, Sun Tzu, who said</p>

Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), who has unfortunately absented himself from the Chamber, that the lack of strategy is our biggest problem. The hesitancy of the Foreign Secretary, perhaps in an attempt to seem reasonable and open-minded, conveys a lack of confidence that I have also picked up on in private meetings in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence and from our military commanders.</p>

operating the 21st-century equivalent of the Schlieffen plan at the start of the first world war, when railway timetables behind the German front lines became the driving factor of German military policy. With a new US President, it is time to say these hard things in the hope that a coherent strategy will emerge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09020541000841">Lord Ashdown suggests that three essentials are required alongside additional military and aid capacity: an international plan, signed up to by everybody; proper international co-ordination expressed with a single voice; and a regional construct&#151;a treaty&#151;to involve Afghanistan&#146;s neighbours, including Iran, that is underpinned by the world powers, including China. Let us hope that Richard Holbrooke&#146;s appointment heralds that new single voice, but reinforces another lesson. The UN does not and cannot successfully prosecute wars. Wars need leadership of the kind that, in this case, only the United States can provide. If some nations are not prepared to accept that, it would be almost more helpful if they left the field altogether instead of insisting on overcomplicated command chains and caveats that preoccupy commanders with process instead of outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09020541000842">If we Europeans want a say in US strategy, we must commit the European forces that can make a real difference. Sadly for the British, our armed forces are so overstretched and run-down that we have limited additional military capacity to offer just as the new President is looking to America&#146;s allies to prove themselves. We are losing influence in Washington and at US central command in Tampa, Florida, and we have only ourselves to blame. That is more than just bad for the UK, it threatens our ultimate success. With our history and blood ties in the region, particularly in Pakistan, we are uniquely placed to be effective and proactive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09020541000843">It is true that Pakistan is vital to success in Afghanistan, but that misses the real point. In the long term, Pakistan is far more significant strategically than Afghanistan. We should be devoting far more to our excellent mission in Pakistan and committing far more military resources to helping the Pakistani army.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09020541000844">Military diplomacy was meant to be a big thing in the 1998 strategic defence review, but the Government keep cutting the numbers of defence and military attaches in our embassies. We have a good but tiny military-to-military relationship with the Pakistan. Given the scale of the potential strategic threat of terrorism, and the disastrous possibility that a Government armed with nuclear weapons might fall into the hands of extremists, why on earth is military diplomacy not being addressed with far more urgency?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09020541000845">We have spent billions of pounds in Afghanistan, perhaps not very effectively. A few hundred million more spent in Pakistan would be of far greater strategic benefit. We should be helping to reform and modernise the Pakistani military to give the army the self-confidence to conduct modern and sophisticated counter-insurgency campaigns, to divert it from its hopeless preoccupation with India, and to help it integrate into a stable Pakistani democratic settlement. We would also be tackling the roots of the insurgency in Afghanistan; at present we are treating the symptoms and not the cause.</p>

 I profoundly agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said about the importance of Pakistan. We should not forget that it is the sixth most populous country in the world, with 170 million people, or that it is a nuclear power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09020541000847">One warning that I would make about putting Afghanistan together with Pakistan in this debate is that we must not prejudice improvement in Pakistan by our actions in Afghanistan. It is that important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para31"><a name="09020541000848">Even so, there are some grounds for optimism about the present situation. First, we have a new President in America. I voted against the Iraq war because I felt that America took its eye off the ball in Afghanistan between 2000 and 2003, and we are paying a very heavy price for that neglect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para32"><a name="09020541000849">Secondly, we have better people in charge now. General Petraeus has more confidence than some of his predecessors and did a good job in Iraq. I think that he is the right person to manage these matters, given his experience in an equally difficult part of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para33"><a name="09020541000850">Thirdly, it is clear that there is a new emphasis in Pakistan on the importance of relations with Afghanistan. President Zardari, for example, had President Karzai with him during his inaugural procedures, and that was a good sign. Moreover, the Pakistani Parliament had a long and very sensible discussion last October about negotiations in Afghanistan, and that is a very good sign indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para34"><a name="09020541000851">As has been said, however, the situation on the ground is dire. The Joint Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee recently heard evidence from Lieutenant-General Wall. Several Opposition Members were present, and the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) said that we had been told in New York that only one of the 13 provinces in Helmand was now under control. Lieutenant-General Wall agreed and said that that was a fair assessment. In his speech today, the Foreign Secretary insisted that far more provinces were under control, but it is clear that the situation is fluctuating and I do not believe that the present assessment is correct. It is worrying that Lieutenant-General Wall should have made those comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para35"><a name="09020541000852">The situation on the ground in Afghanistan is dire and, as various contributors to this short debate have said, we need a radical adjustment of our strategy. In particular, greater emphasis needs to be placed on political dialogue with the Taliban and the Pashtun. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway), if he gets called to speak, will elaborate on those matters, which I have discussed with him over the past few years. I agree with his basic proposition that we must negotiate sensibly with those elements of the Taliban and the Pashtun who will respond. I appreciate that it is very difficult to decide who to negotiate with and what they want, but nonetheless I think that that is inevitable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90205-0019.htm_para36"><a name="09020541000853">Fourthly, as Adam Roberts&#151;an Oxford professor and noted authority on the issue&#151;pointed out in evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, which will visit Afghanistan in April:</p>

precisely the wrong strategy: its authors, specialists in the region, argue instead for a rural security presence that has been largely lacking.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09020541000854">In other words, there is some doubt about whether for ever strengthening the central Government&#146;s military force is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000855">Clearly, Pakistan has to make a much bigger effort to deal with the problems. As has been said, the border more or less does not exist as far as the Pashtuns are concerned. As was pointed out by the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), in the FATA&#151;the federally administered tribal areas of Pakistan&#151;female literacy is at 3 per cent., which is appalling. Unemployment is at 80 per cent. Are we surprised that those people are ready to be radicalised by the Taliban? There, too, a major effort has to be made to get the show on the road, so I hope that in future we can have longer debates on the subject. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex that the allocation of three hours for a debate on Pakistan and Afghanistan is lamentable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000856">I hope that we can have debates of a decent length on the issue, particularly, as the shadow Foreign Secretary says, when there are major, or even significant, changes to the UK Government&#146;s strategy, as there have been from time to time. I hope that there will be a radical change in strategy, but I believe that we should be there in Afghanistan, for the reasons that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) so admirably set out.</p>

 Yesterday, I saw a friend who had been tracking the Afghan Taliban in Pakistan&#151;he was listening to somebody with a Yorkshire accent trying to speak Arabic into a hand-held radio. What can we do? We cannot do very much on our own, but I suggest that Britain and our allies declare a new war: a war on radicalisation. We should seek to protect our people by cutting out this cancer, rather than by suppressing the symptoms&#151;that is, by dropping bombs on it from 20,000 ft, thereby distributing the cells all over the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000858">The new American President has a choice. He can either be a pragmatist or reinforce failure. Failure might look something like this: the Americans send another 30,000 troops, hot-foot from Iraq, in the absence of a political settlement. They then think that the answer is to continue to &#147;clear, hold and build&#148; among a civilian population to whom foreign troops are, in large part, the problem. In that scenario, President Karzai stays in office until his term runs out in May, but limps on with his corrupt narco-clique until elections at some unspecified time in the future. As we know, Karzai remains a major barrier to meaningful reconciliation. Of course it was he who chucked out the utterly irreplaceable Michael Semple.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000859">Meanwhile, we would muddle on. We would shrug and continue to utter expressions such as &#147;We are where we are,&#148; &#147;It&#146;s just about fine-tuning the comprehensive approach,&#148; and &#147;Just a few more troops.&#148; Pakistan would continue to bomb and disperse its population, and continue to lose large chunks of its territory. Sometime thereafter, we could guarantee a more or less irretrievable situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000860">On the other hand, the US President might be a bit more pragmatic. In fairness, some people in our Government may at last have understood the gravity of the matter. What might be the ingredients of a success that would allow us to avoid a second strategic failure? First, we have to understand that Bonn was a conference of the victors. Large parts of the Afghan political landscape were left out of it. Whether we like it or not, Hizb-e-Islami and as many elements as possible of the Taliban have to be brought back into the political process. The Taliban are not a single, coherent movement. In large part, they are the ordinary people of the Pashtun belt. Al-Qaeda is not the same as the Taliban. Frankly, I do not think that AQ needs Afghanistan anymore. It is now in plenty of other places, including our cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000861">Like it or not, the great majority of Afghan and Pakistani tribal inhabitants are deeply traditional people. They want a very light touch from central Government; that system has worked for centuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000862">In other words, what we need now is an Afghan solution&#151;obviously, though, one that protects the strategic interests of the western countries. Of course, it is a hell of a lot easier to say that than to do it, but a couple of weeks ago in Dubai in the Art Boutique Apartment hotel a remarkable meeting took place&#151;you are hearing it here first&#151;between elements of the Taliban and representatives of all the major political parties, including that represented by Gulbuddin Hikmetyar. They were there to discuss the elements of a grand conference, which would do three things. It would correct the imbalance of the Bonn agreement, helping to bring the Taliban back into politics, it would agree to an interim Government to replace Karzai at the end of his term in May, and it would agree a programme for the withdrawal of foreign troops over many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000863">Elements of the Taliban have signed up to those three things as the basis for a further meeting in a few weeks. The driving force behind the initiative, Mr. Jarir, is right now getting on a plane at Heathrow to go back to Dubai. He cannot go back to Kabul because Karzai has threatened to arrest him. The initiative, like many others before it, is imperfect, but it is huge in the sense that Afghan political parties are getting together, talking about bringing the enemy back in, and also talking about an agreed withdrawal of NATO troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000864">Secondly, such a political settlement would allow resources to be concentrated in the Pashtun belt and Pakistan&#146;s tribal areas. It will never be perfect, but light government would be working there with the international community to bring security, justice and the rule of law and to develop government institutions that serve the people meaningfully. This would be an enormous rescue plan, and we would have to be prepared to spend gigantic sums of money. We would have to reduce dramatically the tension between India and Pakistan. Remember that the Pakistanis see everything through the prism of Kashmir. We would then be in a position to allow the Pakistani military, which is now in tanks facing India, to focus on counter-insurgency and tribal engagement. It would be extremely helpful if the US Administration were engaged with Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000865">The plan would have the effect of freeing up our military resources, which are at present fixed in locations holding geography, rather than doing what they should be doing&#151;defeating networks. None of that can happen  <br>

without this Afghan solution at last, which would have to be supported by a clear international plan, a strategy and a single voice, which the military call unity of command, unity of purpose. It is there in the manual for winning a counter-insurgency operation. Without that, or some sort of significant rebalancing of our efforts, the problem will only get worse. At some point, that will directly affect our population. I want to win this.</p>

 I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway) not only for the breadth and depth of the speech that he has just made, but for lining up exactly what I wish to begin with, which is a word or two about counter-insurgency in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000869">I have a mantra, which is that there are four elements to a counter-insurgency campaign. Some of them are more familiar than others. The first three are very familiar&#151;to identify, to isolate and to neutralise&#151;but the fourth element is to negotiate. That is what my hon. Friend was referring to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000870">However, negotiation cannot be carried out at every stage of a counter-insurgency process. During an insurgency&#146;s early stages, when the insurgents think that they are on course for victory, negotiation is not an option. The time for that comes either when the insurgents are in retreat, or when a stalemate exists&#151;that is, when the insurgents cannot achieve their aims and the counter-insurgents cannot totally eliminate the insurgents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000871">At this point, I must pay tribute to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), who focused the House&#146;s attention on the central point of our war aim in Afghanistan. It is not a great, positive aim, but a negative one: to prevent Afghanistan from being used in future to host what has shown itself to be not some sort of patriotic, anti-colonial, nationalist organisation, but one engaged in an ideological crusade worldwide.</p>

 I partly accept the hon. Lady&#146;s point. What we need to do is help the Afghan state to build up a workable life for itself.

 Part of the aim was to destroy al-Qaeda&#146;s safe place from which to organise terrorism. We have not been successful: that safe base continues, either on the borders or in Pakistan itself. Where is the threat of Taliban action in Britain? Is there any evidence that the organisation is planning terrorism here?</p>

<p><a name="st_o380"><a name="09020541000877"><a name="90205-0020.htm_spnew7"><a name="09020541001480"><b>Dr. Lewis:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is confusing my argument, which he has perhaps not fully grasped. I am talking not about the Taliban in this connection, but about al-Qaeda. The whole point about how insurgencies end with a negotiated settlement is that our war aim should be to demonstrate to everyone with influence in Afghanistan&#151;including the Taliban&#151;that they are on to a loser when they give house room to an organisation such as al-Qaeda, which certainly has aims of causing mayhem in our own societies. The concept of negotiation should come into play precisely when we have shown the Taliban that they are at best in a military stalemate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000878">I will lay a large wager that the people, groups, sects and tribes who make up Taliban forces will be as fissiparous as any other insurgency movement. There will be those among them who will be willing to do deals, compromise and realise that they made a terrible strategic mistake when they accommodated al-Qaeda; others among them will be diehards who say that they will never do a deal. Our job must be to show the more pragmatic among the insurgents that they made a strategic error, which they can rectify by isolating militants and giving no house room to al-Qaeda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000879">Although the hon. Gentleman rightly says that al-Qaeda is now to be found in other parts of the world, the NATO mission in Afghanistan, if it is to succeed, should have as one of its aims showing other countries that they should think long and hard before emulating the mistake of the Taliban and giving house room to al-Qaeda so that it can launch its attacks against the west.</p>

<p><a name="st_o381"><a name="09020541000880"><a name="90205-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="09020541001481"><b>Mr. Sarwar:</b>
 There is an unfortunate perception among the people of Pakistan about the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. It is important that the leadership of Pakistan tells the people of Pakistan that the Taliban are killing Muslims and non-Muslims and bombing girls&#146; schools in Pakistan. This is a war that it is essential to win for the sake of the integrity and prosperity of the people of Pakistan.</p>

 The logic of what the hon. Gentleman is saying is that if we now discovered that al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden had a base in Pakistan, we should invade Pakistan. I am sure that that is not what he means to say, but that is the logic behind it. Is it not a terrible mistake to put all these groups&#151;al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the insurgency in Iraq, North Korea and other countries&#151;together as one group, as terrorists, and talk about a war on terrorists? Surely we have got past that nonsense.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that not all the groups with which we have been militarily engaged are part of a single organisation, but the ones that belong to al-Qaeda are part of a single organisation, and our job should be to show the other groups that they should have nothing to do with AQ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000884">Let me quote from a report in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> of 10 January about one of the drone attacks that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) condemned. However, this was one of the more productive drone attacks. The report reads:</p>
<a name="90205-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="09020541001033"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The head of al-Qa&#146;ida in Pakistan and one of his senior henchmen have been killed in an American air strike, according to intelligence sources. Usama al-Kini and his aide, Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, both Kenyan nationals, are believed to have been killed by a missile fired by a &#145;predator drone&#146; in south Waziristan, a Taliban stronghold close to the Afghan border.</p>
</ul><a name="90205-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="09020541001034"><ul><p class="tabletext">The men are believed to have been involved in the bombing of the Marriott in Islamabad last year, in which 55 people were killed when suicide attackers drove a truck bomb into the security gates. They were also suspected of planning a failed assassination attempt on the late Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan, shortly after she returned from exile in 2007.</p>
</ul><a name="90205-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="09020541001035"><ul><p class="tabletext">They were indicted in the US for their role in the 1998 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and were believed to have played a key role in training recruits to carry out terrorist attacks in Britain and Europe.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000885">I want to impress on the House the fact that we are dealing with two very different types of enemy. One group is a declared enemy of everything that we stand for. It comprises people such as those in that report, who were from Kenya and yet, strangely enough, ended up in Waziristan. They do these things not because NATO responded to the attacks in America by invading Afghanistan, from which the organisers of the attacks had been operating, but because they have declared holy war on our way of life. The other, wider group&#151;the enemies about whom we have to be concerned&#151;are people who we have a lot of potential for working with if we can show them that dealing with al-Qaeda is ingesting a form of poison into their own lives and societies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09020541000886">I say frankly to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) that if al-Qaeda is expelled from one country after another, then takes root in a third, and then shows every sign, as it almost certainly would, of continuing to launch attacks against the west, then yes, we would have to work with that third country to cut them out, and if the third country were not prepared to work with us to do that, we would have to cut them out anyway&#151;unless he is proposing that western countries simply sit back as terrorist outrages are committed in the centres of their cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09020541000887">I have spent enough time on the theory, so I would like to say a few words about the debate. When the Foreign Secretary said that he would not be here at the end, he gave the excellent excuse that he is going to have talks with General Petraeus. If those talks are going to be about a possible increase in the British troop commitment to Afghanistan, I would like the Minister to answer a specific question. If he answers nothing else that I say from this Dispatch Box today, I would like him to answer this question: how will any extra troops that are sent to Afghanistan, if that is agreed, be funded? Will they be funded in-year from the Treasury reserve budget, or will they be funded in such a way that the money can be clawed back from the central Ministry of Defence  <br>

budget? I am sorry to inject a rather banal, cost-and-effect, penny-pinching approach to this debate, but the Minister will be as aware as anyone else that, at the moment, however well our armed forces are doing in theatre, the chiefs of the armed forces are at each others&#146; throats in a civil war of their own over inadequate defence resources. We know that one service is attacking another service&#146;s prime projects and reciprocation is not likely to be delayed for long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09020541000888">We have been fighting two medium-sized conflicts on a peacetime defence budget&#151;now it is going down to one. I have said before from this Dispatch Box, and I make no apology for saying it again, that Prime Minister Tony Blair gave the game away when he said that throughout the decade that new Labour had been in power, defence spending had remained roughly constant at 2.5 per cent. of GDP, and added the fateful words:</p>
<a name="90205-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="09020541001036"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;if we add in the extra funding for Iraq and Afghanistan.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90205-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09020541000889">Whenever we talk about Treasury reserves and so on, when we lump everything together, we find that we have been fighting two conflicts on a peacetime defence budget, and now the services are seriously talking about having to abandon one of the strategic roles of the armed forces in peacetime&#151;which is to insure against conflict with another state&#151;if we are to go on fighting these counter-insurgency campaigns, even at the present level. That is totally unacceptable, so we must have an assurance from the Government that any extra cost arising from further deployment to Afghanistan will be paid for by extra money. Otherwise, it cannot be contemplated.</p>

 I have no problem with that at all; I have talked about it before as well. I have been challenged about the matter before, I am asked the same question every time and I always give the same answer: the official Conservative policy on defence is that we will fully fund our defence commitments. That means increasing the money for defence, reducing the commitments, or doing something in between the two. If the Government are proposing to increase their commitment, they have got to find the extra funding for it. They cannot do it at the expense of the core MOD budget.</p>

matter, unlike the British in the past&#151;we are not out to conquer Afghanistan. We are out to work with people and groups in Afghanistan to enable them to deal with terrorist elements there. The reason why our casualties, grievous as they are, have come nowhere near the sort of levels incurred by the Russians, is precisely that difference. They were out to conquer and we are not.</p>

For NATO generally, that is because it responded when one of its countries came under attack, and because it has invested a lot in the campaign. However, not all NATO countries have invested anything like the same amount, and that needs to be considered. I welcome moves in NATO to start examining how interventions are funded, and I believe it is moving in the right direction with the suggestion that if some countries are not so willing to undertake the fighting, they should be more willing to put money into a central pot to help finance those of us that are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90205-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000898">We have heard a number of dissenting voices, but at the end of it all there are only two ways of leaving Afghanistan. One is to capitulate, and basically to say, &#147;It&#146;s okay. You can house international terrorist organisations. They can launch attacks on our major cities and we will not respond.&#148; The other is to identify the main elements in the country&#151;not just the ones that we regard as the most democratic but the real power brokers&#151;and say, &#147;Look here, we don&#146;t want to run your country, but we cannot tolerate a situation in which you allow splinter groups of foreigners to attack us, so we want to negotiate a deal.&#148;</p>

We might not be able to win militarily&#151;we never thought we would&#151;but we are certainly capable of ensuring that our opponents cannot defeat us. When they realise that, the basis for a deal will be available and the outcome will be the isolation and removal for good of the cancer of al-Qaeda.</p>

Gentleman complained that the Government had not kept Parliament well enough informed about Afghanistan or reported to Parliament at regular intervals. Frankly, I was a bit surprised to hear that complaint. The Government gave an extraordinarily full response to the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee, whose Chairman is no longer in his place, on 23 January, which is not very long ago. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has had a chance to read it yet, but I am very happy to pass it across to him if he has not had the opportunity to get his own copy. When he reads it, I hope that he will find that his complaint is not quite as well founded as he first thought.</p>

 I cannot believe that the Minister really thinks that a sanitised response to a Select Committee report&#151;we all know what responses to Select Committee reports are like&#151;is a substitute for regular parliamentary statements, which mean that Ministers can be cross-examined by the House. That is the least that we ask for. It is unprecedented that a military campaign should be in progress and statements given so rarely.</p>

 I cannot accept that remark, because Select Committees are not marginal; they are a central part of the institution of this place. The Government&#146;s responses to their reports should be in the mainstream of the whole mechanism of accountability on which a successful legislature depends. The response to the Foreign Affairs Committee report is full and detailed, and I believe that if the hon. Gentleman reads it, he will see that his criticisms are not well founded.</p>

Strangely, he said that was not so interested in helicopter hours or availability, he simply wanted more machines. Helicopter hours and helicopters with the right sort of capability, whether lift or ground support, at the right time&#151;available as rapidly as possible to commanders on the spot&#151;are important. We have made a considerable increase&#151;60 per cent.&#151;from the beginning of 2007 to the end of last year in the availability of helicopter time to our forces in Afghanistan. This year, there will also be a substantial increase&#151;25 or 30 per cent.&#151;including some Merlins, which he mentioned. We are also re-engining several Lynxes to enable them to operate on a 24-hour-day, seven-day-week, 365-day-year basis. I may have contributed modestly to that, and I set much store by it. That would constitute a considerable increase in our capacity. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman recognises that we have addressed the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90205-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000916">My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) spoke a little about Afghanistan and rather more about Pakistan. He acknowledged that the emancipation of women in all areas that ISAF controls or that are under our influence has been one of the great, positive changes in Afghanistan since ISAF intervention. The main thrust of his speech was Pakistan, a country with which he is obviously familiar. He made the point that many other hon. Members made: that Afghanistan cannot easily be disentangled from Pakistan, which cannot easily be disentangled from relations with India, which cannot easily be disentangled from the problem of Kashmir.

None the less, she delivered a well informed and lucid speech to which we enjoyed listening. She made some significant points on behalf of her party, including saying that more troops may be necessary in Afghanistan. She put it in the subjunctive, but it was an important point. She also said that United Kingdom should be prepared to make an additional small contribution. I note the word &#147;small&#148;. In that respect, the Liberal Democrats seem rather more decisive than Conservative Members, who do not express themselves so clearly on the matter. One sometimes suspects that&#151;to use the term that was used yesterday rather memorably&#151;there is a little bit of opportunism in the air. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> That will probably be my last party political swipe of the evening.</p>

Obviously he knows a lot about the background and a lot about Pakistan&#146;s history. I was glad to hear that he had led a delegation of colleagues to Pakistan, because it is extremely important that we maintain such contacts. As he said, we do not have just a long-standing historical relationship with Pakistan, which goes back to what the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell) calls the Raj, or a large number of citizens here whose family origins are in that country. We do not want our links to be just historical; we want them to continue&#151;to be burnished and kept alive. Such initiatives are extremely welcome and valuable.</p>

I do not think that I have ever heard one without learning some new historical fact, and today&#146;s was about Lord Salisbury telling the viceroy of India that he needed to use a larger-scale map, which is certainly a memorable phrase. The hon. Gentleman always enlightens the House, but he is always a pessimist about any British involvement anywhere. He said&#151;I hope that I noted down his words correctly&#151;that we want to &#147;get out of Afghanistan altogether&#148;.

The Conservatives have made additional commitments, such as on the three battalions, which is quite absurd, but they have not said what they will cut back if they go ahead with that commitment.

 It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in tonight&#146;s Adjournment debate on prejudice and mental health. We live in enlightened times. People no longer face persecution because of their sexuality, the colour of their skin or the nature of their physical disability. That is an extremely good thing; it is the mark of a civilised society. However, that enlightenment does not yet extend to how we relate to people with mental illness. There still seems to be a permitted culture&#151;or, if not a permitted culture, a tolerated culture&#151;of prejudice and discrimination towards them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09020541000936">It is sad that, over the past 15 years, society&#146;s view of the mentally ill has gone backwards. Our level of empathy for people with mental illness has actually deteriorated since 1994, and it is time that society and we in this place addressed that. Like many Members of Parliament, I was extremely privileged and honoured to attend the launch of Time to Change, a group of charities that have come together to try to dispel the stigma attached to mental illness. Society is still not reaching out to the mentally ill. We are still keeping them at arm&#146;s length. People with mental illness are afraid to connect with the health services because they are afraid of losing their liberty. Perhaps they are even more afraid, however, of how their friends, neighbours and workmates will respond to them. They face an unwarranted level of prejudice, and that should not be tolerated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09020541000937">One of the first things that I did when I became a Member of Parliament was to go to a local charity in my constituency. It was a charity that supports people with mental health problems. I met a number of constituents with schizophrenia and other forms of severe psychosis, and I learned a huge amount in those two hours. It was a hugely informative afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09020541000938">One event left me absolutely marked for the rest of my professional and adult life; it was seared into my heart. A carer told me that one of the patients&#151;the service users&#151;wanted to have a word with me in private, and asked whether I would object. I said that I would not at all object, and that I would very much like to have a private conversation with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09020541000939">The gentleman had suffered from schizophrenia for a number of years. He had had very severe schizophrenic events throughout his adult life, but he wanted me to know that he experienced hopes and aspirations, fears and concerns, joy and loathing&#151;all the same emotions as people who do not suffer from mental illness. He wanted me to know that, although he suffered from schizophrenia, he still had hopes, and that there were still things in his life that he wanted to achieve. In essence, he was justifying himself and his illness to me. That was very moving, even though there was no need for it. If he had cancer or heart disease, there would be no reason or expectation for him to justify his illness. I was shocked and saddened that he felt the need to address what he perceived would be my prejudices against him. It was, as I say, a very moving experience, and I learned a lot from him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09020541000940">Society reinforces the stigma of the mentally ill. We are guilty of that in this very place. If a Member of Parliament is sectioned for more than six months, they will be removed from the House of Commons and a replacement will be found for the seat; there will necessarily be a by-election. What message does that send out? It is no wonder that not a single serving MP in this place has admitted to having a mental health problem. They are fearful of what will happen to them if they do so. If someone running a company has a breakdown or a psychotic event, they can be removed from the board with no right of return. Again, what message does that send out?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09020541000941">One of the saddest aspects of the problem is that people who have had an episode of mental illness are banned from serving on juries. I know that the Government are looking further into that. Each year, 9,000 people are disqualified from serving in this country&#146;s justice system. The tragedy and the comedy of that, if I may make that connection, is that many of the people disqualified from serving on juries will be leaders in their respective fields. Some, yes, will be captains of industry; some will be leaders in the field of medicine, science or industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09020541000942">In fact, millions of people across our society who&#151;day in, day out&#151;make a huge contribution to it have mental health problems. They may well be people at the top of Government, or at the top of the Opposition parties, who manage mental health problems each and every day in a way that allows them to make a full and thorough contribution to public life. There should be no need for them to hide away or to hide their illness away. If they admitted that they had a mental illness today, they would remain exactly the same people tomorrow and would carry on doing an equally good job. People with mental illness are no more prone than others to fail or to succeed or even perhaps to be happy or sad; they are ordinary people, managing their illness and making a contribution. There is thus a huge job of work for us in this place to do in amending or getting rid of laws to send the message that mental illness is not something that people should be ashamed of and is not a crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09020541000943">I have spoken about mental illness on a number of occasions in this place over the past four years. I have sometimes been critical of coverage by the press. Indeed, I was critical of it three weeks ago. However, I have updated my thinking on this matter. Today I instructed my researcher to look at the <i> News of the World</i>, <i> The Sun</i> and the <i> Daily Mirror </i>over the past six weeks and find some examples of those newspapers taking a prejudicial approach to people with mental illness. I am pleased to say that I could not find one example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09020541000944">I am aware that Shift, an organisation that the Government are involved with, has published some guidance, which has been distributed to the media, suggesting ways in which they can report mental illness without driving people who have it further underground. I am also pleased to see that some very senior people in the media&#151;people such as Jon Snow, Alastair Campbell and others&#151;have taken the issue to heart. Alastair Campbell himself has suffered from mental health problems and he is leading the campaign to change how the press report mental illness. Let us remember that people with mental illness are 11 times more likely to be the victim of violent crime. They are the victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09020541000945">This big campaign, Time to Change, is running at the moment. There is a big media campaign and a big advertising campaign. One in four people, we are told, suffers from some form of mental illness in his or her lifetime: depression, anxiety, and conditions that are far worse and far longer-lasting. For many people, a period of mental illness is something that they will work through. They will obtain the necessary support, and they will come out of that bleak and dark period. But we must not let the figure of one in four diminish the fact that for one in 100 people&#151;perhaps one in 50&#151;mental illness is a life sentence. For those with schizophrenia, there is very little hope of a lasting recovery. Their symptoms can be managed; their equilibrium can be maintained through drug therapies; but, in the main, they will not recover from schizophrenia. There was a very good article in <i> The Times </i>today by Sathnam Sanghera, who wrote about his family&#146;s experience of schizophrenia: his father&#146;s experience and his sister&#146;s experience. As I have said, it is a long-term condition, which will be with them for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09020541000946">As a society, we probably have the greatest problem with schizophrenia and severe psychosis, and the way in which those conditions have been represented. I believe that in the coming years we will tackle people&#146;s concerns about depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, but there will be a huge job to be done in breaking down the barriers of concern surrounding schizophrenia, which have been built up for so long by, I am afraid, the media and others through irresponsible headlines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09020541000947">This is how difficult I believe it will be. A month ago, I got on to a train at Finsbury Park. I am an enlightened person living in an enlightened age; I understand these things. Yet when someone near me on the train was clearly having a severe turn&#151;psychosis&#151;and was clearly a troubled soul, every sinew in my body demanded that I get up and move. Of course, I had to persuade myself that I was being stupid. This man posed no threat to me; he posed a greater threat to himself, and he was deserving of my compassion and sympathy. Yet I, as someone who claims to understand, still wanted to get up and move. If I find it difficult, others who are not so aware of this illness and the terrible, ravaging effect that it has on the sufferer will find it more difficult&#151;difficult not to get up and move, difficult not to form negative opinions, and difficult not to stereotype sufferers from schizophrenia. So there is a huge job to be done, not just this year and next year but for decades to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09020541000948">Every day, we in this place must ask ourselves whether we are doing enough to address the stigma and prejudice attached to mental illness. If the answer is no, as it often will be, we must do a great deal more. We are a caring and a compassionate society, and we should set the highest expectations for ourselves. No one should be condemned to suffer in silence; no one should feel ashamed of having an illness. We must wrap our arms around those people and hold them close to us, to show them that we care and that we are with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09020541000949">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise this hugely important topic on the Adjournment.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)&#151;as I have done before&#151;on securing the Adjournment debate, and thank him for again using the opportunity to raise the key issue of mental health. He spoke with enormous passion and terrific eloquence. I have heard him speak before on the issue, and our view on it is very much shared across the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09020541000951">I echo what the hon. Gentleman said about us as a society. We like to think that stigma of this kind is a sin of the past: we do not like to think that any sort of discrimination can be endemic in our modern society, or that it can still have&#151;as the hon. Gentleman made clear&#151;such a profound and negative impact on people&#146;s lives. On this and previous occasions, the hon. Gentleman has done a very good job of pricking that bubble of complacency. As he rightly said, when it comes to mental health, stigma is unfortunately very much alive and well&#151;thriving, in fact&#151;and is something that we need to confront and defeat as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para15"><a name="09020541000952">Let me briefly make an observation, because I was interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of how we have made progress on various matters. This might be a crude simplification, but it seems to me that we have made a breakthrough on discrimination in every decade: in the &#146;70s, on gender discrimination; in the &#146;80s, on racism; in the &#146;90s, on homophobia; and in this decade, perhaps on ageism. I am not suggesting that we have totally eradicated discrimination on any of those grounds&#151; obviously there is a lot more that we can do&#151;but we made big leaps forward in those years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09020541000953">The stigma attached to mental health is the elephant in the room. Approaching the second decade of the 21st century, we may have mental health services that rank among the best in Europe according to the World Health Organisation, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that popular attitudes to mental health are well behind the times. He eloquently gave an example of someone he met in his constituency. I was struck by the story of a lady who had suffered from breast cancer, and who said that her friends and colleagues found it much easier to deal with her cancer than with the depression that followed when she went into remission. As a rule, people with a physical illness get flowers, sympathy and support; with mental illness, they are often met with silence and solitude&#151;and sometimes reproach. Moreover, this is just the tip of the iceberg, because stigma and discrimination&#151;in businesses, in the media, in public services and across communities&#151;mean that many people never really escape the legacy of their mental health problems not because of poor health, but because of poor attitudes. Giving people flowers or sympathy is fine, but we must address the harsh reality of disadvantage and social exclusion&#151;problems in finding and keeping work, in securing housing and in education and training. What stigma does is deny people opportunity and hope for a better future; I am thinking of the example the hon. Gentleman gave of the individual in his constituency whom he met after he was first elected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09020541000954">Certain groups are more affected than others and suffer a &#147;double discrimination&#148;&#151;this came up in a debate we had in the House a few weeks ago. Some black and minority ethnic groups have high rates of severe mental illness as well as facing greater inequality in terms of their access to, and experience of, mental  <br>

health services. That must change. Our five-year action plan, &#147;Delivering race equality in mental health care&#148;, aims to address that by showing how services must adapt to offer timely and culturally sensitive care to different cultural groups. We will also put race inequality&#151;and age inequality, which is another key issue&#151;at the heart of the new horizons project, which is the new vision for mental health we are currently developing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para18"><a name="09020541000955">Having agreed with much of what the hon. Gentleman said, I wish to add that it would be wrong to portray this as a &#147;year zero&#148; moment in tackling this matter, or any other kind of stigma in mental health. Thanks to more than &#163;1.5 billion of further investment in mental health since 2001, the reality is that things are changing: services are improving and experiences are better for people with mental health problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para19"><a name="09020541000956">Since the last debate, I have had the pleasure of seeing at first hand how a combination of investment and innovation is changing lives. I visited Newham, and if the hon. Gentleman wants to see some excellent practice I recommend he sees what is happening there, too. It has pioneered new ways of improving access to psychological therapies. I met a young French mother who told me how the service she receives linked her to a whole network of support, including a children&#146;s centre and a job club. Her therapist was always available to her, including by text message on her mobile phone, so she always knew somebody was there when a moment arose when she needed support. I spoke to her directly, and it was clear that that support made all the difference. She is now much better and she is receiving help to look for a job&#151;and I am sure she will find one very soon. What was even more encouraging was how the treatment centre I visited linked her with other people who used the centre&#151;and although she has moved on, she still goes there for a cup of tea and a chat when she needs it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para20"><a name="09020541000957">Indeed, the whole community in Newham is starting to break down barriers. Another group, who had received cognitive behavioural therapy, has volunteered to take leaflets round to local clubs and community venues, letting people know help is available. The hon. Gentleman may not know Newham, so may I tell him that it is one of the most ethnically diverse boroughs in the country? That word-of-mouth support has been key to improving the number of black and Asian people receiving treatment. They can self-refer, walk into that centre and get the benefits from it. That has not led to an avalanche of responses from the worried well, as some people feared. People were coming forward with illnesses as serious and enduring as those referred by doctors, so this approach has opened up services for the black and minority ethnic community in a way that others have not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para21"><a name="09020541000958">All in all, the visit I made was an inspiring one. The hon. Gentleman described how he was inspired by the people whom he has met and, likewise, I have been inspired by the people whom I met in Newham. The Government are investing &#163;173 million over the next three years to deliver similar programmes around the country, so that what happens in Newham will soon happen everywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para22"><a name="09020541000959">Transforming mental health services is not enough&#151;as the hon. Gentleman said, we must transform attitudes across all public services. Every touch point for people with mental health problems needs to be aware of that and must not hang on to discriminatory attitudes. Our  <br>

national social inclusion programme and public service agreement No. 16 are focusing minds in public services, bringing together action across central Government and translating it into progress at the local level, particularly on issues associated with settled employment and settled accommodation for individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para23"><a name="09020541000960">As the Minister for the East Midlands&#151;that is another role that I have&#151;I have created a regional sounding board in the east midlands to develop practical action across all the agencies that operate regionally on housing, on jobs and on education and training, so that we can bring those people together to examine what more we need to do. That is particularly important now, when people who are a long way away from the employment market are likely to become further away from it if we do not take action to support them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para24"><a name="09020541000961">The Government have a raft of smaller initiatives in place that are aimed at offering individual services that confront and do not compound stigma: the Open to All training package for museums and galleries; the &#147;Really Useful Book of Learning and Earning&#148;, which has been distributed to carers, jobcentre advisers, colleges and training providers; and the Work Matters advice for occupational therapists, which helps them to obtain the advice and guidance necessary to meet their clients&#146; needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para25"><a name="09020541000962">Getting local services right can be a springboard for wider changes across society. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning Shift, which is funded by the Department of Health and is doing great work to confront prejudice in two key areas: the workplace and the media. It was great to hear what he had to say about the analysis done by his researcher; perhaps we are beginning to have an impact and perhaps some of that work is beginning to have an influence. He is right to say that leading figures in the media who are prepared to stand up and challenge their own industry on all this are important to making progress. The work being done is also contributing to our forthcoming national mental health and employment strategy, to be led by Dame Carol Black, which will be vital to breaking down barriers to employment in all sectors. It would be great if we could work with the media so that instead of taking an unhelpful, sensationalist approach, they could suddenly become the solution to the problem of changing attitudes to mental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90205-0022.htm_para26"><a name="09020541000963">That leads me to my final point: the need to create a deeper cultural change across society. The hon. Gentleman and I very much share that aim, which requires political leadership. That is why it is so important that we are having these debates in the House. I know that there is a growing consensus between the political parties and, indeed, between Governments on the issue. I recently attended an international conference on stigma in mental health, where I shared a platform with the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton), who speaks on behalf of the Conservatives, and the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), who speaks on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. No one could have put a cigarette paper between us; we shared the view that we should challenge that stigma.</p>

Health Media&#151;and it is very significant. This is the start of another long journey on which those organisations are going to take us. The fact that the impetus is coming from those organisations will help to garner support in the wider community. We have to reach far deeper into the public&#146;s mindset if we are to achieve the outcomes that the hon. Gentleman and I seek.</p>

am proud of what we have achieved in mental health services. I am proud of the significant expansion in community-based support for people with mental health problems, and of the praise that the World Health Organisation reserved for our system in its recent report. But stigma threatens those achievements. So we need the same conviction, the same strength and the same focus that helped us to break down past sources of discrimination&#151;which I mentioned earlier&#151;to end this one too. We all want this period to be the one that we will look back on and say, &#147;That was the moment. It was 2009, the start of the second decade of the 21st century&#151;that was when we made the breakthrough. That was when we opened people&#146;s eyes and changed their minds about mental health.&#148; I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to see that as much as I do.
