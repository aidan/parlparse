 I agree with my hon. Friend, and I can tell him that no fewer than 11 credit unions in Yorkshire are benefiting from the investment that the Government are putting in through the growth fund. We have found that in many areas a number of small credit unions have come together to collaborate and pursue a bid for growth fund money. That has been especially effective for credit unions that cover rural areas. My hon. Friend is right that such amalgamations must take place if we are to get wider coverage on behalf of credit unions, and that is precisely the sort of thing that growth fund investment has encouraged.</p>

 The growth fund money is being used in a number of ways. Some of it is expanding the capitalisation of credit unions&#151;it is having a substantial impact in that respect. As I said, a number of credit unions have amalgamated or brought collaborative deals to us in order to bid for the growth fund. Some of the money is also available to assist in training and development for those who work in credit unions&#151;both full-time staff and volunteers, who play an important role.</p>

 I recognise the picture that my hon. Friend has painted.

If they are successful in getting a job there is also, of course, our successful &#147;access to work&#148; programme to address ways of supporting them in employment. I know that my hon.

I hope that she welcomed the recent statement in the pre-Budget report supporting enhanced facilities for speech therapy.

Would it not be better for all concerned if the Government concentrated on putting their efforts into providing tailored support for such people to get back into work, as proposed in the Freud review, which Ministers have now ditched, rather than on demonising disabled people by using negative stereotypes of the type that we have read about again in the papers today?</p>

For those who have a hearing impairment, we provide British Sign Language signers and we examine different ways in which we can support technology to maintain people in their employment.

 The Secretary of State has just rightly said that since its inception the Child Support Agency has encountered many difficulties. I am sure that he will be aware, as are many hon.

 We will provide powers for direct collection from bank accounts, because the hon. Lady is right that there is a problem with self-employed people. We will also encourage mediation, especially for those on benefit. At present, they have to enter into a statutory relationship, via the CSA.

 First of all, in terms of numbers we estimate that 1.1 million to 1.7 million pensioners do not take up pension credit. I think before the hon. Gentleman makes comments such as those he has just made, he should recall that when the Conservatives were in office they left 2.7 million pensioners living in poverty, many living on as little as &#163;69 a week; many women were restricted from building up state pension entitlement in their own right and carers were similarly mistreated. In talking about the financial assistance scheme&#151;the help for the 125,000 pensioners concerned because of the breakdown of their pension scheme&#151;the Tories should be a little careful; they cannot afford to claim that they looked after pensions during their term. They created the circumstances in which many of those schemes got into trouble. In 1986, pension fund surpluses were capped by the then Chancellor. They allowed pension holidays&#151;</p>

Does he not support the Government in getting people off benefit and into work&#151;getting British people off benefits and into British jobs? Of course he should support us. That is our objective and that is what the Prime Minister was talking about. The vehicle for doing that is the signing up of more than 200 local employment partnerships, with employers joining them, to get people directly off incapacity benefit and into work, and to get older people and lone parents into work.

 I am very much in favour of sensible lines. In respect of the problem, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is a danger that foreign nationals could depress wage levels. That is why the minimum wage that we brought in must be enforced rigorously throughout the economy. In some cases, that is not happening, and foreign nationals themselves are being exploited, so we are bringing in tougher measures to ensure that it does happen&#151;and to enforce employment rights, which are not always enforced. I hope that he will join me in insisting that the legal rights for which we have legislated as a Government, including the minimum wage, are properly respected, in Macclesfield and elsewhere.</p>

 The Secretary of State was right in his statistic when he told the House that the proportion of non-UK workers in the work force has almost doubled since 1997. He could have added that the proportion of UK workers has fallen in the same period. Furthermore, is he aware that since 1995, the number of British jobs occupied by British workers has decreased? At the same time, there has been a continued increase in the number of non-UK nationals in employment, including both EU nationals, to whom the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) referred, and non-EU nationals. The Government continue to issue an ever-increasing number of work permits, at a time when there is an influx of nationals from the A8 states.

 If the hon. Gentleman supported the policy of identity cards, it might be easier to resolve the question that he has put. Let us look at the facts. The facts are that we have seen a million more British nationals in jobs under our Government. Unemployment and the claimant count rate are at an historically low level. There are 660,000 job vacancies in the British economy today and every day. Also&#151;this is crucial to a sensible analysis of the debate&#151;the number of working-age British people has fallen significantly, because it is an ageing society. Therefore, one might also ask the question: what if those foreign nationals, including those from Europe, had not been here to fill the jobs in the gap that an ageing population left behind? That is why we want to get more people off benefits and into work, and why the Prime Minister&#146;s policy of getting British benefit claimants into British jobs, so that they become British workers, is the right policy.</p>

 Will the Minister have urgent talks with Treasury colleagues about why they have been encouraging credit unions to offer easy credit rather than follow the well-tried policy of insisting that customers prove their ability to save? My local credit union in Llanelli, which provides an excellent service, is concerned that easy credit could lead to unserviceable debts and put the security of the credit union itself at risk.</p>

 Under the rules that apply to investments in respect of the growth fund, it is clear that credit unions should do a full assessment of individuals applying for credit. It is certainly not the case that credit should be extended to individuals who cannot meet the repayments. The important advantage that the growth fund investment gives is that its loans are running rates that are probably at least half those for loans secured from doorstep lenders and vastly less than rates secured from loan sharks. Provided that credit unions carry out the necessary checks on individual applicants, the loans should be affordable.</p>

keep a job. Many of the 2.64 million people of working age are currently on incapacity benefit because the personal capability assessment has focused more on people&#146;s incapability than their capability for work. In October 2008, I am therefore introducing a new medical test&#151;the work capability assessment&#151;that will assess people&#146;s physical and mental ability and what they can do rather than what they cannot do. I placed a report evaluating the new test in the Library this morning.</p>

 May I invite the Secretary of State to indulge in a bit of interdepartmental thinking and action to overcome a problem that is becoming very apparent in inner-city areas such as mine? Single parents have great difficulty in accessing council or housing association properties because of the shortages and are therefore placed in private accommodation by the local authority, often on a very high rent&#151;sometimes as much as &#163;300 or &#163;400 a week. That rent is then paid for by housing benefit. I have no problem with people getting housing benefit; this is not an attack on housing benefit, but the problem that then emerges is that, if and when they are offered a job or encouraged into a job by the agency, they have to reject it because they need to get one that pays more than &#163;15,000 to start with just to pay the rent. That means that they are in danger of losing benefits and we are in danger of losing somebody who wants to work and contribute to society. This is a twin problem of benefits and housing. I realise that it is not entirely the Secretary of State&#146;s responsibility, but does he recognise that it is a serious issue, and is he prepared to do something about it?</p>

as far as I know. We sought to draw attention to a radical change from what has gone on in the past, in the 1980s and 1990s, when people were smuggled off the unemployment statistics on to incapacity benefit. The numbers tripled, which led to the benefit mountain we received as a legacy from the previous Conservative Government. We are reducing it. For the first time in a generation, the figure has come down&#151;by 120,000 during the past few years&#151;having risen year on year as a result of that legacy. The new, stringent, personal capability assessment, of which I have informed the House, will enable us to bring that number down even more.</p>

 On the contrary, compared with the record of the Tory Government, where incapacity benefit tripled, we have already brought the numbers down by 120,000 and this additional test will enable us to accelerate that process. In addition, the rolling out of pathways to work throughout the country by April next year will bear down even more sharply on those figures. At last we will begin to get rid of the awful legacy bequeathed to us by the previous Tory Government, where people were written off on incapacity benefit, instead of being helped into a job, or being given new opportunities, skills and support to get a job, which enable them to transform their lives as a result.</p>

In the UK, private pensions are more important, and 86 per cent. of UK pensioners have income other than state pensions. Private pensions are also eligible for tax relief so, including a private pension, a pensioner on a medium income gets an income of two thirds of average earnings.

I also said that I expected to publish a statement of principles underpinning the Government&#146;s approach to proposals received by Northern Rock with regard to its future. I published that statement this morning, prior to the markets opening, in the usual way. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="71119-0003.htm_para2"><a name="0711196000143">It is important to be clear about the respective responsibilities of the Northern Rock board and the Government. The board is legally responsible to its shareholders for the future of the company. However, the Government have a wider public interest in maintaining financial stability, which is why we agreed to lender-of-last-resort support in September and subsequent lending by the Bank of England. The Government also have an interest in protecting the interest of the taxpayer. Because of this, the Government have, as a major creditor, a direct interest in the future of Northern Rock. The Government therefore have to agree to any proposals for the future of Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="71119-0003.htm_para3"><a name="0711196000144">Before turning to our approach, let me deal first with the position on the guarantee arrangements to Northern Rock depositors provided by the Government and, secondly, with the loan facilities provided by the Bank of England to support Northern Rock and to maintain financial stability in general. First, we have made it clear that the guarantee arrangements already announced for depositors in order to safeguard their position will remain in place during the current instability in the financial markets. These guarantee arrangements were absolutely necessary. They have not had any cost to the taxpayer because these deposits covered by the guarantee arrangements remain in the bank. As I have said before, savers are free to take their money out if that is what they want to do, but they have no need to do so. The guarantee arrangements ensure that savers&#146; deposits are safe. The guarantee will not be removed without proper notice being given to depositors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="71119-0003.htm_para4"><a name="0711196000145">Looking ahead, I have made clear that the Government will legislate for a new regime for protecting bank depositors. As the House knows, we have published a discussion paper on this legislation, and I very much welcome the offer of cross-party support for it. But it is important that we get it right. There are many examples, both here and in other countries, of legislation having been rushed through only to be regretted later. The current consultation finishes on 5 December. I will bring forward proposals in the new year when I have also had time to consider the outcome of the Treasury Committee&#146;s work, as it has requested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0711196000146">The second element of support is the Bank of England loan facilities. It is important to remind ourselves of why this support was provided in the first place. Northern Rock got into difficulties because it was almost totally reliant on getting very substantial sums from the securitisation and money markets on a continuous basis  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Nov 2007">

to do its business. When that lending became ever more difficult, it had no option other than to go to the Bank of England. Because of the possible impact on the stability of the wider financial system, it was right that I authorised the Bank of England to intervene. That, too, had cross-party support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0711196000147">While international financial markets have shown signs of improvement since the sharp credit squeeze in August and September, following the problems that arose in the American housing market in the summer, there clearly remains continued uncertainty in the markets. The rates at which banks are willing to lend to each other also remain high in all the major currencies. It is therefore vital that we do everything we can to maintain stability internationally, as well as here at home. As the House knows, we are taking steps at an international and domestic level to improve the regulatory regime and to provide greater transparency. That was the subject of the discussions of G20 Finance Ministers that I attended in Cape Town over the weekend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0711196000148">The continuing support of the Bank of England has also given Northern Rock an opportunity to consider its strategic options. I am very clear that this is also the right thing to do and, indeed, when I announced this, it enjoyed support from both sides of the House. I know that there has been interest in how much support the Bank of England is giving. The Bank publishes its balance sheet every week. However, in common with other central banks, it does not provide details of any operations because it believes that doing so would undermine its ability to provide such support. I understand the frustrations that that can sometimes cause, but to provide what would, in effect, be a running commentary on any operations would be likely to have adverse affects that none of us would want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0711196000149">Having said that, I can tell the House that Bank of England lending is secured against assets held by Northern Rock, which include high-quality mortgages with a significant protection margin built in and high-quality securities with the highest quality of credit rating. The Bank is the senior secured creditor. The Financial Services Authority has said before, and continues to say, that Northern Rock&#146;s main asset base&#151;its mortgage book&#151;is strong and sound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0711196000150">As with any lender on this scale, we have ensured that the Bank&#146;s lending is subject to significant conditions and controls to ensure that our interests are protected, and, in return for that facility, Northern Rock has agreed a number of controls, including not declaring, making or paying any dividend without the prior written consent of the Bank of England, and not making any substantial change to the nature of its business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0711196000151">I now turn to the next stage. It is in the interests of everyone that the situation with regard to Northern Rock is resolved as soon as possible. That was why Northern Rock asked for expressions of interest in purchasing the business. As the company announced earlier today, as part of its review of its strategic options, it has received indicative expressions of interest, covering a range of options for the business. It currently expects to receive further expressions of interest in the next few days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0711196000152">It is essential that the public interest is protected. That is why I have published today the principles that will underpin the Government&#146;s approach, when  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Nov 2007">

<notus-date day="19" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>19 Nov 2007 : Column 961</b><br>
assessing proposals from Northern Rock regarding its future. As I have already said, the Government have to agree to any such proposals. The principles make it clear that the Government have a clear duty to protect the public interest, and we will do so. However, I think that the whole House, and particularly Members representing the north-east, will want us to do everything we can within the constraints on us to resolve a very difficult position for Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0711196000153">Let me therefore set out our approach. First, we must protect the interests of the taxpayer. Substantial sums have been lent, and that money has to be repaid at an appropriate time and rate. The Government will consider proposals with a view to reaching the best outcome for the public purse. Secondly, we want to protect depositors. It is essential to do everything we can both to safeguard their interests and to maintain the service provided to them. Thirdly, we will maintain wider financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0711196000154">As I have made clear all along, the Government will now assess proposals from the company consistent with the approach that I have set out, and we remain closely engaged with the company as the best outcome for its future is assessed. As the company has acknowledged today, any proposals would have to be approved by the Government and, importantly, any proposal can be vetoed by the Government. In that way, the Government can ensure that the public interest is safeguarded. As I have told the House on previous occasions, any outcome must meet EU state aid rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0711196000155">It would be quite wrong to dismiss any option now without proper consideration, as some have suggested we do. I continue to believe that it is right to use this time to explore the best outcome for the company and the public interest. I agreed to Bank of England support because I believed it was right to do so. I agreed to continue support to allow Northern Rock the time it needs to consider its strategic options because it was right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0711196000156">I have set out today the approach that the Government will take as they assess proposals from the company to ensure that we will approve a solution only if it safeguards both the public interest and the specific interests of the taxpayer. That work is being done now and will be concluded as quickly as possible. I will, of course, continue to keep the House informed in the coming weeks. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 Order. Let the hon. Gentleman ask his questions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="0711196000159"><a name="71119-0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="0711196000535"><b>Mr. Osborne:</b>
 The question we now ask of the Chancellor is simple: has he been honest with taxpayers about the risks that they face, and has he told the whole truth? First, let us look at what he has announced today. He announced that what was supposed to be a short-term emergency facility for Northern Rock may now be extended beyond February and could last for years. Thank you, but we already knew that because it was in a memo from the company&#146;s advisers that was leaked last week. Indeed, throughout the crisis we have learned more from media leaks than we have from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0711196000160">The Chancellor will not tell us the size of the facility, when he expects it to be repaid or the terms of the repayment, even though much of that information is an open secret in the City. Indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England wants to publish the letter that he sent to the Chancellor to set out those terms. He told the Select Committee that that he wanted to do so, but the Chancellor refuses to publish the letter and simply says that it is in the public interest that he should refuse. Clearly, the Governor of the Bank of England disagrees. Will the Chancellor explain in greater detail why he will not publish that letter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0711196000161">This is not about the commercial interests that the Prime Minister spoke about last week, but about the public interest and the &#163;900 that has been pledged on behalf of every taxpayer in Britain. The Chancellor talks about the Government&#146;s liabilities being secured against &#163;100 billion of Northern Rock assets, but he does not say that many of the assets are already promised to other creditors. Will he confirm that the free assets at Northern Rock could be closer to &#163;40 billion and that total Government liabilities, through both the facility and the deposit guarantee, might now be approaching the total of the available assets, putting the taxpayer further at risk?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0711196000162">The Treasury also said today:</p>
<a name="71119-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0711196000402"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Authorities expect the costs and risks associated with Northern Rock to be borne to the greatest extent possible by the current and future private sector providers of capital.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0711196000163">So do we, but has the Chancellor given a general guarantee to cover the &#163;13 billion or so lent by medium-term note holders&#151;the large institutions that lent money with their eyes open? Has the Chancellor considered reducing the risk to taxpayers by announcing a cap on the guarantee offered by the Government so that only individual savers are fully protected? Of course, we need to get the depositor protection legislation right, but we now know from the Governor of the Bank of England that he has been pressing the Chancellor to do that for a considerable time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0711196000164">The Chancellor has failed to address today the two things that he appears so far to have kept secret from Parliament and from the taxpayer. First, will he tell us whether it is true that the Treasury, as well as the Bank of England, has lent money to Northern Rock? He mentioned only the Bank of England in his statement, but today we are told that the Treasury has also lent so-called subordinated term debt, which does not have to be paid for five years, comes at the back of the queue and is in most danger of default if the bank is wound up. If that is true, taxpayers have been exposed to an extraordinary long-term risk, yet we have been told about that Treasury loan by the BBC&#146;s business editor rather than the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If it is  <br>

true, the Chancellor is surely deliberately withholding information from Parliament and the public. Will he confirm the existence of that Treasury loan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0711196000165">The second thing that has become clearer today is that the Chancellor cannot be sure of keeping the promises that he and the Prime Minister made to the taxpayer. He said to the Select Committee that</p>

Will all the money lent by the taxpayer be repaid with interest&#151;yes or no? Let us hope that the answer is yes and that, in the final reckoning, the taxpayer will not have paid a heavy price for the Government&#146;s incompetence. Let us hope that the Chancellor can be honest today about the risks to the taxpayer and about the existence of the secret Treasury loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0711196000170">We are considering a tale of incompetence and weak leadership from a Government who now reel from one disaster to another. We have a Chancellor who appears to have made secret loans from the Treasury, who has made guarantees to the taxpayer that he cannot be sure of honouring and whose weakness contributes to the instability of the financial system. That is why the Chancellor&#146;s job is now on the line.</p>

 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was unable to make any constructive proposals. He supported the decision that I made at the start to enable us to provide lender-of-last-resort facilities to the bank. He also supported providing a guarantee, yet he now tries to give the impression that he does not agree with any of those things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0711196000172">On the many questions that the hon. Gentleman asked about future proposals, he knows full well that, until we have had a chance to assess the proposals that the various financial institutions have presented and reach a view about what would work, it is impossible for me to state precisely the arrangements that we expect for Northern Rock in future. However, it is right to spend time assessing the proposals that the various institutions have made and then come to a view about what is best to ensure that we secure a future for Northern Rock and protect the wider public interest, especially the taxpayers&#146; money that has been lent to the bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0711196000173">It is hardly a secret that we have made facilities available to Northern Rock&#151;I have informed the House at each and every stage of events, as hon.

been no cost to the taxpayers. The money is there; people can take it out if they wish. However, the guarantee exists, and it is not, therefore, necessary for people to take out the money. There has not been a cost to the taxpayer because the money is in the bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0711196000175">The hon. Gentleman asked about lending to the Northern Rock bank. The lending of last resort and the lending that started in the week beginning 9 October has been by the Bank of England. He asked especially about a story that appeared on the BBC this morning on the element of the loan that represents the penal rate of interest that the Bank of England normally charges. The sum concerned is nothing like the figure about which Mr. Peston speculated on the radio. It is a small amount of money, which will be recovered from Northern Rock. It is due to be recovered by Northern Rock as and when we move to the next stage. There is, therefore, nothing secret about it. It is a perfectly normal lending operation by the Bank of England that is necessary to secure the future of Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para26"><a name="0711196000176">The hon. Gentleman asked about the letter that the Governor of the Bank of England sent. I repeat what I said when he asked that question last week&#151;the Treasury Committee asked the same question. On the evening before the lender-of-last-resort facilities were announced, both the Governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA wrote letters advising me to authorise such facilities. The letters must be seen together. It is true that the Governor of the Bank of England told the Select Committee that he had no objection to publication. However, the chairman of the FSA most certainly objects to the letters being published. As I said to the Treasury Committee, I do not say that we will never publish them&#151;I believe that, given time, it may be appropriate to do so. However, it would not be in the public interest to publish them now. I have consistently taken that position with the Select Committee and in the House last week and today.</p>

He said that he would outline the principles on which the Government would act in the coming weeks, and I am pleased that the public interest was put at the forefront of those principles. In defining the public interest, is he prepared to look at the question of employment, not only at this time but at the time that any bid might be successful, and for a five-year period afterwards?

because of the impact on jobs and on the wider economy there. As I have said on previous occasions, I hope that we can do everything possible to allow the Northern Rock to continue to do business. As he knows, many hurdles must be crossed, but we will do everything we can to help. That is why it is so necessary to provide Northern Rock with a breathing space, and it is deeply regrettable that some people, particularly Conservatives, now seem to be suggesting that that is wrong.</p>

The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was widely criticised for advancing &#163;800 million for the millennium dome. In the past few weeks, the Government have provided the equivalent of 30 millennium domes to this bank, without even the prospect of a decent pop concert at the end of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para29"><a name="0711196000182">The key question, which I put to the Prime Minister last week, is this: is the lending secured? He said that it was. Will the Chancellor confirm, however, that that is not the case? Of the loan, &#163;13 billion has a first charge security, although at a more relaxed standard than is normal; &#163;11 billion, however, is wholly unsecured. Half the assets of the bank have been packaged up by a company called Granite, which is registered in the Channel Islands and has the first claim on the assets. The remainder is a collection of mortgages, many of which were advanced at the peak of the property market and are now of declining value. I therefore return to the question that I put to the Prime Minister, and that has been partially put to the Chancellor already. Will he stand up and give an absolute guarantee that the loan will be repaid in full, with full interest, within the lifetime of this Parliament?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para30"><a name="0711196000183">Will the Chancellor also comment on the management of the company?

Will the Government explain how they got into a position in which they have entrusted &#163;24 billion to a management team that was discredited, that led the bank into its present crisis, and whose chief executive showed such contempt for his own bank that he sold his own shares to invest in a country estate and a Ferrari for his wife?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="71119-0004.htm_para31"><a name="0711196000184">That is not the only conflict of interest. An attempt is being made to sell the bank, led by the company.

 I note that over the weekend the hon. Gentleman changed his position on Northern Rock several times. On Saturday he was calling for full-scale nationalisation, by yesterday he was calling for reluctant nationalisation; and today it was reluctant nationalisation for a very short period. This afternoon, having denounced the City, he went on to press for a quick sale to the very people whom he had denounced.</p>

The reason that we insist on our interests being upheld is that we would have to agree with any proposal for the future of Northern Rock. If we do not like a proposal, we can say no to it. We can veto it because, through the Bank of England, we are by far the major creditor.</p>

wrong. I think that we owe it to people in the north-east, as well as to the general public, to do all that we can to try to reach a point from which this business can be taken forward. It will be difficult&#151;many hurdles will have to be overcome, and a great deal of hard work will be involved&#151;but I think that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that we can manage the process, and that it would be wrong to close the door on any possibility of something in the future.</p>

 Will the Chancellor spell out in more detail why, despite the unprecedented sums involved, he is unable to be more transparent with the House in regard to the amount, the conditions, the terms and the repayment process? He now says that that is not possible because of the central bank&#146;s commercial confidentiality, but we were told earlier that the potential deal being considered by the Treasury and the bank was aborted precisely because it was thought that such details would have to be made public.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman raises two points. Let me deal with the second one first, as there has been some comment about a proposal that a major bank made to the Government, the Bank and the FSA at the end of August. There was no firm proposal on the table, but, as the FSA chairman has said, an exploratory inquiry was made as to whether the Bank would be prepared to lend the institution in question about &#163;30 billion at commercial rates. It was explained that there were three problems with that. First, neither the Bank nor the Government normally provides commercial lending in this way to a going concern, which is what that financial institution was. The second problem was that if we were to entertain such an option we would have had to ask other banks whether they would be willing to enter into a similar arrangement, perhaps involving less Government money. As the right hon. Gentleman will recognise, the Government cannot just, in effect, lend &#163;30 billion to a bank without there being some sort of due process to allow others to see whether they could do something more competitively. I would have been open to severe criticism if I had done that. The third problem was that, on any view, this would have been state aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="71119-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0711196000197">As it happened, having made the preliminary inquiry the institution never pursued the matter. The proposal was made on a Saturday and the institution withdrew its interest in Northern Rock on Monday. Therefore, it was never the case that there was a proposal on the table that was there to be considered and accepted or rejected. There was a preliminary inquiry, and I have explained what the difficulties were. However, as I have also said to the House, and to the Treasury Committee, I have always taken the view that had it been possible for Northern Rock to have been acquired prior to all these difficulties, that would have been the best solution. I must also say to the right hon. Gentleman&#151;I apologise to the House for taking up so much time in dealing with this, but it is important&#151;that we should remember that that approach was made before anybody in the outside world knew there was a problem with Northern Rock. For us to have then started a competition as to which bank might take it over might have drawn attention to the very problems we are concerned about.</p>

We have never said that everything would stop at the end of February and could not possibly continue. Surely the best thing to do to secure the best possible repayment of the loan made by the Bank of England is to assess the proposals being worked up and then decide on the appropriate rate and timing of repayment.

Will he impress upon Bryan Sanderson, its chairman, that there is no case for a payout for its chief executive, Adam Applegarth?

 I am sure that Bryan Sanderson will have heard what my right hon. Friend has had to say. It is important, especially given the position that Northern Rock is in at the moment, that whatever it does, it must ask itself whether that is the right thing to do. In answer to his question about the three principles that I set out&#151;to protect taxpayers, to promote financial stability and to protect depositors&#151;they are all equally important.

If the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) were to examine paragraph 3 of the statement on principles, he would see that that is precisely what the Government set out.</p>

 I was making the point that the guarantee is there and that it will not be removed without warning. I said it would continue as long as current conditions subsist. One of the things that we will consider is future legislation to put in place a long-term deposit protection scheme, as I indicated earlier. What I have tried to do right from the start is to provide stability not just for Northern Rock but for the financial system as a whole, and the guarantee is an important part of that.</p>

 Unlike those on the Opposition Front Benches, I remember having welcomed the Chancellor&#146;s giving the facility to Northern Rock on the grounds that it would avoid wider financial instability. My memory is better, and I stick by it. I now welcome the spelling out of the priorities in terms of taxpayer and depositor protection, as well as wider financial stability&#151;but has the bank made crystal clear to private shareholders, including the one or two hedge funds that have opportunistically come on board, the reality of their position, and made sure that they approach the private bids with that reality in mind?</p>

One thing that we should not lose sight of is the root causes of the problem: Northern Rock had a business model predicated on its being able to get very large sums of money from the financial markets, which simply dried up so that it could no longer get those sums. The FSA accepts that it should have looked at that situation.

That agreement was in our long-term national interest. It is good for Britain and good for Europe, and today I shall explain why. It is good for Britain because it not only preserves our rebate but will see it rise in value during the next six years. It is good for Europe because it provides investment to help the emerging economies of eastern Europe prosper, which in turn and in time will benefit our own economy, as have all previous EU enlargements.

 The Chief Secretary is right that it is important that the parts of Europe that need structural funds receive them.

Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), funds will continue to be available to the less well-developed regions of Britain. Merseyside has recently improved its competitiveness, but challenges remain in Cornwall and, I believe, the western highlands. Parts of this country will still benefit substantially from funding to improve their competitiveness.</p>

As the former Prime Minister told the House, overall the abatement will get us back around &#8364;41 billion in this budget period, which is more than in the last one. Thirdly, the agreement will see sensible, restrained growth in the overall budget. The latest forecasts are that the budget will fall below 1 per cent. of EU gross national income in commitment terms by the end of the financial perspective. Overall, the budget will grow by just 7 per cent. across the financial perspective, as compared with growth of 17 per cent. in 1988 and 22 per cent. in 1994.

 May I clarify one point with the Minister? He says that our rebate is going up, but will he confirm that the rebate is a percentage of the difference between what we pay in and what we receive back?

Rather than being enthusiastic about the rebate rising, we should look for it to fall, so that our gap falls, too. Surely that is the case.</p>

My hon. Friend&#146;s point about the gap is correct, but that is because there is a disapplication of the rebate on economic and structural spending in the new member states, as I have explained. With those countries having been welcomed into Europe, our judgment is that the right thing to do morally is equip them to compete competitively. If we did not do that, we would be in breach of our responsibilities as a full member of the European Union. That explains the gap to which my hon. Friend has drawn the attention of the House.</p>

Friend&#146;s question a moment ago, new member states will receive &#8364;158 billion in structural and cohesion funds in this financial perspective&#151;a 250 per cent. increase on the previous financial perspective period. The share of new member states&#146; receipts will rise from 24 per cent. of the total to 56 per cent. in 2013. Lastly, because of the shift in spending from west to east, all wealthier nations will see their net contributions rise, some by more than others. In this financial perspective, French and UK net contributions will be in rough parity, with French and Italian contributions rising twice as fast as ours.</p>

 I feel very cross with the Minister for suggesting that we do not want to help the eastern European countries. My grandfather came to this country from eastern Europe during the war, and we on the Opposition side of the House feel passionately about those countries. Our problem is that we do not expect the United Kingdom to have to stump up all the cash; France, Germany and the others should do so as well. The Minister&#146;s comments are outrageous. </p>

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman&#146;s are, too. How on earth can he justify voting against the Bill tonight, if he says that he favours providing the support to help the economies of eastern Europe? How on earth can he troop through the Lobby to oppose the Bill when all the wealthier nations of Europe have agreed to make contributions to aid the economic development of eastern Europe? As I said to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), Cornwall has benefited from structural funding, as has Merseyside. We have seen their economies improve. Ireland and Spain have benefited from the funding, and their economies have also improved. All our business benefits from those enhanced and improving economies, yet the hon.

 The Minister&#146;s case seems to be that public expenditure in eastern Europe is bound to be a good thing. Would he, however, put his own money into a company whose accounts had been rejected by the auditors for 13 years? If not, why does he want to increase the sum of public money to be committed over seven years, when the European Union has failed its audit test for the past 13 years?</p>

The long-term benefit of those arrangements will come to our economy, because they will increase our trade with those countries and build more prosperity in them. As my hon.

 Perhaps we can get back to focusing on the Bill. Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that its purpose is to incorporate the own resources decision into the definition of the European treaties? It is not going to make any difference to the spending budget. It is about how the cost of meeting the budget is divided up between the member states.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is being extremely nit-picking. I invite him to read the own resources decision, and to look at the table in it that spells out how the rebate will be retained on all agricultural spending, and on all spending in the EU 15. As I have described&#151;it would be good if the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) read the decision before making his claims&#151;it spells out how the rebate will be disapplied in respect of economic and structural spending in the new member states. That is how it affects the overall budget. Yes, there is an annual EU budget process, but it is informed by the own-resources decision, which the hon. Gentleman has clearly not bothered to read.</p>

Assuming that these are the same Tories who so recently raised xenophobic mayhem about the number of eastern European migrant workers in the UK, can the Minister explain what he believes is more likely to be the effect of the sort of economic development in eastern Europe that the measure is underwriting on the very ways of these migrant workers who were so recently subject to such disgraceful scaremongering by Conservative Members?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point to that complete contradiction. As we have seen with previous EU enlargements, there may have been an immediate increase in the number of people using their ability to move around Europe, but in the long term people are more likely to return to their country of origin, particularly if that country is experiencing economic development and prosperity. This is a long game&#151;not a short-term gimmick to be played in the House this afternoon&#151;that will bring benefits over a generation rather than over a few months. My hon.

 My right hon. Friend is struggling manfully to cloak his dodgy deal in respectability by constantly focusing on help for eastern Europe. If we were asked for a simple straight fiscal transfer to help eastern European countries, that would be one thing, but the reality is that Chirac attacked our rebate simply because we were threatening the common agricultural policy once again. If we got rid of the CAP, we could all give generously to eastern Europe.</p>

 My hon. Friend may be in search of perfection, but we work within the existing structures to improve and make steps forward where we can.

I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way, which is helpful in allowing us a degree of dialogue. I want to make it clear that I do not believe that he is one of the bad boys, but I do think he is a bit of a rascal in seeking to polarise the debate by suggesting that anyone who has any reservations about any negotiated settlement is necessarily in favour of withdrawing altogether or of giving nothing to eastern Europe. That is most certainly not the position of Labour Members who have reservations. Surely the Minister would accept that we have made virtually no progress in reforming the CAP during this settlement and that although the submission of additional money for eastern Europe is welcome, it does not necessarily go to the right people there.

 Thanks very much! I know that my hon. Friend is feeling bad because Scotland lost at the weekend, but that is no reason for him to take his nastiness and resentment out on me. This financial perspective does include reform of the CAP. I do not have the precise figures to hand, but it drops reasonably significantly as an overall percentage of the budget and member states are being asked voluntarily to shift spending away from simple direct support into helping improve the sustainability of local rural economies. So, yes, there is reform. If my hon. Friend is asking me whether that is enough, I would have to say no. We want more reform of the common agricultural policy. That is the very clear position of the British Government and we believe that we have secured the means&#151;through the review of the process&#151;to achieve it. It is not perfection. I am not arguing that the EU budget and the recently agreed own-resources decision represent perfection. We have made progress and continue to do so, because that benefits us all.</p>

 Many people may be right to argue for CAP reform, which we would all like to see for moral reasons&#151;not least to do with our trade with Africa and South America. However, does the Chief Secretary accept that we have to recognise that if we did not have the CAP that would probably mean that the French would give money to French farms and the Polish to Polish farms and that the amount of subsidy would increase rather than decrease? That was why Tory Governments always argued that there should be a strong CAP.</p>

 Of course, the overall budget is increasing in size. The figures to which I referred a moment ago in answer to my hon.

I was trying to illustrate that the overall percentage of spend from the EU budget on agriculture will decrease in this financial perspective. I do not doubt the figures that the hon.

The Chief Secretary is being very generous and is encouraging a proper exchange of views. He is being slightly disingenuous in the sense that he is forgetting the fact that the Government&#146;s original position was that we would not sacrifice any part of our rebate unless there was reform. He has said that there may be reform, but how can there be reform when the French have publicly stated that they will veto any cuts to any future CAP spending?</p>

 The rebate exists because of distortions in the way that money is spent around the EU. The rebate will remain as long as that is the case. That is the clear position of the Government. I said to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) that I did not doubt the figures that he gave, but our figures say that the CAP budget will decrease from &#163;55 billion in 2007 to &#163;51 billion in 2013.

 The hon. Lady makes an important point. The agreement invited member states voluntarily to move spending from pillar one to pillar two. If my memory is correct, the UK has decided to switch about 14 per cent. of overall agricultural spending. That is indicative of our desire to see reform in the way in which support to rural communities is spent. We hope that other countries will do the same. In the long term, it is our aim for all agricultural spending to be migrated in that way.</p>

The Chief Secretary said earlier that giving more money to countries in eastern European would benefit British business. Local businesses in West Yorkshire want more money for local infrastructure to help transport. The Government cannot afford to give it. According to them, it is all about spending priorities. Is the right hon. Gentleman genuinely trying to argue that businesses in West Yorkshire will benefit more from building up the infrastructure in eastern Europe than from doing that in West Yorkshire?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman betrays alarming ignorance of those matters. Businesses in West Yorkshire have benefited over the years from European structural and cohesion funding. I am now looking at details of programmes throughout Yorkshire that support the growth and competitiveness of the region. Why does not he recognise and celebrate that rather than trying at every opportunity to whip up anti-European feeling?</p>

That confirms Britain as a middle-ranking net contributor among the wealthier nations. It also fulfils our long-standing commitment to budget discipline. In 1994, a budget of 1.2 per cent. of EU gross national income was agreed. In the current financial perspective, the budget will be less than 1 per cent. of EU GNI, which is nearly 20 per cent. lower. That represents a saving of &#8364;160 billion compared with the Commission&#146;s original proposal. For the first time, CAP spending will not be the largest item of expenditure in the EU budget. Instead, it will be sustainable growth. The budget is disciplined, with a fair contribution from Britain, which preserves our abatement. The Bill will secure our national interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="71119-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0711196000346">However, there is a bigger picture to consider. It is emphatically in Britain&#146;s long-term interest to provide for the fair financing and enlargement of the European Union. We thus bring British business immediate market opportunities and secure Europe&#146;s long-term competitiveness. Achieving a fair deal was the challenge that faced the UK presidency in 2005, but we met it. It means that new member states will experience a 250 per cent. increase in structural funding on the previous financing period.</p>

It is right that we should stand by them and that they should not be denied the economic investment that has benefited Britain and other parts of western Europe so much. As I said earlier, it is also firmly in our interest. Allowing our partners in central and eastern Europe to grow and develop strengthens them and strengthens Europe, making us all more secure. A more developed Europe will be better able to meet the common challenges that we face, such as climate change and security. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I can hear Conservative Members chuntering.

Enlargement is strengthening and widening that single market: it is now half a billion consumers strong, and the largest market in the world. That helps our partners to grow, and helps make Europe more prosperous. It is not to our cost, but to our benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0711196000364">Let us look at the facts of earlier enlargements. After the 1986 enlargement, United Kingdom exports to Spain increased by a quarter. After 1995, exports to Sweden rose by a similar amount. The benefits that EU membership can have are demonstrated by the fact that since our closest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, joined the EU it has received almost &#8364;53.5 billion from the EU budget. Between 1993 and 2003, the EU supported more than 120 major infrastructure projects. That has helped Ireland&#146;s exports rise from &#8364;1.1 billion in 1973 to &#8364;88.4 billion by 2005. In 2003, gross national product per capita was more than three times its 1973 level in real terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0711196000365">Ireland also demonstrates that the economic development of our partners is good for Britain, a point entirely lost on Conservative Members. It increases trade, and creates new opportunities and new jobs. Between 1998 and 2006 alone, UK exports to Ireland have doubled. Such development has particularly benefited Merseyside, which is one of this country&#146;s poorest regions and receives objective 1 funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0711196000366">The Conservative party&#146;s claim that the Bill secures us nothing in return is self-centred and narrow-minded, but also wrong. As I have said, the Bill will disapply structural and cohesion funding, and in time that spending will benefit Britain. Just as development funding in Ireland helped Britain to increase trade from a buoyant Irish economy, we will gain the long-term benefits of a prosperous eastern Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0711196000367">Already British firms are making the most of the opportunities that the recent accessions have brought. In 2006, UK exports to the A8 countries amounted to &#163;8.8 billion, a 36 per cent. increase in the first full year after accession. Tesco, Unilever, Vodafone, BP and International Power are already investing in our new single-market partners, and UK foreign direct investment in the A8, which averaged just over &#163;860 million in the three years before accession, was more than twice that amount&#151;nearly &#163;2 billion&#151;in 2005, the year after accession. Enlargement is good for those economies, and provides economic opportunities for our largest companies.</p>

I think that my right hon. Friend is being a little unfair to the Conservative party. After all, widening rather than deepening was John Major&#146;s policy, and he was absolutely right in that regard.</p>

What they do not understand are negotiations. I spent a great deal of my professional life negotiating in business, in the private sector, and I know that if one obtains all that one wants in negotiations with a partner with whom one frequently negotiates, that partner will get back at one next time. The Conservatives do not understand that there is wave upon wave of negotiations in an entity such as the European Union, and that if one pushes too hard for something on one occasion, one will not obtain it on the next. They do not understand the need to play it for the long term.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and what we have witnessed this afternoon provides ample illustration of the very point he makes. Conservative Members will make knee-jerk statements to please the newspapers and party members in their constituencies. They will come out with such rhetoric because they know it will be good for their personal standing within their local Conservative party when they next return to their constituency for a meeting&#151;they will probably pass around the relevant volume of <i> Hansard</i>.

<notus-date day="19" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>19 Nov 2007 : Column 993</b><br>
Europe who have come to Britain taking advantage of the free movement of labour are likely to make a stronger net contribution to public finances. The Bank of England reported last year that overseas workers have played a significant role in boosting the pool of available labour and helping to ease labour shortages. Britain is experiencing direct and immediate benefits in increased trade, extra jobs and the benefits of migration from enlargement&#151;a process that the December 2005 agreement consolidates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para9"><a name="0711196000379">Britain has also benefited, and will continue to do so, from structural and cohesion funding. Between 2000 and 2006, the UK received about &#8364;15 billion of those funds, going to projects that benefit constituencies in all parts of the country. That has contributed to the economic development of some of our poorest regions. Merseyside alone has received more than &#163;300 million of European social fund investment, and Cornwall has also received a significant sum&#151;the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne mentioned that. UK regions that still need funding will continue to receive it&#151;to answer a point made by the hon. Member for Stone, who has now left his place&#151;but as areas such as Merseyside grow stronger it is right that the focus switches to the poorest EU regions, particularly the new member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0711196000380">Before I conclude, may I turn to the budget review and the future of Europe? The figures I have been quoting this afternoon support the case that we need to be even more hard-headed in prioritising funding towards the future challenges that Europe faces collectively, if it is to secure value for money. As well as the benefits I have already outlined, we have secured a frank and honest process of challenge and review of the EU budget to ensure that Europe is helping to equip itself to face the challenges of the future. As the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary set out in the recent &#147;Global Europe&#148; pamphlet, the EU has spent too long focused on institutional questions. Europe needs to move on from that debate and focus on the issues that matter to its citizens: competitiveness; jobs; migration; the environment; and security. It needs to meet the challenges of globalisation and play its full part in the wider world, and to do that, its budget needs reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="71119-0009.htm_para11"><a name="0711196000381">Some change has been made, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), but he is correct in saying that too much expenditure&#151;40 per cent.&#151;still goes on the common agricultural policy, and more than 50 per cent. of economic investment spending continues to go to the richer member states. Without reform, the EU cannot meet its future challenges and we will not see the global Europe that we need. So it is clearly in Britain&#146;s interest&#151;and in Europe&#146;s&#151;that the budget is reformed. The fact that the agreement that this Bill implements provides for a review of the budget, including the CAP, is the third reason why the Bill will implement a good agreement for Britain.</p>

In addition to the measures that we have championed over recent years, such as the establishment of the European Anti-Fraud Office, former Commissioner Kinnock&#146;s work on Commission reform, the shift to activity-based budgeting and accruals accounting, and the Commission&#146;s 2006 action plan following the UK presidency&#146;s work, we will go further.

 I am grateful for that round of applause from Conservative Members. Surely the important point about the auditors&#146; figures is that nearly all the problem areas involve member states&#146; expenditure rather than the Commission&#146;s. We and the Commission have been trying to argue for some time, although Conservative Members have been opposed, for the Commission to have increased powers to investigate how that money is spent in member states. Is it not incumbent on those who argue against qualified majority voting sometimes to explain what the problems are?</p>

 My hon. Friend has tempted me on to matters that this House will debate in a few weeks&#146; or a few months&#146; time. He is correct in the substance of what he says. That contradiction is so often at the heart of what the Opposition call for. We have been leading the case for the reform of financial transparency and accountability in Europe, and we will continue to do so. We plan to present our consolidated statement in the spring of next year and, as I have said, it will be audited by the NAO. The European Court of Auditors pointed to such examples as being the way to improve standards of financial transparency across the European Union.

Thirdly, it paves the way for a critical look at how we reshape the EU budget to prepare for the big challenge of the future that we face in common with our European partners. The EU has made Europe and Britain more secure and more prosperous. On this side of the House, we are pro-European, but we are not uncritical and we are hard-headed.

I should, of course, have known better. Within two weeks, we had a West-style 180<sup>(o)</sup> clarification of those words, when he said that the rebate was</p>

Radical reform of the CAP in exchange for a corresponding reduction in the British rebate would provide a satisfactory outcome for the UK taxpayer and at the same time move the EU from the disastrous agricultural protectionism that damages consumers and developing economies alike, and which the Prime Minister described as a prerequisite for making poverty history.</p>

that as a result of the Bill the amount disbursed under the EU budget will change, although if we chose not to support the Bill the composition of the contributions would change. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that under this proposal the UK will contribute an additional &#163;19 billion net over the next seven years. If the rebate had not been given away we would still contribute an extra &#163;12 billion over that period.

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="71119-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07111925000019">I shall continue with my narrative, if I may. The Prime Minister went off with his team to Brussels with clear objectives: first, to cap the budget at 1 per cent. of European Union gross national income; secondly, to shift the focus of EU spending from agriculture, with the ultimate objective of scrapping the common agricultural policy; and, thirdly, to keep the British rebate unless and until that reform was complete. So how did they do? They failed on every single one. The budget that this lot signed up to added more than &#163;25 billion of extra spending. The Prime Minister claimed after the event that that reflected the cost of enlargement, but without reform, Ireland, whose per capita GDP is 30 per cent. higher than the EU average, is getting more per head than Lithuania, Slovakia or Poland. France will remain the EU&#146;s biggest recipient and the UK the lowest net recipient per capita.</p>

What they did achieve was a review, which, surreally, will be conducted during the French presidency of the Union, so I advise my right hon. and hon. Friends not to hold their breath.

 I hesitate to be cruel to the hon. Gentleman, but I say to him what the Chief Secretary said to me earlier: read the papers before you come into the Chamber. The agreement has nothing to do with agricultural spend. It has to do with the own-resources decision&#151;the contribution made by individual members. That is what the Bill will implement.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman criticises me for not doing my homework, but that is far from the case. Does he accept that the two matters are obviously linked? It is extremely important that we consider both sides of the bargain. He is continuing to evade the point. He does not want to recognise an enormously important achievement&#151;that the weighting of agriculture in total EU spending has been reduced as part of the package. Why does he not recognise the facts when they happen to be in favour of the Government rather than of his own party?</p>

Failure to reach agreement on a budget for the period after 2013 would have a devastating effect on the UK contribution, because the rebate reduction would become uncapped. We would have no effective veto, and thus no negotiating power, during negotiations on the EU budget for the period from 2013&#151;and our partners in Europe would know it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="71119-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07111925000045">There is one further twist to the tale. The Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, put it about that he was against the deal. When it was announced, the Treasury pointedly refused to endorse it and denied all responsibility, because it was worried that the deal would force future spending cuts. According to the Treasury briefing, the current Prime Minister was &#147;quietly fuming&#148;. What did he do? This April, it became known that having failed to claw back some of the rebate through negotiation, he too had caved in and agreed to accept the original deal&#151;the deal that he had previously condemned. So much for his powers of persuasion on the international stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="71119-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07111925000046">That is the sorry tale behind the Bill, although, of course, that could never be discerned from reading it. We, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, whose responsibility is to our electorate and our UK taxpayers, are invited to give the Bill a Second Reading, thus giving effect to what was done&#151;in our name, but in complete contradiction of everything promised to us in this House&#151;at Brussels in December 2005. If we do so, by 2010 the UK taxpayer will be footing the bill for an extra &#163;1.9 billion a year&#151;a sum roughly equivalent, fittingly enough, to the total Foreign Office budget&#151;as a result of the sell-out on the rebate. That is in addition to the increase in the UK contribution to the underlying budget&#151;&#163;1.5 billion a year on average for the period 2007 to 2013&#151;to deal with the cost of enlargement.

 May I tempt my hon. Friend to speculate about why we caved in on the rebate?

The existing own-resources decision will continue in force, indefinitely if necessary. The total expenditure budget will not be affected.

The Chief Secretary is trying to have his cake and eat it. He wants to give away our rebate on top of that increase, which we will pay anyway as the EU budget increases.</p>

 It is right that our contribution will increase to pay for EU enlargement in eastern Europe.

If he agrees that it is right that our contribution should increase, the net contribution should be calculated by reference to the rebate itself.</p>

 I know that the Treasury operates only a static model. The Chief Secretary would be right if everything else were static, but the budget is increasing.

Last week, the European Court of Auditors refused to sign off the EU accounts for the 13th year in a row. The accounts are riddled with material errors and irregularities&#151;for example, the irregularity that receipts are still not collected for MEPs&#146; expenses, and the material error by which money earmarked for agriculture is spent on golf clubs. That is to say nothing of the &#163;3.8 billion a year that the EU spends on propaganda&#151;public relations staff, pamphlets, teaching aids, school trips and cartoons. There is the originally named &#147;Captain Euro&#148;, whose mission is apparently to uphold the EU&#146;s values&#151;perhaps he could find time to fight fraud and waste as a sideline.</p>

That money would pay for 45,000 nurses, 37,000 teachers, 42,000 prison places or, if the Chief Secretary prefers this currency, 1.2 million hip replacements. It would also pay for much-needed equipment for our front-line troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="71119-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07111925000062">We are used to this Government&#146;s casual attitude to public money: &#163;5.7 billion was wasted on tax credit overpayments; &#163;3 billion was spent on nine NHS reorganisations in nine years; and &#163;141 million was wasted on an abandoned Department for Work and Pensions IT programme. We are used to tough rhetoric on Europe followed by craven surrender, and we are used to broken promises: there were broken promises on the referendum; a promise has now been broken on the rebate; and no doubt promises will be broken on the red lines. The Bill is so objectionable, because it embodies all those failures of government in one measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="71119-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07111925000063">We were promised that the rebate would be non-negotiable, yet it was surrendered without a fight. The Government talked tough about how they would force the scrapping or at least the radical reform of the CAP, but the CAP will remain untouched. At a time when our public services are feeling the squeeze, when our troops in the front line are short of equipment and when our schools are falling down the world league table, this Government propose casually to chuck away &#163;7.4 billion of our money. By giving away our rebate, which has been worth &#163;54 billion since it was negotiated in 1984, without securing anything in return, this Government have manifestly failed in their paramount duty to protect Britain&#146;s interests.</p>

By rejecting this Bill tonight, Parliament has the opportunity to rectify the damage caused by the incompetence and duplicity of this Labour Government, to stand up for the interests of Britain and British taxpayers against a Executive who have broken their promises and betrayed the people&#146;s trust, and to send a clear message that Britain&#146;s hard-won rebate is not for giving away. I urge hon. Members to seize the chance this evening to send the Government back to the negotiating table in 2008, in parallel with the promised budget review, and to enter into a good-faith discussion about the rebate, the budget and the future of the CAP on the clear basis that all three are linked and that there will be no change to the British rebate formula unless there is long-term, sustainable reform of the CAP. This is our last chance. If the Bill is passed, Britain&#146;s rebate, and with it the principal lever to secure sustainable reform of the CAP, will be gone. I urge hon. Members to deny the Bill a Second Reading and to keep the cause of EU reform alive.</p>

In effect, she agreed to a significant increase in the overall budget&#151;to 1.4 per cent. of European GDP, an increase of about 40 per cent. The EU budget is now lower as a share of European GDP. Again, I salute Margaret Thatcher; there are things in Europe that can be done better collectively than through the mechanisms of 27 national states.

In the past century or so, British history has not been generous vis- -vis Poland. Tory appeasement betrayed Poland to the Russians and the Nazis in 1939, and at Yalta Churchill allowed the division of Europe, and allowed the communists to take control of Poland.

I could talk about France and the common agricultural policy, but it was not cutting much mustard; such countries were signing cheques to HMT as part of the rebate.</p>

After the stunning success of Labour Governments who, after the disastrous economic policies of the preceding Government, have seen national wealth more than double in the past 10 years, how could we, one of the richest nations&#151;not only in Europe, but in the world&#151;say to eastern European Governments, &#147;Your poor people have to pay money to our rich nation&#148;?</p>

 I agree that Britain has helped Poland and other eastern European countries tremendously. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Margaret Thatcher. In 1990 she was instrumental, in the Paris club of lending nations, in getting rid of Poland&#146;s debts. However, the way to help countries such as Poland in future is through increased trade and helping British companies trade liberally with Poland, not constantly giving it handouts, as the Bill purports to do.</p>

I accept that once the Poles had won their freedom, Mrs. Thatcher came round to accepting that that was a good thing.

I have no problem with that, because we have had a good deal from the rebate in the past 24 years. Despite what the shadow Chief Secretary said, we are not, in per-capita terms, the largest or second largest contributor to the EU budget. Page 32 of the very good Library report shows that we paid 68 euros per head last year. The Netherlands pays four times as much, at 241 euros per head; Denmark pays twice as much at 127 euros per head; Sweden pays 124 euros per head, while Germany pays 100 euros per head. France and Austria pay 50 and 40 euros per head respectively. Those countries, too, are pretty fed up with the assumption that Britain does not have to pay its fair share.</p>

 The Francophobia that always infects these debates is jolly good fun, but there are 25 other member states apart from France and the United Kingdom, in the European Union, and the figures vary. I fully accept that there are grotesque anomalies such as Luxembourg. I am getting into some gruesome detail which I would not want to inflict on the House, but the plain fact is that the Netherlands&#151;our trusty old Protestant ally for 300 years&#151;pays four times, pro rata, what we pay. Why on earth should the Dutch always have to pay part of the British bill? That is how they will see it&#151;ditto the Swedes and the Germans. The Germans have spent 4 per cent. of their gross domestic product, year on year, on East Germany following unification. That is twice to two and a half times what the United States put into western Europe under the Marshall plan. The Germans, with a much bigger problem to solve than we have ever had to face&#151;the incorporation of a bankrupt third-world country, the German Democratic Republic, into the western German Federal Republic&#151;have made huge personal sacrifices as a nation, yet still pay proportionately far more, 35 per cent. more, on last year&#146;s figures, than we do. The figures against us are much worse, in terms of Germany, the Netherlands and some of the Nordic countries, during the recent past.</p>

At its peak, it went as high as 5 per cent. of GDP, which in British terms would be &#163;60 billion. A net inward transfer of funds from the EU totalling &#163;60 billion might make us rather more enthusiastic.</p>

 I am terribly sorry, but page 34 of the Library report shows that in 2006 Ireland received &#8364;475 million of structural fund expenditure, while Britain received &#8364;3,021 million. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My hon. Friend is right in per head terms; I cannot disagree with that. However, I am making a different point: if we want Ireland, France, Germany and other countries to change, we must engage with them.

 My hon. Friend is talking through his hat. Ireland was so poor when it joined in 1973 that the amount of net transfers from the UK economy would have been absolutely enormous. The idea that each country goes round with a begging hat saying, &#147;I&#146;m poor, please give me some money&#148;, simply will not work. I respect my hon. Friend&#151;although he does not like the EU and the way it works, he has always taken a consistent, cheerful and friendly position on it&#151;but we have to work with what we have, and if we want to change it, we have to engage, network and discuss. That is what the Conservatives completely and resolutely refuse to do.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has been talking about Ireland. I must tell him&#151;we get on quite well with one another, so I hope that he will take this on board&#151;that the Irish Government have just spent &#163;300 million of taxpayers&#146; money on propping up the Irish dairy industry. I am chairman of the all-party group on dairy farmers. How can our dairy farmers in the west of England and Wales compete when the Irish are so flagrantly contravening the spirit of the common agricultural policy?</p>

 I wonder whether that is a wise intervention on the afternoon when we have learned how much money we are giving to Northern Rock. If the Irish subsidy, subvention or support is against EU state aid provisions, let it be taken to the European Court of Justice. To be fair, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear that any aid that the British Government choose to give to protect the 1.5 million borrowers and savers in Northern Rock must be within EU rules.</p>

In fact, last year&#146;s structural fund expenditure figures show that the UK gets a third more than France, 20 per cent. more than Belgium and nearly twice as much as the Netherlands. We get more than Slovenia, one of the accession member states, and&#151;the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham might want to listen to this point&#151;only &#8364;1 per head less than Poland. The world&#146;s fourth largest economy gets from the EU only &#8364;1 per head less in structural funds than Poland, which, despite its enormous economic progress, is still a not very rich EU country.</p>

What we are debating was, in effect, set in stone in 2002 with the agreement between the then French President, Jacques Chirac, and the then German Chancellor, Gerhard Schrder, to maintain CAP expenditure at a fixed amount, not as a percentage amount. That was in the context of the Iraq conflict and, frankly, a deep worsening of relations and divisions within the EU. If we want to achieve desired British goals of getting some reduction as regards the CAP, we will have to look at linking up, making networks, making the argument and going out to persuade people. These decisions are not taken in some closed caballing session in Brussels. They are taken by parliamentarians like ourselves in Paris, Dublin, Germany and Rome, and we need to talk and network far more with them ahead of decisions being taken.</p>

in Britain&#151;the hill farmers, the sheep farmers and those with a very small income&#151;and increase the support that goes to rural development. But what did I read yesterday in <i> The Observer</i>? It was suggested that the richest recipients of CAP aid, such as the Duke of Marlborough and all the Tory-supporting ex-aristocracy, are receiving hundreds of thousands of euros. The British Government, who like a duke when they see one, will try to defend outrageous payments to the richest cereal and agro-industrial companies in Europe, as well as to some very rich individuals in our country. We have to consider motes and beams before we lecture other countries on those issues.</p>

a lesser degree than Germany or the Netherlands, have made significant fiscal transfers that have allowed Ireland as a nation during the past 33 years to become richer and happier than it ever was when it was an independent state before it joined the EU, or when under English control? I do not think so. It must have been in our interests to do so. It is why Ireland today is a country of immigration, not emigration. Immigration brings its own problems, as we know, but it is far better to be a country that is so successful it needs to attract workers to do jobs that nationals are not prepared to do.</p>

Members will remember travelling to Spain, southern Italy or even bits of France not so long ago and being able to see rural and social poverty. It was quaint, and it was nice for the British ex-pats who could buy houses and drinks that did not cost very much, but now it is far better that Italians and Spaniards can, in contrast to their position in the 1950s and 1960s, stay in their own countries, and that those countries are rich enough to attract people to work in them. That is my ambition for Poland and the Baltic states.

We welcome the fact that the EU has brought a period of unparalleled peace and prosperity to Europe, and that there has been successful integration with new member states. However, that does not mean that there is no need for a proper public debate about the future of Britain&#146;s relationship with the European Union.</p>

Since 1997 Labour has given away powers, but has refused to make the positive case for Europe and engage in a proper debate about the direction of the EU. The Conservatives, who promoted closer integration without referendums while in government, now indulge in populism of the worst kind, calling for a referendum to mask their own divisions.

I was disappointed that the Conservatives chose to oppose such a proposal, or are they afraid that too many Conservatives Members would vote to withdraw from the EU altogether? Instead, the Conservatives will use the debate on the treaty as a proxy for that debate, despite the fact that it has much narrower terms. I am sure that those opposed to EU membership altogether will take the opportunity to air their views then, but much of the treaty is in fact about the practicalities of dealing with an enlarged EU, such as whether we need 27 commissioners.</p>

Although the Bill is short, it gives effect to the new own resources decision made by the European Council on 7 June 2007. The Bill sets out the new financial framework for the EU for 2007 to 2013, the basis of which was agreed under the UK presidency in Brussels, in December  <br>

2005. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches believe that the EU is good for the UK. We support measures to enable smooth running of the expansion of EU membership, and we believe that it would be wrong to defend an arrangement under which we were recipients of funding from eastern Europe. Those measures were part of the negotiations for a new financial framework&#151;a part that we wholeheartedly supported, because we wish to support the poorer parts of the European Union, which means those in the UK as well as in the new accession states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07111925000148">The key point is that the negotiating objective was to trade the rebate against fundamental change. The question we must ask is: could the Government have done more in trying to achieve that fundamental negotiating objective? The Minister has not conceded today that the end result was a bad deal for the UK. It was a bad deal because the former Prime Minister totally failed us in the negotiating process during his six-month presidency of the EU. He seemed to think that any deal was better than none at all. The result is a bad deal, caused by the Government failing to identify, let alone secure, their objectives. That result is more the legacy of the former Prime Minister than the vision of the current one, which is probably why he chose not to raise it in the Queen&#146;s Speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07111925000149">The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, liked talking about grand ambition and using radical rhetoric about reforming the EU, but when he had his golden opportunity he failed to deliver. He totally mishandled the negotiating process before it had even started. He spent most of 2005 saying that the rebate was non-negotiable. Clearly, however, it was negotiable, and was actually being negotiated at the time he was saying that it was not. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) spoke earlier about negotiating skills; perhaps he should have shared some of his expertise with the then Prime Minister, who completely failed in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07111925000150">Such a position resulted not only in the Government looking foolish. It also meant that they could not open up terms of compromise from anyone else. Perhaps it would have been better to say, &#147;Okay, we&#146;ll put our rebate on the table if you&#146;re prepared to talk about the serious reform of the common agricultural policy.&#148; But they did not, so they had absolutely no hope of delivering reform of that kind. The best that they could do was to cave in on the rebate, while giving the pathetic excuse that it related only to the expansion elements, and not to those linked to the CAP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07111925000151">This was the area of greatest opportunity, and of greatest failure. Too much was given up in return for too little reform. There was an opportunity for a long-term strategy to be put in place, but the former Prime Minister bottled it. Instead of a long-term sustainable solution to CAP reform being found, the issue was effectively kicked into touch, with a full review of EU spending and resources by the Commission scheduled to report in 2008-09. In other words, it will become someone else&#146;s problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07111925000152">Today&#146;s debate has highlighted the fact that the urgent need for CAP reform has still not been addressed.

bureaucratic than its predecessor systems, and it is no longer awarded on the basis of production. However, there is still a need to go further, to increase trading opportunities for developing countries while safeguarding the changing rural economy. The Government should have been more ambitious in what they believed they could achieve.</p>

This gave an indication of where it believed the EU needed to be in 10 to15 years&#146; time. Operating on that time scale, the Brussels Council should have been crucial to taking the first steps, yet that opportunity was missed. The Treasury document highlighted many of the issues that need to be tackled and, yes, tariffs remain one of the key obstacles to further and more fundamental reform. The Government&#146;s position in 2002, in failing to secure a renegotiation of the CAP, not only undermined their position at the summit in Brussels in 2005, but also impacted on the subsequent World Trade Organisation negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07111925000154">Instead of kicking the issue into the long grass with the review, the Government should have looked much more closely at potential co-financing arrangements and at splitting the responsibility 50-50 between the EU and the national Governments. This would have had a much greater impact on the rebate than the measure that we are debating here today and the sums of money that we are talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07111925000155">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury talked about the way in which resources had been allocated across from pillar one to pillar two of the common agricultural policy. Those are the kinds of issues that really should have been pushed at the Brussels Council. Such an approach at Brussels would have helped to bring decision-making powers&#151;and with them, decisions over resources&#151;back from Brussels to a more local level within the UK. That would have put money back into rural communities, using public money for the delivery of public goods. It would have encouraged food to be produced and sold locally to high animal welfare and environmental standards, which would have cut food miles and ensured sustainability. Fundamentally, it would have made a real difference, but the opportunity to get those changes moving was wasted.</p>

We support them in their intent, but that will mean national Governments, as well as the EU, taking on responsibilities. Perhaps it will mean taking more responsibility down to national level, as some of the problems are caused by centralising too much of the detail at EU level. This issue was highlighted in the past week or so, when we learned that the EU auditors had refused to sign off the EU&#146;s financial accounts for the 13th year in a row. One of the issues identified by the report was poor knowledge of complex rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07111925000162">The applications for structural funding in my constituency involved an incredibly complicated process, but the layers of complication often came not from Europe but from the regional body administering the structural funds. One of the most frustrating things was the fact that the goalposts were moved during the application process. The example that always springs to mind relates to industrial buildings and work spaces, for which funds were available. Because there were a lot of applications going in, however, the Government office for the south-west decided to raise the environmental standards required. That was great, but unfortunately there was no one available to assess those standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07111925000163">We can see from that example how these complications can arise. The fact that the Department for Work and Pensions has failed to have its accounts signed off for the past 13 or 14&#151;or is it 17?&#151;years shows us that it is not just the European Union that has difficulty in dealing with these issues. The Government must sort themselves out as well as demanding improvement in Europe. Clearly, there are lessons to be learned at national and Europe-wide level. If we can do that, we shall achieve greater clarity and help to inspire confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07111925000164">The Government should concede where they failed in this set of negotiations. They should admit that it would have been better to have had no agreement under Blair&#146;s presidency, rather than an agreement that was nothing but a bad deal for the UK. If, like us, they want the European project to succeed, aspects of the Union must be fundamentally reformed. They should accept that the greatest failure in this whole process was not on the part of the EU, but on the part of our then Prime Minister in giving up part of the rebate without securing fundamental CAP reform. Achieving that reform would have been a legacy to be proud of, but it is one that this Government have failed to achieve.</p>

 I am pleased to be able to speak in a European debate, and in particular to speak on the Bill that will give effect to the deal signed up to by our previous Prime Minister last December. That deal will cost Britain billions in future years and, as has already been pointed out, will bring very little to Britain in return, at least in material terms. The deal was described by <i> The Economist</i> as a very poor one for Britain. <i> The Economist</i> is hardly the kind of Eurosceptic, leftist magazine that I would support, but it said that no deal would have been better than that deal. I certainly agree with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07111925000166">The previous Prime Minister negotiated&#151;if that is a fair description&#151;the deal at the last minute, at the end of Britain&#146;s presidency of the EU. It was also done in a rather spontaneous and arbitrary manner that apparently shocked and astonished other politicians, who felt that they would at least have had to refer back to their Cabinets and Governments before making such a dramatic decision. The fact that our then Chancellor of the Exchequer was not with the previous Prime Minister at the time might have made it rather easier for him to do that deal. Perhaps he knew that he was soon to leave office, and that it would be left to his successor to pick up the tab. That is precisely what has happened, and one suspects that, behind the scenes, our new Prime Minister is, unsurprisingly, not happy about the deal.</p>

 At the time, it was greatly publicised on television that the then Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, was in constant telephone contact with the current Prime Minister and that he ran everything by him. My understanding is that the current Prime Minister was very much aware of what we were signing ourselves up to at the time.</p>

<p><a name="st_o361"><a name="07111925000168"><a name="71119-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="07111925000286"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 I sincerely hope that they were speaking on the telephone, but it may be that they did not have the degree of harmony that one would hope for in taking such a big decision. Perhaps some of this friction between the former and the present Prime Minister that has been talked about in recent days was in evidence. I have never believed those stories myself, but perhaps there is some substance to them after all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07111925000169">The Government and my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary have constantly emphasised the importance of giving assistance to the newer member states, which are distinctly poorer than ourselves. That is a noble and respectable objective. However, the debate was really about the common agricultural policy and its genesis was the suggestion by us that the CAP should be reformed and the budget for it reduced. President Chirac was already smarting from his defeat in the referendum on the constitution; he was extremely angry and looking for someone to lash out at. He saw Britain attacking his CAP and there was also the issue of our budget rebate, so it was President Chirac who forced the debate about our rebate on to the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07111925000170">At that point, we should have responded robustly and said &#147;no deal&#148;&#151;at least until the cost of the CAP was substantially reduced. In my view, of course, we should entirely abolish it. I have said many times here and in Committee that the CAP should simply be abolished and agricultural support returned to member  <br>

states. Member states are best able to judge what their own agricultural industries require and what subsidies, if any, are required. Under that system, they would also be democratically accountable. The subsidies would have to be accounted for in a direct way at elections, which is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07111925000171">Indeed, I would go further. Much has been made of structural cohesion funding, but here again it is an inefficient way of subsidising or trying to help the poorer regions. It would be much better for member states to decide what subsidies were appropriate for their regions and to pay for them out of their own budgets rather than have to go through the circuitous budgetary processes of the EU. Money is lost in inefficiencies&#151;no doubt in fraud and corruption as well&#151;and there is frictional wastage in distributing aid in that way. I am sure that I am not alone in being slightly annoyed when I spot notices around my constituency and elsewhere that are funded by the EU&#151;indicated by the yellow stars on the blue background. That is effectively our money being used, yet it is claimed that it is European money. If we were a poorer nation and we were receiving a net contribution, that would be fine, but we are actually net contributors and only some&#151;certainly not all&#151;of that money is redirected back to Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07111925000172">As a socialist, I am strongly in favour of redistribution from those who can afford it to those who are in need. If we did that in a sensible, fair and non-corrupt way, it would represent a sensible way forward&#151;but we do not do that through the structures of the EU. I have said before and I will keep on saying that a system of simple fiscal transfers from the richer to the poorer nations of Europe would be a much more efficient and much fairer way of doing things. The relevant member states could then decide how to allocate those extra funds to their own peoples, and be democratically accountable to them in doing so. We should repatriate agricultural policy and leave regional and structural funding to member states, not have it allocated through the EU.</p>

It is estimated by the OECD that that costs Britain &#163;15 billion a year, so the CAP is not just a matter of subsidies to the budget, but a real further cost in higher food prices as well. The CAP should be abolished, not reformed. Reform can mean many things to many people, but it usually means not very much to anyone. The reality is that reform has been gradual&#151;a bit here, a bit there&#151;and sometimes it is two steps backwards rather than two steps forwards.

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="71119-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07111925000178">A number of estimates of the cost of EU membership have been made. There is a Swiss view&#151;Switzerland is outside the EU&#151;set out in a Europe 2006 report. It states that full EU membership would cost the country 1 per cent. of the Swiss national income. Well, 1 per cent. of national income in one year may not seem very much, but if it is compounded over many years or decades, it becomes a very large sum of money indeed. It has been estimated elsewhere that the cost of the European budgetary and economic arrangements to Britain is about 0.5 per cent. of our gross domestic product. Again, that may not sound much in one year, but if we compute it over 40 or 50 years, it becomes a very substantial sum. Many of us have argued that how the EU is constituted at the moment does not actually benefit the peoples of Europe economically, so we would do better to have different economic arrangements&#151;not to break up the EU entirely, but to have different economic arrangements within it, with each member state deciding what is most appropriate for its own economy.</p>

 Indeed. The hon. Gentleman is right to mention that. There may not be a lot of fishing in Luton, North, but we eat fish. I have seen an estimate that if something is not done, all the fish will be fished out of the seas by about 2020, which would be a tragedy for the whole world, as we cannot replace fish stocks. We have to guard fish stocks and I believe that member states would be best at guarding their own fish stocks when they knew that their futures depended on them. When fishing is going on in other people&#146;s fishing waters, far less concern will be expressed than when it is a matter of protecting one&#146;s own waters. Giving each member state responsibility for its own fish stocks in its own fishing waters would be a sensible way of protecting fish stocks for everyone.</p>

He argued that we should not promote the development of Europe as a superstate, but that Europe should be an association of independent and democratic nations. I agree absolutely and I have made that point very strongly in the past. What we are seeing is a constant drift towards that superstate and at some point we have to start saying no. We could start to say no by abolishing the CAP and restoring some of the functions carried out by the EU to member states. We could then work together on a co-operative, fraternal and sororal association of states to everyone&#146;s benefit. That would not only benefit everyone&#146;s living standards in Europe, but would improve our relations with our neighbours as well.

 I realised, slightly to my surprise, that I had been missing EU debates over the past few months, so I could not resist the opportunity to participate in the first of what will probably be three opportunities to discuss EU-related business in the next few months. It has been a pleasure to listen to at least some of the contributions, perhaps most especially that of the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins). I frequently come to the same conclusions as he does: for instance, his conclusions on repatriating agriculture and regional policy are eminently sensible. I usually come to those conclusions for opposite reasons; none the less I strongly commend the courage that he showed by making it clear that he will vote with his conscience this evening, rather than being cowed into going along with the party line.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes his point well, as ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="71119-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07111932000004">We are debating a small, defined Bill that will implement an agreement that was made in December 2005. The House last had an opportunity to debate the deal on 8 May 2006. It does little credit to the way in which we deal with EU business in the House and in this country that the Bill simply gives legal force to an arrangement that has been in effect since 1 January. Now, 11 months later, the House has the chance to debate a Bill that will implement the deal that was made by the former Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, nearly two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="71119-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07111932000005">The Bill and the deal that it will implement are bad measures, but they are also bad because of what they say about the state of the EU and of Britain&#146;s ability to negotiate a better arrangement and a better deal within the EU. The Bill is bad not least because this is a time of tightening public finances, when the Treasury and the Government face more difficult decisions about funding and public services in this country. The situation could become considerably more difficult in the year ahead, and even worse in the year after that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="71119-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07111932000006">The Bill represents a change in our financing commitments to the EU that, according to the excellent Library note produced for the debate, will contribute to a net increase in the UK&#146;s contribution of &#163;2.3 billion every year. That is a cause of considerable concern. The Chief Secretary seemed to try to justify it on the grounds that although it might cost us more, that was okay because it would also cost France more. I am not sure that that explanation would cut much ice with my constituents or with his.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="71119-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07111932000007">The Chief Secretary went on to say that the rebate had not been cut, but rather that parts of it had been disapplied&#151;as far as I can see, that amounts to the   <br>

same thing. The rebate applies to fewer aspects of EU funding than it used to. Even though the absolute amount of the rebate may rise in line with our rising contribution&#151;that point was made earlier&#151;we will effectively see a cut in the scope of the rebate, which will contribute to an overall substantial increase in the net contribution from this country to an unreformed EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="71119-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07111932000013">The right hon. Member for Rotherham seemed to suggest that CAP reform would require endless negotiations. He talked about networks and even suggested that the Government should create a new fund to pay the Conservative party to lobby in Europe in favour of CAP reform. I do not support state funding of political parties, so I would find that rather difficult to justify, but I can see that his logic is such that after the woeful inability of the Labour Government to negotiate CAP reform, he is even prepared to accept the job being subcontracted to the Opposition instead.</p>

 The right hon. Member for Rotherham talked a great deal, but he missed out one key possibility that was available to Mr. Blair two years ago: to use the strongest card that we had, which was won by Lady Thatcher in 1984&#151;the British rebate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said in his opening speech, we always made it clear that we would support sensible measures to negotiate the reduction and CAP reform balanced against a reform of the British rebate. Instead, we got a hopelessly one-sided deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="71119-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07111932000016">So, what is the upside to the deal that was secured and the arrangements that we are considering? Mr. Blair certainly failed to secure the prize of his key objective of CAP reform. Not only did he give up billions of pounds of British taxpayers&#146; money but, more shamefully, he gave up a key bargaining point. He was wholly culpable for the fact that we conceded that crucial part of the British rebate while getting nothing in return. We should not readily forgive or forget that.</p>

It would have been easy to draw the conclusion from the tone and demeanour of his lengthy opening speech&#151;I accept he was generous in giving way&#151;that the Government were presenting a great triumph. One might expect Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition to be most dismayed by the sacrifice of such an important part of the British budget rebate and cross about the Government&#146;s failure in Brussels in 2005, but I was delighted that the hon.

Several newspapers reported that &#147;Mr. Brown was unhappy&#148; that the deal would cost the UK an extra &#163;1 billion a year and that he had not taken part in final negotiations. Attempts were clearly made to distance the then Chancellor from the deal that Mr. Blair had made.

intensive talks, Mr. Blair promised to surrender a further &#163;1.7 billion of the rebate first secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. My maths is not that good, but I believe that that is &#163;100 million given up for every hour of the negotiations.</p>

On the one side are our constituents&#146; interests, and our need to defend their hard-earned money and to stand up for the important case for reforming the CAP to reduce food prices in the UK and remedy the damage that it does in the developing world. On the other side is the Labour Government&#146;s need to maintain face.

Judging by his speech, it is no more likely that I shall agree with him in future, on the subject of our debate. However, he is an honest and able man. He is always courteous in debate and in private discussion. It is therefore a pleasure to follow him in the debate.

The Irish are extraordinarily enterprising people, and once released from the autarky pursued by their Governments in the initial generations after independence, some take-off was likely. Since the Whitaker report in the 1960s, they have invested in education in a big way. As Members on both sides of the debate have said, they have pursued sensible and attractive tax policies.

That is enormously important, as it means that the issue of agricultural spending is being resolved over time. As anyone who can do elementary logic will know, the curve could be steeper or less steep, but we are going in a direction in which the common agricultural policy problem will inexorably be resolved. The hon. Gentleman did not want to recognise that.</p>

Gentleman was that, under the settlement, France and Italy will increase their contributions at twice the rate of those of this country. That is also unprecedented, and an extraordinary achievement. Signor Prodi and Monsieur Sarkozy will have a much more difficult time defending this settlement in their national assemblies than the Government will have here. I have some sympathy for them, and I am glad that we have reached this sensible compromise, for all the reasons that I have mentioned. The hon. Gentleman did not even recognise those facts.

It is perfectly true that the Court of Auditors has regularly put reserves on the accounts that it has signed. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I will give way again to the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="71119-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07111935000021">A regular feature of Eurosceptic rhetoric both from Conservative Members and from the press has been to say that the European Union is a sink of corruption, that the Court of Auditors has never approved the accounts, and to ask how we can go on being part of such an organisation. Of course it is true that every human organisation is exposed to fraud, corruption, mismanagement or waste; there is no such thing as perfection in these matters. If I look back to the Conservative Government, there were egregious cases of waste and, indeed, corruption in the national health service in Wales at one point. We have also had corruption in local government. One can never clear that up completely. This country has a very good record, and northern Europe as a whole has a very good record and good traditions in this matter, particularly Germany, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Therefore, by world standards, such cases are few and far between, but they exist in all institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="71119-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07111935000022">I suspect that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West knows this, but I do not know whether the other Conservative Eurosceptic Members do, or whether they are genuinely bemused by their own rhetoric or that of the Tory press. The fact of the matter, however, is that the Court of Auditors has not for many years put a reserve on the Commission&#146;s accounts. It has criticised not the Commission or the institutions of the Union, but the member states, which in many cases distribute the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="71119-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07111935000023">The logic behind the criticisms made of waste or corruption in the European Union is that we should have a federalist policy, and that member states should stop distributing structural funds and agricultural support of various kinds. The Commission should do it directly, and there is every chance, given its record, that it would do it very well. I have a little experience of the Commission, and it is a superb bureaucracy. There are few bureaucracies around the world that are so professional, good, clean, well motivated, efficient and so small in relation to the money that they are disbursing&#151;even if it has 20,000 people, that is a small number in comparison with bureaucracies around the world and the money that they disburse. Getting 300 directives through and creating the single market in a few years was a formidable achievement. I am not advocating a federalist policy, but that is the logic of what Conservative Members are saying&#151;they will not like it, but I ask them to examine honestly the logic of their criticism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71119-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07111935000024">The problem lies in the member states, not in the Commission. If the Conservative party thinks that a radical solution is required, it ought to be a federal solution, extending the competence of the Commission and reducing the role of the member states. That would be a logical solution, but is it the solution that the Conservative party is suggesting? No, because the Conservative party will not recognise reality. The Conservative party will not draw the logical conclusions from its own position. The Conservative party will simply go on talking contradictory nonsense&#151;for that it is what it is: it is contradictory and it is nonsense, and it is about time that it was exposed as such. But that is extremely difficult in this country, because the Eurosceptic press will never reproduce the points that I am making. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Of course it will not: we know that. So the public are genuinely bemused about the issue, which  <br>

I do not think they should be proud of having deceived the public. I think they should be ashamed of using such methods, and I hope that the more honest among them will now examine the facts. I hope that they will look at the report from the European Court of Auditors, which they will find in the Library. If they do, they will see that I am right. The reserves, I repeat, relate to the member states&#146; role in the disbursement of Union funds, not to the Commission and the other institutions of the Union itself. That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="71119-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07111935000028">It is clear to me that the Conservative party is engaged in pure political opportunism. The Conservatives do not wish to draw the logical conclusions of their own policies, and they do not wish the public to draw those conclusions. They want to be all things to all men. They want to go in for doublespeak. They want to go around the Conservative clubs and talk to the chauvinists there. We all know that such people exist in Conservative clubs throughout the country, and I have met a great many of them over the past 20 years. The Conservatives want to go around those clubs and say, &#147;Get these nasty foreigners out. We aren&#146;t going to let our country be taken over by France and Germany,&#148; and so on. They want to come out with all that rhetoric, which will be popular in their constituencies and with the Tory party, but they know that it will not play with those on the middle ground of politics, so they will say to those people, &#147;Oh no, we really believe in our membership of the European Union; we&#146;re totally signed up to it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="71119-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07111935000029">I can give two reasons&#151;indeed, I could give more&#151;why it is clear that the Conservatives are not genuinely signed up. One is their policy on the European People&#146;s party, which was a gratuitous unprovoked insult to those who had been their best friends for generations. <i> [Interruption.] </i>That is what it was, and how can they possibly expect it to be forgotten? We are talking about having a relationship with someone, signing an agreement agreeing to sit with someone&#151;in this case, in the European Parliament&#151;for five years, and then saying &#147;We&#146;re going to tear up this agreement because we don&#146;t like it. We&#146;re going to spit in your face.&#148; Do the Tories really think that if they ever came to power, that would be forgotten? Do they really think that a bank of good will would be waiting for them if, by some awful mischance, they ever found themselves in Downing street? They would be far less well placed to negotiate anything on behalf of this country; that is absolutely clear.</p>

gratuitous crisis in our relations with the European Union. People will say, &#147;The British Government signed up to this, and then backed out of it.&#148; The east Europeans will say, &#147;My goodness me! We thought that the British were our friends, we thought that they supported us in enlargement, and now the Tory party has got itself a majority in Parliament&#148;&#151;if that were ever to happen, which I trust it will not&#151;&#147;and turned the deal down.&#148; It would take a long, long time to restore our reputation for good faith after that.</p>

Either the Tory party has not realised the logic of its position, or it has, and it wants a crisis in our relations with the EU. That is why the Tories talk nonsense about pulling out of the common fisheries policy or the social chapter. It is really shorthand for creating a crisis and putting us in an impossible position&#151;a position in which we could not pursue the principles that they have set out, and will I suppose set out in their manifesto, and still maintain our full membership of the European Union.

It will mean that every time a new wave of relatively poor countries joins the European Union, we in the United Kingdom will somehow have to give up more of our taxpayers&#146; money to support those new member states. As I told the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), the Foreign Secretary has stated publicly that he wants to expand the European Union to include countries in north Africa and beyond. The hon. Gentleman disputes that. Only time will tell, but what is genuinely agreed on all sides is that Turkey will inevitably wish to join the European Union and become a full and active member.</p>

Many other poor countries either wish to join the EU or are in the process of actively submitting application forms. Ukraine, Georgia, Bosnia, Macedonia&#151;all those countries are very poor, and will require massive financial assistance. At a time when budgets are being tightened here in our own country, with an ageing population and a massive borrowing requirement, the Government want us to go on bailing those countries out.

 No, I do not wish Turkey to be a member of the European Union. As I said, we are currently &#163;700 billion in debt as a nation, and this year alone we borrowed &#163;34 billion.

I feel very angry and upset about his comments. Never, in two and a half years, have I sat in the Chamber and been so incensed and appalled as I am by rhetoric of that kind. The Chief Secretary claims that we are against Poles because we are not prepared to give them huge financial subsidies. I feel very insulted by him. This is the arrogance of power. This is what the Labour Government are all about: they cannot justify giving up the rebate, so they want to insult us by saying that we are against eastern Europeans.

However, we have helped them a great deal in the past. It was Britain, and Margaret Thatcher, who insisted that they enter NATO and become members of the European Union. We wrote off all the debts that they had incurred during the days of communism.

They want to challenge that stranglehold, and they look to the UK for leadership. I feel passionately about that and will try to help my party find the right-of-centre partners in eastern Europe that the Minister spoke about. <i> [Interruption.] </i>He laughs from a sedentary position, but there are in fact many young right-of-centre politicians across Europe, such as myself, who feel passionately about having a European Union of sovereign states that trade and want to work together in co-operation, but also to guard their own sovereignty. There are a lot of them; I can assure the Minister that I myself have spoken to many young right-of-centre politicians from across eastern Europe who will work together to ensure that that happens.</p>

It is clear that the current Prime Minister played a large role in the debacle over handing back our EU rebate. He was in constant contact with the former Prime Minister&#151;Blair.

I have openly stated to many politicians from Poland and other eastern European countries how disappointed I am that they did not come to our aid over these critical negotiations. Britain has done more for Poland than any other European country has, and it is very disappointing that on this one occasion when Britain needed help and support from her allies in eastern Europe, Poland and others did not do anything to support us.

It is not the EU or its institutions that are in any way corrupt or wasteful&#151;or if they are, it is only to a very minor degree&#151;and the auditors have not made such a suggestion for years.

I would have liked to hear an assurance from the Minister that some of the money would be spent on helping these countries reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. Owing to its communist past, Poland has hugely inefficient steel plants, such as Nowa Huta in Krakow, that belt out hundreds of thousands of tonnes of emissions. It would be at least nice for some of the money to be spent on helping countries to reduce their CO2 emissions, so I look forward to hearing in the winding-up speech how some of the money will be spent.</p>

They are currently experiencing terrible problems in getting their hands on money to which they are entitled under European Union terms. Will the Minister assure me that the rebate that he has given away does not affect British overseas territories, and will he give me a commitment that he will help the Governments of the Cayman islands and the Turks and Caicos islands get what they are entitled to?

The reason is the problems that we face in the United Kingdom on public services. I visited Coleham primary school in Shrewsbury in my constituency. Its headmistress has worked out that she receives &#163;711 less per pupil than the average per child funding&#151;I am not talking about the best schools&#151;and that equates to a &#163;300,000 shortfall for one primary school in my constituency. I asked how that affects her. She said, &#147;Clearly we cannot buy certain books or put the heating on when we would like, and we have various problems.&#148; How can we be experiencing such problems in the fourth wealthiest country in the world, yet at the same time be giving so much to eastern Europe?</p>

I have told the relevant Minister that we have a huge funding shortfall. Our local education authority is ranked 145th out of 149 LEAs for funding. Later this evening, I shall present a 16,000-signature petition that aims to prevent the closure of Shrewsbury ambulance control centre. Can one imagine such a thing? At the same time, the socialists are giving my taxpayers&#146; money to the eastern Europeans&#151;it is unbelievable.</p>

Today, if one speaks to Icelandic politicians&#151;we are returning to the theme of Iceland&#151;one finds that they still talk in derogatory terms about how Roy Hattersley negotiated the fishing stocks between Britain and Iceland back in 1978. They still laugh at that. In political circles in Reykjavik it is still talked about, and people there say that the poor negotiation and his poor performance as a negotiator cost the United Kingdom millions of pounds. The deal before us will be talked about in 20, 30 and 40 years&#146; time as an appallingly bad negotiated settlement that has cost our taxpayers and our children billions of pounds.</p>

 I do not want to follow on from what the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) said, but I must put him right on Iceland. What he mentioned was not done by Roy Hattersley and it did not happen in 1978, because he was not in the Foreign Office at that time. The settlement was in 1976 and the proposals that Roy Hattersley turned down were made in 1974. The hon. Gentleman would have done better to stay off Iceland altogether.

this House. It is nice to welcome two new Ministers in the field as umpires or referees in the contest&#151;my congratulations to both of them. I shall not put forward a view that accords with their policy or with official policy, because I shall not vote for this measure, and I would not want to give the impression that speeches by Labour Members will be, with one exception, that of my hon.

Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)&#151;my new Friend&#151;has left the Chamber, but it was good to see him get all that accumulated bile about the Conservative party off his chest. I am sure that it did him a lot of good. It was interesting to see, but I do not think that those views will do him as much good under our new leadership as they would have done under the previous leadership until July&#151;the bid is a bit late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="71119-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07111935000064">The basic problem that we face with this Bill is that it adds to the costs of belonging to the European Union, which are already unacceptably high for this country. After Germany, which is much more generous and committed towards Europe, we have long been the second highest contributor. That situation has been compounded by the concessions made on the rebate by our previous Prime Minister, whose name slips my mind temporarily, earlier in the year without much consultation with Labour Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="71119-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07111935000065">The rebate was negotiated unwisely by Mrs. Thatcher, because it addressed some of the problems that the structures and financing of the European Union placed on this country unfairly and unequally. However, it was wrong to give up any part of that rebate, and in particular to do so without concessions in the negotiations in return. One should not just make generous impulsive offers and throw all one&#146;s cards on the table</p>

In the negotiation, one must play one&#146;s cards and games in return for sacrifices. My concern is that there were no reciprocal gains and we got nothing in the negotiations, either on the treaty, which was also in play and being negotiated at the same time, or on the budget situation that has been so damaging to this country. Before those concessions, our contributions, which will increase under this Bill, were between &#163;7 billion and &#163;8 billion gross over the past few years.</p>

 The previous Prime Minister, when negotiating rebate reform, stated that European partners had arrived at a quid pro quo in respect of CAP reform.

 The so-called concession on the CAP was not worth the paper that it was not written on. Our experience of the CAP indicates the difficulty. The new settlement will be in 2013, but I do not imagine that we shall get any substantial concessions from the French.

them back. This issue has been impossible to address. Every party in this country has promised at every election a fundamental reform of the CAP, but we have not got one.</p>

Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the negotiations have set the CAP expenditure on a remorseless downward path, but that is nonsense. It has been reducing as a proportion, but it has been increasing as a total, and it still represents well over half the annual EU budget going to 5 per cent. of the EU electorate. That goes to show what the EU&#146;s preoccupations are, so he was wrong to say that there has been a concession.</p>

 I am not even sure that the trend is downwards. The overall proportion of allocated expenditure that the CAP took in 2006 was 46.7 per cent and in 2005 it was 46.2 per cent. It is floating up slightly, not floating down as my hon. Friend&#151;perhaps inadvertently&#151;suggested.</p>

 My hon. Friend is a fount of wisdom and sagacity, and I am always delighted to be corrected on any issue that is damaging to the European Union. So the trend is up for the proportion now, although it had been heading down for some time. Anyway, the CAP is very boring and I want to move on&#151;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman mentions the CAP. There is no question but that it needs reform and we all have our own issues with it, but at 0.4 per cent.&#151;less than half a per cent.&#151;it has provided secure food supplies for decades in Europe. It has also, to some extent, been a social tool to protect the most fragile economies in some of the most remote and rural areas. We all want to see changes in the subsidies for big agro-business, but what other changes would the hon. Gentleman make that might weaken or damage the good things that the CAP has delivered for many decades for a small proportion of Europe&#146;s income?</p>

 I do not want to make changes: I just want to scrap it. That would be the sensible thing to do, because then we could support our own agriculture in our own way. That is enough for now on the CAP, but the key point is that it is a massive budgetary contribution to a small section of the European economy.</p>

That is our money with their costs deducted to spend on purposes that they see fit. It annoys me, as it does my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, to see on every dogs&#146; home or retirement home for eurocrats the sign with the stars saying that it was built with European money. It was not built with European money, because it is our money that we have been given back, with their costs deducted. We could spend all that money for our own purposes much more effectively&#151;and certainly not on the CAP.</p>

 Yes, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="71119-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07111935000077">The Bill will increase our gross contribution to &#163;10 billion&#151;which will rise to some &#163;20 billion after 2013&#151;and the net receipt to &#163;6 billion. I ask those hon. Members who say what a benefit the system is to the rest of Europe to envisage how many roads, schools, hospitals and health centres could be built here, at our discretion and for our purposes, if we were not making that annual contribution. We are told to rejoice that Italy and France are now beginning to pay something after all the years of paying nothing, but the proportionate increase in their contribution is less than in ours, and we have been making the second highest contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="71119-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07111935000078">Our Government&#146;s contribution is about 0.5 per cent. of our GDP, and that is important, because that is the growth from which the people of this country benefit, but it is not our only contribution to Europe. We also make contributions to European institutions of &#163;1.8 billion in total, including for instance the blessings of the Galileo project, which is to send 20 flying pigs into space to bounce back a location system that we get free from the Americans at the moment, so that our motorists and defence forces can pay for it. I come back to the CAP&#151;I am sure that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) will rejoice. The net cost of the CAP to us, by the OECD&#146;s estimate, is &#163;15 billion a year. That is partly in distortions to the market, but it is also the cost of not buying the cheaper food that is available on world markets, and being forced to buy the over-priced production from Europe. What could we do with that &#163;15 billion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="71119-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07111935000079">Then there is the cost of the European regulations that are showered on us, some necessary and some not. Estimates vary and some are higher than others, but let us say &#163;25 billion a year. Add that lot up and we are contributing between &#163;45 billion and &#163;60 billion a year to belong to that institution. It is some 2 per cent. of GDP, so in other words our growth would have been 2 per cent. faster each year had we not been making those contributions. That growth is cumulative, so at the end of 10 years our economy would have been that much more powerful&#151;and that much better able to contribute to the needs of developing countries.</p>

We are in a substantial and growing balance of payments deficit, and we are adding to that by the flow across the exchanges. We have already suffered damage to manufacturing in this country. When we joined, we had a surplus in manufacturing trade with Europe. Now we have a steadily growing annual deficit. We have paid for that in previous years through a surplus with the rest of the world, but that has now gone, too. There is a massive drain on the balance of payments, which will only get worse if we carry on this course.</p>

Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford was quite wrong to say that it was not the Commission&#146;s spending, because it is the programmes that the corruption occurs in, and Europe is responsible for those programmes. Is the money going to the Spanish, to build fishing vessels to come and catch our fish and take it off to Spain? Is it going to farmers in the Republic of Ireland and France? I am sure that they do better out of the CAP and the aid than do the Poles, who are the poorest in Europe. Where is our money going and what benefit do we get from it?</p>

Is he aware that the debts of some countries in eastern Europe, such as Poland, are nothing like the national debt of this country, which is more than &#163;700 billion and rising? So it is nonsensical for our British taxpayers to give Poland money when our national debt is increasing at a much faster rate than its is.</p>

He need not have given any of that money away. He did not need any of the skills that Baroness Thatcher required to win us the rebate&#151;he had all the cards in his hand.

Friends had misgivings. The Opposition were prepared to listen, however, and see whether it was feasible to negotiate a much better deal on the spending side of the account, whereby the British position would not worsen, while that of all members of the Union would improve if spending could be reduced on agriculture. Such spending gets in the way of efficient agriculture in many member states and prevents developing countries from getting fair access to our markets.</p>

This Government have signed up to a set of spending plans that mean that, on average, every year over the seven-year period the United Kingdom will have to pay &#163;10 billion into the European Union, after knocking off the smaller rebate, which is still in place thanks to Baroness Thatcher. That means that, in practice, there will be an underlying spending increase of &#163;70 billion over a seven-year period. Using my simple sum, if the Government borrowed that over 20 years at 5 per cent., we are talking about &#163;140 billion of first-round interest payments and capital repayments, just to see us through the seven years. At the end of the seven years, of course, we know that we would be on another escalator, because our bargaining position would be greatly weakened thanks to the Government&#146;s foolishness in giving away this most important principle and allowing the rebate to be weakened.</p>

Now we discover that they can apparently pledge this country to pay &#163;70 billion over the cycle of the budget proposal. We know that they can propose that only because they intend to borrow every penny of it, just as presumably they are borrowing every penny of the &#163;24 billion that they have so far made available to Northern Rock.</p>

There was the strange argument that the rebate was going to increase, whereas we all know that there will be a worsening of the rebate and increased spending. There was then the argument that we should be extremely grateful and welcoming of the fact that, as a result of our much bigger contribution to the European Union kitty, there would be more spending in countries outside the United Kingdom. He implied that he believes that, as soon as a country gets European Union spending, it becomes more prosperous and its growth rate rises. That is a curious argument.</p>

The other thing that we discover is that, under this Government in the past decade, those areas have also had the slowest growth rates.

 I see the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), a Cornish seat, becoming agitated, but she must know that the Cornish rate of growth has been much less than that of London or the south-east. London and the south-east are not main recipients of European aid, whereas Cornwall is. If receiving subsidy and aid triggered a big increase in the growth rate, one would expect Scotland to have been the fastest growing part of the United Kingdom in the past decade, as it has had so much extra money from all sources. Instead, we discover that Scotland has been about the slowest growing part of the United Kingdom.</p>

 Growth rates in London and the south-east are far greater than that in Cornwall, which demonstrates that European Union money is not managing to do what the hon. Lady hopes.

 Could not the argument be made that the issue is not actually about subsidies at all? The rate of growth in the Republic of Ireland, for example, has been double that in the United Kingdom. That has happened because Ireland left the United Kingdom and set its own tax structure to suit itself. Perhaps that is not happening in Scotland because Scotland is not independent so that it can compete, match and beat the Republic of Ireland.</p>

 This is not a debate about Scottish independence, but I agree that cutting the tax rate is a very good way to accelerate the growth rate. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury seemed to think that subsidies to the Irish agricultural sector were the main cause of accelerated Irish growth. There is no evidence from the Irish economy that the agriculture sector has led the growth; it has been led by the service and manufacturing sectors. That is definitely the result of very low corporation tax.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s endorsement of my case. So much European money went into the agriculture sector in Ireland, but that is not the great success story.

The language of the European Union has already downgraded the review, and the French have made it clear that they do not wish major reforms of the common agricultural policy to occur under their chairmanship.

 I see the Economic Secretary to the Treasury shaking her head; I presume that she is still one of the true believers, as befits somebody who used to be the chief economist for Britain in Europe&#151;hardly an impartial organisation on such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07111939000006">It would be right for us to reject the proposals and for the Government to stand up for British interests. The budget negotiations were meant to rely on real reform as a quid pro quo for additional payments from the United Kingdom, but it is absolutely clear that there has been no real reform in the EU budget as a result of our conceding a substantial chunk of our rebate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07111939000007">The Prime Minister and I completely agree on the need to repatriate to the United Kingdom expenditure on structural funds. As has been said, no value whatever is added by the process of passing money to Brussels, handling fees being taken off, and some of the money coming back to us for projects in this country. All that involves is a transfer of political power to Brussels, which allows politicians there to make decisions about which projects should be supported and which should not, and under which rules. Such issues would be far better handled in this country. It would be much better to dispense with the system whereby Brussels handles the structural funding throughout the European Union, and I shall come in a moment to how I think that ought to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07111939000008">I have similar thoughts about the common agricultural policy in the UK. As far as I can see, for a long time there have been very few reforms in the CAP. As has been said, the policy basically operates as a wealth transfer system, whereby poor consumers pay more for their food so that wealthy farmers can benefit. It is an obscenity that, as has been mentioned, people such as the Duke of Westminster receive enormous sums from the CAP, and will continue to do so under this scheme. Under the proposals, the undeserving rich will continue to get richer from the CAP and that financial system.</p>

Friends who intend to vote against this budget, oppose aid for eastern Europe. I have been in favour of widening the EU for a long time, so that is a calumny that we should in no way be prepared to accept. However, it is not helpful to handle the money that we wish to give to eastern Europe as it is currently being handled. In our relationship with eastern Europe, we should adopt two models from the Department for International Development. First, where we have little confidence in the internal systems of the country involved, we should be prepared to say, &#147;Yes, we&#146;re willing to support this project, but we&#146;ll handle it. We&#146;ll seek your help and assistance, but we will not hand the money over to the local equivalent of the Mafia, so that they can take away a huge proportion of it instead of making sure that those who deserve it receive it.&#148;</p>

Union and its bureaucrats sitting in Brussels know better what is needed in Latvia, Lithuania and other parts of eastern Europe than the people in those countries do. If we support devolution in this country, we should support devolution in the form of direct budget support across the whole of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07111939000011">Let me turn to some concerns about the detail of the system that the Government have not yet touched on. Does the Minister accept that the Government have, as they confirmed in a written answer, agreed to a last-minute &#163;1 billion increase in the administration budget merely to ease the passage of the proposals in Brussels? Why did we concede an extra &#163;1 billion in sweeteners? That is log-rolling, and I can see no reason why we did it, or why we expect the British public to pay our share of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07111939000012">Following the agreement in December 2005, we were told, &#147;That&#146;s it&#151;enough is enough. This is the agreement and this is what we are going to stick to.&#148; Yet two months later the Government agreed to an increase in the European budget of &#163;2.7 billion. Why was that? It seems to display a certain inability to strike even a bad deal and then stick to it. Saying, &#147;We surrender, but if you&#146;re not happy with that, we&#146;ll surrender again later on,&#148; is not the best way of dealing with these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07111939000013">We have been told that the Government are very keen on transferring money to eastern Europe. However, we should be absolutely clear that it remains the position that Ireland and Belgium will be net recipients from the budget, as are Luxembourg and several other wealthy countries, whereas a country such as Cyprus, with a gross domestic product half that size, will end up as a net contributor. That is absurd. Per head, the top three recipients of EU funds will be old member states&#151;Luxembourg, Belgium and Greece. That does not display a transfer of wealth from the EU&#146;s old western members to its new eastern members. France will be the largest single recipient of money from the EU under the negotiated settlement, which is meant to be about transferring money to the east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07111939000014">I fail to understand how the Government can possibly defend this as a good deal. If this is good deal, I dread to think what a bad deal would have been. It is noticeable that the Government have refused to produce statistics indicating their estimates of how much every other country in the EU will pay in and receive&#151;except for France. If they are prepared to do it for France, I cannot see why they are unwilling to do it for other countries, unless they feel that there is something to be ashamed of.</p>

This does not strike me as being a reform budget. Spain was previously the largest recipient of funds, but it has been replaced by France, and that transformation does not seem to be a brilliant piece of negotiating. Ireland is the second richest country in the EU, with an income per head 30 per cent. above average, yet it will get more money out of the budget than it puts in. I do not understand the logic of that position.</p>

Is that another brilliant example of hard negotiation?</p>

 Indeed, I had already touched on that. Why are we giving more money to Belgium and Luxembourg? If more money has to go on administration, we in this country have a policy of trying to disperse jobs from the rich centre to the poorer periphery. Why is that policy not being adopted by the European Union? That seems an absurdity to me.</p>

We are not giving up the rebate completely in 2007-08. We give up 20 per cent. in 2009, 70 per cent. in 2010, and we have agreed to give up 100 per cent. of the funds between 2011 and 2013. Why has that process been end-loaded? Presumably they saw us coming, and it is now much more difficult for us to negotiate our way back. We have a far more disadvantageous deal than we would if the rebate were evenly given up over the period in question. At the end, we would end up with a better figure from which to work. I remember from when I was negotiating that if we could manage to get a deal that gave us a certain percentage over a year, but it was end-loaded, we started off in a much better position in the subsequent year. I can only assume that those elementary lessons in negotiating had not been passed on to the British negotiators, and I can only assume that the European Union saw us coming, and decided that taking sweets off children was quite an enjoyable process&#151;but I will not digress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="71119-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07111939000021">The difficulties caused by our failure in the negotiations spill over into other areas of interest for the British Government. We have an excellent record in the area of foreign aid. We have worked exceptionally hard, but we ought to be exceedingly concerned about the way in which our commitments to retain CAP spending have locked us into negotiating positions, in the Doha round and so on, that make world trade talks more difficult than they otherwise would have been. The agreement places us in a position that is directly against the interests of the third world in world trade talks. I can see why the French wanted to put us in that position, but I cannot understand why we were willing to accept it. We must do better subsequently.</p>

 Thank you for calling me to speak at the end of this important debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall try to keep my remarks short. This has been an interesting debate, with some varied contributions. I notice that the Government could only get the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) to speak in favour of their position. The right hon. Member for Rotherham gave a long and&#151;as I said when he was in the Chamber&#151;fairly tedious speech, but he did it with a twinkle in his eye. Too often, however, when we have debates about Europe, we start to throw out words such as &#147;racist&#148; and &#147;xenophobic&#148;, and that does this place no good at all. It brings the whole political class into disrepute. It is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about this country&#146;s relationship, and its future relationship, with Europe without being called a racist or xenophobe. Those terms are thrown around the Chamber far too often, in far too many debates.</p>

Farming is fundamental to those countries&#146; development and economic growth, yet we weight agricultural subsidies in favour of our own well-heeled farmers, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) has just pointed out. We make it difficult for African farmers to bring their produce to our markets, yet we think nothing of taking our excess product that no one here or in Europe wants to buy and dumping it on their markets at massively reduced prices, making it impossible for African farmers to compete. I have used this example before, and I will use it again: there are markets in Nigeria that are selling tinned European tomatoes. That is simply madness, and we in the European Union must put an end to it. It is unsustainable for us to subsidise our farmers off the backs of struggling African farmers. If we are really going to demonstrate that we want to improve the outlook for African countries and to strengthen their economies, we must allow them access to our agricultural markets. We must allow them to compete on an even footing.</p>

farmers access to our markets by talking about the number of air miles involved in the shipment of food. I am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker. I know that you do not want us to talk about carbon footprints, but foods imported from Africa often have a far smaller carbon footprint, because they are grown in natural sunshine rather than in expensive, heated greenhouses. We must not use the concern about the environment that is shared by our EU partners to block African farmers&#146; access to our markets.</p>

We use abstract phrases and high-minded language. Of course, we are very high-minded people, but we must remember that what we do here has to be relevant to a wider audience. I know, from going around my constituency, that there is concern about the European project and about these quite significant additional sums of money that we are going to hand over to the newly joined member states of the European Union. I do not think that my constituents are mean-minded people, however. They understand that there is an argument for helping emerging economies in Europe to get the foothold that they need to become wealthier and to become our trading partners, but they also have a legitimate right to be concerned about the sums of money being talked about. We must not dismiss those concerns as the concerns of racists and xenophobes. After all, any money that we spend in this place belongs to the taxpayer. It belongs to the people whom we represent, and it is therefore incumbent on us to make a strong case for spending it. Ultimately, we should be answerable to them for where their taxes are going.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is probably right in one respect: there is relatively little concern about the unreformed CAP providing net sums to the accession countries. I see little wrong with that. What does concern me is countries such as Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, which are all net beneficiaries from the unreformed CAP. That cannot be allowed to continue for much longer, can it? How can that strike constituents in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s area or mine as being fair or sane?</p>

 I share many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and I will tell him why. My constituency faces significant funding pressures on public services. For example, we face the closure of not one hospital, but possibly two.

If we believe in sending money to the emerging economies of eastern Europe, we need to make that argument. I personally believe that this country gives too much to the European budget and that we could do with giving quite a bit less.

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. If anything, the EU is too much about agriculture. The EU is obsessed with agriculture and with agricultural subsidies. For the EU to gain the support of the European population, it has to be seen to be working for everyone, but all too often, as he points out, it seems to be working for very few people. Conversely, for far too many people, it amounts to a nice dollop of extra cash on top of what they are already getting.</p>

 Absolutely. The comparison was made with London, which has enormous financial institutions of world repute. Clearly, wealth creation in London is disproportionate when compared with the rest of the UK. It is therefore important that we work hard in the peripheral areas.</p>

It was a strange dilemma, because on the one hand we wanted to be poor enough to get the European money, but on the other, we would have liked to celebrate being not so poor as to attract it.

However, we must understand that there can be examples of good and bad practice in all government, whether we are considering Brussels, the UK national Government or local government. It is sometimes easy to overlook the significant benefits that we have enjoyed from EU membership, such as opportunities for Japanese electronics companies, for example, to invest in this country and to be part of the market, economy and purchasing power that is Europe. When we consider financial gain, we must therefore take into account more than the single sum of money that is being pushed one way or another in any specific budget.</p>

 We could discuss for ever individual figures and what goes where at any particular time. However, we clearly benefit enormously from being in the EU.

Sarkozy is possibly being over-ambitious in his goals for when France has the presidency of the EU. We should not fall into that trap. The power vested in the presidency is not sufficiently significant to push things in the French direction in the way that has perhaps been suggested. It is ironic that Sarkozy has ambitious ideas about defence given that the Assembl&#233;e Nationale turned down the idea of a European army in the 1950s. He may therefore be overstepping the mark, and we, too, do so if we suggest that his influence will be quite so great when France takes on the presidency.</p>

We need to be careful to ensure that the debate does not become anti-enlargement or focus negatively on specific countries. Turkey has been mentioned a number of times as a country that is not suitable for EU membership, but for quite the wrong reasons. There are huge concerns, which I share, about Turkey&#146;s human rights record, treatment of people in custody, attitude to minority groups, treatment of groups such as the Kurds and policy towards Cyprus. The argument that is often repeated, however, is that if Turkey joins the EU, we will be swamped by people from Turkey seeking economic benefit here. The economic and religious issues seem to drive a lot of the prejudice against Turkey, but neither are relevant. In 10 or 15 years&#146; time, when Turkey joins the European Union, it will be better off than countries such as Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to wind up today&#146;s debate. Those of us who deal with Treasury matters are used to Finance Bills, so a Bill with only one operative clause appears somewhat less daunting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71119-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07111939000073">The debate has also been a pleasure because of the range of views heard. From Conservative Members, perhaps not surprisingly, we have heard forceful criticism of the deal facing us, and of the consequences that will flow from enacting the Bill. Such contributions were made by my hon. Friends the Members for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). We also heard strong speeches making precisely the same point from Labour Members, particularly the hon. Members for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson).</p>

Member for Grantham and Stamford was going to be in a somewhat isolated and minority position in his own party on this issue&#151;once again&#151;but it was not to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71119-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07111939000075">The simple question dealt with by the Bill is whether the deal obtained by Tony Blair in December 2005 was a good one and in Britain&#146;s interests. He went to negotiate with an objective to protect the rebate, to limit EU spending and to reform the CAP. He delivered on none of those. Our gross contributions are up, what we get back is down, and our net contribution is up. Moreover, our negotiating position for the next financing period has been horrendously undermined. The UK will therefore pay the price for this deal not just until 2013 but for the seven years after that. All that has occurred at a time when, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham made clear, we had a veto&#151;we had an ability to block something that was clearly against our interests, and we failed to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71119-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07111939000076">The argument is made that the deal is all about redistribution from the wealthy west to the poorer east. But let us look at the facts&#151;the comparative data. What do they tell us about the winners and losers from the budget settlement and the own- resources decision? The Government will not give us all those figures, but Open Europe has obtained leaked copies of working papers, and there is little link between spending and needs. The highest per capita spending is in the EU&#146;s wealthiest country, Luxembourg. In second and third place are two members of the original EU 15, Belgium and Greece, not new accession countries. Ireland, one of the richest countries in Europe, will receive more per person than eight of the 10 accession states. To be fair, there is one western country that does do poorly. The country that does worst in terms of funding is the United Kingdom.</p>

It is a bad deal for Britain: it loses us part of our rebate, it fails to reform the common agricultural policy, and it weakens our negotiating position for the next time.

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0711208000015">We have heard a lot of facts and figures this evening, so let me start by explaining the true ones. This is a good package for Britain. The abatement is preserved<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> Of course it is; it is in writing in the own-resources decision, which states:</p>
<a name="71119-0020.htm_brev11"><a name="0711208000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The European Council of 15 and 16 December 2005 concluded that the correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom shall remain&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0711208000016">I have it here in black and white. It continues:</p>
<a name="71119-0020.htm_brev12"><a name="0711208000688"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However, after a phasing-in period between 2009 and 2011, the United Kingdom shall participate fully in the financing of the costs of enlargement, except for agricultural direct payments and market-related expenditure&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0711208000017">The rebate as a whole will remain. It has not been signed away and will remain in full on the common agricultural policy across old and new EU member states and on all spending in the EU 15. It is right that we pay our share towards reconstruction in eastern Europe and it is in our national interest to do so. Not only that, our abatement is worth more in this budget round than in the previous one. We will get back &#8364;40 billion, which is an increase on the &#8364;34.5 billion in the previous round. Over the period, Britain and France will contribute roughly the same, which Conservative negotiators never achieved. The net contributions of France and Italy will rise twice as fast as ours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0711208000018">Under this deal, the EU budget as a whole has fallen below 1 per cent. of European Union gross national income, which is a saving of &#8364;160 billion compared with the Commission&#146;s original proposal. The deal that we agreed is 20 per cent. less than the last budget agreed when Conservatives were attempting to negotiate for the Government. In 1988, the then Government signed up to a deal that saw the budget grow by 17 per cent. over five years, and in 1994 they signed up to a budget that was shown to grow by 22 per cent. We have signed up to a budget for an enlarged EU that will grow by a mere 7 per cent., working in the national interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0711208000019">We have secured a commitment to a fundamental review of the budget. The CAP, which was two thirds of the budget in the mid-1980s, will no longer be the largest part of the EU budget. The value of the CAP will start to fall in real terms from this year, from &#8364;55 billion to &#8364;51 billion by 2013. That has been negotiated by this Government. The budget now gives help to the new member states of eastern Europe, which need it most. It is in the national interest to pay our fair share of the cost of enlargement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0711208000020">I want to refer to some of the questions and contributions in this evening&#146;s debate. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, said that she wanted a debate on EU membership. She accepted that CAP reform was going the right way, but then she confirmed that she will vote against the Bill. The Liberal Democrats are, as always, trying to face two ways at the same time. She said that it would have been better to have had no agreement than to have the agreement reached in 2005, and other Opposition Members tried to make the same point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71119-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0711208000021">It was essential to have a December 2005 deal to allow the new member states to start preparing to use EU funds and to avoid the European Parliament, in the absence of such a deal, setting annual budgets under existing funding arrangements that, just to give one example, would have cost Poland about two thirds of its EU funds. Reaching no deal would have betrayed our support for enlargement. Perhaps the Opposition parties&#146; support for no deal betrays their lack of support for enlargement.</p>

I do not agree with all of them, but I was grateful for his contribution. He said that the CAP and structural and cohesion funds should be nationalised. On the CAP, the Government&#146;s policy is the abolition of market support and direct payments. On structural and cohesion funds, as set out in 2003, it is our policy that wealthier countries should be responsible for their own regional policies. SCFs should be targeted on the poorest and, as a result of the deal that we secured in December 2005, 250 per cent. of structural and cohesion funding expenditure will go to new member states.</p>

That is not the case: the own-resources decision will not come into force until it is ratified by all member states, and I hope we will do so very shortly.</p>

I support enlargement&#151;I am not sure whether Opposition parties do&#151;and I am clear that the investment in new member states will be to the economic benefit of the UK. It will facilitate trade. In 2006, British exports to the countries that acceded in 2004 had risen by 36 per cent. in the first full year after accession. That means jobs and growth in the constituencies of all hon. Members.</p>

That sounds like a good idea, because by voting against the Bill Members of both Opposition parties will, in effect, be voting to take money way from east European countries; yet the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), said in the House on 23 February 2003:</p>
<a name="71119-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="0711208000689"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Enlargement of the EU is wholly welcome.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 13 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 1023.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="71119-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0711208000046">The Opposition support enlargement on one hand, yet they do not will the means for it to happen with the other. Is not that strange? We can only presume why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="71119-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0711208000047">I presume that the Conservatives need to make money from the accession of eastern European countries to plug the &#163;6 billion hole in their public finances&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o505"><a name="0711208000048"><a name="71119-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0711208000765"><b>Mr. Redwood</b>
<i>  rose&#151;</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o506"><a name="0711208000049"><a name="71119-0021.htm_spnew5"><a name="0711208000766"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 I am not giving way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="71119-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0711208000050">Perhaps the Conservatives will use the money that would have gone to reconstruct the former Soviet bloc to pay for removing inheritance tax from millionaires&#151;they have no other way of paying for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="71119-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0711208000051">The crux of the debate is that if the rebate was not disapplied for eastern Europe, the UK would have a windfall from the accession of eastern European countries. That is akin to a transfer from the poor to the rich. It may appeal to Opposition Members but it certainly does not appeal to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="71119-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0711208000052">The Conservatives say we could spend the money on doctors, nurses and teachers. I say that under the Labour Government we can invest in public services and do the right thing by Europe. It is in our national interest to do both. When eastern Europe prospers, so do we. It is good for Britain to be in a market of 500 million consumers. British exports to eastern Europe are rising dramatically. Our firms are investing there, and as they grow we shall grow, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="71119-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0711208000053">The shadow Chief Secretary got a bit carried away over the weekend and put out a press release saying that we were disapplying the rebate with nothing in return. Does he call enlargement nothing? I call it peace, prosperity and in our national interest.</p>

 I beg to submit this petition, which it is an honour to present in the names of Gareth Dadd, Derek Adamson and Mark Robson. It expresses their concern about the proposed police funding formula review and its impact on policing in North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire is one of the most rural counties in the country and rural policing poses one of the biggest challenges. That should be reflected by an increase in the police funding formula. Any proposed cuts in rural policing to divert funding to urban, Labour-controlled areas, would be totally unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0711208000621"><i> Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.<i> &#151;[Mr. Watson.]</i></p>

 I welcome this opportunity to raise in the House my constituents&#146; concern about proposals for a new flight path into Southampton and Bournemouth airports. NATS&#151;National Air Traffic Services&#151;has proposed additional controlled airspace from Newbury to Romsey, where aircraft may fly as low as 5,500 ft. Flights would be permitted between 5.30 in the evening and 9.30 in the morning. At this stage, the proposal would only affect inbound flights from next April, but if approved it could be extended to outgoing and therefore noisier flights. Indeed, the document says:</p>
<a name="71119-0022.htm_brev13"><a name="0711208000716"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Bournemouth outbounds may also be positioned in this space.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0711208000623">There seems to be no scope for limiting the number of movements using controlled airspace once it has been designated. The proposals have been opposed by Hampshire county council, Basingstoke and Deane district council, 18 parish councils, the council of partners of the north Wessex downs area of outstanding natural beauty, New Forest national park authority and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. I am grateful to Professor Johnnie Johnson and Alan Cox of Ashmansworth parish council and to councillors Horace Mitchell and Clive Sanders for their work in challenging these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0711208000624">Despite those powerful objections&#151;more than 500 were made&#151;NATS has asked the Civil Aviation Authority to accept the proposals without amendment later this month. In a letter dated 2 October, the Minister, whom I welcome to the Dispatch Box, told me:</p>
<a name="71119-0022.htm_brev14"><a name="0711208000717"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the change sponsor must submit a report to the CAA who will consider the proposal against regulatory requirements. As appropriate, this might include seeking the views of the Secretary of State for transport on environmental matters.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0711208000625">I will show that those regulatory requirements have not been kept to. This evening&#146;s debate is apt because at the end of this month the CAA is due to take a decision, in which the Minister has a role, and today the Prime Minister sought to underline his Government&#146;s environmental credentials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0711208000626">There are two questions. First, was the consultation process fit for purpose? Secondly, has the case for change been made? First, on process, what NATS did might have been appropriate some 20 years ago, when concern about environmental issues was lower, there was less commitment to consulting and getting feedback, and parish councils were less engaged in the planning process. We lived then in a less participatory society. But today, when there is a proposal such as this, that process is no longer fit for purpose. MPs should be offered a briefing in the House, NATS should write directly to parish and town councils, the document should be intelligible and conform to recent guidelines, and NATS should be prepared to put on roadshows for those who want them.</p>

and Shalbourne, although the people there are very concerned. Does he agree that the real outrage about what is happening is that whereas a local planning authority can, as has happened in such cases, stop noise pollution in areas such as Ham and Shalbourne in relation to glider launches or motocross, when something of this sort is proposed there is no local control at all over what happens.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. There is less protection for what may be a noisier development than there is for the developments that he has just described. Indeed, he has put his finger on a point that was in the Government&#146;s White Paper, &#147;A better quality of life&#151;strategy for sustainable development in the UK&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0711208000629">In May, a document landed on my desk, entitled &#147;Terminal control south west airspace development&#148;, which I nearly binned because I do not regard North-West Hampshire as being in the south-west. It came with a letter dated 4 May, containing a list of organisations that the CAA had identified for consultation, which included MPs. It said:</p>
<a name="71119-0022.htm_brev15"><a name="0711208000718"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Identified organisations are requested to cascade this information to related groups as deemed necessary.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0711208000630">In other words, responsibility for consulting the parish councils was subcontracted by NATS to local MPs. Although local authorities also had that obligation, none of my parish councils were notified by them, and NATS made no attempt to see if the cascade they asked for had taken place. Indeed, one parish councillor e-mailed me on 8 August, two days before the consultation was formally ended, saying:</p>
<a name="71119-0022.htm_brev16"><a name="0711208000719"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It was only by chance, nearly two weeks ago, that a local resident, on browsing the web, discovered that consultation was taking place.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0711208000631">The document flies in the face of the January 2002 Department for Transport guidance to the CAA, CAP 725, which states that the formal proposal must include </p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="71119-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0711208000632">But there was no assessment in the document of other options. That point was well made by Basingstoke and Deane borough council, which said:</p>

The policy that we set out in the 2003 air transport White Paper and reaffirmed in the 2006 progress report is in line with both the Stern report and the Eddington study. We recognise that a balance must be struck between tackling environmental challenges, enabling people to fly and allowing the industry to compete internationally.

In May this year, National Air Traffic Services began a 14-week public consultation on proposals to extend a portion of airspace termed the terminal control south west airspace development. The consultation was undertaken in accordance with CAA guidance. I shall turn to the details of the CAA&#146;s airspace change process in a few moments, although I acknowledge that the right hon.

 I will express my view about the guidance in a few moments. At the moment, the best I can offer are the words that I have just used: I fully acknowledge the strong comments of the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="71119-0023.htm_para16"><a name="0711208000670">Following a large number of replies received near the end of the consultation period, NATS extended the consultation into the middle of September. That was done to ensure that all interested parties were given adequate opportunity to comment. NATS then undertook an analysis of all responses, which was forwarded to all who responded to the consultation and has been placed on the NATS website. That analysis, along with all consultation materials, was then submitted on 21 September by NATS to the CAA for regulatory review. The CAA will give regulatory approval for the airspace change only if all regulatory requirements are met. I understand that the CAA&#146;s decision is expected in January 2008. If approved, the proposed change would be implemented on 10 April 2008.</p>

NATS stated in its consultation materials that the proposed development aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of air traffic control procedures. I know that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that aviation safety must remain paramount. The UK air transport industry, and NATS in particular, has an excellent safety record, and accident rates have stayed low despite a rapid rise in traffic levels, although we must never rest on our laurels. That is why NATS constantly reviews its airspace management and makes proposals for airspace changes where it believes them necessary. In the case of terminal control south west, NATS believes its proposals will reduce air traffic control complexity, reduce the workload on individual controllers, reduce delay and bring efficiencies to all aircraft passing through the region.</p>

change process includes substantive guidance on a range of environmental requirements, including noise, air quality, tranquillity and visual intrusion. In practice, it would be impractical to prevent widespread over-flying of areas of outstanding natural beauty or national parks in the south of England or elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="71119-0023.htm_para24"><a name="0711208000680">I cannot offer comment on the terminal control south west airspace development while it remains subject to CAA scrutiny under its independent airspace change process. However, I emphasise that the consultation has been conducted fully in accordance with the CAA&#146;s guidance and that that guidance was recently reviewed and strengthened to provide clarity on roles, consultation activities and environmental assessment. However, as with all guidance, it remains a living document. That is why the CAA and NATS have welcomed comments on the current consultation to help their planning for any future such consultations.</p>

 I sense that the Under-Secretary is about to touch down. Surely if a national park authority makes representations against a proposal such as the one that we are considering, he would expect the CAA to touch base with a Department before ticking it through?</p>

 I have outlined as best I can the way in which the process works and that it is a matter for the regulator&#151;in this case, the CAA&#151;to make the assessment. It has to satisfy itself that the change cannot be practically done other than in the way that has been proposed for safety reasons, or that it does not impinge on the environment, as I described. Given the number of objections that Conservative Members have outlined and that have been submitted to the proposal, I would be surprised if the CAA did not fully take on board the strength of feeling and the objections raised for scientific, environmental or other reasons. However, it is not my job to pre-empt or anticipate the conclusion of the review of the regulator, who has the expertise, scientific advice, knowledge and experience to make those decisions. The structures were put in place long before I came to the Department. I have confidence that they will deliver the right results for UK plc and take into account all the issues that were raised in the consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="71119-0023.htm_para25"><a name="0711208000683">I fully acknowledge the criticisms and concerns raised by the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen about the cascade process, and about other aspects of the consultation that they do not believe have been robust enough. As I said, I would be very surprised if those comments were not taken on board elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="71119-0023.htm_para26"><a name="0711208000684">Finally, I want to repeat my reassurance to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire that airspace changes are made only where it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue, or where the airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative. I am sure that the record of this debate will be noted by all the organisations involved in, interested in or affected by the proposed airspace change process.</p>
