 Local authorities will always want to consider the outlets for their services, and that will include post offices. For example, most local authorities offer people a range of ways in which to pay bills and the option of paying council tax online. That reflects the changes that people are making in their lives and the decline of business in the post offices in recent years. Of course, even after the current closure process is completed, the Post Office will still have an unmatchable reach in urban and rural communities, involving many more than 11,000 branches.

That is reducing the scope for such developments and making matters worse for the house building sector.

 My hon. Friend mentions the need for regulation to be proportionate and appropriate. Even in the good times, the construction industry makes use of false self-employment, which often leaves people unprotected and uninsured.

 My hon. Friend makes a good point about health and safety issues in the construction sector.

It will pay for that by cutting tax reliefs, but those reliefs are important to businesses and to their long-term investments, so I do not think that that is a responsible strategy.

 Yes, I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. The public sector construction market is hugely important given that it counts for about 40 per cent. of the industry&#146;s total output. At this point in time it would be grossly irresponsible to do anything other than to continue to seek strong investment in our national infrastructure. The public sector can lead the way in continuing to ensure that there is strong demand and that there are jobs in the construction sector. That is the responsible thing to do in difficult economic times. To suggest that we should cut that investment, which is what the Opposition seem to want to do, or to reject our proposals to do more, would not be welcomed by the public, who are concerned about construction jobs and about jobs more generally in our economy.</p>

The best thing that we can do is to continue to provide a package of support for small businesses that are going through difficult times. That is why we made the announcement that we did yesterday.

 I am certainly very aware that there is anecdotal evidence of the practices that the hon. Gentleman describes.

It is right that the Government should show a strong interest in that, and right that when talking to banks about the bank recapitalisation package, we insist that they do all that they can to support small businesses and home owners with mortgages in these difficult economic times, and we are committed to doing just that.

 On the subject of the part-privatisation of Royal Mail, we were told a few minutes ago that Richard Hooper&#146;s report on independent mail services was due to be published soon. When the Secretary of State appeared before the Select Committee on Tuesday this week, he said that he was contemplating giving additional work to that review team. Can the Minister say what additional work is planned and what impact that will have on the publication timetable?</p>

 The Hooper review is considering the changed context in which Royal Mail operates in terms of competition not only from other mail providers, but from other technologies. That competition has seen the volume of mail decline by 2 or 3 per cent. a year in recent years in this country and in others. The Hooper review must take all these changes into account in compiling its report, and that is exactly what the review team is doing.</p>

We are spending public money, and in matters of the public purse we need to ensure that we do so in a proper way.

 If I might differ slightly from the Church of England by way of assessment, I should say that the Church Commissioners manage their investments proactively and are able to move swiftly when economic circumstances change. Even before the credit crunch began, they sensed that times were changing and acted accordingly. Between 2005 and early 2007, they sold more than &#163;400 million of residential property at prices near the top of the market, and they made &#163;250 million from commercial property sales during the same period. However, in the Church of England we must not overlook the role of individual churchgoers in funding the Church&#146;s vital contribution to the spiritual life of this country.</p>

On 13 October, the Government announced that bank lending would return to 2007 levels, but we now know that that was not a commitment but an aspiration. When people are facing the loss of their jobs and their homes, and small businesses face going under because they cannot get bank loans, what sort of a Government give people false promises of hope? They are a Government who believe more in political convenience than proper scrutiny, who are more interested in spin than effective action and who have taken this country from boom to bust.</p>

 The right hon. Lady is mouthing things at me, and she is right to point out that there is a significant issue about how we tackle violent crime. Crimes of violence against the person are also down by 7 per cent., but we all know, in each of our constituencies, of our constituents&#146; genuine concern about violent crime. There is an issue in that some police authorities this year have chosen, following advice, to report some violent crimes in a slightly different way. However, it is important to acknowledge that all the statistics for homicide and burglary are down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000192">The right hon. Lady&#146;s second point was about the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Bill. The Government are glad that the Bill passed its Third Reading yesterday with a very significant majority of more than two thirds&#151;355 to 129 votes. There were many free votes yesterday and I think that the House reached its settled mind on the Bill, which I believe will make a significant difference, ensuring that in future scientific innovation can make a difference to people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000193">On the Local Transport Bill, the right hon. Lady referred to the large number of amendments tabled for next week&#146;s debate. As she knows full well, many of the Government amendments are often technical and many are a response to Committee debates. One much misunderstood aspect of the political process&#151;it is never reported by the media&#151;is the importance of the Committee stage in improving our legislative work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000194">The right hon. Lady made various statements about the economy. I make no bones about the fact that we are facing difficult times, which is why we need to be absolutely focused on the needs of home owners, on jobs and on ensuring that if people are going to lose their jobs, they have the skills necessary to find a new one and additional support for paying their mortgage. We have provided the ability to debate these issues in various ways&#151;through regular statements, for example&#151;and when I speak to the Leader of the House later, I will ensure that she understands the House&#146;s requirement to be kept up to date throughout the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000195">On Network Rail and last year&#146;s crash, which very unfortunately led to the death of an elderly lady, we of course send our sympathies to those involved. We want to make sure that any lessons that can possibly be learned will be learned. The right hon. Lady could bring the matter up at Transport questions. If a statement needs to be made, I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport will want to come to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000196">Finally, the right hon. Lady spoke about Government communications. I make absolutely no apology for Government communications over the last few weeks, because we have made it absolutely clear that we will stand by ordinary families as they face the difficult international situation that we all face. I know that sometimes the right hon. Lady would like to pretend that this is just some home-grown situation and that we in little Britain can simply manufacture our own way out it. The truth is that the issues we need to address are international and some of the solutions are international&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para38"><a name="08102334000218">On next year&#146;s sittings, the dates of the party conferences are an issue, as that has made it difficult for us to start earlier in October than we did this year. There is also an issue in that next year&#146;s Session will finish earlier than this year&#146;s; this year it will finish late in November and the state opening of Parliament and the Queen&#146;s Speech is not until December, but next year they will be considerably earlier. It is therefore wrong to compare too precisely next year&#146;s dates with this year&#146;s. I should also add that although the hon. Gentleman says that we are on holiday when we are in recess, that is certainly not my experience. Since I was elected to the House in 2001, my experience of parliamentary life is that I work just as hard during the recess as I do when I am sitting here, and I find that my constituents expect me to do so because the job of the constituency MP has completely changed over the last 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81023-0004.htm_para39"><a name="08102334000219">On yesterday&#146;s events, there was a programme motion before the House, which it voted for, so we decided to go forward with the business, and we had a series of votes. In the end, the main issue is that it is absolutely right and proper that we should have an appropriate amount of time to scrutinise all proposed legislation that passes through this House. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill was debated in total, on the Floor of both Houses, for 86 hours, with 10 sessions in the Lords and, so far, eight sessions in the Commons. I think that that is an adequate amount of time for us to be able to do our work, not least because there was also substantial pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right: we must make sure that repossession is the last possible outcome when people are having difficulties in paying their mortgage. That is why the Master of the Rolls yesterday approved the Civil Justice Council&#146;s new protocol, which will make sure that every other avenue is pursued first. It would be extraordinary if the same were not to apply in Scotland, and I urge the Scottish Executive to ensure that home owners get that protection in Scotland.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. On a number of occasions you have expressed your concern about the use of amplifiers by protestors in Parliament square, and we had a meeting with representatives of Westminster council on this issue some months ago. We were told that the licence for the use of loudhailers would run out at the end of January this year and that we would be informed if any application was made to renew it. Evidently no such application has been made and yet the use of the loudhailers goes on persistently, incessantly and at unreasonable volume. Will you please consider writing to Westminster council and urging it to enforce the law, irrespective of the fact that the Government will bring forward new legislation that may affect this matter in the future?

In many cases, they could get a job with the right help and support but, as matters stand, that is not always available for them. It may be that many of them are present in the ranks of those in receipt of incapacity benefit, and at 2.6 million people that remains a stubbornly high figure. It is a particular worry that, in the past seven years, the number of claimants in receipt of incapacity benefit for more than five years has increased by 270,000&#151;a total that accounts for the majority of incapacity benefit claimants.</p>

We have advocated the early assessment of people&#146;s needs, tailoring support to individual needs, sustained support, mentoring, getting people into sustainable jobs&#151;an important thing in the present economic climate&#151;and putting in place the funding mechanism that I have mentioned already and that will enable all that to be achieved.</p>

Skills are vital for obtaining work and for making progress once in work. The Minister may have wanted to say a little more about skills if time had permitted, but the Opposition have brought forward our own very significant policy proposals in that regard.</p>

50 per cent. means. We have a problem that has not been addressed at school level, let alone at training level. During the 1980s and 1990s, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research undertook lots of research comparing us with other countries. It found that in Germany, apprentices would typically have many hours of pedagogy&#151;rigorous teaching&#151;every week. When that was explained to those who led the training and skills industry in Britain, the response was, &#147;Well, that wouldn&#146;t be appropriate in the British context.&#148; That was just a cop-out; they were not prepared to undertake that level of skills provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="81023-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000361">Comparisons were made between apprentices in France and Britain. It was found that apprentices in France knew basic mathematics, and when they took a very simple mathematical test they could get all the questions right in a few minutes. In Britain, a comparable group of apprentices could not do any of the sums at all. There were serious problems at a very basic level. Those problems are still there. I will say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that the Government have recognised that and are trying to deal with it, particularly at school level, but we have not got there yet. My concern is that we have not much considered the interface between the teacher or lecturer and the apprentice, schoolchild or student. We do not deal with the issue at that level.</p>

 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman remembers the report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Centre for the Economics of Education on the extent to which qualifications give a person an earnings advantage in the labour market, but its findings on level 2 national vocational qualifications were stark: they had no impact at all, although level 3 qualifications did.

 My concern is that we have a lot of qualifications, but underneath the qualification the level of skill is often inadequate. German factory workers can typically not only do mathematics but speak a foreign language. They can handle a foreign language, and their language, very well. We are failing in that. The OECD has shown time and again that the gulf between the best educated&#151;the highest achievers in Britain&#151;and the lowest achievers is wider than that in almost any other country in the developed world.

I am glad to say that last weekend, the Chancellor mentioned the great John Maynard Keynes again. I used to teach economics, and Keynes used to be highly regarded&#151;in fact, I still regard him highly&#151;but we have been through a period of madness in which lesser brains have dominated the economic policy agenda. About 15 years ago, I had a debate over lunch with a former deputy economic adviser to the Treasury. I asked him a simple economic question; he could not answer it and lost his temper.

any of the monetarists intimidate me. We have to look to some of the Keynesian recipes, used in the &#146;30s to solve our problems. When the economy recovers, we will need people to be skilled. The modern world cannot rely on people just picking things up on the job, without being able to do mathematics or even handle their own language very well. We have to tackle those basic skills problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="81023-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000365">There are many small companies, and many more smaller companies today, and some apprenticeships cannot be sustained by them. They are fearful of taking on an apprentice because they fear that once the apprentice is trained, he or she will get a job with someone else who pays better. One case that I have written to Ministers about concerns those in the historic vehicle restoration business. Apprentices in that business are highly skilled, but as soon as they are trained, they can get much better paid jobs in the motor sector looking after insurance repair jobs. People in that field are very highly paid; of course, insurance companies pay well for cars to be repaired. Apprentices have to be sustained properly in such small companies. The only way to ensure that is to place a levy&#151;based on turnover, not headcount&#151;on all companies, so that the whole economy pays to sustain apprenticeships, particularly among small companies.

 I too welcome the Minister to his position. It is the first time that we have debated together. I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, given the context: last week, the largest rise in unemployment for 17 years was announced, bringing the figure up to 1.79 million. It is likely to rise to more than 2 million by Christmas, so the issue is obviously important.</p>

It is true that, when it comes to skills, this country has let itself down in the past. The Leitch review set us ambitious literacy and numeracy targets.

The Train to Gain pot, which will be &#163;1 billion by 2011, has been consistently underspent.

is quite clear that employers have not taken up the Train to Gain money because of the often bureaucratic and difficult process that they had to go through to access it. I welcome anything that makes that process easier.</p>

 I agree, and later I shall come to what we can do to deal with those two problems. This month, the number of jobseekers has risen from 31,800 to 929,900.

I want to use as an example some of the work that my local council in Rochdale has done to get people into work, because that is vital. Rochdale has set up a joint project with Oldham called J21, which is tied to the development of the large industrial development at Kingsway. Between them, members of the Kingsway recruitment team have trained 1,300 people and helped get them into work over the past two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81023-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000376">In Rochdale and elsewhere, however, there has been a large increase in the number of redundancies. I do not know whether the Minister saw the announcement last week by MFI that a number of its stores would close. After the receiver looked at which stores were viable, the closure of 86 stores was announced. That announcement was made in a national newspaper&#151;the <i> Daily Mirror</i>&#151;last Friday. If employers are to issue redundancy notices by that method, it brings into question how such things are done and what is the right way of going about it. There was no warning to the employees who were affected: they read it in the newspaper. If unemployment is going to rise, we must make sure that we have mechanisms in place to deal with that. The Minister&#146;s commitment not to close Jobcentre Plus offices in areas with high unemployment is therefore welcome.</p>

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned redundancies. Does he agree that, particularly with the announcement of redundancies for people who are middle-aged or older in the jobs market, it is unfortunate that in the past couple of years the Government have begun to focus further education funding on training for people who are under 19 and certainly under 25? FE&#146;s traditional role to reskill people in their 30s, 40s and 50s after involuntary redundancy has been lost, and that will impact materially on the ability of those people to retrain and to get jobs in this difficult economic climate.</p>

All the increases have taken place in modern apprenticeships at level 2, which offer substantially less valuable employment opportunities.</p>

 I agree. I was going to make the point that level 2 does not really hack it, and that we need to provide apprenticeships at level 3. We must move people at level 2 to level 3 if we are to achieve gains in employability and the amount they can earn, which is increased by having better qualifications.</p>

I was a member of the Modernisation Committee, and I am a strong supporter of topical debates. However, they depend on the Leader of the House choosing a topic that the House wants to discuss and considers topical. The Minister should report back to the Leader of the House on today&#146;s feeble attendance. Work and skills was a subject that Labour Members used to debate the whole time, particularly when the economy was doing better and the labour market was stronger. Today, to have literally one Government Member giving a speech, when the Leader of the House herself  <br>

chose the subject, is not good enough, and it will lead to topical debates dying out if things carry on like this. The Minister may like that idea, but I do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08102334000386">I have followed the labour market a good deal over the years: I served on the Employment Committee, I was Conservative spokesman on the subject, and so on. Earlier this year, I was concerned that the quarterly survey published by the recruitment industry showed that the industry was robust in finding short-term positions for people, but that permanent positions were proving hard to fill. That is often a precursor of a recession: companies across the country are not prepared to make the commitment to the long-term employment for staff. Recent figures show that the claimant count has increased by 31,800, and the labour force survey showed an increase in unemployment of 164,000. The projections from the think-tanks are alarming. Yesterday, the chief economist of the Social Market Foundation gave evidence to the Select Committee on Work and Pensions and said that his estimate was that long-term unemployment, which is just under 150,000, would quadruple over the next couple of years to 600,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000387">Recently, the Ernst &amp;Young ITEM club produced a survey on the overall scale of unemployment, both short and long-term, and suggested that the claimant count would double. Against that background, the Government must review their policies on employability practices. I wrote a pamphlet about trying to audit the new deal in 2004 entitled &#147;Auditing the New Deal: What Figures for the Future?&#148;, in which I made the point&#151;and I think that many people agreed&#151;that providers of the new deal made quite a bit of money on the back of the general improvement in the labour market. The labour market expanded and, yes, people found jobs, but no one who looked at the issue seriously was of the view that many of those jobs were the result of someone having a new deal interview. When the Government hit their target of 250,000 young people going into employment, the National Audit Office produced a report saying that only about 8,000 of that total would not have found work anyway. Of course, 8,000 is something, but it is nothing like what was being claimed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08102334000388">The Minister should accept as part of his new responsibilities that the new deal was a policy that appeared to work well when the wind was behind it, the labour market was expanding and all was set fair. Now that we are in a situation in which it appears that the opposite is going to happen and that there will be a contraction in the labour market, the Government must look again at their capacity to deal with unemployment and how they will deal with the longer-term unemployed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08102334000389">It is often said that there are many vacancies in the economy. It is true that there are about 575,000 vacancies in our economy, but in 2004 there were almost 1 million. The last time we had a major recession was in 1990-91 and, in that recession, the number of vacancies halved and unemployment rose sharply. If, as seems to be the case, we are to have a major recession, all sorts of assumptions that the Government have been making about a flexible new deal must be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08102334000390">In my pamphlet, I suggested that we needed to focus the effort on the people who had genuine barriers to employment and tailor the packages to their needs. There should be an early triage to find out what the problems are&#151;the person may be an alcoholic, may be unable to read and write, or may have one of the other  <br>

classic barriers to employment&#151;and to offer them without delay a tailored package probably provided by the private sector or the not-for-profit sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08102334000391">I pointed to the evidence in America, which was very promising. Since then, as has been said, there have been reports about the Wisconsin experience, which has been remarkable. By means of tailored packages, the claimant count there has been reduced by 80 per cent. in three years. That is a tremendous achievement. Such focused approaches are the right way forward. Although it does not go as far as I would like&#151;it does not have the triage and there are faults with it&#151;the flexible new deal is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08102334000392">However, all the prime contractors who are waiting for the Government&#146;s decision next February have been assuming that the labour market would be roughly what it had been. The Government are producing performance targets that the prime contractors are supposed to aim at. Those targets do not assume that we will have a quadrupling of long-term unemployment. If we do, the prime contractors will have a number of problems. First, do they have the capacity to cope with 600,000 rather than about 150,000 unemployed? That is a massively higher number. Secondly, the flexible new deal is outcome-based, so the payments are back-loaded. That means that the prime contractors are taking on substantial risk while the individuals receive advice, their tailored packages, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08102334000393">It is one thing to take a risk on 100,000 people; it is quite another to take a risk on 600,000. The capital needed to be able to do that would be substantial. As the Minister is starting afresh in his role, will he have a serious look at whether the model will work in the world of employment that we are entering, or whether it is necessary for the Government to think again about how they underpin the flexible new deal to ensure that the capacity exists?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000394">It is all very well speaking about prime contractors, but others are involved. There are the subcontractors&#151;good-hearted charities, voluntary bodies and not-for-profit providers who desperately want to help people with social and medical problems. There are the individuals themselves. Some of the most vulnerable people in our society are in that category of the long-term unemployed. For the sake of the small subcontractors&#151;the good people who want to do good works&#151;and the individuals and for the sake of the overall financial model, will the Minister examine that model carefully to ensure that it is robust?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08102334000395">The flexible new deal is a much better model than the old new deal, which was about box-ticking and taking credit for the rise in the jobs market. It would be a pity if one looked back at the improvement in what is being done and considered it a failure because the background had changed at a crucial time.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the factors that the Minister should consider in dealing with the risk that my hon. Friend is describing is that any contractor should have a substantial capital cushion? Contractors must have a big enough balance sheet to be able to absorb the risks of the economic cycle and to ride out the ups and downs. It may also be necessary for the Government to consider differential payments in the case of those who are hardest to help and furthest from the job market. Success in getting someone like  <br>

 Not at all. It is good that we are thinking along the same lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000400">With reference to the winner&#146;s curse, if it is simply a matter of quoting the lowest price, there is the risk that the contractor who gets the job may not be robust enough or have enough capital to provide the service in difficult times. If the figure of 600,000 long-term unemployed is realistic and those people cannot be placed in employment because long-term unemployment is rising and the general background is poor, the financial risk could be significant. My hon. Friend made the point more succinctly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000401">Some of those with barriers to employment need a great deal of help. They are people with substance abuse problems, people with a history of back trouble, which can be expensive to cure, and people who have mental health problems and a range of other difficulties. It is necessary to make sure that the rewards for getting those people into work are high enough to ensure that that happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000402">The evidence from Australia is that the people nearest the labour market were finding work&#151;being pushed across the line&#151;rather than those who were the hardest to help, where the benefit to society would be greatest and the premium should be adequate. There is a case for having a tariff for getting into work the hardest to help, and that tariff should take account of the four or five main conditions that people with barriers to employment have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000403">Finally, I shall say a word about skills, if I may do so without trespassing on the good will of the House. My first point is about literacy and numeracy, a topic on which I spoke recently during the Committee stage of the Education and Skills Bill. It is true that it is much more difficult to get a job if one cannot read, write and add up properly. It is at least 12 per cent. more difficult for people in that tier to get a job and their earnings are lower. Functional illiteracy is often associated with a household that is deprived, with poor health and with a household where the head of the household is an unskilled worker who is also often unable to read and write. The problem is thus generational, leading to a cycle of deprivation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o224"><a name="08102334000404"><a name="81023-0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="08102334001020"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying about children from illiterate households who cannot read. Has he seen the recent television coverage of the use of phonics to get those children reading, and what wonderful results were achieved?</p>

 That is exactly the point. I have a very good special school in my constituency, Woolgrove, which takes youngsters who one might think would never learn to read, but they do. It is because the school uses methods such as synthetic phonics. If a child with  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2008">

such obstacles can be taught to read using synthetic phonics, it is madness not to provide the same service to people who do not have those special barriers. Yes, let us make sure that we use synthetic phonics and teach our young people to read.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000406">Although we welcome the fact that the Minister and his colleagues are trying to rescue those who did not learn to read at school and bring them back, it should never have got to that point. The problem should have been solved when the youngsters were seven or six, not when they are 17, 18, 25 or much older. I applaud the fact that the Government are trying to rescue the situation, but things should never have gone that far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08102334000407">My second point is about level 2 qualifications. According to all the research, graduates are likely to earn 71 per cent. more than those with no qualifications; the figure is 50 per cent. more for those with two good A-levels or an apprenticeship at level 3. Level 2 qualifications, however, do not give a gain, yet a lot of the Government&#146;s effort is going into level 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000408">The Minister has a difficult job at a difficult time, but let us try to get things right. The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) made the point that other countries are rigorous about apprenticeships and professional qualifications of that sort and that people there are taught at level 3. If, as Ministers say, an educational ladder of opportunity has to be climbed&#151;and Leitch did say that beyond 2020 there would be very few jobs for people without qualifications&#151;it is not good enough to teach people something; they have to get to a level that is higher than the one there used to be. The Government accept that, but level 2 is not the answer. Level 3 is what we should aim for. A topical debate on an important subject is the sort of debate that we should be having, but it is a pity that more Members have not been here.</p>

 I want to pick up on the skills aspect, about which my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) has been talking.

Those skills are not required only for the current project, which has a finite life; they are also required as a major part of skills export from the UK to the fusion projects throughout the world in the coming years, in which engineering expertise at Culham will play a major part for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000412">What is at stake in getting the skills mix right is the international competitiveness of that whole arc of science and technology in an area that is genuinely world class and cutting edge. Taking forward the skills agenda on the ground is therefore causing considerable local concern, which is caused principally by the lack of flexibility in delivering the skills agenda on the ground and ensuring that it matches skills training with local requirements. The consistent complaints that I get from organisations across the board, in both the private and public sectors, is that Jobcentre Plus, the Learning and Skills Council and programmes such as Train to Gain are far too driven by top-down national policy and fail to give enough recognition to huge local variations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="81023-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000413">Let me give an example of such a variation in the context of Train to Gain. My constituency lies in a county that has very few benefit claimants of working age; the number is half the national average and lower even than that of the rest of the south-east. Claimants for jobseeker allowances account for less than 1 per cent. Some 84 per cent. of employment is at the top end, much of it in the service sector. Some 70 per cent. of adults of working age already have a level 2 qualification, and almost 84 per cent. have a level 1 qualification. That leaves 7 per cent. with no qualification at all, and it is right that skills programmes should address that 7 per cent., who are already a major feature of a considerable amount of co-ordinated local activity from a number of organisations in the public and private sectors.</p>

I receive complaints that the parachuting in of Train to Gain is more about achieving a uniform approach than about recognising the need for that flexibility. Further education colleges have expressed concern that the constraints on training have been too great. Initially, the colleges welcomed the prospect of those constraints being relaxed and of the &#163;350 million announced in the recent ministerial statement. However, as time goes on they are getting more and more suspicious that that is taking their eye off the need for front-line skills, which are suffering in comparison with back-office skills.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the issue is not only about recognising the local skills  needs of the employers in a particular area, important though that is?

Personally, I think that it is useful if those partnerships are led by businesses providing practical input right from the top. However, participating businesses are concerned that they will, in any case, ultimately fall foul of Government micro-management of the whole process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08102334000428">There are four main concerns. First, the market is too complex and confusing for those seeking training and for employers. Secondly, Train to Gain is poorly understood. Thirdly, there are fears that the demise of the LSC will lead to a multiplicity of quangos and further complications in the market. Fourthly, there are practical concerns about diplomas and the relationships to other legislation. The stories about building trade students not being allowed on to building sites until the age of 16 for health and safety reasons are not apocryphal. Training should not be theoretical in these circumstances; it should be practically based and experienced on site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000429">A number of hon. Members have mentioned the need for more apprenticeships. There is huge enthusiasm for apprenticeships, and it runs very wide. My own county council, of which I am still a member, has some 50 apprentices in fields from social care to civil engineering. Large companies in the area are enthusiastic about apprenticeships, but so too are local small and medium-sized businesses. When I recently visited Henley college, which provides training in these areas, people were effusive in their praise for the commitment of small and medium-sized enterprises to training and employment, not only in providing apprenticeships but beyond apprenticeships. I urge the Government to consider introducing further flexibility in this context.</p>

fair contributions. It is important to return to my little faux pas about my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett), because my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) is both right and wrong. Yes, of course, given the public funding and the need for money to go where we can exact the best return, we must concentrate on areas where the lack of skills is at its greatest. However, I do not accept that areas such as Henley, which we have just heard about, can almost be left alone. The regional contribution of each and every area, whatever its starting base, is hugely important for our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08102334000436">Wherever we are going in the current economic downturn, its impact could be desperately disparate and different in various areas, and the relativity of its impact could be very important. For example, on the latest figures, the most significant increases in the claimant count were in the south-east and south-west, albeit from a low base relative to other areas&#151;but that does not mean that we should not be doing all that we can, as flexibly as we can, for the south-east and the south-west. The lowest increase was in London&#151;5 per cent. as opposed to about 30 per cent. in the south-east and south-west&#151;but we know that there is a huge quantum of unemployed in London because of the nature of its labour market. The National Economic Council, the regional economic structures and the Council of Regional Ministers should be pushing back up to the national level the immediate concerns and fine-grained nuances of each and every labour market in terms of jobs lost, vacancies and skills shortages. Those points were well made, and I will try to ensure that that occurs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08102334000437">As the hon. Member for Henley said, that granularity in getting closer to what is going on in localised labour markets will be one result of moving down from the Learning and Skills Council to local strategic partnerships. What local employment partnerships have done, where they have been successful&#151;nearly 50,000 jobs have been secured through that process&#151;is another aspect of his point about having fine-tuning and sensitivity to what is occurring in local labour markets. That needs to happen at any time, but in a period of downturn, significant or otherwise, it needs to happen all the more. I also take his points about practicality and about having greater flexibility in matters such as Train to Gain.</p>

Member for Rochdale, I point out that the announcement on the &#163;350 million was made yesterday, principally in the other place, but my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury spent an hour here elaborating on it. If the hon. Gentleman reads <i> Hansard</i> and still needs greater detail, I will happily provide it for him. This is partly to do with a sharper focus on getting from level 2 to level 3 as well as other refocusing in terms of Train to Gain. More details on how to achieve that will be elaborated on in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000439">I do not take so seriously the comments that were rather cavalier with recent history. For the record, since 1997 long-term claimant unemployment has fallen by more than three quarters and is close to its lowest level for 30 years. Let us have the debate about nuances and trends, but not by undermining what has gone before. It is easy to assert that there are more unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds now than in 1997, but youth claimant  <br>

Member for Hertsmere said, is not necessarily the claimant count, nor even the International Labour Organisation figures, but the number of people who remain in a workless state or entirely economically inactive. We are trying to address those individuals, not least by introducing the employment and support allowance on Monday, enabling us to go through the various incapacity benefits available to individuals to replace them with one allowance, for precisely the reasons the hon. Gentleman suggests, so that no one is left behind. Those in that category who do want to work&#151;I fully accept that there are plenty, some of whom we are not getting to as rigorously as we should&#151;should be helped in that fashion. That will aid with regard to simplicity, as well.</p>

 The Minister was making a point about flexibility, which I think is important. Six months ago, I encountered a case in which someone wanted to train to be a driving instructor. There was a cost for the relevant course, but Jobcentre Plus said that he was not eligible. I hope that we will look at the criteria that are used, because that course would have got him a job, but he was not eligible. Will the Minister look into such cases?</p>

 If the hon.

I take his broader point about things being done as early as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000443">There are some pilots under way that deal with hon.

We are looking at developing further all aspects of the integrated employment and skills service for people including skills screening&#151;I almost said silk screening; that is obviously a subset of skills screening&#151;for new claimants, skills health checks and skills accounts, and hopefully we will be able to implement those further to bring the needs of individuals and employers and that backdrop of analysis of a local area together far more readily. Whatever the shortages, even in areas as relatively affluent as Henley, the industries described by the hon. Member for Henley are important, and we need them to be performing as expertly as possible, and with as much capacity as possible, for the wider economy.</p>

well made, and it was a theme of our debate. Getting people back into work in a sustainable fashion is better than having a sort of merry-go-round, and being able to sustain apprentices in the small business sector is central to the experience and reward that individuals can get out of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000446">That is why much of the &#163;350 million refocus will be on the small and medium sector, as everyone knows. We are trying to concentrate on small businesses&#151;a sector that may suffer more from the lack of skills and lack of speed in reskilling the local labour market. By doing that alongside the other fiscal things we are doing, we will try to sustain those small businesses. Much of the Government&#146;s focus over coming weeks and months will be all that I have described regarding the route from unemployment back into employment, but it will also be about wider fiscal interventions to ensure that jobs do not go in the first place, which is very much part of the equation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000447">I take seriously the point of the hon. Member for Hertsmere about worklessness and lack of economic activity. We take seriously the focus on small businesses, and the point about being as local as possible, using intelligence and understanding the nuances in regional and sub-regional labour markets. That all relates to the point I made in my opening remarks about geographical and sectoral concentration of jobs and skills. As with the wider fiscal picture, in this area of all areas, within the context of the progress made thus far in periods of relative prosperity, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, we had better make sure that there is a flexibility to the new deal and everything else that the Jobcentre Plus network offers in periods of less than clement weather, if I can use that phrase. That will be the test. I sincerely think, based on what I have known as a constituency MP and as a Minister, that the Jobcentre Plus network is up to that test, as is the wider system, if the points about simplicity, local focus, flexibility and practicality are allowed to permeate the system during a period of economic downturn.</p>

 Does the Minister accept that the changed circumstances we are seeing are a bit of a shock to the system? It was not expected that we would necessarily be going into recession at this time. A lot of the plans for job centres are based on the idea that things were going to be ticking along as normal and that it would be possible to cut out waste and so on, and to have a little less capacity. Does he accept that we might need more capacity, not less?</p>

Since our last debate, the Government have managed to achieve the impossible through the incredible, with their lifeline to the banks. The impossible achievement has been to dwarf the scale of public money encompassed by the reports in today&#146;s motion. In this debate last year, I was able to recite in a single sentence a list of public spending projects amounting to more than &#163;60 billion. In the last month, some &#163;500 billion has been pledged in an attempt to crack the ice covering our frozen financial system. Incredibly, the word &#147;nationalisation&#148; has re-entered the Government lexicon as the taxpayer now seems likely to own substantial swathes of our once mighty mortgage providers.</p>

For the sake of those of our constituents whose savings are locked in Icelandic banks, including &#163;7 million from West Lindsey district council, I can only hope it was not the same Treasury team who took four months to produce the Government&#146;s response to our tax credits report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000455">Of course, the sobering events of recent weeks are not the subject of today&#146;s motion. However, the House may be interested to know that I have spoken with the Comptroller and Auditor General about the audit of the &#163;37 billion that the Government are injecting into the banks, which is supported by the recapitalisation scheme. He is proposing to examine whether the Treasury has been able to secure compliance with the specific commitments that the banks are making to maintain lending to homeowners and small businesses; to help people stay in their homes; and to meet the criteria that the Treasury has laid down for senior executive remuneration. He will consider those matters. Alongside those issues, he will want to consider whether the wider strategic interest in strengthening the business performance of the banks has been met, thus also protecting the value of the taxpayer's investment. The Comptroller and Auditor General is expecting to report once we have seen sufficient evidence of the Treasury&#146;s progress towards those important objectives. No doubt, our Committee will wish to keep the implications for taxpayers under careful review following any National Audit Office report.</p>

The temptation, as with the former nationalised industries, will be to impose extraneous requirements of pay, employment, backing winners and artificial lending priorities, which will hinder rather than help the banks&#146; return to financial health.

about the fact that we&#151;the public&#151;own the banks and that they must therefore take a more public-spirited view when people fall behind with their mortgage payments. That is fair enough, but let us remember that the investments are taxpayer funded, and that the taxpayer is entitled to expect enhanced value, realised through an early return to the private sector. I am sure that that is the Treasury&#146;s view, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000457">The glacial storm that is creeping over the economy should give all Members who consider the Committee&#146;s reports cause for cold, hard reflection. As economic prospects hardened a year ago, the comprehensive spending review stemmed the flood of gold that had previously rushed in&#151;and out&#151;of spending Departments. Now, with the flow of taxpayers&#146; funds diverted to the City, and the onset of an economic winter of uncertain harshness and duration, the constraints on Departments are likely to be tighter still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000458">In our previous debate on the matter, I noted that the narrowed ideological gap between the major political parties placed the efficient delivery of public services&#151;and hence our Committee&#146;s work&#151;at the heart of the political debate. That is even more true today, for a moral imperative now embraces that political importance. Taxpayers facing difficult times have no more to give. Citizens in need will rely on public services to help them through in difficult times. A Government who rely on borrowing can afford no costly public expenditure failures. The duty of all public servants is therefore clear, vital and personal. It is to stretch every pound and squander none. That is where our Committee comes into the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000459">The Committee&#146;s reports offer prescriptions from which, I believe, public servants can learn, and I want to emphasise today three themes that have a wider resonance. Sound financial management is paramount, reducing internal costs is essential and&#151;perhaps most important and pertinent&#151;understanding risk is critical if projects are to end on the right side of the dividing line between successful delivery and disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="81023-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08102334000460">Departments need to display strong financial management if they are to withstand the slings and arrows of changing economic conditions and deliver cost-effective public services. They need the requisite finance skills, commercial acumen, the right information and leaders who emphasise that money matters. I welcome the increasing priority that is given to professional finance skills. We are delighted to say&#151;because it reflects a long-running campaign by the Committee&#151;that all but two major Departments now have a professionally qualified finance director. Those appointments have brought new focus to financial management in Departments.</p>

Many permanent secretaries are the accounting officers who appear before our Committee, yet they have not a single financial qualification between them. They are not automatically held to account in the civil service for their management of resources. It cannot, therefore, be a surprise that so much remains to be done to embed in Departments a culture that money matters. A worrying lack of financial skills and awareness remains among non-finance staff. Budgetary control is hampered by inaccurate forecasting, and the quality of financial information needs significant improvement. If Departments  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08102334000462">To support better financial management, the National Audit Office has embarked on a series of reports that examine each Department&#146;s financial management. For example, in the past two years, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has budgeted to spend more than its Treasury funding limits. As the risk of overspending became clear, it had to make cuts, but there are also things to welcome. DEFRA has established more rigorous financial systems and this year&#146;s accounts were delivered much earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000463">Our system of public financial management relies on transparency and clear oversight. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Defence tried to persuade us that the forecast costs of major defence equipment projects were under control by moving &#163;1 billion to other defence budgets. Anyone with a passing familiarity with recent events understands that masking true cost is wrong and dangerous. I hope that the approach was unconnected to the fact that, despite initiative after initiative, lasting improvements in the delivery of vital equipment to our servicemen and women have yet to be achieved. Such creative reporting is the enemy of sound financial management and I do not believe that the Committee would want it repeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08102334000464">The Committee was also critical of aspects of the Ministry of Defence privatisation of QinetiQ. We recognise that the privatisation successfully protected the viability of that strategically important business and that the Ministry of Defence ran the 2006 flotation well. However, the NAO estimated that an extra &#163;90 million could have been raised from the initial 2003 privatisation. Despite the Department&#146;s protestations, it is clear that the sale went ahead at the worst possible time and that the Ministry of Defence weakened competition by eliminating bidders too early.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08102334000465">We were strong, too, in our condemnation of the conflicts of interest affecting QinetiQ&#146;s senior management, which the Ministry of Defence failed to manage during the sale process. Public servants should not be negotiating their own incentive schemes with a preferred bidder. The result of the privatisation was a clear disparity in rewards, which the Committee found scarcely credible: while the taxpayer received &#163;9 for every pound invested, QinetiQ&#146;s senior management received an extraordinary &#163;200.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08102334000466">Let us examine reducing internal costs. We all consider precious every additional pound that can be devoted to the front line and that does not have to come from increased taxes or raised borrowing. A year ago, the Government accompanied ambitious new efficiency targets with plans to sell &#163;30 billion of surplus assets by 2010-11. The Committee had to express scepticism over claimed efficiency gains in the past, so I welcome the news that the NAO will audit those savings on a Department-by-Department basis. However, setting savings targets is easier than delivering results. Accounting officers should cut waste, reduce complexity and seek economies in some obvious areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08102334000467">Property should be an immediate target. That is elementary stuff. The Government are almost 40 per cent. worse than the private sector benchmark for using office space, with a potential saving of more than &#163;320 million a year. I am pleased that the Office of Government Commerce has the ambition to seek savings  <br>

of &#163;1 billion a year, but it will need to do better than its performance against the two key milestones already missed. I trust that the Exchequer Secretary will look to her own house&#151;or her own office block&#151;given the Treasury&#146;s parlous position at the bottom of the league for efficient use of space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08102334000468">Another unrealised area for savings is using shared services. The Committee had strong doubts about the information on which the Cabinet Office&#146;s target of &#163;1.4 billion savings is based. Indeed, those Members present at the hearing will recall that the Cabinet Office had lost the calculations and the underlying data involved in its estimate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08102334000469">Reducing complexity in processes is another requirement for an efficient public sector. Nowhere is the financial impact of complexity felt more strongly than in the Department for Work and Pensions; nowhere, that is, except for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000470">Benefit fraud and error continue to be a major drain on taxpayers, with &#163;2.7 billion lost last year. I recognise the progress in reducing reported benefit fraud, but for customer and official error to have nearly doubled in the past five years to almost &#163;2 billion suggests that our benefits system is not merely complex, but risks becoming unmanageable. We have said time and again that, if we are to get a grip on fraud and error, we must reduce complexity in the benefits system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08102334000471">Meanwhile, our latest look at tax credits showed the highest rates of error and fraud in central Government. The annual amount may have reduced somewhat, but &#163;4.3 billion remained to be recovered from claimants. In our hearing, we expressed doubt about how much&#151;if any&#151;will be recovered. Nearly &#163;2 billion at least is in doubt. That level of error led the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualify his opinion on the HMRC trust statement for the sixth year running. Despite some improvements to the scheme, it is still not efficiently run. Everyone&#151;claimant and taxpayer&#151;has been let down. Let us hope that the pressure on families to pay back money that they have already spent does not make the coming economic winter coldest for those who can least afford it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000472">I come now to risk management. Sound financial management and reducing unnecessary administration are bedrocks to build on, as we have said again and again. It is the failure to manage risk that causes many project costs to soar and delivery to fail. The public sector must never be afraid to innovate or to take well managed risks. We never stand in the way of Departments doing that. Constant innovation is as essential to public sector success as it is to private sector success, but the consequences of inappropriate innovation and misunderstood risk have never been so powerfully obvious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000473">If there has, as yet, been no public sector equivalent of the weapons of mass financial destruction that have unleashed such devastation elsewhere, there remain too many examples for comfort of inadequate risk management in public sector projects. Government borrowing is at its highest for 60 years, so a sober look is surely needed at the risks of each new private finance initiative deal racking up debts for schools and hospitals. Those vital public services must remain both financially stable and operationally flexible. Knowledge and good health are too precious to put at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000474">Only this Tuesday, the London news programmes reported on how NHS trusts in London are now facing severe difficulties with their PFI projects for new hospitals. In conference after conference and in parliamentary questions I have queried the level of debt that the PFI is building up for our children and grandchildren. I have been constantly reassured by the Treasury and, indeed, by the National Audit Office that everything is fine. Listening to those London news reports about the increasing difficulty of London NHS trusts, however, I began to wonder whether my warnings had in fact been pertinent. Many others are worried about the level of debt building up through PFI projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000475">We saw inadequacies in risk management in the Foreign Office&#146;s approach to our liability for the 14 overseas territories; in our update report on the single payment scheme, which is still causing problems for farmers; and in the BBC. Perhaps it would help the corporation if the NAO were given full access to the books. We say that as often as the BBC repeats its programmes, so perhaps there is no point in going on saying it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000476">Failures to anticipate and manage risk were encapsulated in our report on the Bicester asylum accommodation project. Almost &#163;30 million was spent without delivering any benefit to the taxpayer or in any way furthering asylum policy. It was a controversial project, yet the Home Office did not recognise the serious risk of planning delay. Nor did it give explicit recognition to its own changes to the asylum system&#151;a classic case of the right and left hands expressing surprise at meeting each other in the same place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08102334000477">Let us hope that those in charge of a considerably larger project&#151;the 2012 Olympics, which has been in the news again this week&#151;proceed with a greater appreciation of the risks and a higher level of competence. I am sure that all Members present would like to congratulate our sportsmen and women in Beijing on their excellent performance. They finished fourth in the Olympic medal table and second in the Paralympic table four years ago. I was particularly pleased that our sailors who practise my own sport proved more successful than me in my recent damp experience in the Solent, where I managed to overturn my dinghy in a dead calm&#151;perhaps an allegory for some of our political careers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000478">Applying lessons to the Olympics from the management of risk in other public sector projects does not give one a wholehearted sense of comfort. There should be realistic assumptions about likely costs and realisable benefits. The estimate of the 2012 budget at the time of the bid&#151;at just over &#163;4 billion, although originally it was &#163;2 billion&#151;was clearly unrealistic in ignoring major factors such as contingency provision, tax obligations, policing and wider requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000479">The budget has now mushroomed to &#163;9.3 billion, while over-optimistic estimates of private sector funding have been scaled down from &#163;738 million to &#163;165 million today. Watch this space, as I am sure there might well be further reductions. With a revised budget, one could say that that is water under the bridge. My Committee welcomes the fact that the programme is broadly on track, but arrangements to manage the whole programme are not yet in place. We must guard against pressure to change venues and infrastructure and we must be quite clear about the costs and consequences of any such changes.</p>

We must not get too dazzled by the gold medals in Beijing. The PAC is not a tabloid; it is not bedazzled by gold medals, but works in the interest of the taxpayer. Instead, we need to see a plan for using sporting success at the games to improve levels of participation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000481">It is also important to have contingencies if matters take an unexpected course. To support medal goals, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport hopes to raise about &#163;100 million from the private sector. Perhaps the Minister can confirm today that there is still a realistic chance of raising that money, as we warned back in 2006 of the risks of leaving it too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000482">There must be a contingency plan for protecting the funds of the sports most likely to win medals in 2012, and the total final cost depends on proceeds arising from the disposal of assets such as the Olympic village after the games. In today&#146;s climate, that looks increasingly uncertain. Given these uncertainties, potential demands on the &#163;1 billion of contingency funds that have not yet been earmarked will need very careful monitoring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000483">Of course, no risk to any project can be effectively managed without accurate evidence. Departments are responsible for ensuring that Members of Parliament are not misled, even inadvertently, by the evidence they provide. We were therefore very concerned that the Department for Transport gave the Committee unreliable information on the rate of evasion of vehicle excise duty. We produced our report, drawing on its figure that the rate of evasion of duty by motorcyclists was 38 per cent. Yet shortly afterwards, new statistics for evasion, based on a new methodology, put the figure at 9.8 per cent. We expect Departments to be accurate; if they are not sure whether their figures are reliable, they should say so and, if necessary, apologise for any mistakes,  as I did.</p>

The commission has spent a lot of time on that and I think that it has it right. I look forward to the inclusion of the necessary legislative changes in the Constitutional Renewal Bill in the near future. In the meantime, I am pleased to say that the wheels are in motion to find a permanent successor to Mr. Burr.</p>

 It is a great privilege and pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). As Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, he does an excellent job, and he has just given the House a powerful and in-depth appreciation of our work. We have spent many hours covering the issues that he has managed to cover in about 20-odd minutes. For that, we are in his debt.</p>

It is because of their hard work and professionalism in support of its members that the PAC is held in such high regard&#151;and, of course, without the hard work and initiative of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the support of the National Audit Office, it would not be half as effective as it is. Without the National Audit Office, Parliament and our democracy would be the less, Governments would not be held to account, and public spending would lack the in-depth scrutiny that we are able to give it. Britain&#146;s National Audit Office is, I believe, the envy of parliamentarians around the world.</p>

The broad range of subjects that we investigate and the wide-ranging nature of our inquiries ensure that all Government Departments are open to examination. Echoing the words of our Chairman, the hon. Member for Gainsborough, I wish that the BBC&#151;although it is not a Government Department&#151;were part of that scrutiny. It is quite wrong, in my view, that a body that spends billions of pounds of public money is not open to the same scrutiny as any Government Department. It is the first to broadcast the news if anything goes wrong with any Department, while closing its own doors to detailed public scrutiny.</p>

Departments are incapable of learning lessons as a result of projects that go wrong. The two overriding impressions with which I am left after each session of the PAC are that when a project goes wrong no one takes responsibility, and that&#151;perhaps more important&#151;it rarely seems to occur to Departments to conduct a &#147;lessons learned&#148; exercise when a project goes wrong, or indeed right.</p>

I believe that the hon. Member for Gainsborough said that this was the sixth successive year in which a qualified opinion had been issued, and there is still very little evidence that the problems with the system are coming under control. Six years on, the situation remains the same: &#163;1 billion was overpaid in 2006-07, and &#163;4.3 billion remains to be recovered from claimants, some of it because of error and some because of fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para32"><a name="08102334000495">Time and again, the complexity of applying for tax credits and the lack of clarity in the information that is provided when someone submits a claim have been cited as major causes of the difficulties with the system. Indeed, the Committee&#146;s fifth report on tax credits states that many claimants struggle to understand them, and cannot understand why they have been overpaid either. There have been many complaints about the process for recovering overpayments, and the ombudsman continues to receive, and uphold, a large number of them; but only now is HMRC giving people support to help them to make their claims and avoid such problems. It is a little too late for families who may wish that they had never become involved in the tax credit system in the first place&#151;which is a great pity, because it has made a huge difference and benefited a great many families in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="81023-0011.htm_para33"><a name="08102334000496">Given those problems with HMRC and tax credits, we have to ask, &#147;Where are the lessons learned?&#148; I am convinced that the failure to learn lessons led to the outrageous situation in 2005 involving the European Union single payment scheme for farmers. The cost of implementing the scheme was budgeted at &#163;76 million, but in March 2006 it had reached &#163;122 million. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Rural Payments Agency had expected to reduce the agency&#146;s staff by 1,800 and to make efficiency savings of &#163;164 million by 2008-09, but difficulties in processing claims led to the recruitment of additional staff, and the scheme&#146;s implementation has now cost &#163;46 million more than the budget.</p>

to &#163;678 billion a year by 2010-11. That report also stated that six Departments, accounting for more than &#163;45 billion of Government expenditure, still did not have a professionally qualified finance director on their main board. The Chairman, the hon. Member for Gainsborough, has updated us, and that is now down to two Departments, so some progress has been made.

Almost 70 per cent. of Departments cited the level of skills of non-finance staff as one of the three most significant barriers to improving financial resource management across Government. One has to wonder whether this may be the reason why there have been so many commercial blunders. The Home Office spent &#163;29.1 million planning and designing the purpose-built accommodation centre for asylum seekers at Bicester, only for it to be cancelled. The enormous problems delivering the national programme for IT in the NHS, which will cost &#163;12.7 billion, arose because officials did not actually understand the limitations of the technology.

No one is ultimately responsible for any decision. Ministers may come and go and civil servants may move on, and the ownership of a project can change hands several times.

Senior staff have to take ownership of major projects and should bear the consequences if they go wrong. In that way, we will begin to reduce this awful waste of taxpayers&#146; money. The hon. Member for Gainsborough said that we must stretch every pound and squander none. I entirely agree. If that happens, perhaps future PAC hearings will be less of a blood sport.</p>

 In listening carefully to our revered Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)&#151;and I always listen to our revered Chairman carefully&#151;I noted that he made at least two important points. First, he laid out the systematic failures of public expenditure programmes. Secondly, he highlighted the huge new task that confronts us&#151;because, after all, we are now in a situation in which public expenditure is ballooning and Government expenditure is encompassing bailing out the whole financial system almost across the globe, and there is also a continued roll-out of private finance initiative projects, which will increasingly be the  <br>

way in which Government spend money. Tax revenues are, therefore, ever more precious, and effective targeting of public expenditure has never been more important, and waste has never been more unforgivable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000510">The Chairman has put forward sensible, important and strategic proposals for Government consideration, and he has done so in a wholly constructive spirit. I think we are a wholly constructive Committee. To be fair, at times the PAC has an attack-dog reputation, as was alluded to in the previous speech; it has a reputation for gratuitously roughing up senior civil servants, and especially those on large bonuses. However, the arrival of the hon. Members for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson) and Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths) and the right hon. Member for Streatham (Keith Hill) has changed that just a tad. We have possibly been a little slower to condemn key Government spending programmes&#151;or, possibly, they have&#151;or the way Governments deploy resources when they embark on spending programmes. However, this is not a battle between critics and defenders of programmes, or between optimists and pessimists, or at least that is not how I see it. Instead, the Committee is essentially evidence-led; we are interacting all the time with a massive resource, the National Audit Office, to which we are deeply indebted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08102334000511">I am not going to embark on a Cook&#146;s tour of all our reports in the past Session, but I would like to alight on some that have brought back many memories for me, and to highlight those that contain important messages. First, we had a raft of reports on taxation&#151;the evasion of vehicle excise duty and on tax credits and tax form reports. Significantly, they underline how much could be gained through an efficient tax system and how much could be lost through a grossly inefficient system, and therefore what great gain is to be had simply in getting it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000512">One interesting report, although not directly about taxation, was on managing risk in overseas territories. It turned over a stone that covered the vast and murky world of tax avoidance and tax evasion, which is a whole industry in places such as Bermuda, where I think there are about 80 per cent. of all hedge funds. We found that huge amounts of money were being moved around the world by companies that had connections with this country. Surely it is unacceptable that those corporate pirates&#151;the hedge funds&#151;can hide out there, free like the old-time pirates, to create havoc on the financial markets and to account to no one. Surely that must be tackled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000513">Another set of reports were about Government efficiency, and we examined Government property. We have recently heard, and moaned, about the culling of tax offices, which has certainly been an issue in my constituency and something about which I have strong views. When surveying it, I felt that we were unable to judge the real gains, and we are unable to do so now as the programme unfolds. I am not sure whether anybody is in a position to judge the real gains in property, because so much has already been leased under commercially confidential private finance initiative arrangements. We simply do not know what those are worth or the result of surrendering the leases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000514">We examined the NHS. We will all recall the issue that arose a year or so ago concerning the NHS being overdrawn or in the red. We examined its return to balance and agreed that it was a wholly good thing, and  <br>

we awarded congratulations where they were due. I must say that I personally baulked at the spectacle of the north-west subsidising London, as it appeared to do according to the accounts that I looked at, and at times I found it hard to distinguish true efficiency gains from creative accountancy or simply the same money being accounted for in different ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000515">Most poignantly, we examined the plight of neonatal babies and the variations in their fortunes across the nation. We all had to accept that that was not directly a function of NHS spending but due to wider intractable problems, public health issues and so on. It is an incredibly difficult problem to tackle but modest progress is being made, and we were all grateful to see that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000516">Something that stuck in my mind, and about which I was reminded by the question that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) asked at Prime Minister&#146;s questions yesterday, was our report on people leaving the services. We concentrated particularly on the less qualified individual&#151;not the lieutenant but the private, the squaddie leaving the services. It seems to me there is a problem that demands immediate attention but that genuinely can be rectified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08102334000517">We established that too many young men who join the infantry, often as a path to personal salvation and often with problems and a relatively deficient educational background, pass through the Army and eventually end up on the streets, sometimes unhoused, usually untrained for civilian life and certainly woefully unprepared. That was vividly illustrated in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question yesterday, when he pointed out that 10 per cent. of the prison population have been through the services. There must surely be something that the Army, the services or somebody can do about that. We cannot let that situation continue. We have to do more for those people when they join, when they serve and when they leave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000518">I close my remarks by suggesting where the PAC and the NAO may wish to go next, following the progress that we have made over the past term. Following our inquiry into pathfinders and housing regeneration, there is a genuine need to look into the targeting and efficiency of the whole regeneration budget and the various budgets that constitute regeneration. We have to challenge the assumption that the process is always meritorious and that all the money is well spent. My belief is that much is, in fact, being wasted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000519">Following the QinetiQ inquiry, we need to look into the whole issue of remuneration in the higher reaches of the civil service, the bonus culture that has grown almost without our noticing, and the transfer of top people to and from Whitehall and the conflicts that that might involve. Such an inquiry would be deeply unpopular in many circles, but I believe that it has to be done and is long overdue. Also, probably, in the overdue category is the need to remove the bad odour hanging over defence contracting and commissioning with overseas states, including, dare I say it, Saudi Arabia. We perhaps need to take a close look at recent contracts, rather than raking over the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="81023-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000520">Finally, I turn to a point that we have not dealt with at all in the two previous Sessions. We need to examine public value in our railways: the stewardship of Network Rail, which is a bone of contention in this House; the quasi-monopolies of the rolling stock leasing companies, or ROSCOs; and the Department for Tranport&#146;s role in the whole kaleidoscope of interactions that make up  <br>

When I first starting asking what proportion of principal finance officers&#151;finance directors, as they are now called&#151;in Departments have an accountancy qualification, the answer was 23 per cent. The Treasury recently told us that the answer is now 91 per cent, and although that figure excludes the big exception of the Ministry of Defence&#146;s finance director, who is in charge of &#163;32 billion of expenditure, enormous progress has been made. I congratulate the Treasury and other Departments on starting to realise that the topic is important and that they have to do something about it. The progress should not go unremarked; the Treasury has understood the importance of the matter.</p>

At the moment, it is unable to do so&#151;it has not been able to do so for several years. I hope that we will be told when the Treasury expects the Comptroller and Auditor General to be able to sign off HMRC&#146;s accounts as clean, because it is only right that what is good for other Departments should be good for the Treasury and its subsidiary departments.</p>

claimed that EDS should pay it &#163;209 million, but that was later cut to an agreed settlement figure of &#163;71 million. Only about &#163;44 million of that was paid in cash or near cash; the remainder, &#163;26.5 million, was to come from future revenues on contracts that EDS had not yet won with government. In other words, it is to come from future business. Apart from the fact that that gave Government Departments a rather strong incentive to award EDS further business despite, rather than because of, its track record, it has been clear that over the past two and half to three years since the agreement was reached hardly any money has been paid. Most of the &#163;26.5 million is still unpaid; a few hundreds of thousands have been paid and there was one payment of &#163;20,000. The chairman of HMRC for the time being knows that every time he comes before the Committee&#151;unfortunately, I was abroad when he came before us last time, in early October&#151;I shall ask him how much money he has had. He always comes prepared with the answer. Indeed, his distinguished predecessor Paul Gray, who honourably resigned over the issue of the missing discs, said that he would have been most disappointed had the question not been asked. I will continue to ask the question.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who brings me to the point that I was about to make, which is that the various representatives of HMRC have made it very clear that they have been documenting millions of pages of material relating to the case so that they can, if necessary, litigate. But they really ought not to have to. It is in the nature of large-scale computer contracts that they hardly ever go to litigation because, at the end of the day, the only people who win are the lawyers.

It is probably a bit less than that now, but the principle still applies. No safeguards were put in place. The permanent under-secretary, Bill Jeffrey, made it clear to us that there were no safeguards. The Treasury must revisit the whole issue of QinetiQ and make sure that in any future transactions of that kind, better safeguards are put in place. Many of our constituents are very angry about it and many parliamentary colleagues were very angry about the fact that such a transaction was allowed to occur.</p>

I have read in detail the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report on the whole fiasco and he did have a lot of responsibility.

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000537">I find it extraordinary that an agency with the title of the Rural Payments Agency had the job of making payments but was unable to tell farmers either the date when they would get their payments or how much they had already been paid. I once worked out the number of payments per employee of the agency, and I think that it was 29. The employees could have been sent out to the farms, with a day for travel there, a day on the farm and a day for travel back, and the whole thing could still have been done and dusted in three months if the payments had been made by personal visit and manually. If people phone their banks, they can find out if they have received a payment and for how much, but that so-called payments agency was unable to provide those figures, which speaks eloquently of the scale of its failure.</p>

Two years ago it had been running for four years and was four years late, so little change there. There has been a development since we last had a chance to discuss it&#151;the withdrawal of one of the major contractors, Fujitsu. Baroness Thornton described its departure in the other place as &#147;a sign of strength&#148;, which is an interesting way to put it. Essentially, Fujitsu was prepared to fulfil the terms of its contract, but the Government have said that they would rather keep the project money than have that happen, thus risking a &#163;700 million lawsuit, which&#151;according to the press&#151;Fujitsu is now threatening.

 I shall begin by offering my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and members of his Committee for the work that they do.

That is an area in which I have some practical responsibility, in that I had political responsibility for delivering a shared services centre in a large local authority. As I am a committed decentraliser, the centralisation inherent within shared services was something of a bitter pill to swallow, but the potential from shared services is so enormous that it is difficult to ignore.</p>

They have become much more sophisticated, so they are no longer about the centralisation of everything in one place but about a number of different shared services that can work in parallel, supporting each other in partnerships or through federated solutions that deliver more of the benefits without creating the centralised monster that these things can become.</p>

can be measured in a number of ways, not just in cost savings. This is a chance to avoid and remove duplication and to simplify processes, but, most of all, the implementation of shared services, if delivered in the right way, can be a fundamental tool in achieving culture change within an organisation and sweeping away a wasteful and bureaucratic culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000548">I would be interested to hear comments on a few lessons that I took on board from my experience. First, the key to success is to have not only a strong business case but a superb level of detail up front in the implementation plan. It is not just about the practicalities of buildings and technology. Any organisation will find that multi-tasking means that bits of jobs are here and there. It is not unusual for somebody in finance, for example, to spend 40 per cent. of their time on finance and 60 per cent. of their time on something else. That is quite difficult to accommodate within the concept and model of a shared services centre, but unless that is done, the opportunity is missed not only to centralise the 40 per cent. that is devoted to the finance function but to challenge the viability of the remaining 60 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000549">Secondly, it is absolutely essential to have a clear timeline, detailed financial information and an idea of exactly where the savings will come from. My experience is that that will change as the project advances, but unless one knows where one is at the start&#151;or at least where one wants to be&#151;it all ends up in an awful mess. I understand that a number of attempts at setting up shared service centres have already fallen foul of that. It is right to insist on detailed project plans and to measure progress frequently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000550">Thirdly, it is important not to be too ambitious. Most Government Departments could do with setting up a shared service centre just for that Department first, before the Government try to take an interdepartmental approach. If they try to extend too quickly, that will lead to problems because of the differences in culture&#151;even fairly small ones&#151;between different Departments. In the case of the shared services centre that I set up for my county council, for example, we refused from the beginning to follow the Government&#146;s advice to try to do it in one go by bringing in district councils, the police authority and whatever else. The differences in culture would have meant that that would have been too difficult and would have upset the financial business case. I would have been happy to consider doing that in the future, and I hope that those still involved in the project would be happy to do so, but it has to be done incrementally, so that people can be absolutely sure of the costs and the savings that arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000551">Fourthly, the project cannot be divorced from a hearts-and-minds initiative. As I mentioned earlier, this is about major cultural change. In my experience, one of the biggest bits of cultural change was driving home the idea of the internal customer and of the needs of that customer. There are huge penalties and risks of failure if that point is not taken on board, and the IT requirements got right, from day one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08102334000552">My fifth point is that is essential to have a separate governance structure that includes customers and simple service agreements. Such a structure ensures that customers have a stake in the shared services centre, and it also helps to secure efficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000553">Finally, it is very important that someone from the commercial sector outside Whitehall is hired to run any shared services centre that is being set up. If a centre is not run on proper commercial lines, the risk is that it will fall back into the bureaucracy from which it came.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000554">The second report to which I want to allude, somewhat more briefly, is entitled &#147;Ministry of Defence: Leaving the Services&#148;. The reputation of RAF Benson in my constituency is that it is extremely good at looking after the human resources needs of its personnel, but I am concerned about the effect that leaving the services can have on a range of health and family issues, as well as employment. That is why, in 2009&#151;I hope in association with the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen Families Association and the Royal British Legion&#151;I shall be running surgeries on the base to fill in some of the gaps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000555">I took a look at the interview form that is completed for early service leavers, and it is not the most personal form that I have ever come across. As far as I could see, there is only one small box for additional personal information, with most of the rest of the form being concerned with handing people on as quickly as possible to other organisations, and to the jobcentre in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000556">I am aware that the National Audit Office found in 2007 that services for early service leavers were inconsistent, and I hope that the Minister can reassure me that there is some measurement of whether that consistency is being put into the system. It is important that early service leavers in my constituency and elsewhere have access to consistent services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000557">In addition, I should like the services to be joined up more with the services offered by local government, especially in relation to homelessness. Early service leavers are referred to a list of places, but the interview form does not seem to include any element that relates to passing them on to local government. Therefore, I was not surprised that many people responded to surveys asking for an evaluation of the resettlement packages by saying that they were not useful to their needs. I urge the Government to come forward with firmer proposals in that respect.</p>

 I should like to begin by saying how much sheer pleasure I get from being a member of the PAC. I am very enthusiastic about it, and consider it the most interesting Committee appointment that I have ever had. The work that we do is an enormous source of satisfaction, covering as it does a wide spread of interest and subjects, and I compliment the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) on his skilled chairmanship, despite the many divergent views among members. Moreover, our Chairman always makes a very pointed and effective introduction to our sittings. The fact that he steals most of the questions that I would want to ask in my interrogations is purely incidental, because I suppose that that is his job. It has also been a pleasure to work with members of the Committee. The hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), who is modestly exiting the Chamber before I can pay him any compliments, is one of the most effective questioners and financial analysts with whom I have ever worked.

the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) brings to Committee a whole sheet of detailed questions, written on yellow paper in red ink. My correspondence is normally in green ink, as he will appreciate. His effective questioning of officials and Departments has been an inspiration. It is a pleasure to work on the Committee with those people. It is marvellous training or preparation for a ministerial job that I shall never have. It has been wasted on me; it came at the wrong stage in my career.</p>

 Well, revolutions might happen, and we are all socialists now, so I have not altogether given up hope. I am very well trained, thanks to the Committee and to the hon. Member for Gainsborough. I want to make that clear, because it is such an effective Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000561">I now want to express one or two reservations about problems. In some&#151;or most&#151;senses, our reports do not make the impact that they should. It is a confusing situation; a National Audit Office report comes out, and usually hits the headlines, and some months later, the Committee produces a report saying much the same thing. People are not sure who is saying what. The impact is dulled because the reports come out in two stages. We do not follow up on our reports effectively enough; that is a failure on our part. On the Table we can see a pile of our reports. We are a very hard-worked Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000562">The Committee Clerks ring us up individually and ask us whether we want to do a radio or television interview about this, that or the other. I remember dealing with an unnecessary, expensive detention centre that had been built in the countryside around Oxford somewhere. I unearthed the fact that there were no security arrangements, as it had been built in that place because there was no bus service. Anyone escaping could not get a bus to the station to make their getaway. That was an extraordinary fact. Having revealed it in the course of the Committee&#146;s inquiries, I was asked to make a statement, but there was not time, and I could not do it adequately. We need a press office attached to the Committee to make sure that our reports have the impact that they deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000563">The fact that our reports do not have the impact that they deserve is indicated by the attendance at today&#146;s debate. There is dynamite in many of those reports. It is red meat that the Opposition should be devouring; they should be mobilising to use it against the Government. The left in the Labour party should be using it to further their views about the efficiency of Government spending, yet it goes unnoticed. The reports sit there on the Table, we briefly mention them, and then they are forgotten. The lack of interest in our reports and the lack of effort that we make to put their content over to the public are disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81023-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08102334000564">That is in total contrast with our American counterpart committees. I have watched them on C-SPAN, the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network. They are very effective; they are all on television, and they all have powerful, effective questioning. They haul the mightiest in the land before them and get headlines in the newspapers&#151;and it is always a pleasure for a politician to get headlines in the newspapers. The lack of interest in our proceedings is depressing. It is partly our fault, because we do not have time to put over the arguments and give them political impact.</p>

 Absolutely. We need to keep a running analysis as the situation develops, as it puts us in a more powerful position. However, in most subjects, we are not in that powerful position. The best instance is the Ministry of Defence information system, with which we dealt yesterday. The contract is behind schedule and over cost, as several such big contracts are. It was decided to introduce it in 2000, but&#151;I speak from memory of yesterday&#146;s discussions&#151;it was finally introduced in April 2005. The accounting officer with whom we dealt was amiable and effective in giving us the official view, but he was appointed in November 2005, so he had no responsibility for the system that he had to explain and defend.</p>

The intention is absolutely fantastic: details about this patient or that case or issue are open to access in any part of the country, depending on which train the laptop was left by the civil servant responsible. It is marvellous to have such access. There is too much enthusiasm for big projects, which are often too big. Every single one is inadequate; they are usually behind schedule&#151;NHS Connecting for Health is one such project&#151;well over budget and face many problems that are glossed over. There should be a centralised Government system to allow the civil service to vet and authorise those big projects before they go ahead, because I am not sure who is responsible for them.</p>

they are now wandering around the countryside, putting money into contracting firms and kicking people. Until now, the role of the OGC has been that of a marriage bureau, lining up Departments with IT firms and consultancies, rather than looking at the projects themselves and asking, &#147;Are they too big? Are they trying to do too much?&#148; That is the usual tendency, but we should ask whether those projects are going to produce a palpable gain, and what the position of the heritage system is while the new system is installed. That is never thought through, and I do not know why. I do not know whether Ministers are pushing the virtues of big computer contracts on the civil service, hoping that once everything is mobilised in such a fashion, government will be more efficient and cheaper to run and they can fire all the civil servants. I do not know whether it is a question of fashion in the Departments. I do not know whether every Department must have such a contract and the bigger it is the better, or whether there has been zealous salesmanship on the part of the companies. Who is to tell? Certainly, the projects are oversold, and the civil servants do not seem competent at cutting down to reasonable dimensions the brochures and vision that they are given by the salesmen and asking, &#147;Is this really going to work?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08102334000571">There is a problem, and I am delighted to hear that something is being done about it, but at such a stage it is too late in our experience. We are left with several big projects that will be very difficult and very draining financially before they are working. There should be a degree of pre-testing, which does not seem to have occurred. Yesterday we were looking at the information system in the Ministry of Defence. When the computers were to be installed, it was found that they could not work in the existing buildings without serious modifications. They were never pre-tested. Again, some general review should require that and should require Departments to justify these big projects before they are authorised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08102334000572">Some means of central authorisation is necessary, and some degree of sanction against the firms that oversell the projects in the first place. On the tax credits issue, EDS had to pay compensation because of the inadequacy of the systems that it had installed, but that compensation was geared to EDS getting more Government contracts from which it could pay the compensation for the mess that it had made on the first Government contract. What an insane situation. If a firm screws up one contract, it gets other contracts to help it pay for the compensation on the contract that it screwed up. I have never heard anything like it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000573">I do not know much about banking, but I can say that there is insufficient disciplining, control and sanctioning of companies if they fail. I should like to see the same procedure as for Gershon-style economies&#151;the grinding Gershon wheel that is supposed to squeeze fat out of the Departments all the time, as they go along. That goes on remorselessly, even at a time when Departments are trying to carry on some major function. The Rural Payments Agency is a classic example. Because of the Gershon economies, people are being fired at the same time as the agency is embarking on one of the biggest tests of its efficiency and payments system that it is possible to imagine. The result is that it is understaffed, the people who know the work have gone, and the agency must hire them back again to make up deficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08102334000574">Such economies must be co-ordinated. There is another example coming along in the Department for Work and Pensions, which is proposing to fire a large number of civil servants just as we all know that the coming recession will increase the number of unemployed, create more work for the Department and make its life more difficult. Nevertheless, it is proposing substantial reductions in personnel. The functions, personnel and computer systems of a Department need to be co-ordinated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08102334000575">I turn from such general preoccupations to a few specific points about some of the reports that we are discussing today. I was somewhat worried by the tax credit system, which we dealt with a week ago. It was implemented in too inflexible a form, which has resulted in large sums of money having to be clawed back from the poorest sections of society. Mainly because of the inflexibilities of the system, the people whom it was meant to help must repay large sums that they cannot afford and which, in fact, will never be recovered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08102334000576">The suspicion crosses my mind that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which does not want that burden&#151;it is used to taking money from people, not giving it to them&#151;is embarrassed by the situation and has therefore implemented the giving back or credit system in such a ham-handed fashion that the system is discredited. That is too malign a thought for our civil servants, but things have been cumbersome and the HMRC has been far too slow in bringing them into line. The testing has been inadequate. The system itself is good, but its implementation has been clumsy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08102334000577">The treatment of those who are being and have been asked to pay back large sums&#151;they are particularly so for them&#151;is in total contrast to what we saw in another of our reports on HMRC, about the management of large business corporation tax. According to <i> Private Eye</i> and evidence given to us, the businesses that pay large sums in corporation tax are wined and dined by HMRC. Their representatives are taken out to expensive restaurants and asked how HMRC can be nicer to them, what would oil the wheels, and how the companies can be made to cough up voluntarily&#151;a proposition that must be extraordinary to the large corporations. All that is in great contrast to the treatment of the poor, whose faces are ground in the debt and who are pursued in the most cruel fashion. They are taken to court and forced to repay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08102334000578">The report on the taxation of large corporations was very worrying. The position taken towards such corporations was, on the whole, one of trust&#151;&#147;We trust the chaps to fulfil their obligations.&#148; But we all know that a culture of tax avoidance, and in some cases tax evasion, permeates the whole of business. Companies, particularly big companies, are not paying the social rent that they owe this society for profits generated in this country. News Corporation Ltd is the classic example: it has very profitable investments in this country, but its tax affairs are fiddled through a whole plethora of tax havens and it does not make anything like the contribution that it should to this country, given the revenues and profits that it generates here. That is the culture, yet those are the chaps whom we are asked to trust to pay their tax obligations.</p>

In other words, a total of &#163;13 billion is lost through tax avoidance. We try to get to grips with the issue, but our effectiveness is nothing like that of the American committees. They have been dealing with the same culture as ours: big firms sell tax avoidance&#151;and tax evasion&#151;schemes to the companies in the knowledge that it will be profitable to implement them until the Internal Revenue Service catches up with them, as it eventually does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000580">Interestingly, following a US Senate committee inquiry into the design, marketing and implementation of abusive tax avoidance schemes, KPMG, a firm of which I have heard, admitted criminal wrongdoing and was fined $456 million.

The Committee found that major banks such as Deutsche Bank, HVB Bank, UBS and NatWest provided purported loans and credit lines for the purposes of tax avoidance.

We need to go into this area because it directly affects this country&#146;s finances on a massive scale, shifting the burden of taxation on to individual taxpayers in favour of a big industry of tax avoidance and evasion in which companies are not paying their way. Our recommendations were very good, but we encountered the disadvantage of their not being publicised enough and not becoming part of a major debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000585">We pointed out that whereas the Americans have an estimate of the tax gap&#151;in other words, the tax that corporations should be paying as compared to what they do pay&#151;we found that HMRC had no measure of that tax gap and appeared reluctant to develop such a measure. Unless we have a knowledge of the sums at issue and how the matter is being dealt with, we cannot possibly deal with it. An outstanding recommendation of ours was that it should develop such a measure and it should be publicised. We need to know what the tax gap is, how much has been avoided and how much has been evaded. We found that as HMRC has reduced the use of generic avoidance schemes, tax advisers have developed bespoke schemes that are now flogged to help business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000586">We found, too, that HMRC would find difficulty as regards its staffing in coping with the clever, highly paid boys who devote their whole lives to devising schemes that can be sold on to the banks and other businesses to avoid taxation. There is clearly a problem in terms of the amount that HMRC can pay its staff compared with the amount paid by the institutions&#151;the big  <br>

accountancy houses and others&#151;in developing these schemes. The two areas are totally unmatched. HMRC&#146;s large business service faces a loss of skills and industry knowledge as more experienced staff are due to retire. It will have to recruit people with the skills and ability and at the pay level necessary to cope with this issue.</p>

We are dealing with a major political issue&#151;one of a whole series that we come across in our work. We need to be able to promote it further, push into the political forum and get it discussed instead of seeing it falling mutely like a feather on the waters; I was about to say a tomb of silence, but I am mixing my metaphors too much. We are doing important and valuable work&#151;frightening work in the sense that there is so little sanction and so little discussion at the end of the day.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell); he is never a feather to fall silently on water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000589">I begin by apologising to the House for not being here at the beginning of the debate as I had a prior engagement. I gave my personal apologies to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), and I pay tribute to his chairmanship of our Committee. I would like to put on record how much we on the Public Accounts Committee owe to the National Audit Office for the calibre of report that it puts before us. The reports are always of such high quality that it is a pleasure to work to them, although I sometimes find it rather challenging to have to read up on two separate subjects a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000590">I would like to touch on some common themes, not just in the reports that are before the House today which have recently been considered by the Public Accounts Committee, but in what happens once the NAO report has been published and we are yet to take evidence. One cannot help but feel that the moment an NAO report arrives in the public domain the Department it refers to goes into frenzied activity in order to try to mitigate some of the recommendations or criticisms before the permanent secretary and other officials are required to attend an evidence session. I am sure that it is just hearsay that there is a special training course for permanent secretaries who may have to appear before the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000591">During the time I have served on the Committee, I have not found any discourtesy in the treatment of civil servants, although probing questions are asked. However, there are times when the subject matter that we are dealing with reflects not so much the role of the accounting officer but the policy behind it, and often one wishes that not just civil servants but the Ministers responsible for the policy were appearing before us. Unfortunately, as the accounting officer, the permanent secretary has to account for the public expenditure. One cannot help feeling that, given the number of times in evidence we are told, &#147;Since the NAO report was published, we have made huge improvements&#148;, the reports are seen as a trigger for improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000592">That picks up on what Members from all parties have referred to during this debate: the need to look at how the civil service and Departments work&#151;individually and collectively, because often there are cross-departmental issues. If the NAO has picked up on difficulties, discrepancies and lack of good use of public money, surely there should be a better mechanism in individual ministries so that they can identify much of that for themselves and address it before the NAO trigger is reached, valuable though it is&#151;although we would not wish the Committee to be decommissioned because it was no longer seen as necessary. Ministries are reactive to the reports, and one wonders what is lacking in their structure that means that they do not pick up on such issues earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000593">I would like to make some suggestions that pick up on what others have said today. Like many Members, I am occasionally invited to speak to the National School of Government, formerly known as the Civil Service College, and as a former Minister I hold the training of civil servants in our country in high esteem. I know that it is fair game to criticise the civil service, but we have one of the best civil services in the world, and its training is very good. However, somehow it has lagged behind the commercial sector in integrating core management skills into the workings of the organisation&#151;or in this case the Department. I shall come on to the IT skills and commissioning that has been mentioned. As a member of an institute that is interested in management, I feel that Departments should improve their skills in two core areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000594">The first area is management information systems. It is key that such systems are considered, whether for an individual project or a strategic overview of a Ministry in carrying out its duties. People should be properly trained to ensure that information is both timely and relevant to ensuring that the Ministry works efficiently. My hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) said that he had identified a lack of accounting skills in key positions. One would have thought that that was pretty basic. If one has a work force who lack skills, one should adjust one&#146;s recruiting programme and in-service training to ensure that the skills are obtained or recruited in. As time goes by, one gets the impression that that work is not done quickly enough to tackle some of the problems that we consider in the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000595">The second area is project management. Outwith the IT side of things, project management should be integrated more, and the skills associated with it should be integrated into Departments. Lack of continuity has been mentioned. A long-term project is difficult to achieve when there is no continuity among the people who have to oversee it. Sometimes that cannot be avoided, but if a project has been set up properly, with a proper management system, one should be able to replace key people as it progresses without causing detriment to it. The reports from the NAO and the PAC suggest that the civil service should completely review its training and recruitment for and management of those two core functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000596">Some of the problems that the reports identify are persistent. Even when they are identified, it is often difficult to ensure that they are corrected in a timely manner. Although there are several examples, I shall refer to the single payment scheme, about which our report states that, although most farmers are being paid  <br>

earlier than they were in 2005, &#147;errors persist&#148;, and that the Government run the risk of being fined hundreds of millions of pounds. One would think that every warning bell in the Ministry would ring at that. Apart from the practicalities of getting the scheme right, the Ministry was heading down a road that would leave the British taxpayer culpable for such a fine. That should have been picked up early. If proper project management had been applied to the scheme, the problems might have been avoided. The does not apply only to the single payment scheme&#151;there have been persistent problems with tax credits and pay-as-you-earn.</p>

<p><a name="st_o260"><a name="08102334000597"><a name="81023-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="08102334001056"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 Before my hon. Friend moves on from the single payment scheme, let me point out that, although there might not have been adequate project management, a series of Office of Government Commerce reviews was published in the back of one of the NAO reports on the Rural Payments Agency. They showed that, time and again, the OGC gateway process produced red traffic lights, but nothing happened. At no point did anyone at the centre say, &#147;Stop.&#148; Things simply carried on.</p>

<p><a name="st_o261"><a name="08102334000598"><a name="81023-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="08102334001057"><b>Angela Browning:</b>
 Indeed. That is why I believe that such projects need to be properly managed, and key people need to take responsibility for them. If there is a properly drafted project management scheme, those responsible should be easily identifiable. As my hon. Friend said, that did not happen and, as he pointed out in his speech, the appalling record keeping compounded the single payment scheme&#146;s problems. As I said earlier, I believe that the political imperative was sometimes to blame. Sometimes it would be helpful to have a Minister rather than a civil servant present. I recall that when the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett) as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced the single payment scheme to the House, it was done in a very hurried way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08102334000599">Let me come on to information technology commissioning and the overseeing of IT, which lie at the heart of many of the problems brought before the Public Accounts Committee and covered in its reports. It seems to me that the single payment scheme is a classic example of a policy being introduced hastily&#151;possibly against the advice of civil servants at the time, although how would we know for sure? If more time were taken and more trialling done before a policy was rolled out as a national scheme, the Government and relevant Departments would hopefully pick up more of the many problems caused by complex IT schemes&#151;problems for our constituents and, more particularly for the PAC, problems that lead to a huge waste of taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08102334000600">I say again that I am not an IT expert, so I am nervous of venturing down the path of making recommendations on IT to the Government, but it seems to me that the commissioning of software is a particular problem and that the people who draw up the specifications in the first place often do not have the necessary qualifications or knowledge. That brings me back to having proper management information systems&#151;all these issues feed into each other&#151;that are necessary in order to commission correctly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08102334000601">There are always going to be glitches with major IT projects&#151;there are bound to be; it is never going to be perfect the first time round&#151;but by trialling and sorting  <br>

out the glitches before a programme is rolled out, the Government and Departments could avoid many of the difficulties. That applies not just to DEFRA&#151;or EFRA as it is now often called&#151;but across the board. Perhaps one of the worst examples was the commissioning of projects in the Ministry of Defence, but problems have been evident in the NHS and the Department for Work and Pensions, as well as in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para28"><a name="08102334000602">I hope that as a result of today&#146;s debate the Minister will take forward some of the overall concerns that have been expressed. We have heard specific complaints about individual reports, but I am referring to overall concerns about recurring problems and common themes that the PAC all too often picks up in its reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="81023-0014.htm_para29"><a name="08102334000603">I conclude by noting the opportunity presented to the PAC to come back to its reports more frequently than at present. It is very difficult to decide which of the National Audit Office reports should be considered in an evidence sitting&#151;ideally, we would like to consider them all. Two a week when the House is sitting is a lot of reading, but, equally, the power of the PAC in comparison with other Select Committees is that it has the opportunity to call the permanent secretary and other officials back in order to monitor progress after the previous report. We already do that to a degree, but in my opinion, not enough. If we could bring reports back more frequently, where appropriate, we could make more of a difference to some ongoing and persistent problems.</p>

 It is a pleasure to respond to this debate, which has been fascinating to listen to. Speaking as someone who spent about 14 or 15 years in business and industry before becoming an MP, I know that many of the issues spoken about today make a lot of sense, as I often ran up against them in industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08102334000605">The excellent Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee&#151;I shall pay further, more detailed tribute to him shortly&#151;rightly opened the debate by pointing to the considerable changes that have occurred since we debated the previous PAC reports back in May. If we had thought back in May that we would see the current bank rescue plan, hear the word &#147;nationalisation&#148; being used more frequently than it has been for years, and witness the general worsening of our country&#146;s fiscal position&#151;the Governor of the Bank of England delivered a bleak prognosis only this week, and today the Institute for Fiscal Studies has reportedly flagged up a potential &#163;125 billion black hole in the public finances&#151;we would have found it difficult to believe that all that could happen so quickly.</p>

For me, the work of the PAC is one of the reliable constants that we have in public life. There are a number of reasons why the Committee works so well, and I hope to discuss them briefly, but first I want to add to what others have said about some of the issues raised in the reports.</p>

stones and rocks presented by the Government&#151;is embodied in my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). He set out very clearly the challenges that the Committee faces in examining so many different topics. As we have seen today, it contains a unique combination of talents: an eclectic mix of members, with a massive variety of not just skills but opinions. I pay tribute to its Chairman for his ability to corral that diversity of talent, skills and opinion into such powerful reports. There is real verve in the Committee&#146;s work and, beneath it all, a clear understanding of what it is there to do&#151;to play a critical role in carrying out its parliamentary scrutiny of the work of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08102334000608">What strikes me when I listen to and participate in debates on the PAC is the breadth of its remit. We need only consider the sheer breadth of the issues covered by the reports, which range from tax credits and PAYE in the eighth report to the 2012 Olympics in London in the 14th report, the single payment scheme in the 29th report, and benefit fraud. People are often asked to engage in a trade-off between quantity and quality, but&#151;as was made clear by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)&#151;although the Committee&#146;s members may have to wade through an awful lot of material, they make no trade-off in favour of either quantity or quality. It produces numerous reports, which are always of extremely high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08102334000609">I was particularly interested to hear the Chairman&#146;s views on financial management, reducing internal costs and understanding risks. I felt that he hit the nail on the head in highlighting those three elements. Without them, it is difficult for any Government of any political persuasion to deliver true value for money, which is, of course, the key focus of the PAC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08102334000610">As was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton, in today&#146;s IT age there should be more scope for understanding of the financial management of Government than ever before. We should have better data and information to enable us to exert control over public expenditure, and over the devising of policy more generally, by means of effective decision making. However, that does not seem to be happening, as has been emphasised in a number of the PAC&#146;s reports. Three examples are the tax credits report, the benefit fraud report and&#151;this was close to my heart because I am a London Member&#151;the 2012 Olympics report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08102334000611">I was shocked to see in the benefit fraud report that &#163;2 billion of taxpayers&#146; money has been lost owing to customer and official error, and it is worrying to learn that that has doubled in the last five years. There is no doubt in my mind that the complexity of the benefit system is one of the key reasons why this is able to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08102334000612">On tax credits, we heard that &#163;4.3 billion of taxpayers&#146; money remains to be recovered. All those who hold their constituency surgeries on a weekly basis, as I do, regularly see people who have been the victims, as it were, of overpayments and who are now having to struggle to pay the money back. The Committee is right to point out that there must be a question mark over how much of that &#163;4.3 billion that has been overpaid will ever actually be recovered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08102334000613">I was particularly interested in the London 2012 Olympics report, and I was fascinated to learn of the Committee&#146;s concerns about the unrealistic original budgeting for the Olympics.

those concerns about the robustness of that budget when the Olympics Bill passed through this House. It is one of the reasons why I was one of the few Members who voted to cap the contribution of the London taxpayer to the London Olympics budget; I had a clear sense that an increase in that budget would be required, and that that would swiftly make its way into the taxpaying liability of London taxpayers&#151;and, unfortunately, I can clearly see that happening. I hope that over the coming years the Committee will be able to return to not only difficult issues such as tax credits and benefits fraud but the London Olympics, to continue to watch how taxpayers&#146; money is being managed and how the Government are delivering value for taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000614">My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough raised the very pertinent and valid issue of financial skills and awareness among not only civil servants who are responsible for budgets, but those who are non-financially responsible, as it were. With my background as an accountant, I fully understand why being able to manage budgets is important, but it is also vital for the accountability of Government, because when all the political rhetoric of this place is set aside, in my experience all we are often left with is the figures. Therefore, being able to understand what the figures mean is crucial for parliamentary accountability. As my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell) articulately pointed out, it is essential to have the figures in place against which Government can be held to account on whether they planned ahead or went into the necessary detail. The reports often rightly point out that there was not sufficient planning ahead on key projects or enough detail in implementation plans, and that insufficient project management skills were brought to bear. The result is that we lose taxpayer value for money and gain Government waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08102334000615">Another reason why it is vital that all civil servants have an ability to manage finances&#151;after all, they are all ultimately responsible for some form of taxpayers&#146; money in their activities&#151;is that when people understand how to manage the budgets they are impacting on and responsible for, they have the confidence to be able to take better decisions. The worst situations I have come across in industry have been when I have been confronted with people who were not clear about how to manage their resources, and who therefore would resort to ever more elaborate ways of hiding that fact by generally making their resource management as complex as possible, as once other people understood how they were managing their budgets it became clear that they were not doing so very effectively. Therefore, giving people the toolkit to manage their budgets better means that we are bound to have much better taxpayer value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000616">I also welcome the upcoming national audit reviews of the financial management of each Department, because I have no doubt that the reviews themselves and the reports they generate will be of great value to the Departments and will also provide valuable fodder for careful consideration by the PAC. If government is to be set up for success, it is vital that we have good financial control, clear accountability and good information and transparency across the board. We must confront issues, whether climate change and carbon footprints&#151;that is ultimately about how broadly we examine the carbon impact of different options&#151;immigration and the  <br>

contribution that migration brings to this country, or another diverse topic, calculating our debt. Ultimately, it is critical to understand what are the right figures to examine in any given situation, and that means good training. It is only with good training that we will end up with much better decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000617">I share the frustration of the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) about waste. He talked about the very real impact that it has on projects in his constituency, and we can all think of such projects in our own constituencies. I instantly thought of Elliott school, which is desperate for capital spending to make it a school that we can be proud of, and the lifts that we are keen to get at East Putney station to make it accessible to everyone. Such projects bring into sharp focus the cost of waste, which is much more than just a figure&#151;it is money that cannot be spent on the key projects that communities across Britain would like it to be spent on. We all have such projects in our constituencies, and they demonstrate clearly why the work of the PAC is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000618">Comments have been made about responsibility for decisions and waste, which is critical. Running through all the comments has been frustration and the sense that there needs to be more accountability and responsibility for things when they go wrong. Having come into the House from industry, I get worried that it seems that the best way for a civil servant to stop their next promotion is to say no to a Minister and to be the person who tells him or her that things are not going well and that change is needed.</p>

 I agree with a great deal of what the hon.

Although I have said that I am concerned that things are not looking good in our country at the moment, I do not think that they are quite that bad.

That topic perhaps does not get as much attention as it ought to, and I was extremely pleased to see the PAC examine it. As the Member whose constituency contains the site of the old Putney hospital, which has been derelict for 10 years, I have found it amazing that property management across government sometimes happens at a pace that seems glacial compared with what would happen outside this place. The Committee&#146;s report on that matter was quite important in generating a debate not just inside but outside the House.</p>

It plays a crucial role in our parliamentary democracy and in ensuring that the Government and Ministers are accountable. As I said, its spirit is embodied in the articulate, forensic and tenacious approach of its Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, who opened today&#146;s debate. I wish the Committee well in the many challenging reports that I am sure it will produce over the next few months, and I look forward to our next chance to debate the results of those reports in this Chamber.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to respond, once more, to our debate on the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s reports&#151;this is the third time that I have done so. Today&#146;s debate has demonstrated not only the wide-ranging nature of the PAC&#146;s work, but the fascinating insight that it gives its members into the way in which government works. I speak as a three-times member of the Committee; I was a member when I was in opposition and when I was on the Back Benches in government after having been a Minister, and I am now a member, although in the slightly more formal sense of being the Treasury team&#146;s representative on the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000625">I have always been a great advocate of the Committee&#146;s worth; it proves its worth every time it sits. That tradition has been carried on under its current Chairman in the usual fine way, and I too congratulate him on the work that he does. The Committee builds on a great, long and proud tradition of ensuring that public moneys, which are voted by Parliament, are properly accounted for in respect of value for money and ensuring that the appropriate lessons can be learned when reports are produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000626">In these difficult and turbulent times, thinking about what the Committee does might not be to the fore. People might call its work accountability and they might dismiss it as housekeeping, but it is even more important in difficult and turbulent times; a recurring theme of today&#146;s speeches has been that public expenditure and getting value for every pound spent becomes even more important. I know that members of the Committee are driven by a strong desire to secure high quality public services and value for the money spent, and I share that desire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000627">Working in the Treasury recently has obviously been challenging, but I suspect that the same could be said in respect of every finance ministry in the world, as we have been struggling to deal with the turbulence and the unique set of circumstances endangering the global financial system. Some of us have only read about such times in history books; actually experiencing them is a different thing. In this storm, the Government&#146;s priority is financial stability, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor  <br>

of the Exchequer has repeatedly made clear in statements to the House. We are determined to do whatever it takes to secure that stability, and we have already put in place a comprehensive package of measures to support the financial system and to protect ordinary savers and businesses, who rely on a strong banking system in order for the economy to work. We maintain a careful watching brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000628">As a number of reports this week from the CBI, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Governor of the Bank of England have made clear, we are in very difficult and challenging times. The economy is dealing with the biggest shock to the system for generations, and the Government will continue to act to ensure that we get through these challenges in the fairest way possible. I assure all hon. Members that we will continue to pay extremely close attention to the work of the PAC, even in times when the attention of the media and others who follow our debates is torn to other areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000629">The Government take the recommendations of the Committee very seriously and have a good record in implementing the vast majority of them. This year in response to the Committee&#146;s requests, Departments will report progress on all their outstanding agreed recommendations in their autumn performance reports, which I think will be an extremely good discipline on them. It may focus a few minds and ensure that things that may have slipped off the radar suddenly re-emerge so that that they can receive the focus that they deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000630">I want to respond to some of the issues raised by right hon. and hon. Members. The Chairman of the Committee, the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)&#151;whom we all love and who has had a lot of praise today&#151;had a little dig at the Treasury with respect to the efficiency of the use of the Government&#146;s property and pointed out, helpfully I thought, that the Treasury sat at the bottom of the list. We have taken action to mitigate that and have continued to increase our building occupancy since 2005-06, increasing our net internal area figure&#151;the hon. Gentleman will know what that is &#151;for 1 Horse Guards road, our main building, from 21.9 sq m per full-time equivalent person to 16.62 sq m, which I think is significant progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000631">We continue also to look for new tenants to take up the vacant space but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the fact that the Treasury&#146;s main building has some constraints upon it because of its listed status, the wide range and sweep of some of the stairwells and the width of some of the corridors make it difficult to use absolutely every square inch in the efficient way in which some newer buildings might be utilised. However, I assure him that we continue to try to make progress on that, and we have made some.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="81023-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000632">The Committee Chairman said that there was a narrowed ideological gap between all parties. I do not know whether that means that we are all socialists. The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) was denying that earlier. I have an inkling that the ideological gap has widened in the last few months and we are no longer talking about how to manage a system established post-Thatcher and Reagan, but are looking to see how the pieces will reorder themselves after the shocks that we have had. This is only a personal opinion; ideological gaps might be widening rather than narrowing, but I am sure time will tell.</p>

Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) expressed great frustration, which everybody shares, at the opportunity cost of money that is wasted and what could have been done with it if it had been used more effectively and efficiently. That is right at the heart of the work that the Committee does and my right hon. Friend represented the zeal with which those of us who have been privileged enough to sit on the PAC during the course of our parliamentary careers&#151;at whatever stage that might be&#151;can identify and feel. Committee members in the debate today have managed to get across that motivation. I share his ambition to reduce the &#147;blood sport&#148; nature of the Committee&#146;s hearings, even though Ministers do not appear before it, a fact that has been commented on today. If the hearings are less like a blood sport, it will improve the efficiency and value for money of Government expenditure. I therefore share my right hon.

Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) made some interesting points, ranging from money laundering in foreign dependencies to the review of neonatal care, which was similar to the work that the Committee did last year on social care&#151;taking a more thematic approach to areas that do not always get considered. He also talked about the report on leaving the services, which was raised by other hon. Members. He set out a forward agenda, and was possibly making a bid that the Chairman will doubtless consider and will make a few civil servants shake in their boots, as he suggested consideration of the remuneration of senior civil servants. Far be it from me to comment on that, because the Chairman will obviously decide how he wants to take forward the work of the Committee in conjunction with his colleagues.</p>

He asked why EDS has not paid HMRC&#146;s compensation. There was a PAC hearing on 8 October at which the subject came up<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Ah, the hon. Gentleman was in Turkey so he missed the vital information that would have answered his question. The acting chief executive officer of HMRC said that it was in delicate negotiations on that very subject. The time by which HMRC expects to be paid runs out in the next couple of months and the acting CEO made it clear that he intends to be paid, but asked for the Committee&#146;s forbearance while the discussions concluded. The Chairman said that that was reassuring. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Norfolk will pursue the issue the next chance he gets, if he is not in Turkey&#151;</p>

attention, and it is important that those who are thinking about removing duplication and achieving efficiency savings through shared services take into account the issues that he raised. We agree that there is great potential to make savings in that area, but it has to be done properly and effectively or else it can be counter-productive. We agree that there is potential to make central Government savings, and that is why my right hon.

His enthusiasm has not dimmed since his last contribution to such a debate, which is always a good sign. We know that the trend is possibly even up when it comes to enthusiasm. I agree that it is a pleasure to work on the Committee, having done so twice. I also agree that it is very good training for a ministerial post. I am sure that those Members who have had the privilege to serve in government and who have been on the Committee would agree that it gave us a great deal of insight and never leaves us when we are making our decisions.

Common themes always come out when one is considering value for money, such as how one can create a process that minimises the chances for waste and increases the possibility that we will get the best value for money that we can. She identified that core management skills and project management skills are important. As a former Minister, she will know that some areas of Whitehall are better at that than others. There is a general recognition in the senior civil service that there is a shortage of project management skills for many reasons, but I can assure her that the Office of Government Commerce and senior management figures in Whitehall are extremely aware of that and are taking action to try to deal with it.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Lady&#146;s general observation. There are weaknesses in particular Departments, but there are also weaknesses because of the silo nature of Whitehall. The connections between Departments are often not as strong as any of us would like to see. I reassure her that the OGC is apprised of that fact, particularly with respect to procurement. I know that procurement is not everything, but &#163;175 billion of public procurement a year, of which &#163;70 billion is carried out centrally by Whitehall Departments, is quite a big slug of money to focus on to begin with. That is why we are conducting procurement capability reviews in every Department, and they will be published. We are having a very good exchange with senior managers, who are engaging not in a defensive way but in a way that demonstrates that they are willing to learn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08102334000647">As part of transforming the Government procurement process, we are also trying to give much more training and recognition to procurement professionals across Whitehall. We want to begin to create a cross-Whitehall and cross-departmental culture of procurement. That will benefit both procurement and project management, and there are solid foundations for the development of an approach that will break through the silo mentality that everyone who has been in Government will have experienced. Everyone in the House who deals with Departments can sense that mentality and knows that it exists. I am optimistic that we are making progress in that area, but I cannot say that all the problems are solved and that there is not a shortage of procurement skills in the public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08102334000648">The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked whether the hopes of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to raise &#163;100 million from the private sector to go to the training and support of elite British athletes were still realistic. Obviously, I should like to begin by joining him in congratulating our sports men and women on their excellent performances in Beijing. We will all remember their various triumphs for a long time, but we also need to recall that, in addition to the lottery funding, &#163;265 million of Government revenue was given to elite athletes for training and support ahead of the Beijing games. For the first time ever, that money included individual living cost allowances that enabled the athletes to focus on full-time training for their sports. That was very successful in helping them to achieve the excellence that they did achieve. We stand by our commitment to give our elite athletes the best possible preparation. There can be no absolute guarantee of private sector funding, especially in circumstances that are changing as much as the present ones, but we continue to work towards securing it.</p>

The PAC, supported by the NAO, has been at the heart of the scrutiny process for an extremely long time. I think that the Committee as an entity goes all the way back to Gladstone&#151;although I am obviously not referring to its present membership; we might feel quite old sometimes, but I hope that we never feel that old, collectively or individually.</p>

It undoubtedly aids parliamentary accountability. However, we cannot allow ourselves to sit on our laurels just because the Committee has existed for so long and is venerable; we have to keep looking into how we can modernise the way in which the system works. Our alignment project, which the Prime Minister announced in July 2007 in the Green Paper &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148; aimed to carry out that modernisation. When implemented, it will simplify and put in a more consistent format public spending plans, parliamentary Supply estimates and published resource accounts. In essence, that means that Parliament and the public will be able to compare apples with apples, and pears with pears, instead of apples with pears, or chalk with cheese.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08102334000653">I hope that the project will greatly facilitate a reasonable understanding of where money goes, how it flows through the system, where it was when Parliament voted on its use, and to what effect it was used. Members of Parliament, Select Committees, the public and commentators should be able to track departmental spending more easily, all the way from the planning and budgeting stages to the out-turn. The alignment project does not sound particularly exciting, but those of us who have seen how it will work when it is finished are excited by it, and I am sure that the Committee is, too.</p>

It is exhausting just looking at them. We have had a flavour of them today. Those listening to our debates will appreciate the sheer breadth of the work that has been done. It is no mean achievement, and it clearly demonstrates the Committee&#146;s huge work load. I want to say a few words about the Committee&#146;s 44th report.  <br>

The formal Treasury minute has not yet been presented to the House, but the report is about the roll-out of the Jobcentre Plus office network, which I was involved in when I was a Minister at the Department for Work and Pensions. It was heartening to read the Committee&#146;s report, and it is pleasing to know that when things go well, the Committee fully acknowledges the achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000655">I agree with the report that there are important lessons to learn from any transformation project, and certainly from the transformation of Jobcentre Plus from a decrepit and inefficient network of 1,500 offices scattered randomly around the country. As I recall, the furniture was bolted to the floor when I was first responsible for them. The offices have been changed into a high-quality, well-located network of 800 offices fit for the 21st century. Staff in the offices will have a very important job to do, given what has happened to unemployment figures in the past few months. The offices are now more efficient and are equipped to do that job, thanks to the effective transformation of that public sector service.</p>

 I was just looking through my pile of papers, having forgotten the Minister&#146;s comment that the Treasury has not issued a minute on the report in question. The single most interesting aspect of that Jobcentre Plus report&#151;this is reflected in its first recommendation&#151;is that the three witnesses before us had, between them, 112 years of experience. Lesley Strathie, the then chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, and the other two witnesses had, between them, well over 100 years of experience. They started as clerical assistants, not fast-track administrative trainees. Are there not potentially huge lessons for Whitehall to learn from that, in light of what we have been saying about project management?</p>

 I would like to congratulate and commend Lesley Strathie, then chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, on the work that she and her team did to bring about that transformation. The hon.

I always found, when I was a Minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, that stress-testing reforms with the people on the front line who use the systems, and getting their feedback on what I was trying to do, was far better than any number of consultants&#146; reports, glossy though they may be. Consultants were completely unused to the experience of using and administering the system daily. Lesley Strathie and her team clearly learned that lesson when they were undertaking the transformation.

 I suspect that if we sent an e-mail to every permanent secretary and asked them to look at the report, that would be a better way of doing it, and I certainly undertake to draw it to their attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000660">I understand the irritation of the Committee and its Chairman at the publication in February by the Department for Transport of revised vehicle excise duty evasion estimates for 2007, which indicated that evasion was much lower than cited in the PAC&#146;s fifth report published a month earlier. I am very sorry that the subsequent publication of a Treasury minute, made in error, compounded an unfortunate series of events. That sounds like a film or a book, but it is something that Committee members and the NAO had to put up with. I hope that Members accept that at no time did the Government seek to mislead or somehow embarrass the Committee. Lessons have been learned from that experience, and we will strive to avoid a recurrence of such an episode.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000661">We should after all rejoice that following the introduction of an automated number plate recognition system, evasion of vehicle excise duty, with its implications for accurate licensing information and the detection of crime and public revenue, is at a low level, which is something we all welcome. People who see the police using that information to great effect, as I have in my local area, to prevent further crime, know how important it is to have accuracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000662">The PAC has expressed continuing interest in the private finance initiative, and its recommendations and reports on the matter are invaluable. Hon. Members have helped us to review, reflect and revise our views. The Committee has added value by choosing a wide and useful range of topics over the years. It has helped us assess and analyse the risks in infrastructure projects, and improve the means of procurement and efficiency. We look forward to continuing that fruitful dialogue as we extend the range of approaches to complex procurement, always seeking best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08102334000663">The PAC&#146;s recent recommendations in its September report, &#147;HM Treasury: Making changes in operational PFI projects&#148;, were welcomed by the Treasury. I was pleased that the Committee endorsed recent Treasury guidance that will help to ensure that value for money is obtained when changes are made, and that it has also endorsed the roll-out of training programmes to support contract management. Before I conclude, may I touch on the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Gainsborough about the apparent largesse of space at the Treasury, which I have addressed in a separate note outwith my speech? Finally, may I repeat my gratitude for the hard work of the PAC and the National Audit Office, which ably supports it. Together, they make a major and lasting contribution to the performance and delivery of public services across the United Kingdom, and they keep the Government and public servants on their toes. Their work will continue to be as effective as it has always been, and I look forward to working with them in future and, if circumstances allow&#151;one never knows&#151;to other occasions such as this.</p>

 It is a pleasure briefly to thank everyone who has taken part this afternoon. I thank the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), who made the first speech in the general debate, and initiated an interesting theme to which we have returned several times and to which the Committee, too, may have to return. Why do civil servants not take responsibility?  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2008 : Column 532</b><br>
Are we rewarding them enough for success? Are we sacking those who fail? Of course, they are never sacked. The theme was taken up by the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000665">I am divided in my own mind about these matters. One part of me is rather old-fashioned&#151;perhaps old Labour. I support the traditional concept of the British civil service as incorruptible, with staff remaining in it all their lives, and as not having a great interface with the private sector, which can cause many problems. So part of me is old Labour and part of me is old Conservative, in that I recognise the importance of financial inducements in promoting productivity. That is why we now have bonuses in the civil service. &#147;Bonus&#148; is almost a swear word because of what is happening in the banking sector, but we have to get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000666">If ever there were to be a change of Government, I know that the new Government would place great emphasis on saving money. If we are to save money in this respect, there must be inducements for the civil service. The Government have already tried it. It is a difficult area, but with the help of the National Audit Office, the Committee would be well placed to try, in a completely non-partisan way, to understand what is going on inside the civil service and how we are promoting efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000667">That point was taken up by the third speaker this afternoon, my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon). On the door of the Chairman&#146;s office, there is the word &#147;Assiduity&#148;. That applies to my hon. Friend more than to any other member. He is incredibly assiduous. He had a first in the debate: he was the first Member, as far as I know, to refer to the words of Mr. Crapper without its being taken up by the Chair. That will no doubt be noted in &#147;Erskine May&#148; as a new form of insult.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="08102334000668"><a name="81023-0016.htm_spnew9"><a name="08102334001073"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I can tell the House that when I was a Minister at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, I had a debate on the thing that Mr. Crapper produced. I refer to toilet flushes, not what hon. Members might be thinking. So that has featured on the Floor of the House before.</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="08102334000669"><a name="81023-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="08102334001074"><b>Mr. Leigh:</b>
 I apologise; it was not a first for my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000670">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell), who is a new Member of our House. He is not a member of the Committee. There is a grave danger that these debates become a Committee love-in and we all just slap each other on the back. We welcome him coming in from outside, with his private sector experience. He spoke with great knowledge about the value of shared services, which is not a sexy subject. I am not sure that his predecessor as the hon. Member for Henley would have been very interested, but it is an important subject and huge savings can be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000671">As usual, we much enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), as we greatly enjoy him as a member of the Committee. He lightens the atmosphere so often with his biting tongue. He took us to task for not having the bite of congressional committees and seemed to suggest that we could get more publicity for our hearings and our reports. That is an extremely difficult tightrope to tread. We cannot be partisan. We cannot, and I never do, attack Ministers. We must be consensual and take the whole Committee  <br>

with us, but despite all that our reports are hard-hitting and we get to the heart of matters. It is a difficult balance to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000672">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) for her comments and what she said about the importance of management information. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) who, as an accountant, comes with a particular financial expertise. We are grateful for her remarks. She, too, referred to the problem that has been a theme of the debate: civil servants and whether they should say no. I think civil servants need to seek directions more. There is a procedure for that, and this is where the Public Accounts Committee is intimately involved. If a permanent secretary thinks a Minister is asking for something that is not financially viable, he can seek a direction. If he seeks a direction, it will come to our Committee. Permanent secretaries should be more willing to use that ultimate weapon. Civil servants must say &#147;No, Minister&#148; more often.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000673">Lastly, I thank the Minister. It is such a joy; one sits through so many debates in which Ministers do not refer in any great detail to what has been said, but she took half an hour to refer to virtually every point that had been made. In particular, she was careful to reply to some of the points that I had made earlier. By the way, I do not think that it does any harm to share one&#146;s notes with the Minister before the debate, as I do&#151;jaw, jaw is better than war, war after all. If a Minister is warned about what a spokesman is going to say, they will be more able to reply to the points, and this Minister does that extremely well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000674">I did not deal with the new governance in any great detail; we sorted that out through the Public Accounts Commission, and the National Audit Office now has a robust new governance. I now have a difficult job. Under the statute, the Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee have to appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is a wise procedure; by definition, the Prime Minister is a member of the Government and by definition the Chairman of the PAC is a member of the Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="81023-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08102334000675">We are now starting the process and trying to carry it out in a completely modern and open way. The old days, when such things were done in private and some senior civil servant was just tapped on the shoulder, are not with us any more. A very well regarded firm of head-hunters has been approached and advertisements have been placed in the newspapers. Anybody from the private or public sectors can apply. There will be a very small appointments committee; obviously, I will sit on it. The Prime Minister, who has other things on his mind, will be represented by the permanent secretary to the Treasury. We will be advised by Tim Burr, who has intimated to me that he does not wish to apply for the permanent role of Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08102334000676">I have said all that because the appointment will almost certainly be made before our next debate. I assure the House that I consider my new duty to be one  <br>

of the most important that I have had to undertake during my time at the House of Commons. The man or woman who is the new Comptroller and Auditor General will have one term only, for a maximum of 10 years; after that, they will not be able to return to the public sector or any part of the private sector with which they have dealt. They will be unsackable for 10 years and nobody will be able to influence them. There is no more important job than that of the Comptroller and Auditor General in ensuring financial and general accountability. I hope that we get it right and I ask for hon. Members&#146; support as we try to do so. We will do our best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08102334000677">Finally, I thank the Minister for what she said about the financial alignment project, which sounds boring but is unbelievably important. As every <i> Hansard</i> report shows, there is no doubt that we have one of the best audit systems in the world; however, we also have one of the weakest Budget systems in the world. We have a strong National Audit Office. Some of us have studied supreme audit offices around the world, and I am not sure how we could do things much better in respect of considering what has gone wrong in the past. As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said, one of the problems with our work is that we often look at things too much in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000678">I have tried to speed the whole process up to ensure that the National Audit Office works quicker, reports come to us quicker and we report quicker. The system works pretty well, but we have a very weak Budget system. One reason for that is that it is virtually impossible for Members of Parliament to understand the process. It is all much easier and better done in the United States Congress, where the President proposes a Budget through the Office of Budget and Management. It goes to Congress, and what emerges at the other end bears no relation to what the President has proposed. The President proposes; Congress disposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08102334000679">We will never get to that situation in this House, because the Government are drawn from the legislature; we will never go down the congressional route and perhaps we never want to. However, we have to get a much more transparent system of considering the Budget. Through a sub-committee of the Liaison Committee, I have been working with the Chairman of the Treasury Committee, and we have been working with the Government, who should take a lot of credit for getting the whole process moving. That was their initiative and they should be congratulated on trying to bring more transparency to the whole Budget process.</p>

 I am grateful to the House for allowing me to discuss the very serious flooding that occurred in Morpeth over the weekend of 5 and 6 September. I am pleased to see the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) in his place. He introduced a similar debate in this House on Monday evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08102334000685">While other parts of the north-east of England were affected by the most intensive rainfall in living memory, the town of Morpeth was devastated. Morpeth has a population of about 19,000. It is located in the heart of Northumberland and lies in the valley of the River Wansbeck. It was a thriving market town and is the home of the administrative headquarters of Castle Morpeth borough council and Northumberland county council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000686">The first indications that anything was amiss came with a warning from the Environment Agency on the afternoon of 5 September that a flood watch would be issued for Morpeth and Ponteland from 1 am on Saturday 6 September. Early indications predicted an event similar to that which occurred in 2005. Although river levels were high and gave cause for serious concern in 2005, no properties were damaged. However, it became clear on the Saturday, following a period of unprecedented rainfall, which equated to three times the monthly average falling in just 48 hours, that a very dramatic event was unfolding. From 8 o&#146;clock on the Saturday morning, the water levels were already much higher than in the 2005 event, and torrential rain was still falling with no signs of abatement. Indeed, from 9 am, the pleasure boats that were moored in the River Wansbeck and should have played an important part in the subsequent evacuations were being overwhelmed and were sinking. Staff from Castle Morpeth council were fully stretched in closing off roads and attempting to sandbag vulnerable areas. The whole of Northumberland was awash. Villages were being cut off and numerous roads were closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08102334000687">The emergency services were at full stretch. At 12 noon on Saturday, Gold Command was called and 15 minutes later the first evacuations started. The rescue helicopter from RAF Bulmer, the RNLI, the fire and rescue services from Northumberland and Tyne and Wear, the police, council staff and residents worked throughout the day and night to ensure that everyone was rescued. There was no loss of life. This was due in the main to the skill and dedication of all the people I have mentioned, but also to the spirit and courage of a number of friends and neighbours who acted quickly to evacuate the most vulnerable to places of safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08102334000688">The Environment Agency played an important role in the early flood warning system. For the majority of those registered under the scheme, it worked very well. Five hundred and twenty three homes were contacted with a warning. For the residents of the Middle Greens area of Morpeth, it did not work at all. There are more than 300 homes in that area, which is situated next to the river. Of those, 198 homes were registered under the scheme, but for them the system failed completely. I have met the Environment Agency&#146;s new chairman Lord Smith and Ian Hodge from the region, who inform me  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2008 : Column 536</b><br>
that they have changed their procedure. The previous system divided Morpeth into a number of separate areas and issued warnings depending on the perceived risk. Middle Greens&#146; warning was not physically activated by an operator. In the light of that mistake, they have taken action to ensure that that will never happen again. In future, all the registered areas in Morpeth will receive the same warning at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08102334000689">The flood damage to Morpeth was extensive and devastating, with 1,012 properties affected&#151;913 residential and 89 commercial. A total of 714 were privately owned, and of those 562 were seriously affected. Of those seriously affected, more than 300 households are currently displaced, and that number is rising daily. There are more than 30 properties where drying has not even commenced. Some 172 properties are owned by registered social landlords, and of those 150 are seriously affected. A total of 90 households are currently displaced, but it is accepted that that number will rise to 150. Tragically, of those numbers, 112 households are known to have no insurance cover at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08102334000690">Among the worst affected buildings were essential community assets, such as the ambulance station, a large doctor&#146;s surgery, the library and the leisure centre. It is to the great credit of Castle Morpeth borough council that on Sunday morning, as soon as the water levels began to drop, it started the physical clean-up. On the same day, Gold Command handed over the ongoing work to Castle Morpeth. It set up the Castle Morpeth community recovery and restoration group, which has since adopted the name Springboard. It is a multi-agency partnership and it has been set up to assist the affected community, and to manage its recovery and restoration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08102334000691">Drawing on the experience of other severely affected flood areas is of prime concern to the partnership. Best practice has been the driving force. Ascertaining that everyone in the affected area was safe and well was done without the need to affect forced entry into any of the properties. Morpeth now faces huge challenges. Many of the shops remain closed for restoration work, which is affecting those businesses that are still trading. Many are struggling to survive at present, and are eager to get the message out that Morpeth is still open for business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08102334000692">To compound the problem, car parking is becoming increasingly problematic. The residential streets are narrow and easily congested. A loss of car parking owing to flood-related issues is further compounded by a massive increase in builders&#146; vehicles and skips. That in turn is acting against efforts to attract additional footfall into the town to support the existing retail trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08102334000693">Homelessness is expected to rise. About 400 households are currently displaced, and many of those people are staying with family and friends. From experience elsewhere, I know that that is unsustainable in the long term. The supply of temporary and emergency accommodation is virtually exhausted. Long-term contingencies are urgently required and I look to the Government to assist in the funding of those contingencies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o280"><a name="08102334000694"><a name="81023-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="08102334001076"><b>Sir Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b>
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has seen, as I have done, the amazing work being done by voluntary organisations and public authorities, working together in providing continuing services to the people most affected. I have found the amount of extra effort put in by staff members and volunteers very impressive, and I am sure that he has too.</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I agree with him, and it is a subject I intend to tackle in more detail later. I have been hugely impressed by the voluntary sector and council officials in Morpeth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08102334000696">Apart from the long-term contingencies, there is an increasing need for emotional and psychological support, which will have an even greater impact as people are unable to return to their homes for Christmas. It is important that the agencies responsible are able to identify and respond effectively to a need once it is identified. Additionally, there is a need to lift morale throughout the period of recovery. I am delighted to say that there appears to be no increase in criminal activity. However, there is genuine concern that household possessions kept on the first floors of houses in housing estates that are virtually deserted overnight could be at risk. The police are currently providing additional patrols in the affected areas, and I ask the Minister to press for the continuation of these much-needed patrols.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08102334000697">I mentioned earlier the large number of properties that were not insured. Flood damage repair and renovation to an insured property could be severely compromised if it is adjoining an uninsured property with similar levels of severe damage. There is no doubt that severe financial hardship is being experienced by everyone affected by the flooding, but especially those people who are not insured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08102334000698">Unfortunately, many of the main public buildings were badly affected by flood damage. Morpeth library was immensely popular and well used by many residents. So severe was the damage that it will probably have to be demolished. It is therefore essential that a new library is built as soon as possible. The leisure centre suffered similar damage, but no decision has yet been made about its future. However, one thing is certain: it will be closed for a long time. The same applies to the doctors&#146; surgery and the ambulance station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08102334000699">I have tried to outline briefly the extensive damage that the huge flood did to the town of Morpeth. I am here to seek Government support to help to rebuild the town and, more important, to ensure that we do everything possible to prevent a similar occurrence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08102334000700">The Environment Agency has been heavily criticised for its failure to warn the residents of Middle Greens of the impending flood. That criticism was fully justified, but we need to ensure that the early warning system never fails again. The agency has assured me that the changes it has introduced will guarantee that everyone is informed in future. I also urge residents who are not registered to register now&#151;it is a free service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08102334000701">I have met the agency&#146;s new chairman Lord Smith to press for early implementation of a new flood defence scheme for Morpeth. He has agreed to visit Morpeth in the next few weeks and he is keen to move forward quickly with the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08102334000702">The economic assessment is almost complete, and it is intended to consult the people of Morpeth on the options available no later than next January. The agency intends to run several items in parallel to enable it to commence the scheme several months earlier than originally planned. I am delighted to say that funding no longer appears to be a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08102334000703">In the next few weeks, work will commence on rebuilding a much stronger flood wall to replace the one damaged near the library. Urgent structural assessments will take place of all the various flood defences in the town and of the damaged weir at Highford. The agency is also considering my request, which residents affected by the floods put to me, to begin river bed dredging and clearance. There is a strong economic case for the scheme, which could bring huge investment to Morpeth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08102334000704">A new flood defence scheme would release valuable riverside land for redevelopment to complement the current town centre development. A new health centre, providing state-of-the-art diagnostics and treatment, has been under discussion for more than two years. We should accelerate that development and include a new library on the site. If it proves necessary to demolish the leisure centre, consideration should be given to building a new one, perhaps on a new site. There are many other options&#151;I merely make the point that enormous opportunity exists for the town and we need to maximise it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08102334000705">While local business and commerce has been badly affected, 1,000 properties require extensive building works, new furniture and decoration. At a time of building slump, that could help many local businesses. I hope that people source those services locally, and of course we must endeavour to keep out the cowboy builders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08102334000706">I was impressed with the Government response during and immediately after the flooding. I was contacted by the duty Minister&#151;the then Minister for the Environment, my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)&#151;from 10 Downing street at 9 pm on the Saturday evening to warn me that Morpeth had been badly flooded. I was on holiday in Dorset and I returned home immediately. On Sunday morning, I was called again, this time by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Hilary Benn), who inquired about the extent of the damage and sent his best wishes to the people of Morpeth. I spoke to him and the Minister responsible for flood recovery, my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (John Healey), who said that he wished to visit. He did so the next day. The people of Morpeth also received a much-needed boost in the form of a royal visit by Prince Charles and his wife. They were accompanied by the Minister for the North East of England, my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown), whom I am delighted to see in his place today. He has done a great deal to help me and the people of Morpeth. By any standards, it was a great response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08102334000707">I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will, in her response to the debate, show the same concern for Morpeth and assist its speedy recovery. Morpeth needs urgent funding in the form of Bellwin. It also needs another &#163;600,000 to try to assist the local authority with the expenditure that it has already incurred. I will provide my right hon. Friend with the detailed breakdown of that expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para29"><a name="08102334000708">Castle Morpeth council is a very small local authority; its chief executive Ken Dunbar, his deputy Trevor Walker and all its employees have performed remarkably. They are conducting an inquiry into the flood, and it is essential that all agencies co-operate with it. Their hard work, skill and dedication have been exemplary. They deserve our thanks and recognition for their excellent  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para30"><a name="08102334000709">The voluntary sector also performed exceptionally well. The Red Cross has been invaluable, as have the Lions and the Rotary club, which are raising a large sum of money to assist flood victims. The citizens advice bureau is under increasing strain, but understandably has to deal with many more cases. I request that the Government make a direct donation to the voluntary services in and around Morpeth to enable them and others to continue helping the people of the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para31"><a name="08102334000710">In conclusion, the events at Morpeth on that terrible September weekend were both dramatic and dangerous. That no lives were lost is down to the skill and dedication of the emergency services and of many Morpeth residents&#151;and, of course, some good luck. The Environment Agency&#146;s decision to commence an early flood defence system means that it will probably not happen again. Morpeth needs all the help the Government can provide to help with rebuilding and regeneration. I hope that the Minister will confirm in her reply that that help will be made available.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) on securing this debate. We had an interesting and useful debate on Monday night on the wider issue of flooding in Northumberland, which was inspired by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith). I apologise to those Members who were present&#151;including my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck and, indeed, the Minister for the North East, my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown)&#151;in that some of what I say today may be a little familiar. It is important to reinforce some of the important points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para32"><a name="08102334000712">It may be worth saying that over the last 40 years, Morpeth has grown rapidly, with about 1,000 properties estimated to be at risk of a one-in-100-year event. Current standards of protection vary for different parts of Morpeth and the Environment Agency estimates the average protection at about 60 years. Several studies of the River Wansbeck flooding have been carried out, the most recent of which is the Wansbeck strategy study. My hon. Friend referred to it and I will return to it in a few minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="81023-0017.htm_para33"><a name="08102334000713">The Northumbria regional flood defence committee provided funding through the local levy to carry out investigations in Morpeth further to understand the flood risk and to establish whether any quick wins could be developed. As the scope of the local area project has been developed in 2007, additional flood defence grant-in-aid funding became available and the project transferred to that funding stream.</p>

being most affected. I applaud my hon. Friend for the strenuous lengths he went to to draw the issue to the attention of Ministers, albeit that we were first alerted by my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas). I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck spoke personally to the Prime Minister about the impact of these events on Morpeth and he also secured a visit by the Minister for Local Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08102334000715">I thus congratulate my hon. Friend again on the efforts he has already made, as well as on today&#146;s debate and the various suggestions and requests that he has made. The issues that he&#151;and, indeed, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed&#151;raised today will be studied in detail and given careful thought and consideration by me and my ministerial colleagues as we consider how the Government should respond to the experiences of Morpeth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08102334000716">I also described on Monday how the severe rainfall that caused the flooding was first identified as a potential threat a number of days before the actual event itself. By Wednesday 3 September, the Environment Agency and the Met Office began to track the low pressure system and potential rainfall. By Thursday, they were beginning preparations in case of serious flooding. Heavy rainfall early warnings were issued for the north-east of England, and flash flood warnings were sent out across many further parts of the country on the Friday. Through the early warning system and the new and improved working arrangements between the Environment Agency and the Met Office, warnings were issued to alert local authorities and the emergency services, and preparations were made to prepare vulnerable people and areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08102334000717">My hon. Friend drew attention to the incredibly heavy rainfall that affected the north-east, with 150 mm of rain&#151;6 inches&#151;falling on to already saturated ground and full river catchments over 48 hours. The average monthly rainfall for that time of year is 50 mm, or 2 inches. I am afraid that I always convert metric measures to imperial in my head. In fact, according to the Environment Agency, the flooding that occurred was estimated to be a one-in-150-years event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08102334000718">At the time&#151;and since&#151;a great deal of attention rightly focused on Morpeth, where the first flood watch alert was issued at 3.30 on Saturday morning, with warnings escalating throughout the day. I described that during Monday&#146;s debate. My hon. Friend mentioned the flood warnings. For the purpose of the Environment Agency&#146;s flood warning system, Morpeth is divided into five areas. Four warnings were issued. The severe flood warning intended for the Middle Greens area was issued as a downgrade at 12.49 pm. The residents would not have received that information: it went to professional partners only. A downgrade is normally issued when the Environment Agency believes that waters are receding and there is a settled outlook. Although the residents did not receive the level of flood warning service that the Environment Agency expects to offer, they were engaged in constant dialogue with the agency&#146;s professional partners, and the evacuation from Middle Greens was not compromised.</p>

friends in the area, a number of disabled people could not have been moved out. That happened long before the emergency services arrived. The problem was compounded by the fact that two burns burst their banks, which prevented the emergency services from getting in. Although I accept most of the points made by the Environment Agency, I am afraid that on that occasion it was wrong.</p>

<p><a name="st_o284"><a name="08102334000720"><a name="81023-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="08102334001080"><b>Jane Kennedy:</b>
 It is the purpose of debates such as this to allow precisely that sort of representation to be made. I know that the Environment Agency will want to learn lessons, and indeed has already learned lessons, from the experience of Morpeth in September. It is trying to find ways of making the system more resilient, including rationalising warnings so that the whole town receives the same warning should such warnings ever need to be issued again. It is also instituting additional checks to ensure that the mistakes made in Morpeth are not repeated. It has apologised for the errors, and reaffirmed that although the warnings were not received as planned, it was in constant dialogue. It clearly believes that the evacuation was not compromised, but as my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, the residents of Middle Greens are very grateful indeed for the actions of their neighbours, to whom I pay tribute for their swiftness in rising to the challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08102334000721">In Morpeth, approximately 1,000 homes and businesses were affected by the flooding, and around 250 families were looked after in rescue centres. As my hon. Friend said, and as I said on Monday, the evacuation of Morpeth was successful. As I acknowledged on Monday, flooding of homes and businesses is always devastating for those affected, but such events will take place from time to time, despite the substantial increase in flood defence spending that the Government are implementing. I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend&#146;s description of ministerial readiness to respond to the events of that September weekend. I was also, therefore, pleased to hear of the success of the multi-agency approach, and that those involved showed what can be accomplished through strong partnership work. On Monday, I paid tribute to the emergency services for the excellent job they have done in dealing with the flooding events, and I know that that would be echoed on both sides of the House. The actions of many third-sector organisations following the flooding events has once again shown how our communities can pull together at difficult times. I hear what my hon. Friend has said about further financial assistance being needed by such organisations. Such matters will have to be considered while we await the full claim from Castle Morpeth for the Bellwin assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08102334000722">In Northumberland, the local recovery and support operation is under way and will continue for some months yet. I am particularly grateful to all involved for having pulled together in the face of such challenges. I described the involvement of One NorthEast, the regional development agency, which has made more than &#163;500,000 available to help with immediate costs for affected businesses, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has confirmed that the Bellwin scheme has been activated. Castle Morpeth has registered an intention to claim for Bellwin assistance and has been provided with the necessary information to help with a subsequent claim. The Department for Communities and Local Government awaits the details, and it is also expecting a request for  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08102334000723">On Monday, I described some of the emergency works the Environment Agency is carrying out in the area. However, more important for the longer term is the initiation of the EA&#146;s flood alleviation scheme, which commenced in December 2007. The River Wansbeck strategy study determined that a stand-alone flood alleviation scheme should be progressed with in Morpeth, and an initial site investigation was carried out and an environmental assessment is under way. In addition, in partnership with the Northumberland Strategic Partnership, a detailed business case is being carried out to determine the impact of flooding on local businesses. The scheme is at the end of year one of its current four-year programme. However, the EA is exploring the possibility of an accelerated time scale for construction of the works. I am delighted to hear my hon. Friend&#146;s description of the EA&#146;s willingness to engage at a local level, listening to what local residents have to say about the EA&#146;s proposals. I commend that way of working, and I encourage the EA to continue down that path. I know that he will be quick to raise with me any concerns he might have should that approach begin to slip, and I will be very open to hearing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08102334000724">Although substantial flooding did occur in parts of the north-east at the beginning of September, it is important to remember the many flood defence systems that were not breached despite the very heavy rain. I referred to some of those in detail on Monday. The EA is responsible for maintaining and repairing flood defences, including the installation of temporary defences where needed. During the past year, it has inspected 180,000 assets and carried out work that now means that 95 per cent. are serviceable and will perform as designed during a flood event. The EA spent &#163;377 million building and maintaining flood defences in England, as well as raising public awareness through greatly improved flood-mapping and warning systems.</p>

 When reassessments have taken place, there has tended to be an acceptance that more flooding of fields may help to save properties. Most people accept and understand that. However, will the Minister also accept that if that is done&#151;and, effectively, that happened in parts of Northumberland&#151;the burden on agricultural businesses becomes much more serious, and we may need to look at ways to help agriculture to cope with its taking the bigger impact of floods, instead of homes?</p>

 I am very pleased that the right hon. Gentleman has made that point. I discussed that very issue with the president of the National Farmers Union this morning. It is very important that the Environment Agency considers all stakeholders and all those affected as the country wrestles with the problems of rising sea levels and the threat of high levels of ground water and the sort of inundations that we saw that weekend in September. He is absolutely right that if the water moves somewhere else, somebody else is affected&#151;perhaps not their life and limb and their homes, but agricultural businesses are also very important and the impact of flooding on them needs to be taken into account.

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="81023-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08102334000727">I have described the increased investment, and in recent years our experience of managing flood events has also increased. Last year, we immediately established an independent review of the lessons to be learned from the September 2007 flooding, led by Sir Michael Pitt. Sir Michael&#146;s final report was published on 25 June 2008 and includes 92 recommendations. The Government have already welcomed the report and announced initial allocations from the &#163;34.5 million that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has set aside for the next three years to take the recommendations forward. We will say more about our plans later this year, and I hope that a prioritised action plan will be produced&#151;in the autumn, it says on my notes, but it feels as though we are near winter given the weather outside.
