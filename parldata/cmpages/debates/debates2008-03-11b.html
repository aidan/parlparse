the considerable progress we have made in the treatment of mentally ill offenders. We are transferring many more from prisons to more appropriate facilities in the national health service, and since 2003 the NHS has been responsible for health care inside prisons. However, I accept, as I think the whole House does, that we must do more, and we are doing more. In addition, my noble Friend Lord Bradley is currently conducting a major review to see what further imaginative steps we can take to achieve the end that we all want, which is that prison should deal with serious and persistent offenders who do not have serious mental health problems; those who do are better dealt with elsewhere.</p>

 I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to look at the costs again. At more than &#163;460, it is almost cheaper to put prisoners in a five-star hotel anywhere in the United Kingdom. That clearly cannot be right. Part of the problem is that it costs, I understand, under &#163;1 to feed a child in school and about &#163;3 to &#163;4 to feed a patient; yet to feed a prisoner in one of those cells costs about &#163;12. Will the Secretary of State look again at the costs associated with keeping prisoners in police cells?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman: the costs are too high. Having to use police cells is very much not just a second best, but a third best. I simply say that we use them a great deal less than the Administration that he supported. Of course, he is correct to talk about hotel accommodation, but one can freely leave hotel accommodation.</p>

 Is it acceptable that yet another weekend has gone by when prisoners from courts on Friday were locked out of their full local prisons to be transported across the country to police and court cells, and then back to court on Monday? Rather than spending the equivalent of a night not just in a four-star hotel, but at the Ritz, on housing prisoners, surely it would be a better use of taxpayers&#146; money to spend more than &#163;35 million on providing more than 400 new prison places.</p>

 We have provided additional prison places at twice the rate of the previous Administration&#151;2,000 a year on average, compared with 1,000. None of us believes that the use of police or court cells is acceptable. We want to get prisoners out of them as quickly as possible. However, while the hon. Gentleman&#146;s memory might be short, mine is a little longer. On average, we used 181 police cells a night last year, but the rate was running at 1,100 a night in 1991-92; indeed, back in November 1980, the use of police cells peaked at an astonishing 3,540. I will take lectures from a lot of people, but not from those on the Opposition Front Bench.</p>

 Unfortunately, ClearSprings Management Ltd has a number of properties in my constituency, which is testament to the disaster of penal policy under the Government.

None of the properties&#146; neighbours has raised any objections either, and the scheme is working well. The hon.

 My right hon.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One of the purposes of the ClearSprings scheme is to ensure that women in particular can be bailed rather than await their sentences and court hearings in prison. That means that families can stay together and that many children are not taken into care. Ultimately, many of those women may not be given a custodial sentence. The scheme is an economic and efficient use of resources and it helps keep families together. I commend it to the House.</p>

 From recollection, I should say that I have written to the hon. Gentleman in the past day or so about the scheme that might operate in North Cornwall constituency. I shall certainly consider his objections. However, the issue remains: if, when ClearSprings proposes a property, the police or the local council object to it being used for such a purpose, it will be withdrawn from the potential use. If North Cornwall district council objects, we will certainly revisit the scheme and examine the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns.</p>

 The hon. Lady raises some interesting points. The entire concept of offender management means that we are in a much better position to ensure that the courses that prisoners start while in prison can either be completed or continued outside in the community. We have done that by making sure that the adult education and basic skills courses available in prison are the same as those available outside prison. Offender management means that when the probation service takes over the care of released offenders it can ensure that the correct opportunities are available to them, which will help both to reduce the chances of their reoffending and, it is to be hoped, to reintegrate them into society properly.</p>

 My understanding is that 4 per cent. of those released early on end-of-custody licence have been recalled, and that amounts to 673 people. They may have been recalled for a number of offences, but obviously they are in breach of their licence. Some 1 per cent., or 257 people, have reoffended in various ways. The Ministry of Justice regularly produces figures on these matters, so there is no attempt to hide that. Whenever anybody comes out it is possible that they will reoffend&#151;some do and some do not&#151;but these numbers are quite low compared with other types of release.</p>

 May I bring the Secretary of State back to a previous answer that he gave to the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon)? There seems to be an inherent contradiction between on the one hand praising the effectiveness of community sentences, as well as the perfectly sensible remarks made by the Secretary of State at the <i> Guardian</i> criminal justice summit, which have been rather unfairly criticised, and on the other hand announcing that more and bigger prisons will be built.

 We want to learn from the experiences of countries across the world. It just happens, for all sorts of reasons, that Denmark has a lower prison population per head than we do. The crucial test of a penal policy should not be the arbitrary figure of the number of prisoners per head of population, but whether the overall policies are working to make our communities safer and to reduce levels of victimisation. I have put the Government&#146;s record in perspective. There is the lowest level of victimisation since the British crime survey was established by the Conservatives in 1981. Crime has come down, but there are still many serious violent and persistent offenders at large. Telling our constituents whether the overall aggregate record is down or up serves no purpose if they have been the victim of a crime.</p>

We were aware of that, but it is also important, which is why we are giving the matter consideration, that there should be a broad consensus for changes in party funding, because it cannot and should not be used as a partisan tool in the hands of one party or another.</p>

 The matter is very serious indeed; I have made that clear. In my judgment, the issue arose partly because of the shambolic way in which the local magistrates ran the magistrates courts committee, and the lack of effective administration. As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, the inspectorate praised the work of Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, which took control of Leeds magistrates court, and other magistrates courts, in 2005. The protocol came as an astonishing surprise to me. It is in appendix 12 of the report, which contains the extraordinary phrase about the need to &#147;get rid&#148; of outstanding warrants.

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80311-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08031193000314"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the duties, powers and functions of waste regulation authorities concerning the unauthorised deposit of controlled waste on land; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08031193000164">The purpose of the Bill is to promote serious discussion about a shortcoming in the 1990 Act on fly-tipping. For that purpose, the sponsors of the Bill include a distinguished array of former Ministers from both sides of the House, including a former Secretary of State for the Environment and three former Environment Ministers, one of whom, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), has joined me today. The Bill also has the support of the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union. The 1990 Act was a legislative landmark passed under the previous Conservative Government that established the Environment Agency. Among other matters, it sets out the law on the treatment of fly-tipping. The House has long been aware of the problems caused by fly-tipping for both private and public landowners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08031193000165">The journey of the Bill to the Floor of the House began on a farm belonging to my constituent, Mr. David Gibbon, from whom I declare that I have accepted hospitality, though below the threshold for declaration in the register. In August last year, a lorry was caught red-handed dumping bags of asbestos on Mr. Gibbon&#146;s farm at South Fambridge in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), who I am pleased to see in his place and who, I am sure, would have sponsored the Bill, had he not been on the Opposition Front Bench. The manager at the farm in question, who had been wisely advised not to approach such criminals on his own, took the vehicle registration details and immediately called the police. The Environment Agency was also subsequently informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08031193000166">I regret to inform the House that neither Essex police nor the Environment Agency took any substantial interest in the crime. Despite the fact that asbestos was bagged, correctly tagged and therefore lawfully removed from wherever it came from, and an address was found among the rubbish, little investigation was carried out. The vehicle registration, of course, proved to be false, and the only conclusion to be drawn was that it was the act of a rogue trader. At this point, the story ends, and no public authority took any further interest in the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08031193000167">My constituent initially refused to remove the dumped asbestos, on the very reasonable basis that it was not his responsibility. Ironically, if it had been dumped a mere 6 ft in a different direction, it would have been the responsibility of the highways authority and would automatically have been removed by the Environment Agency. As the Minister stated in a letter to me dated 1 November last year:</p>
<a name="80311-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08031193000315"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where there is fly-tipping on public land, the local authority or the Environment Agency will bear the cost of removal and any subsequent investigation.

Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock) is in her place and kindly listening to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08031193000169">Eventually Mr. Gibbon had to pay almost &#163;3,000 for the waste to be removed by a private contractor. Under the law as it stands, responsible victims of such a crime are forced to pay up, while the perpetrators get off scot-free. Mr. Gibbon did not, under section 33 of the 1990 Act</p>
<a name="80311-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08031193000316"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;deposit controlled waste, or knowingly cause or knowingly permit controlled waste to be deposited&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08031193000170">but according to the Environment Agency, the fact that he had been fly-tipped meant that he was in violation of section 33(1)(b) because he was, as the 1990 Act describes it, keeping controlled waste on his land. He was therefore committing a criminal offence for no other reason than that he himself was a victim of a crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08031193000171">The problem that my Bill seeks to address is simple. Rubbish dumped on public land automatically becomes the responsibility of the local authority or the Environment Agency to clear up, but those authorities are not responsible for clearing up rubbish dumped on private land. On the contrary, if a private landowner does not clear it up, the Environment Agency will prosecute them for not doing so. That is grossly unfair on private landowners, who, by being the victims of crime, become criminals in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08031193000172">The problem is not uncommon. An Environment Agency survey published in January 2007 shows that 16 per cent. of farms in England and Wales suffered fly-tipping over a 12-month period. As Mr. Gibbon&#146;s case makes clear, the cost of clean-up can be very expensive. Indeed, the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 have only increased the costs for private landowners. Since I began work on the Bill, a number of similar cases have been brought to my attention. For example, Freddie de Lisle in Hungarton in Leicestershire had to pay &#163;435 to have suspected asbestos removed from his land after it was illegally dumped. In Wales, the Powys castle estate had to pay out more than &#163;1,000 over the course of three incidents involving clothing, a burnt-out car and two unmarked 45-gallon oil drums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08031193000173">The issue does not only affect farmers. Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust recently announced that it is considering closing its woodlands because of fly-tipping. The costs of the continual clear-ups are eating into its limited resources, which are, of course, charitable. Removing the waste is not only expensive but time-consuming and potentially dangerous. A farm worker in Nottingham was injured when an aerosol can exploded as he tried to burn the timber element of some waste, and he was off work for three months as a result of his injuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08031193000174">At present, landowners feel helpless, so it is not surprising that 50 per cent. of those who are suffering from fly-tipping do not bother to report it. Why should they, if it does not lead to a proper investigation of the incident or any prospect of a prosecution? In a 2006 survey, farmers said that in only 22 per cent. of cases had the police investigated their complaints, even though fly-tipping is a criminal offence.</p>

changes. The first would place an obligation on the Environment Agency or the relevant local authority to remove waste if the landowner</p>
<a name="80311-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="08031193000317"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;did not knowingly cause or knowingly permit&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08031193000176">the waste to be deposited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08031193000177">In her letter, the Under-Secretary claimed that that would create &#147;a fly-tippers&#146; charter&#148;, but that is nonsense, because the law as it stands is a fly-tippers&#146; charter. The Environment Agency already automatically picks up all the rubbish on public land. The Government may fear rogue landowners who would encourage illegal fly-tipping on their land for backhanders, but the Environment Agency would still have the power to serve a clear-up notice on such a landowner, if it suspected their involvement, which might include failure to take reasonable steps to prevent such illegal dumping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08031193000178">My second proposed change would place a duty on the relevant authority to investigate incidents of fly-tipping. As the Minister said in her correspondence, that would place additional burdens on authorities, which already have to remove waste dumped on public land. However, the present law is clearly absurd. What is the point of having a criminal offence of fly-tipping on the statute book, if nobody is even going to investigate those crimes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08031193000179">The case for the changes is clear. Far from creating a fly-tippers&#146; charter, the obligation to investigate and prosecute would help to deter fly-tipping. It is ludicrously unfair that public and private landowners are treated in such grossly different ways. I repeat that had the asbestos in Mr. Gibbon&#146;s case been 6 ft away from where it was, he would not have been responsible for its disposal and that duty would have fallen on a public authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08031193000180">I should inform the House that I am disappointed that the Government have indicated that they are not going to support the Bill, because of the additional  <br>

duties that it would place on local authorities and the Environment Agency. Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has expressed his concern that it might encourage illegal dumping. I hope that the House will agree, however, that I have addressed both those concerns. In any case, the Government are welcome to amend my Bill as it makes progress through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80311-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08031193000181">What is the point of the Environment Agency, if it will not actively investigate and deter illegal dumping? Moreover, active investigation and prosecution of fly-tippers should lead to reduced burdens on the public sector, as well as to a cleaner environment. The agency itself recognises its ineffectiveness, saying that</p>

The central question is whether it is a good treaty for the UK and for Europe. The Government and every mainstream political party in Europe believe that the answer is yes, because the reforms make sense. The treaty reforms the foundations of the EU, which have developed since 1958, and the reforms will allow us to move on to the agenda of prosperity, development and climate change, which we all agree is the essence of the EU&#146;s role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80311-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08031193000215">Secondly, the Lisbon treaty streamlines the institutions and decision-making processes of the EU, so that it can better deliver on the matters that we all agree should be handled at European level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80311-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08031193000216">Thirdly, it makes the EU more accountable to member states and national Parliaments.</p>

 The Foreign Secretary repeats that the treaty will streamline, improve and achieve wonderful things. However, the EU has failed to deliver the Lisbon agenda on competitiveness; its accounts have not been signed off for the past 13 years; and we cannot automatically deport foreign criminals, because of the free movement of people.

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80311-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08031193000226">Let me start with the single market. Hon. Members on both sides of the House want to see an effective and open market. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks has made much of the alleged deletion of the reference to undistorted competition from the list of EU activities. In doing so, he has ignored the new, binding protocol on competition, which confirms that the</p>
<a name="80311-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="08031193000319"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;internal market...includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80311-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08031193000227">He has ignored, too, all the other continuing treaty references to competition, including articles 4, 27, 34, 87 to 89, 96, 98, 105 and 137 in the EC treaty, and the fact that the treaty&#146;s powers on competition remain as strong as ever. He has also ignored the views of the Law Society, the head of the Commission legal service and other distinguished experts that the legal position remains unchanged. In the words of the Law Society:</p>
<a name="80311-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="08031193000320"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A Protocol records that the EU&#146;s internal market includes a system which ensures that competition is undistorted. This does not change the current legal position&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80311-0005.htm_para9"><a name="08031193000228">The Opposition say that they want the single market to work better, and the Lisbon treaty will further that agenda. It will provide a new legal base for the creation of a single EU patent, so that UK companies can have one patent, rather than 27 separate ones, to protect their ideas and inventions across Europe. The treaty will enable the creation of a European research area&#151;a single market in knowledge to make it easier for researchers to take their talents to other countries. The treaty will also allow easier recognition across Europe of professional qualifications, so that professionals can work more freely across borders.</p>

<p><a name="st_o133"><a name="08031193000229"><a name="80311-0005.htm_spnew16"><a name="08031193000486"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 The Foreign Secretary just said that we need the treaty because it will enable us to make further reforms. At the same time, however, I am sure that he will acknowledge that we cannot achieve those reforms if, as my reasoned amendment, which has not been selected, points out, the Bill does not protect our Parliament&#146;s enactments from being struck down by the European Court of Justice and the UK courts. That is what inhibits reform.</p>

<p><a name="st_o134"><a name="08031193000230"><a name="80311-0005.htm_spnew17"><a name="08031193000487"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 I will come to that point directly, because it is important. A similar amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman was selected last week. It challenged the basis of UK participation in the European Union since 1973, which is that on matters of European competence, European law should have primacy. To argue otherwise is to argue that we should be able to join a club, but not abide by the rules. I will show him in this debate that, contrary to the allegation that we have been led into a European project that no one ever warned about, there was absolute clarity all the way through the debates in the 1970s, from Geoffrey Rippon to Geoffrey Howe, whom I shall quote later, and other former hon. Members&#151;</p>

 If the Foreign Secretary is so proud of the text, why did the Government table 295 amendments to an almost identical earlier text, of which only 33 were successful, most of which dealt with comparatively trivial matters?

As we have seen in the Balkans, Lebanon and Chad, the EU can play a role in promoting security and stability in neighbouring countries.

It will do so first by making the European Council&#151;made up of the member states of the EU&#151;responsible for setting the EU&#146;s strategic priorities for all external action; secondly, by strengthening the coherence of the EU&#146;s external action through a high representative, appointed by and accountable to member states, who replaces the current high representative and the Commissioner for External Affairs; and, thirdly, by bringing together existing Commission and Council officials, together with member state secondees, into a single External Action Service.

A full-time Council president, appointed by the member states and answerable to them, will bring greater continuity and drive to delivering the agenda. Elected MEPs in the European Parliament have to approve EU legislation in more policy areas and, as was mentioned earlier, for the first time, national Parliaments get a direct say in making EU laws. If a majority of national Parliaments oppose a proposal and national Governments or MEPs agree, it falls.</p>

 I was coming to the obsession with the myths about the EU. Last week, we heard one that I thought had been buried for good. At Prime Minister&#146;s questions, the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), announced that the treaty will bring in a &#147;United States of Europe.&#148; A United States of Europe means one country, one Government, one currency and every single country of the EU reduced to the status of a county council. Under no circumstances could that be a true description of the Lisbon treaty, which is why no one among the opponents of the treaty believes it&#151;not even the Dutch Party for the Animals, with which the Conservative party is now allied on the issue.</p>

Member for Richmond, Yorks responds on behalf of the Opposition, he will either disown his leader&#146;s comment or say how he can foresee living in such an EU, because many Labour Members have doubts about what the Conservative party&#146;s real agenda is in respect of the EU.</p>

 I am grateful to the Foreign Secretary for giving way. I want to take him back to the point that he made a few moments ago, because he cannot be allowed to get away with it. At the last election, the Labour party put the issue on one side by pledging a referendum on a European constitution.

In fact, it would have made &#147;a nonsense of the necessity for Community law to have the same effect in every member state if the UK, any more than any other member state, could choose by national law to override what it did not like.&#148; [Hon. Members: &#147;Ah!&#148;] Opposition Members can say &#147;Ah!&#148;, but those were the words of Sir Geoffrey Howe at the Committee stage of the Bill that legislated for Britain&#146;s entry into the EU. People cannot join a club and write their own rules.</p>

In the face of an amendment that would have endangered British jobs and British interests, after all the huffing and puffing about courage and convictions, and after all the attacks on the fence-sitting of the Liberal Democrats, they took the tough, principled and forward-looking decision to give Conservative Members a three-line Whip on an abstention that would have set back our national interests by 40 years. They talk about wanting to be constructive in Europe; in fact, they would wreck the national interest.</p>

It is this Government&#146;s view that we must continue to look outward and to try to shape the world, building alliances to tackle the global problems that we face. That is why we are committed to playing a full role in Europe, driving the European Union&#146;s agenda and making a positive difference to the British people. That is what this treaty is about. That is why I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 I begin on a note of agreement with the Foreign Secretary. Given that there are so many disagreements, it is a happy note on which to start. He paid many warm tributes to those of us who have taken part in the debates over the past couple of months. He was very generous to me&#151;if being called antediluvian is a form of generosity; I suppose in Parliament we are grateful for small compliments. Indeed, he has shown himself to be a vigorous debater throughout all our proceedings, and one of the brightest members of the Cabinet, as he is known to be, although in the current state of the Government that may not be such an extraordinary accolade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80311-0006.htm_para21"><a name="080311109000002">I certainly pay tribute to the Minister for Europe who, as the Foreign Secretary said, has always performed with great patience and humour, and will probably now become the portable lightning conductor for the Government and move from one Department to another. I also pay tribute to many Labour Members. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) has been quoted by all of us in almost every speech we have given. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) vied with me to persecute the Liberal Democrats and call for a referendum. The right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) spoke many times, only to meet in the final hours the tragic news that Peter Mandelson may be offered a second term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80311-0006.htm_para22"><a name="080311109000003">An extraordinary number&#151;84&#151;of my right hon. and hon. Friends have taken part in these proceedings. When one of them has spoken 210 times&#151;it feels to those of us who often talk to him in the No Lobby like 310 times&#151;that is a considerable debating contribution. I join the Secretary of State in the camaraderie that has infused those of us who have participated in the debate. I thought that he was going to propose an annual reunion at one stage, but perhaps we will not go that far.</p>

Its scrutiny by the House has not been as extensive or as detailed as it should have been, or indeed as was promised. Amendments supported by Members in all parts of the House that would have made improvements to the future scrutiny of changes to our relations with the European Union have been rejected. Above all, it continues to be the case that the Bill would come into force without ever being submitted for the consent of the British people in either a general election or a referendum. For all those reasons, we shall have no hesitation in voting against Third Reading tonight.</p>

When questioned on whether a referendum on the EU constitution was promised in 2004 because it represented a fundamental shift in the balance of power, the right hon. Gentleman said that that was not the reason. The reason why a referendum was promised on that occasion, and therefore was in the Labour party&#146;s election manifesto, was apparently to &#147;clear the air&#148; on the European issue. So after all the talk of constitutional practice and the necessity for a declaration of the contents of the treaty to be decisive in determining whether a referendum was held, it turned out that in the Foreign Secretary&#146;s own view, the Government of whom he was part promised a referendum not because of any constitutional practice or any particular contents of the previous treaty, but because they wanted to clear the air.</p>

stop the nonsense of pretending that the two treaties are fundamentally different, and to admit that the early commitment to a referendum was entirely for short-term party motives, for which the term &#147;clear the air&#148; is the shorthand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80311-0007.htm_para7"><a name="080311109000023">For the truth is that the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister now believe that the former Prime Minister made a serious error in promising a referendum, and that that error has reduced them to arguing that something that is 90 per cent. the same is fundamentally different. The Government promised a referendum in 2004 because they were approaching a general election and the former Prime Minister thought he might even win a referendum, whereas today we are probably somewhat further from an election and the current Prime Minister thinks that winning a referendum is beyond him.

 If I am following the right hon.

Is he therefore saying that if we pass into law tonight the treaty that he avers is the same as the old constitution, the position of his party will be to have a referendum on that? We need to know; the nation needs to know.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman says that the nation needs to know. I am saying that a referendum should be held on this treaty; that is the clear implication of everything I am saying. As I have frequently explained, quite a lot of water has to pass under the bridge before there will be any possibility of moving on to the question raised by the right hon. Gentleman, to whom I should also have paid tribute for his many interventions in these debates, including the most memorable one, when he said that the Prime Minister had been wrong about the weight of European regulation&#151;which means that we look forward to his interventions from the Back Benches for many years to come; we have all that to look forward to.</p>

The promising of a referendum and then the refusal to give one are nothing to do with constitutional practice or Ministers weighing matters in the balance, but are everything to do with the sharp practice of Ministers focused solely on what they could or could not get away with. Thus they have found themselves not only denying a referendum when a commitment to hold one was given, but denying it for different reasons from those that they usually give in public. On any assessment of transparency and integrity in politics, their sequence of arguments has been about as low down the scale as it is possible to get.</p>

 I believe that the Government should have put the case for their own vision of the future of Europe in the past two or three years, between the rejection of the constitution in 2005 and the agreement on the Lisbon treaty in 2007. Instead, they sat immobile, saying that the constitution was dead, that it was a parrot that had died and that no negotiations were taking place. They allowed the negotiations to happen to them, rather than influence the negotiations and put forward their own vision of the future. Tragically, the opportunity was missed.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point.

The line-by-line scrutiny that a Bill of this nature should receive and that the Government promised, partly as a response to the demand for a referendum, has not taken place in the way that the nation had every right to expect. The media were informed by the Government last autumn that 20 full days of debate would take place in this House, but today we come to the end of those debates after 14 days, compared with 29 days of debate on the treaty of Maastricht. The Bill has only eight clauses yet clause 4, on the increase of the powers of the European Parliament, was debated for less than 15 minutes and clause 5, on the amendment of the founding treaties, was not debated at all.</p>

 The Government have repeatedly said that unanimity is the rule in matters of defence.

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The importance of those issues should have merited substantial debate on the Floor of the House and defence should have merited a separate day of debate, which is what we argued when the procedural motion was tabled at the end of January.

On the subject of the proceedings to come in the upper House, I put it to them that it is not too late to learn lessons from the resignation of three senior members of their Front-Bench team and to honour the commitment to vote for a referendum that they and the rest of us made. The votes last Wednesday demonstrated that with their support the move for a referendum on the treaty could have been carried in the House. At the next general election, everything they say about a referendum will be against the backdrop of the fact that they could have brought about a referendum on this treaty had they so wished.</p>

Although three members of the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench team voted with us on a referendum and resigned, there are eight others who voted with us on a referendum whom the leader of the Liberal Democrats did not have the courage to sack. I can tell him that that is no way to run a Government, if that is something that has ever entered his head. We may be seeing not only a new version of collective responsibility, but a new form of extended abstention, in which a party abstains from voting on something to which it was committed, and its leader abstains from doing anything about colleagues whom he told to abstain but who did not do so. It is abstention as a way of life, but it is not exactly the change in politics that people had in mind. The result is that the Bill still lacks the requirement for a referendum that should so obviously be included in it.</p>

We call for a referendum not just so that people can say no to the treaty, but so that they can have their say&#151;yes or no&#151;on the many profound changes in it. Our debates have proved that the changes are fundamental to our relationship with the EU. To name but four of the changes, there is: the movement of criminal justice and policing from intergovernmental to supranational control; the end of the rotating presidency, shared between Europe&#146;s countries, and its replacement with a new EU  <br>

 I shall give way shortly, but I want to take a few moments to recall, if I may, a little of my personal history and to revert briefly to the early 1970s. I had come from Australia as a student, as many hon. Members know, and had only recently made my home in this country. I was an enthusiastic young member of the Labour party, and I went, as enthusiastic members do, to the Labour party conference. In search of enlightenment, I went to the fringe meeting of the Labour Common Market safeguards committee, no less&#151;and fringe indeed it was. I had the opportunity to listen to two gentlemen who were then Members of this House&#151;Bryan Gould and the late Peter Shore. As an expatriate Australian, I had some sympathy with Bryan Gould&#146;s position. He was particularly worried about New Zealand butter, and distressed that the United Kingdom, by joining the Common Market, as it then was, would turn its back on the Commonwealth, with its system of Commonwealth trading preferences, and abandon the farmers of Australia and New Zealand. The more I listened to him and to Peter Shore, the more horrified I became by the chauvinism, protectionism and sheer little Englandism of it all, and I decided there and then that I would have no truck with that.</p>

 Like my right hon. Friend, I remember that period. What Conservative Members are not telling us is that  another alternative to the Commonwealth was being considered at that time&#151;the Scandinavian dimension. Furthermore, what is being missed in all these debates is the fact that everybody knew, when they signed up to the treaty of Rome, that all things would flow from that. We cannot turn the clock back. If we should ever have had a referendum, it was on the single market, because everything&#151;the Bank and the whole lot&#151;flowed from that, and that is not being faced up to in these debates.</p>

We have heard many right hon. and hon. Members who have served in this House for far longer than I have say that these debates have often felt like a &#147;Groundhog Day&#148;-style re-run of the Maastricht debates nearly 16 years ago.</p>

 I am reluctant to interrupt this fascinating journey through the right hon. Lady&#146;s CV. Nevertheless, if she wants a straightforward debate on these matters, it would benefit the House if she would be straightforward about whether she sees the European Union as an intergovernmental organisation or supports the supranational elements in this treaty, which for many of us fly in the face of the intergovernmental approach that she says she admires, for example in the Commonwealth.</p>

 I strongly support the treaty, in all its aspects. I strongly support the European Union as an organisation&#151;I have argued this point before&#151;in which Governments share sovereignty on issues where they believe that by pooling sovereignty we can do better together than we can do alone. The Union is quite different in its nature from the British Commonwealth, which has its own strengths but is a completely different kind of association. Although many of the arguments and, I suspect, the speeches that we have heard in the past few weeks are similar&#151;perhaps identical&#151;to those that the House heard during the Maastricht debates, the hon.

 Does the right hon. Lady not accept that the reason why the Conservative party has shifted its position is that the European Union has shifted its position? The British people have found out that the pooling of sovereignty to which she refers has proceeded to such an extent that we, the elected representatives of the people of this country, are no longer able to decide on a whole raft of issues on their behalf because powers have been progressively handed over to Brussels.

 My hon. Friend is right and psychologists would doubtless have an interesting time analysing the reasons.

 My difficulty with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s position is that he and many Conservative Members persistently refuse to recognise that the treaty secures so many of the objectives that they claim to support. As was concluded by the senior expert group, of which Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, who I understand advises the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Front-Bench team on national security, is a member, the Lisbon treaty strengthens the position of member states in a number of respects&#151; including the fact that the president of the European Council will serve more than six months, so that it is more than a rotating position.</p>

Now, however, the hon. Gentleman is tabling amendments that are virtually identical to the amendment tabled by those on his Front Bench.

 That issue was dealt with fully in our debate last week. Although I supported a referendum on the constitutional treaty, for all the reasons that have been given in the House and outside, I do not support a referendum on the treaty. Nor would I support for a moment the position that the Opposition have taken of threatening to renegotiate the treaty after it has been ratified by Parliament and by each of the 26 other members of the European Union. Rather like with the Labour party manifesto of 1983, that policy position simply could not be advanced by any party that was serious about forming a Government.</p>

 That is a pretty desperate argument, given that for months on end Telegraph Group newspapers have misreported what has been going on in the European Union; that is also true of many other newspapers.

 Is not the real issue the fact that after 12 days of debate on the treaty, the official Opposition have not been able to explain how the reduction in the number of Commissioners, the changes to the rotating presidency or any other of the organisational changes are in any way constitutional issues more important than the decision to promote the single currency, establish the single market or join the European Union in the first place?

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As I listened to the concluding remarks of the right hon.

They take our membership increasingly for granted, just as they take for granted all the benefits that flow from membership&#151;particularly the fact that, as European citizens, we can all travel, study, work, live or retire in any part of the European Union.</p>

I am thinking of a debate dominated not by questions of institutional reform, but by the real challenges that face our world. As we have heard so often in these debates, those can be tackled effectively only if we work with our partners in the EU.</p>

I say that in a spirit of genuine self-criticism as someone who was one of the staunchest pro-European members of Tony Blair&#146;s Cabinet. With the ratification of this treaty, however, I believe that we have a great opportunity to open a new chapter in Britain&#146;s membership of the European Union, to explain more effectively to our constituents why we are tackling certain issues through the EU and to strengthen even further the relationships and friendships with our European partners within this Union, which have served us so well over the past 10 years and enabled us to shape so much of European policy in a way that is right not only for our country but for Europe as a whole.</p>

Does she also recall that when she and I were in government, my budget was cut to &#163;200,000 and that when I came to a distinguished Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and asked for a little more money to help, I was, alas, sent away empty handed?</p>

It simply involves making the existing arrangements work better, so that the EU is fit for purpose and can be ever more successful. That is what the anti-Europeans do not like.

Many more areas of legislation and budget setting will now take place using the co-decision process, including CAP. For Liberal Democrats such as me who have complained about CAP and, indeed, about Europe&#146;s democratic deficit for many years, the Lisbon treaty addresses that point with real reforms.

 I absolutely agree. Liberal Democrats believe that it is useful to talk to and work with colleagues in other countries, because they often have good ideas, whether on elections&#151;proportional representation, for example&#151;the reform of education or health. Engaging with colleagues in Europe is a sensible thing to do for the people whom we come here to serve.</p>

Yet while experienced Conservatives welcome such measures, Conservative Front Benchers oppose them. They should be in no doubt that we will remind voters that the Conservatives voted against measures to catch sex offenders, to curb the illegal importation of drugs and guns and to tackle terrorism, which is how out of touch they have become with the modern world.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman had read the treaty, he would know that some of the issues that I have described are currently dealt with through qualified majority voting, which means that one member state can prevent the adoption of sensible measures to tackle them. If he has not grasped that yet, he has not grasped a point that is fundamental to how the European Union works and some of the problems with which the treaty deals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80311-0010.htm_para22"><a name="080311109000192">What has really struck me during our debates has been the utter failure of the treaty&#146;s Conservative opponents to give any example of the transfer by the treaty of significant powers and competences from the United Kingdom to Brussels. Despite all the usual guff about the surrender of British sovereignty, concrete examples have come there none. There are examples that the Conservatives could have given, but they have not drawn our attention to them, because those examples do not really help their case.</p>

It makes sense for EU member states to have the ability to work together closely on energy policy, given the need to liberalise energy markets, to protect energy supply and to work together on new technologies such as renewables. I cannot believe that the Conservatives want a UK-only space policy so badly that they would oppose joint EU working on space.</p>

 As the hon.

The leaflet focuses on five areas in its attempt to alarm and mislead people. Its first charge is that Britain&#146;s voting strength will be cut by a third. As I have said, our voting share will increase by almost 50 per cent. The Democracy Movement also says that the control of Brussels is being extended over our criminal justice system. There is no mention of the UK opt-ins&#151;our ability to veto any extension of joint working to tackle crime, if we so choose&#151;and there is no mention that co-operation on criminal justice is restricted to cross-border issues, such as beating international organised crime and tackling the international trade in drugs, guns and people, which one would have thought supporters of the Democracy Movement would favour.</p>

As our debates have shown, that is also untrue. The proposal that the existing presidency of the European Council should change from a six-month rotation to a more permanent two-and-a-half year position means that such a president will not be created and that there will be no president of the EU who is akin to a US President. As for the lie that a Foreign Minister is being created, the fact that the EU has no foreign policy on anything unless and until 27 real Foreign Ministers from all member states unanimously agree shows what nonsense that charge is.</p>

They would doubtless sit down with parties that think like they do&#151;Sinn Fein, the Dutch Party for the Animals and the Italian Northern League&#151;to hammer out an alternative vision and put it to European Governments. They would then try to work out whether they could hammer out a renegotiated settlement, but other Ministers and Governments in Europe would look on that approach with disdain.

I was in favour of an all-singing, all-dancing referendum on our membership of the European Union because I was fed up with the drip, drip of Euroscepticism. I felt that it was the only way in which we could properly explore the issue of being in the European Union. Then I met and spoke to the Foreign Secretary, who convinced me that&#151;<i> [Laughter.] </i>It was not in a darkened corner, it was a proper discussion.

not want the House to infer from his comments that when he told the voters of Leicester, East, in May 2005 that a referendum was very important to decide our European destiny, they were intelligent enough to understand the issues involved, but that two and a half years on, they are too stupid and would be too influenced by the wicked print and broadcast media, and that he is therefore reneging on the solemn promise that he made to his electors in May 2005.</p>

 I did not say that to the electors. What was proposed then was a referendum on the constitution. What the House is discussing is not a constitution but a treaty, and it contains the very reforms that the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) correctly said that I spoke about when I addressed his forum as Minister for Europe. It is essential that a dynamic institution such as the EU should develop. Its enlargement means that there must be changes to how it operates, to make it more efficient and effective. That is why we have the treaty.</p>

 That is an important point. The Foreign Secretary has probably not been able to convince the tabloids that there is a difference between the constitution and the treaty, but I think that he has convinced the British people. The problem that we have in the debate about Europe is the tabloids. The <i> Daily Mail</i>, <i> The Sun </i>and the other tabloid newspapers, apart from the <i> Daily Mirror</i>, are absolutely against anything European. It is therefore vital that we have a debate with the British people, as we have been able to.</p>

That co-operation is essential. Without co-operation through organisations such as Europol and Eurojust, we will never be able to deal with the people who perpetrate organised crime or with the real problems of immigration.</p>

Like other right hon. and hon. Members, I have seen pictures and read stories about how people are exploited by those who bring them in gangs from places such as Moldova. I recently saw a DVD about someone who was brought here from the Punjab and told that they would have a better life in the UK. They were brought from the Punjab to Bucharest, then to Moldova, Moscow, Albania and Amsterdam, and then to the UK.

 The right hon. Gentleman is making a cogent and coherent argument; such arguments have been rare from the Labour Benches. Does he accept that although it is always difficult to stop illegal immigration, it is less difficult for an island? The treaty says that we cannot have any internal border controls or any controls on movement through our ports and airports, and that we have to rely instead on the much more porous borders at the other edge of Europe. Does that not make it more difficult, rather than easier, to control illegal immigration?</p>

 I am not sure that that is actually what the treaty says. However, if people are determined to travel all the way from Amritsar to Amersham via all those other countries, we need the co-operation of our European partners in order to prevent that from happening. It is no good for us to feel that because we are an island we should let the rest of Europe get on and do what they are doing. We need the co-operation of the French in particular if we are to stop illegal immigration. That is why the treaty is so important and why it is so important that we should look at the mechanisms through which the EU operates.</p>

Members from both sides of the House when they say that it is really important that Europe can grow up with its population&#151;its population has been running ahead of it. People are concerned about the way in which some aspects of the bureaucracy in Brussels operate. Anyone who has served as a Minister, whether they were a Conservative Minister or a Labour Minister, will know how difficult it is sometimes to deal with that. The treaty seeks to give more power to those countries that can co-operate, for example on QMV. Maastricht extended QMV. If hon. Members look at the figures on the application of QMV, they will find that when it is used in the European Council, the UK is on the winning side 90 per cent. of the time. That means that the rest of Europe is following our agenda.</p>

If we reject the treaty, we will throw that respect and influence away, and that would be totally wrong.</p>

 Absolutely. In 1997, this country was on the fringes of Europe. We were not even consulted on issues. We were put on the sidelines because of the strong relationship between France and Germany. It is simply not possible in a Europe of 27 for France and Germany to run the EU.

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80311-0012.htm_para12"><a name="080311127000010">The point is that treaties have to be reversed from time to time, in whole or in part. The decision of Lord Denning, in McCarthy <i> v. </i>Smith, followed by Lord Diplock in Garland <i> v.</i> British Rail Engineering Ltd, clearly states the British Parliament&#146;s continuing right: it is unassailable constitutional law. With respect to the European Communities Act 1972 and the European treaty that is part of the treaty of Lisbon&#151;the treaty of Rome and following treaties are all amalgamated with consolidation and amendments in the treaty of Lisbon&#151;the British Parliament has the continuing right to override those provisions in whole or in part. The crucial words are</p>
<a name="80311-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="080311127000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;or any provision in it&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80311-0012.htm_para13"><a name="080311127000011">meaning the treaty. As and when we decide that we want to renegotiate we have an unassailable right to do so as a matter of constitutional law and the case law that is at the very apex of our judicial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80311-0012.htm_para14"><a name="080311127000012">It is essential for us to understand that point, which is why my new clause 9, supported by 47 Members, and the reasoned amendment that I tabled for today, supported by a new set of Members, are so important. I was glad to hear my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) say, in response to my intervention, that we needed a constitutional safeguard. I shall not go through all the arguments we made the other day, but it is imperative that we come up with clear, legally watertight wording that reflects those decisions, or we shall be unable to renegotiate, although we know we must&#151;for example, on over-regulation. By Commissioner Verheugen&#146;s own admission, over-regulation costs European economies &#163;100 billion a year&#151;many billions to the British economy. We shall have to renegotiate the provisions, so we need a sound constitutional basis in our domestic law to enable us, where negotiations fail or falter, to tell other member states that we have reserved our position. The House should be in a position to tell other member states that we will renegotiate because we have retained the right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80311-0012.htm_para15"><a name="080311127000013">Without going through all the arguments again, I say only that the consequence of acceptance of the treaty is that the European Court of Justice and our courts will be determined to apply case law, because that is what declaration 17 says. It may be only a declaration but it will still be used, just like the working time provisions that were meant to be only a declaration. The courts will say, &#147;You have accepted the constitutional assumptions on which the European Court has made its determinations.&#148; Those assumptions include&#151;unequivocally, as is shown in cases such as Costa and Handelgesellschaft&#151;the fact that national Parliaments and national constitutions are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. All the legislating we do in this place will be reduced&#151;pulverised&#151;by the significance of the case law of the ECJ where it chooses to exercise it. Because we have given away so many powers by handing over competences, we are reducing and draining away the powers of the House, but they are not ours to give away. It is not our House. It is not our Parliament. It belongs to the voters.</p>

Conservatives believe in that. I personally would like always to obey the Whip, and I have no problem whatever doing so in relation to the Bill. We have acted together. There have been one or two blips&#151;the other night, for example&#151;but that is not as important as the fact that we work together.</p>

 Tillack is the man, yes. He went to the European Court of Justice looking for justice, saying that his right to privacy had been breached, and he lost his case. He then went to the European Court of Human Rights, which awarded him &#8364;30,000 and expenses. The hon. Gentleman says that there is no appeal, but in such cases human rights are safeguarded by the European Court of Human Rights. If our citizens find that their rights have been breached by the European Court of Justice, they have recourse to another court.</p>

 That is a very interesting point. I do not want to spend the whole debate on this issue, but it is a fact that the European Court of Justice cannot be appealed against. Tillack went to a separate court. As it happens, we endorse in law the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, but we retain the House&#146;s sovereignty over the Human Rights Act 1998. I do not want to go right into the Tillack case, but I simply make those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80311-0012.htm_para17"><a name="080311127000019">The treaty was conceived and born out of deceit. We know that because we members of the European Scrutiny Committee heard how it was bounced on our Foreign Secretary. On the way in which the treaty was conceived, and born out of the German Government&#146;s presidency, I say:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="080311127000139">&#147;Treason doth never prosper: what&#146;s the reason?</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80311-0012.htm_para18"><a name="080311127000020">The fact is that the treaty is being ratified, and if the Bill is successfully enacted, nobody will be able to turn around and claim that it is treason, because we, as citizens, will all be bound under the treaty. It is not merely a question of whether our constituents will be adversely affected, although I believe that they will be. We are talking about much more than that; we will be made citizens of the European Union, with knobs on. That is another matter that ought to be of grave concern, but it has barely been touched on in our debates.</p>

Is Parliament to be reduced, by references to banging on, simply to a forum for platitudes and perceptions? No. We are talking about the daily lives of our constituents and we have an absolute obligation&#151;a duty&#151;to go on about it. I would like anyone to challenge me on this question: by what right, and what duty, could anybody stop us saying what we need to say on behalf of our constituents?</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, while some of us perhaps do not have his degree of arrogance, we believe that we represent our constituents well? We believe that the bulk of our constituents do not like some aspects of Europe because they are complex, bureaucratic and have the drawbacks that one would expect there to be when 27 countries are trying to make something work, but the fact is that they have had 60 years of peace, prosperity and the pursuit of happiness because of the European Union.</p>

 I would be a good deal more impressed if I thought that the Labour party was prepared to keep its promises on the referendum. Having said that, the question of whether the system works is extremely important, and I want to come to it in a moment. We are not talking about theoretical abstractions, or the theology of sovereignty. We are concerned with practical questions to do with the daily lives of our constituents. That is the acid test.</p>

First, I think that I may be entitled to say that my father was killed in Normandy, fighting against tyranny in Europe. Secondly, it happens that I have three grandchildren, one of whom is half Greek, and one of whom is half Spanish. Two of my children were married in France, and I have one daughter-in-law who is Italian, and am about to have another who is half Czech.</p>

 I really do disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It is an important point, and I recognise that many people in the House had family who were involved in the second world war, but I make the point from the vantage point of being accused of being a Europhobe. I am simply pointing out that the House of Commons was, as de Gaulle said in 1960 when he came here, at the foundation of why he was able to go back to a free France. Actually it is NATO, not the European Union, that preserves peace and security in Europe, and I also say this to the hon. Gentleman: look at what is happening in Kosovo. I have to put those points, because they are extremely important. I should also like to say to him that one need only consider the situation as regards Japan: we engaged in a war with Japan, but nobody could honestly say that the fact that we emerged victorious had anything to do with the European Union.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a passionate, sincere case on behalf of his constituents, as always. He will be as disappointed as I am by the insulting, infantile level of debate on the part of Labour Members who are trying to justify the decision to ram through the treaty over the past few weeks. Does he agree that we are witnessing an embedding of the estrangement of a plutocratic elite, who want to create a united states of Europe as a political entity, from the people to whom they are meant to be answerable, just as he and other Members are answerable to the people?</p>

 I agree with that 100 per cent. It is a very important point, which we have to re-emphasise. The reality is that the system does not work; that is another problem. As I say, this is not just a matter of theory. The system has not, does not, and will not work. The right hon. Member for Leicester, East mentioned the Lisbon agenda. I will not go right into that issue, but the Lisbon agenda is not working. We in the European Scrutiny Committee have been given documents that show why it had to be kick-started again, and why it is not working. Will Hutton, who was the rapporteur to the Lisbon agenda, came to our Committee and said that he did not think it was working properly. There are huge sums of money involved and it is not effective.</p>

Old tensions are re-emerging. There is protectionism at the heart of French policies. There are problems between the European Union and Kosovo, whose Parliament is standing out against the European Union. There are enormous strikes in Germany, which are barely reported, and 19 per cent. unemployment in the eastern part of Germany. The Spanish economy is faltering. NATO is under threat. Russia is reawakening. The Hungarian referendum the other day demonstrates the fact that there is not enough money to pay for the wishes of the people in that country. Fledgling democracies will not be given the money that they were expecting and will start turning against the European Union as it is currently constructed.</p>

 Whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not, the House of Commons is democratically elected. I am fascinated to learn tonight that the Scottish National party seems to be throwing in its lot with the more nationalistic&#151;if I may put it like that&#151;wing of the English Conservative party. That is a marriage made on the green Benches but it will end up in a funny place.

gently say to&#151;I am tempted to call him my hon. Friend the Member for Stone&#151;my honourable debating partner that every treaty implies the coming together and the sharing of some sovereignty between its signatory nations. If not, there would be no point in treaties.</p>

We have the sovereign power in the House of Commons. We do not need article 49 in the new treaty, which I find rather ill-written, in that it permits nations to leave the European Union. We can leave the European Union tomorrow by a vote of this House of Commons. France can leave the European Union tomorrow, so can Poland, so can Sweden, by a vote of their sovereign Parliaments. The real problem is that what the Conservatives want is not on offer. It is not on offer from the World Trade Organisation treaty, from our Spanish friends in the treaty of Utrecht, or from my left-wing friends in the North Atlantic treaty&#151;the treaty that set up NATO. Treaties are about sharing some sovereignty for a greater good.</p>

would mean the end of Britain as a nation state. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks famously said before the 2001 election that to vote for a pro-European Labour party again to be returned to power would mean that Britain would become a foreign land. That hyperbole does neither its Labour nor its Conservative articulators any good at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para1"><a name="080311127000074">I want to deal briefly with three of the myths that have been perpetrated throughout this debate&#151;I mean the debate beyond the wide-ranging debate in the House in the past two months that has taken place more generally in recent years. The first myth is the notion of Europe as a behemoth&#151;a giant devouring machine that is eradicating sovereignty and the power of this House of Commons. If one looks at the simple economic facts, 99 per cent. of all Europe&#146;s income&#151;its gross national income, to use the technical phrase&#151;stays in the hands of its nation states. Of the 1 per cent. transferred to Brussels, 85 per cent. is immediately transferred to nation states in the form of agricultural subsidies. I share the criticisms of the common agricultural policy, but if we did not have the CAP, we would have a BAP&#151;a British agricultural policy&#151;and all the gentlemen who get the massive subsidies that they now do from Brussels would be making life hell, particularly for Conservative Members, who tend to represent more agricultural communities than my party does, by demanding massive agricultural subsidies. One seventh&#151;15 per cent.&#151;of 1 per cent. of that money stays with the Commission for it to do what it wants with it. I put it to the House that the notion that one can create a super-state or a federal monster, or that one can destroy the national sovereignty of the 27 member states of Europe with just one seventh of 1 per cent. of their money, does not make sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para2"><a name="080311127000075">The second great myth is that Europe is dictating all the laws of this House. The shadow Foreign Secretary and I had an exchange during a previous debate, and he brought it up very gently and respectfully again today, quoting the Prime Minister against me, or perhaps me against the Prime Minister. Of course, all Prime Ministers at all times are infallible&#151;they cannot be wrong. I occasionally have a kind of old-fashioned interest in the truth. That has often got in the way of successful politics, which is probably why I am not a successful politician.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para3"><a name="080311127000076">I asked the Library to freshen up its continuing study about the amount of legislation that we decide on in this Parliament that emanates from the European Union. I asked for the document to be sent to me last week after that exchange, but it is publicly available in the Library. It showed that so far this century approximately 10 per cent., at the highest point, of all the laws that we pass are to do with the European Union. Within that 10 per cent., 50 per cent. of trade rules to do with the single market stem from the European Union and 25 per cent. of environmental rules are to do with the European Union. I think that the Prime Minister used the word &#147;regulations&#148;&#151;I do not want to gloss what he said; he did not talk about laws&#151;and, yes, 50 per cent. of our regulations that are to do with the single market originate from the European Union, just as they must for every other country if we want the single market to work for them.</p>

responsible for 90 per cent. of legislation, such as taxation, health spending, education, policing, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, sending people to prison, decisions on whether to go to war, and our main foreign policy alliances. All those matters are settled in this House, as they are in the Assembl&#233;e Nationale, the Bundestag, the Sejm, the Cortes and the other national Parliaments in other European countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para5"><a name="080311127000078">The second great myth is that the new treaty is identical to the constitutional treaty. I have some knowledge of that matter as the Europe Minister responsible at the time. Conservative Members tend to pray in aid their experience of the Convention. They make interesting historical points, but the main recommendations of the Convention presided over by Giscard d&#146;Estaing were rejected by the intergovernmental conference that followed. The constitutional treaty that emerged from the process was, in turn, rejected by the voters of France and the Netherlands, and it was declared dead here, not so much by my party, but by Conservative members. I remember well the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) saying, &#147;I am a doctor. I know death when I see it. This constitution is dead.&#148; The less original Opposition Members referred to the famous dead parrot of lore. We all agreed that the treaty was dead, but for the purposes of anti-European argument, it has to be brought back to life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para6"><a name="080311127000079">The pledge to have a referendum on which all parties agreed in their 2005 election manifestos related to that constitutional treaty, but it was killed barely a month after the election of new Parliament, and those commitments died with it. At the end of each Session, any laws that have not been passed in this House die. Unless we are introducing a new constitutional innovation in the House that any pledge given in general terms on any issue has to be sustained throughout the eternity of successive Parliaments, I do not understand how Conservative Members can intellectually say that today&#146;s treaty is identical to the constitutional treaty that was killed, even if much of the anti-European press make that argument.</p>

 No, we never have. All we have said, as most European leaders have said, is that it is between 90 and 96 per cent. the same&#151;similar enough that the promise to have a referendum holds. That is what the right hon. Gentleman should be holding to.</p>

 I accept that the hon. Gentleman, many other hon. Members and many members of the public believe that.

Gentleman says that the treaty is 90 per cent. the same he is saying that it is not the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para7"><a name="080311127000084">In two key respects, the new treaty is fundamentally different.

Council of Europe flag, designed in 1954, which was adopted as the European flag, but the most important difference is that it leaves all the other treaties in place. The constitutional treaty rolled all of the existing treaties into one giant document. It was a re-founding moment for the whole of the Common Market and the European Union. The Lisbon treaty leaves all existing treaties in place. Unless we have a new doctrine that says that we must have referendums on any significant international treaty, it is not right to pray in aid a pledge given on a document that was killed in June 2005 by the Dutch and the French.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para8"><a name="080311127000085">The third great myth is that Britain should look to different areas of the world because Europe is pass&#233;, and that our future lies on the other side of the Atlantic, or in engaging with our global partners in the shape of the rising powers of China and India. Yet we export more to the Netherlands than we do to China; Switzerland invests more in the UK than all of the Asian powers put together. We want a powerful relationship with the United States, but I note that last year European growth was higher than that of America; inflation was lower and productivity was higher. In dollar terms, the UK now has higher GDP per capita than the United States.</p>

Between 800,000 and a million of our citizens live in Spain, but they are not treated as unwelcome immigrants, as anyone who speaks with a foreign accent in Britain is treated by some sections of the press, or by some in our political system.</p>

Opposition Members tabled amendments, and were able to divide up their time as they wish. The shadow defence spokesman could have led in that debate, had the Front-Bench team so decided.</p>

From trips to Washington as a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I believe that we are witnessing an important change in American strategic thinking. The go-it-alone ideas expressed by Donald Rumsfeld&#151;perhaps sometimes brutally when he was Secretary of Defence&#151;and some others who are loosely called neo-conservatives are now perceived by the State Department, the Pentagon and, I believe, the White House, to be redundant. America needs to rebuild its partnership with Europe and we, as Europeans, need to rebuild our partnership with America.</p>

The American decision to give a major US air force contract to Airbus, which is important for British jobs and British industry, signals an American desire to work more closely with Europe and accept the sort of thinking that the former Prime Minister set out in the St. Malo declaration of 1998 about building more coherence around European defence. I welcome that. The security challenges of the world are too serious to be handled exclusively by the United States&#151;or even exclusively by the United States and Britain.</p>

Kosovo. That must be understood. The notion that, as a result of the treaty, President Sarkozy or Chancellor Merkel will substantially change their actions as the democratically elected heads of the Governments of France and of Germany, or that what the Bundestag allows Chancellor Merkel to do or what President Sarkozy chooses to do about rejoining NATO will be affected, is wrong.

We see none of that in the Conservative party. Never, in the Conservative party&#146;s history, have such isolationist prejudices been given free rein, with hardly a check, especially from younger Members.

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para16"><a name="080311127000102">I oppose Third Reading, first for procedural reasons. The imposition of a tailor-made guillotine that limited, in theory, each day&#146;s debate on clause 2&#151;the heart and guts of the Bill&#151;to one and a half hours, which had to be amended to allow a little more time, defeated the purpose of providing the measure with legitimacy in the country and the Chamber. My right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary detailed that to some extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para17"><a name="080311127000103">On day one, we did not debate borders, visas, asylum and migration&#151;or judicial co-operation in civil matters, which was the third grouping for that day. On day two, we did not debate difficulties in the supply of certain products, meaning energy. On day three, we had only an hour and a half to consider the charter of fundamental rights. Not all Members who were present could speak, and the subject of personal data was simply not discussed. On day four, the internal market and common commercial policy took up the allocated three hours&#151;an amendment to the original guillotine. Not all hon. Members who wished to speak got in. Social policies, free movement of workers and establishment were not debated. Intellectual property and economic and monetary policy were not discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para18"><a name="080311127000104">On day five, the external representation of the EU&#151;the foreign service, or whatever one chooses to call it&#151;took up the three hours. Not everyone could speak and the common security and defence policy, let alone other aspects of that policy, was therefore not debated. On day six, which was about aid and development, competence and policy took up the two hours so that the subject that mattered to the world outside&#151;aid operations&#151;was not debated. Incidentally, we got two hours instead of the hour and a half that was initially allocated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para19"><a name="080311127000105">On day seven, which was about competences of the EU and its institutions, relationships with member states took up the three hours allocated. Let us remember that the Government graciously altered their guillotine to provide another hour and a half so that the debate had three hours rather than an hour and a half, but what was not debated? The operation of the institutions, the EU constitutional and treaty revision issues and legislative and decision-making procedures &#151;three whole groupings&#151;were not discussed. It is impossible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para20"><a name="080311127000106">On day eight, the topic was the effect on Parliament&#151;that is what I was really interested in&#151;and it took up the allocated two hours. Again, the Government had graciously extended their guillotine to allow us an extra 60 minutes. However, we still could not discuss in that extra time &#147;Competences: remaining issues&#148; or climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80311-0014.htm_para21"><a name="080311127000107">The custom-made guillotine, introduced in the name of the Labour Chief Whip&#151;the undertaker, as I think of him&#151;and the Foreign Secretary as the leader on the matter, is brutal. However, the other person who signed the motion, of whom we have not seen a whit, is supposedly the Leader of the House. Where is she? Where has she been? She did not introduce the guillotine and did not attest that, on the balance of arguments, it was an appropriate way to consider what is a constitutional change if not in the European scene,  <br>

People have different views and there is no perfect way in this world, but most of us respect and recognise the purposes of the House. What are they? Has the treaty shifted the balance of power and decision away from us to other institutions? This is not a question of vanity; it concerns the power of the British people to hold to account those who make their laws. What has happened since the originating treaty, during the time I have been in Parliament, has been the constant slicing away at the concept that politicians, instead of a bureaucratic elite, should determine what is right for the people who sent us here.</p>

The Bill, which he supported, addressed two major points about referendums, the first of which was their role. I mention referendums because our amendment in that connection was defeated in the debate on the current Bill.

But the people know&#151;or rather knew&#151;that, at the end of the day, if we got it wrong, they got rid of us; and they have, as they will again. We have had certain things quoted enough&#151;we have heard Mr. Blair&#146;s latest thought, his previous thought, his middle thought and his last thought.

Now we have heard the former Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Leicester, West, suggest that we do not understand the world, that somehow it has moved on and that the people out there are better served by, effectively, decisions made by a grand bureaucracy centred in Brussels.

Why not? Because the people there represent other polities, other nations and other states. The European Parliament is only a congress, in that sense. That we should bear decisions that are made by a majority of others who are not accountable to the people we are sent here to represent is an argument in itself, and a defence of a constitutional arrangement.</p>

 The hon.

 That is probably the weakest argument that I have ever heard. If someone is proud of something that they put before the people, but that was defeated in two referendums and then altered in negotiations between countries that want something useful and if those countries come up with something that is not what that person put forward, of course the person will claim that it is the same thing. They will not want to be told that their idea was basically dumped, but that idea&#151;to have a constitution for Europe&#151;was dumped.</p>

 No, I will not. I have taken on board Mr. Deputy Speaker&#146;s caution about other people wanting to speak. I may have more to say than he is pleased with. Due to the fact that I have been chairing European Scrutiny Committee sittings, I have often had only four or five minutes to speak at the end of a debate in which I would like to have participated more. I have a number of things to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80311-0015.htm_para16"><a name="080311135000017">The point is that some people did want a constitution. If they had got away with it, there would have been one treaty, a president of Europe and a Foreign Secretary of Europe, but all those things have been taken out of the treaty. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks referred to a turf war because of the president of the Council, to whom people still refer as the &#147;president of the EU&#148;. If there was going to be a turf war, it would be between the president of the Council&#151;a Council, not Commission, member&#151;and the president of the Commission. That is what happens at the moment. The Council goes into discussions about something that the Commission proposes, and there is a turf war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80311-0015.htm_para17"><a name="080311135000018">The great thing is that someone will be representing and carrying on the work of the Council in two-and-a-half-year terms, with a Council secretariat.

All we have on the record is the Prime Minister&#146;s declaration that any time we move from having a veto to qualified majority voting&#151;using the passerelles, as they are called&#151;that will be decided on the Floor of the House. Why should there not be primary legislation? Given my analysis of the treaty and all the logic that applies to my,  <br>

and many people&#146;s, concern about the sovereignty of the House, why should there not be primary legislation for such far-reaching decisions? That is something for the Government to think about; they have not yet answered our questions about the process that involves this Parliament in the moves that we make in respect of the opt-outs and protocols.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80311-0015.htm_para19"><a name="080311135000020">I was impressed by the many contributions of the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), who unfortunately is no longer in his place. It is amazing that a man of his stature&#151;I knew him when he was a junior Minister in the Scottish Office when I was a council leader fighting against the Thatcher proposals for local government&#151;whose logic, honesty and integrity I have always respected should be sidelined not because of age or lack of talent, but simply because the Eurosceptics have what they tell me is a blocking minority on the Conservative party in opposition. If that is the case, it is a very sad day for the Conservative party and for the people in Britain that it claims to represent&#151;the businesses, the civil society and the constituents whose interests and concerns are helped along by Europe as much as by anything else we can do in this House. I wonder why the right hon. and learned Gentleman has been sidelined.</p>

That is one way of looking at it, but not how the UK&#146;s approach is regarded by everyone else I meet&#151;in the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees and in European Parliaments, for example. They respect us, but, in terms of the EU arrangements, they view us as the most detached member. We have no euro and we have no Schengen borders. Contrary to the mythology we heard earlier about Schengen borders, we do not have the same border controls. We made a virtue&#151;I believe it was the wrong thing to do&#151;in our proposals for the 2001 election of our intention not to sign Schengen and not to come within the Schengen borders, but to have our own immigration system. I think that that weakened the Schengen system, just as our non-participation in the euro weakened the euro system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80311-0015.htm_para21"><a name="080311135000022">That decision bounced back on us and we became a target for illegal immigration. After all, if someone gets into a Schengen country, they will want out of it because they have been given a transit visa, so where do those immigrants head? They go to the nearest non-Schengen country, which is the UK. That is what has happened. We took a terrible decision and if we ever get the necessary opt-ins, it will take us a long time to get the Schengen arrangements working properly.</p>

their country when the European Union was enlarged. If the right hon. Gentleman went to Poland, as I did with a former Conservative Agriculture Minister, he would find that the people of Poland believe that the problem of an enlarging Europe is that the Germans and Dutch are coming back to buy up all their land. The Poles do not make much money off their own land and are being pushed off what land they have. There have been tensions along that border for many years, which was probably being expressed in those comments from that German police officer. There is no evidence to suggest that Germany is facing the sort of problem that the right hon. Gentleman has described.</p>

 During the 1990s, when I reported for the BBC in central Europe, I remember interviewing an Austrian general on the border with Hungary who was concerned, as were the Austrian Government, about the potential for criminality from the Hungarian side, as from the Czech and Slovak side, yet within two years, it was clear that there were no such problems whatever. There may need to be transitional arrangements, but as the economies of central and eastern Europe improve in the longer term, the problem of criminality as a result of different standards of living becomes progressively ameliorated.</p>

 I take that point and hope that everyone else will. I believe that any form of xenophobia is a very bad thing for the project and, indeed, for the world we live in. We now live in a global village, as Marshall McLuhan predicted back in the 1960s. We have to get used to it and come to understand that what seems to some to be a threat may be our saving grace.</p>

There is such Commission creep because that plutocracy was given power to try to put together arrangements for the advancement of a closer and closer Europe in order to prevent Europe from being run by politicians who would go to war when they could not solve problems. We have moved on from that, however, as the process is now about economic development, social development, enlargement and making the European Union a place of safety, security and, hopefully, human rights for people who did not have them under the previous Soviet communist arrangements.</p>

There will be green papers, white papers and even the non-papers. The EU is the only organisation in the world I know that presents non-papers. I predict that they will eventually become green, then white papers and eventually directives. That is how the EU gets things on the agenda. We are used to dealing with that process every week.

even in face-to face meetings with Franco Frattini, I have said&#151;I believe I said it in <i> Hansard&#151;</i>that &#147;the constitution is dead&#148;. The constitution was dead, because that arrangement would never have got through under the barrier. Even by taking 5 per cent. out, the treaty was acceptable to the French Government, who took two days&#151;one and a half days in the Chamber of Deputies and half a day in the Senate&#151;to get it through, but I did not see an uprising in the streets of France.

I am not claiming that this is a perfect deal for the UK.

 For some people, the SNP is the bogeyman, but not for others. The European Court of Justice&#151;that is the bogeyman, an organisation that is going to come along and somehow do bad things in the name of justice. Because it is European justice is it bad? Is that the equation? If it is British justice, is it all right? Go and ask people how we treated them within our empire. Ask people now, who are denied justice&#151;for example, children are locked up in Dungavel in Scotland and in other places. That is British justice. British justice is opted out of the UN convention on the rights of the child so that we can lock up asylum seekers&#146; children. That is British justice.</p>

That is what we can contribute. Why should positive parts of the UK&#146;s perception of justice, as put forward earlier, not be available to everyone throughout the EU? Why should it not be available to an enlarged EU, which we have at the moment, or to Turkey, Croatia or any other country that wants to come and join us?

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80311-0016.htm_para25"><a name="080311135000057">I have listened to the arguments that have been made over the days of debate, and again today. The right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) and  the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) were telling us that we had nothing to worry about because this was not a constitution. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, let us see what the Dutch, the French and the Danish have said about this, but they, of course, have an interest in playing down the constitutional aspect of the document because they have populations that have made it clear that they will not tolerate a constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80311-0016.htm_para26"><a name="080311135000058">Two of those countries have voted against it. Twelve of the other countries have no axe to grind&#151;they have not had a referendum&#151;and seem to have no great concerns about whether it is a constitutional treaty. I am not going to put their views on the record again, because over the weeks of debate on this subject, hon. Members have put on the record what all of those other 12 countries, the original author of the constitution, the European Parliament and the European Commission have said. They are all on the record as saying, &#147;This is a constitution. This is the same as the document that we negotiated previously, with very little difference.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80311-0016.htm_para27"><a name="080311135000059">The second argument is that the treaty does not represent a massive transfer of power&#151;but let me mention some of the ways in which there is a transfer of power: the setting up of new EU institutions; the weakening of the UK power to block legislation; the reduction of national vetoes on votes in Europe; the new EU powers on health, social security and trade policy; and a legal toolbox for further changes, which is perhaps the most damaging aspect, because there can be more changes without us considering them in this form again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80311-0016.htm_para28"><a name="080311135000060">We are told, and many hon. Members have put it on the record again, that the sort of language used in the document has been chosen because it is important for the content and the real intent to be hidden in some way. The Prime Minister of Luxembourg said:</p>
<a name="80311-0016.htm_brev9"><a name="080311135000213"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Britain is different. Of course there will be a transfer of sovereignty&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80311-0016.htm_para31"><a name="080311135000064">The other reason suggested as to why the arguments against the treaty should not be listened to is that we are &#147;scaremongering&#148;. It is difficult to take lectures about scaremongering when hon. Members imply that if we do not keep faith with the EU and the treaty we will be pushed back into a world war: apparently we will be at Germany&#146;s throat, we will be fighting the French, or we will be after the Spanish. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) implied that if we do not vote for the Bill, somehow or other paedophiles will run free around Europe, guns will be all over the place, and we will not even get a European spaceship.</p>

 I think that the high representative and so on are significant. They are a great advantage to the UK because they give us leverage. We can either stand alone, as we could for years as the UK, or we can stand with 26 other member states. It depends on the issue. Foreign policy in the EU is decided by unanimity. It is an each-way bet. Either we stand alone if we cannot agree with the other member states, or we can agree with them and have more leverage and more power in the world. The hon.

 I do not really care which party tried to sell that line. It was the wrong line, and one that we have come to regret. What is so sad is that subsequent Governments have not sought to do anything about it. As other Members have pointed out, once we enter into arrangements such as this they are almost impossible to reverse. It is no use arguing that they were wrong at the outset and would prove devastating, because it is not possible to change them. That is why I find it sad that we have not given this Bill proper scrutiny. We are walking into something that will be irreversible.</p>

We opposed an agreement between the Irish Government, the British Government, the American Government, all the parties in the Irish Republic, all the parties in the House of Commons and all the parties in Northern Ireland. We had been told &#147;Don&#146;t even think of opposing it; no one will talk to you, let alone renegotiate the agreement.&#148; We did not believe that, and the agreement was renegotiated. Safeguards that had not been inserted in the first place were inserted.

I hope that Members will see the light between now and a quarter to 10, although I doubt it. Of course, it is not always a case of seeing the light; sometimes it is simply a case of Members managing to remove the Whips&#146; arms from their throats. If that does not happen, however, at least those of us who stood on the basis of a manifesto commitment to put this to the British people in a referendum&#151;to give them the right to have their say&#151;can walk through the Lobbies tonight with our heads held high, and oppose the Third Reading of  this Bill.</p>

The more experience I have had of politics, of being a politician and of being in this place, the more embarrassed I have felt about the fact that I got it wrong on that occasion. However, I have never liked referendums. I know that they have been described as a creature of Napoleon, but I believe that if we refer to antiquity we will find that certain Roman emperors used a form of referendum to get their own way, and I know that the Italians used them under Mussolini.</p>

seen all parties acting in a politically expedient way. The official Opposition might be doing that at present. I listened intently to the speeches on Second Reading and I was impressed by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). He is the best entertainer and performer in the House at present; he is an outstanding debater. However, when I subsequently read the Second Reading speeches, and thought about them and took out the humour, I found that there was not much substance to tell me what his position was on Europe.</p>

I also know the position of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and that little group around him that represent that strong and remarkable tradition in his party of being both liberal-minded Conservatives and pro-European. I do not say this to make a political point, but I share some of their concerns that something is going on in the modern Conservative party and that prospective members who hold similar views to those of the right hon. and learned Gentleman are being screened out from standing for winnable constituencies. I do not know whether that is because of the influence of some noble Lord, or whether there has been a worrying shift in Conservative party politics, but that sort of Conservative is being eliminated from the parliamentary party. As has been mentioned, very few of the younger generation of Members have made pro-European speeches.</p>

In political life we must judge things in the round, however.

Looking to the future, I do not unreservedly welcome the possibility of Turkey joining the EU.

One reason why I shall be voting in favour of Third reading is that the treaty is fundamentally different from the constitution. I share the view on why Giscard d&#146;Estaing said what he said; it made me very angry when during a long debate that I attended yet another speaker stood up to quote Giscard d&#146;Estaing.</p>

The hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills talked about English common law being built up over centuries. Europe is new, and we are building its measures up in a way that is parallel to the building up of English common law. We have had a series of treaties, and I like that process; one of the reasons why I shall vote in favour of Third Reading is because the treaty builds incrementally.</p>

Members used to say that Mrs.&#151;now Baroness&#151;Thatcher was wicked to introduce guillotines on such important matters and that that was the end of parliamentary democracy as we knew it; and we have heard the same arguments again over the past weeks. However, we must see such steps in the context of Governments having to get their business through. They will get their business done; I am afraid that that is the nature of this place. However, it must be said that Lisbon is a much less significant treaty than Maastricht; that was the big hurdle.</p>

The war that brought more of my generation into politics than any other was the first world war, because we thought that it should never happen again. One can read about the history of the first world war and the disgraceful decisions taken by politicians of every party across Europe that made that war happen and made millions of young men die in the trenches.

Although it brings all sorts of problems, it also brings something that one finds in the American constitution, but not in ours&#151;the pursuit of happiness.

 The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) hardly gave a ringing endorsement of the treaty. He said that it contained parts he did not like, but that on balance he would vote for it. That is an indictment of a treaty that should be at the end of a reform process. Europe should by now have addressed the widely shared concerns about its procedures and policies. It is worth reminding ourselves that the treaty was conceived seven years ago&#151;it had a long gestation period&#151;and was launched in the Laeken declaration of 2001, in which the Heads of Government who were meeting in that  <br>

Belgian town called for Europe to reform itself and described Europe as being undemocratic, complicated and remote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para0"><a name="080311135000112">The Lisbon treaty is the result of a failed reform process. It is obviously a failure. It runs to nearly 300 pages of appalling Eurojargon, so it is completely inaccessible to the ordinary voter. It is designed to be so, because the people behind it knew that the more complicated they made it, the less likely it was that people would be asked to vote on it. That was admitted by one of the vice-presidents of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Mr. Amato, who conceded that if it was designed to be a popular document, it might be put to a popular vote&#151;and they would never risk that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para1"><a name="080311135000113">This reform process has been a failure, because it makes Europe more remote. The very institutions that caused much of the grief have been given more powers. The decisions will be made by more powerful institutions more remote from the ordinary citizen. That not only ignores the instruction given in the Laeken declaration that Europe should be moved &#147;closer&#148; to the citizen; it defies and contradicts it. How can we do that when decisions on a range of new policy matters are to be taken not in the national Parliaments but in the most remote tier of government&#151;the European Union? It is not surprising that this document, or one very much like it, was rejected by the French and Dutch electorates. The problem with the European Union is that &#147;no&#148; is taken to mean &#147;yes&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para2"><a name="080311135000114">Another myth is that without the treaty, paralysis would result. We have been told that. It has been said in the debate that the treaty is needed to govern a Europe of 27 countries. I was told during the Convention on the Future of Europe that the constitutional treaty was necessary for enlargement. Indeed, Ministers told me that if I was against the constitutional treaty, I was therefore against enlargement. In the same way, we are now told that if we are against spending more money on the European budget&#151;our contributions will soon go up to &#163;6 billion a year&#151;we are against enlargement. However, enlargement happened as a result of the Convention on the Future of Europe. Another 10 countries joined, and another two have joined since, and there has been no paralysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para3"><a name="080311135000115">I ask any hon. Member who believes that there has been paralysis to spend half an hour attending at least part of the European Scrutiny Committee&#146;s weekly meeting. They can now do that because, in a radical new procedure, hon. Members can actually attend at least part of a Committee of their own House. They will see a torrent of legislation from Brussels. More than 1,000 new instruments a year are being examined. There has been no paralysis even under the existing treaties, so it is a complete Euromyth that we need a new treaty for a Europe of 27 countries.</p>

All the negotiations that took place last year to revive the treaty were in secret, and there was only a 48-hour gap between its publication and its agreement at the European Council meeting in Brussels in June. We were told in the run-up to the treaty&#146;s publication that the public had to be involved and that parliamentary scrutiny was essential. The need for openness and transparency and the public&#146;s right to know were reasserted in a series of conclusions from  <br>

Member for Huddersfield said that the treaty was different because it differed in form. He said that instead of abolishing the existing treaties, it would amend them. I judge treaties and constitutions by their substance&#151;by what is in them and by their legal effect. The hon. Gentleman ignored the clear conclusion of two Select Committees that, in all material respects, the two documents were similar, if not the same. We have a treaty that is the same in substance as the constitutional treaty. I see the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), the Chairman of my Committee, shaking his head, but I remind him of the Committee&#146;s conclusion:</p>
<a name="80311-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="080311135000219"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Taken as a whole, the Reform Treaty produces a general framework which is substantially equivalent to the Constitutional Treaty.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para8"><a name="080311135000120">Of course, it is true that the Government did not want the treaty. I listened to day after day of speeches and amendments during the Convention on the Future of Europe. The Government representative tabled 295 amendments in total, which I have in my hand. The Government have refused to publish that list. It is very difficult to get hold of it&#151;one has to trawl through European websites and separate out all the amendments tabled by the other 105 delegates to the Convention, but we have done that and there were 295. Of those, 33 were accepted on such epic matters as changing &#147;common market&#148; to &#147;internal market&#148; and changing the reference to member states&#146; &#147;internal law&#148; to read &#147;national law&#148;. On matters of trivia, the Government tended to win, but on substantive matters they lost time and again. The Government are defending a treaty that they did not want. They certainly did not want the substance of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para9"><a name="080311135000121">The treaty is indisputably constitutional in character. It provides for a division of powers and does so on terms that are entirely favourable to the EU. I agree with what the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) said in his powerful speech about the irreversibility of the process. Once we give away those powers, we will never get them back. British history is a long struggle to get powers under the control of those who are accountable to the people. Many wars have been fought to achieve that, and here we are giving those powers away in a treaty. It defies belief that a free Parliament should do that without losing a war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para10"><a name="080311135000122">The treaty explicitly asserts the supremacy of EU law. That cannot be found in the existing treaties.

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para11"><a name="080311135000123">The treaty also creates a self-amending procedure through the so-called ratchet or passerelle clauses so that in future it can transfer more powers away from national Parliaments and member states up to the EU without the need for the traditional intergovernmental conference, parliamentary legislation or referendums. Those at the top of the EU in Brussels have decided that they will never again ask the people what they think. They have dismissed the people and given those powers to themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para12"><a name="080311135000124">The treaty creates a Union that is all-powerful but politically weak. It is a hollow institution because it lacks popular allegiance and legitimacy. The reason for that is fundamental. Europe is not a single political entity on which democracy can operate. There is no European public opinion, as such. There is no single European electorate and no language of Europe. There is no shared political experience. In short, there is no demos on which democracy can operate. People obstinately identify with their own country where voting is concerned. Of course, we can build upwards on that: if we have a vibrant national democracy in Europe, we can co-operate on that solid foundation to tackle common problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para13"><a name="080311135000125">We on the Conservative Benches are the internationalists. We believe in countries, Governments and people getting together to tackle common scourges and the problems of the world, but the process must be built on a solid foundation: it must arise from below, whereas the EU method is top-down. The EU wants to be the dominant law-maker and we have to accept it. That has happened despite all the effort and money spent on trying to create a European political identity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para14"><a name="080311135000126">The failure to do so is shown by the fact that the loss of democracy at national level, hollowed out by the relentless upward transfer of powers, is not being replaced by democracy at European Union level. The attitude of voters towards the European Parliament, which frequently boasts that it is the repository of the democratic impulse in Europe, shows that the reverse is happening. The Parliament has demanded and been given more powers in every treaty. It says, &#147;Give us the powers and people will see that we are important. They&#146;ll come out to vote and we shall express the popular will of the peoples of Europe.&#148; It has not happened. In 1979, an average of 69 per cent. of the EU electorate voted in the first European election. In the next election, the figure dropped to 65 per cent. and thereafter to 64, 58 and 53 per cent. In the most recent European Parliament election, the percentage of the people of Europe who voted dropped to 48 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para15"><a name="080311135000127">The electorate either say no in referendums or &#147;We couldn&#146;t care less&#148; in elections. They certainly never regard themselves as democratically represented, in any real sense of the word, in the European Parliament. In the treaty, we are suppressing democracy at national level without replacing it at EU level. The democratic deficit, which is already yawning, is set to grow worse.</p>

is a magnetic force that operates on us, and much of our history has been bound up with what happened elsewhere in Europe, but we are more than that. We are what General de Gaulle called a maritime country. That other magnetic field operating on us is a result of our historical experience as part of the Commonwealth, part of the English-speaking world&#151;sometimes called the Anglosphere&#151;and part of areas of the world that are showing greater dynamism and higher economic growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para17"><a name="080311135000129">The treaty tries to switch off that maritime global magnetic field and suck us irreversibly into a continental destiny. That is doing grave damage not only to us but to people all over the world to whom we have responsibilities. Like many Members, I am interested in development policy, in helping the poorest people of the world through aid and trade, but the process is hindered, not helped, by the fact that we have no trade policy. There is much to do with aid in the treaty, which states that aid is to be made part of the foreign policy of the EU. However, the provision that until now explicitly required the EU to give most of its attention to the most deprived is removed from the treaty. Rather than gaining power to help the poorest in the world, we are losing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para18"><a name="080311135000130">African countries that want to trade with the UK have to go in supplication not to us, because we no longer have a trade Department, but to the European Union with its protectionist attitudes. It is a disgrace that the world&#146;s fifth biggest economy cannot set its own trade policy even when we want to help the poorest people in the poorest countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para19"><a name="080311135000131">As I have said, the treaty is not reforming; it is constitutional. Although it is complex, it can be reduced to a simple fact: it is about transferring powers from those whom people have elected and can get rid of, to those whom they have not elected and cannot get rid of. Our global role is our strength, but we are being forced to choose a low-growth continental system that is old-fashioned, centralised and regulatory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80311-0018.htm_para20"><a name="080311135000132">There is only one final conclusion: regardless of whether I am right or wrong, it must not be me, or the House, that makes the final decision, because ultimately it is not our powers that we are dealing with, but those of the people who sent us here. I am not one for regular or continuous referendums, as I believe in a representative democracy, but when the rules of the game are altered, and big decisions are made about who governs us and where we are governed from they must be made not by politicians but by the people. The rules are now altering. We are exporting powers of unprecedented scope on an unprecedented scale. That is why all of us must keep our promise to ask the people what they think in a national referendum.</p>

The proposed referendum may have been on the wrong question. However, the pledge was given, and I am old-fashioned enough to believe that when one makes a pledge, one should keep it. Comparisons between the Lisbon treaty on the one hand, and the treaties of Nice, Amsterdam and Maastricht and the Single European Act on the other, are irrelevant. The only comparison that matters is that between the European reform treaty before us and the constitutional treaty in respect of which the pledge for a referendum was given.</p>

How the Government get on with their partners in Europe I do not know. Lithuania, Slovenia and other countries have said the same, too; all of them are apparently not to be trusted.

The Government say that it is essential for the smooth working of the EU. That is patently not true. The EU has worked smoothly since the accession four years ago. A study by Sciences Po in Paris show that the EU is adopting new rules and regulations 25 per cent. more quickly since enlargement than it was doing before. Rejection would simply leave us with the status quo, and the status quo shows every sign of working perfectly reasonably. Moreover, we would not have to concede further competences to the EU.</p>

The French and the Dutch people rejected the constitution, which the Government and the Lib Dems pretend was far more substantial than the treaty, and no one suggested that they should leave the Union.

All we know from experience is that it will always expand competences more widely than originally anticipated. My own experience confirms that. My first role in Government was as Economic Secretary, and the first thing I had to do was implement a decision of the European Court of Justice that we had to apply VAT to building, electricity, water, homes and spectacles. It was an interpretation of the sixth VAT directive, passed in all good faith by the Labour Government back in the 1970s, which none of us had foreseen would extend VAT into previously zero-rated areas.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the main reasons why the treaty is such a significant shift in power is the criminal justice provisions?

 That is perfectly true.

About 20 minutes before this debate, I asked the Library what measures had recently been passed in this House under European legislation. Since last October, there have been some 44 statutory instruments and three primary Acts of Parliament. They covered subjects such as energy and building performance certificates and inspections&#151;the famous home information packs, which increase the cost of buying a house. The Government did not want that measure&#151;it was imposed on us by a statutory instrument that this House had no opportunity to turn down because it came under the transfer of competences and European law. Other subjects include patents, compulsory licensing and supplementary protection certificates, movement restrictions, foot and mouth disease, reinsurance, and radioactive contaminated land in Northern Ireland. Why only Northern Ireland? I do not know. The list goes on, from animals and animal products, to health and social care profession regulations, to asylum procedures and regulations&#151;an issue where we are going to increase the powers of the European Community. Not a single line, clause or amendment on the provisions involving asylum, border controls and immigration was debated in the House, yet the Government are asking us to accept them.</p>

they ensure that security of energy supply in the Union can be voted on by qualified majority voting. The Government say that the right of member states to determine the conditions for exploiting their energy resources requires unanimity. So it does, but that it is not the same as the allocation of oil and gas once it has been produced, which remains under qualified majority voting. In other words, if there is a worldwide shortage of oil and gas&#151;as happened during the Suez crisis, the OPEC embargo, the Iranian crisis, and on several other occasions&#151;we would be vulnerable to the European Community deciding that oil and gas should be shared fairly across the whole Community. My right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) said that the process would be reciprocal.

When I talk to my friends on the continent, they often ask, &#147;Why are you more concerned about these things than we are?&#148; The simple reason is that the United Kingdom has greater differences and idiosyncrasies than almost any other member does vis- -vis the generality of the Community.</p>

The directive, as originally written, would have wiped out our whole system of monetary management and control. Fortunately, we managed to gain an exemption from it. When I became responsible for occupational pensions, I was told that they were not part of a European competence, but we found that they were under a great threat of implications because no other country except Holland had any system of occupational pensions.

Therefore, it is natural that we should want to concede as few powers, and competences, as are necessary to have an open, single internal market and allow the maximum degree of constructive co-operation between our Governments. In my contention, this treaty goes far further than that. It concedes powers, and does so in such a way that we will not readily be able to get them back.</p>

The fact that 27 members states, representing so many nations, cultures and languages, have built up the institution; that regional blocs across the world talk about emulating the European Union; that countries are clamouring to get into the European Union; and that, with one tiny exception, no country wants to leave&#151;all that reflects the success of the European Union.

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to sum up for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition on this important Bill. It may surprise hon. Members to hear that I am going to miss this process. I will miss listening to the Foreign Secretary&#146;s speeches. In particular, I will miss further contributions from my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the shadow Foreign Secretary. He has led us very ably throughout the process. He has combined precision, determination and good humour. It was the Foreign Secretary who generously said at the beginning of this Third Reading debate that my right hon. Friend was one the best debaters in the House of Commons. On that point, I agree with the Foreign Secretary, even if I have agreed with him on virtually nothing else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80311-0019.htm_para19"><a name="080311135000174">I will also miss sparring with my opposite number, the Minister for Europe. Even though we have disagreed strongly on a number of occasions about the implications of the Bill and the treaty that it would enact, I accept that he has acted throughout with courtesy and good humour. He has loyally stuck to the Government&#146;s hackneyed line that the constitutional concept has been abandoned, even after the Prime Minister referred to the Lisbon treaty last Wednesday at Prime Minister&#146;s questions as &#147;the constitutional treaty&#148;. When even one&#146;s ultimate boss admits that something is a constitution, it is difficult to plough on, but the Minister has stuck loyally to his brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80311-0019.htm_para20"><a name="080311135000175">I will also miss the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee and his oft-quoted report, which has become almost the standard text for our debates. That report reminded the House that the EU constitution and the Lisbon treaty are &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; and that to argue otherwise is, in the words of the Committee&#151;a Labour-dominated Committee&#151;&#147;misleading&#148;. The Committee also highlighted how whole swathes of the original EU constitution were brought forward into what is now the treaty of Lisbon. That case was argued so strongly that <i> The Economist</i> subsequently described the Government&#146;s case&#151;that the two documents are really quite different&#151;as &#147;a farce&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80311-0019.htm_para21"><a name="080311135000176">I am also grateful to Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee for reminding the House so eloquently on the &#147;Today&#148; programme that the Government&#146;s much-vaunted red lines would &#147;leak like a sieve&#148;. That bears repetition because it was so accurate.</p>

 The quotation that the hon. Gentleman is always using came at the end of a long contribution about the red lines. Did he subsequently read that the Government&#146;s argument was that by getting protocol 10 to article 10, the red lines would not leak like a sieve, but would be transposed and given away, as they opted in again and again? There would not be a process of accidental filtration, but a process controlled by the Government and, I hope, by the House.</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but the moral of the story is, &#147;Be very careful what you say on the &#145;Today&#146; programme, in case it comes back to bite you.&#148;</p>

So that we do not leave him out of this Third Reading debate, I should like to remind the House of what he said so candidly in <i> Le Monde</i> about the similarity between the original EU constitution and what is now the treaty of Lisbon. He predicted:</p>

To begin with, they briefed the media that there would be 20 days of debate in the Commons, then restricted the debate to 14 days instead. Although they like to compare that to the time allocated to debate the treaties of Amsterdam and Nice, they somehow always forget to mention that the Maastricht treaty was debated for 29 days in the House of Commons&#151;more than double the time allocated to the debate on this treaty. And as my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who has also spoken powerfully, pointed out again and again, at the time of Maastricht, the parliamentary day was often much longer than it is now.</p>

Owing to that methodology, clause 4 was debated for fewer than 15 minutes and clause 5 was never debated in detail at all. Similarly, more than half the groups of amendments selected for debate during the Committee stage&#151;15 groups out of 29&#151;were never even reached.</p>

The detailed amendments on borders, visas, asylum, migration, defence, the free movement of workers, freedom of association, personal data and social policy were never even debated at all. That is why Mr. Simon Carr of <i> The Independent</i>, who has followed this issue closely, said of the whole process:</p>

<a name="80311-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="080311135000231"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This treaty strategy is Gordon Brown&#146;s personal creation, this is his specified treatment of Parliament, and visible to all is his definition of politics as cynicism in action.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para1"><a name="080311135000190">Despite all the protestations about allowing ample time for debate and facilitating line-by-line scrutiny, when it actually came to it, the debate was deliberately rigged to make that almost impossible. The Government just could not abandon their control-freak tendencies and had to restrict debate on the treaty&#151;an important point, which I sincerely hope will not be missed in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para2"><a name="080311135000191">Crucially, as the Bill goes forward to the other place, it still carries within it, in clause 6, provisions to implement article 48(6) of the treaty&#151;the new &#147;simplified revision procedure&#148;. That is the ratchet clause, which means that in future individual vetoes could be surrendered for ever, after only a brief debate on a simple Commons motion. On Second Reading, we said that we would table amendments during the Committee stage to strengthen parliamentary control over that procedure, so that giving up any veto could not be done through a simple motion, but only via a specific Act of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para3"><a name="080311135000192">Although our amendment No. 20 to that effect was not successful, on the night it did enjoy support from Members of virtually all parties in the House, including Labour, the Scottish nationalists, Plaid Cymru, the Democratic Unionist party, ably represented tonight by the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)&#151;and even, on that occasion, the Liberal Democrats. I hope that the other place will consider the content of the amendment especially carefully. Perhaps it will be minded to implement the amendment, particularly given that it would not wreck the treaty itself, but would strengthen control over how the ratchet clause might be used in future.</p>

He was finally reduced to arguing that a referendum was originally promised in order, as he put it that night, to &#147;clear the air&#148;. Well, I put it to him that if it was appropriate to clear the air then, why can we not clear the air now, and give the people the referendum they were promised?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para5"><a name="080311135000196">That brings me on to a fundamental weakness in the Government&#146;s whole argument throughout the passage of the Bill. If they are so confident in the treaty and believe that it is such a good deal for the people of this country, and if they contend that it is so markedly to our advantage, why do not they not have the courage of their convictions and go the people of this country to argue the case in a referendum debate&#151;not least because they promised it in the first place?</p>

Even ardent pro-Europeans must realise that the way in which this whole process has been conducted has done little, if anything, to advance their cause. In fact, it has done quite the reverse.

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para18"><a name="080311140000015">We also heard from the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). Again, the trend of remarkable ingenuity in our debates was followed. As I said some days ago during our proceedings, the hon. Member for Stone quoted an historic parliamentary debate and a speech&#151;by himself&#151;as a source of reference. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk did the same thing by proxy, quoting the right hon. Member for Wells quoting him. This evening we had another passionate speech by the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden, who went one step further in our proceedings. Not only did he quote himself, which has become the new fashion&#151;a fashion that I have not yet bought into&#151;but, in a remarkable innovation, to make his specific point he did not quote himself from an earlier speech, saying,</p>
<a name="80311-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="080311140000603"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can demonstrate that by referring to a speech that I did not give&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 6 February 2008; Vol. 471, c. 1074.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para19"><a name="080311140000016">when he was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. A remarkable constitutional innovation! It is a first, and perhaps many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House will take their lead from it in future debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para20"><a name="080311140000017">On the specifics in the treaty and therefore the Bill&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;No!&#148;] I know. The treaty and the Bill increase the UK&#146;s share of the vote in the European Union; reduce the size of the European Commission; give greater say for national Parliaments; end the utterly ludicrous rotating presidency; improve decision making; end the external duplication; and enshrine for the first time children&#146;s rights in a European treaty. In a topsy-turvy sense of priorities, previous treaties, for whatever reason, enshrined animal rights, but not children&#146;s rights. This treaty puts that anomaly right. It also marks significant improvements in climate change and international development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para21"><a name="080311140000018">As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said&#151;it was foul-mannered of me to ignore not just his walk-out but his wider contribution&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para22"><a name="080311140000021">The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton led with his chin on every occasion and showed that he had a great sense of the detail of the treaty. He also made a point this afternoon that I agree with fundamentally: that Europe is in our national interest. That is because it is not just about the projection of power on the international stage, but about effective influence when it comes to our relations with Russia, China, India and the wider world. Importantly, the treaty brings to an end the circular conversation about European structures and gives us the opportunity to refocus on European delivery on employment, when millions of Europeans are still out of work; on international development, when tens of millions of people are still without basic foodstuffs and basic medicines; and on climate change, which is, after all, the biggest strategic threat to our security and prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para23"><a name="080311140000022">On the remarkably imprecise comments by Opposition Members, the fact is that the treaty enshrines important and fundamental changes to things on which previous treaties were silent&#151;children&#146;s rights, human rights, climate change and international development&#151;ensuring that those issues are, for the first time, strategic objectives for the European Union which give us the opportunity to deliver in a way that our citizens expect us to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para24"><a name="080311140000023">The hon. Member for Rayleigh and his hon. Friends have been remarkably imprecise about what not letting the matter rest means. What does it mean? Wait and see is what not letting the matter rest encapsulates. Not letting the matter rest is a Eurosceptic slogan of a permanent opposition; it is not a European strategy of an aspiring Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para25"><a name="080311140000024">We had a stark reminder of that yesterday. The Foreign Secretary and I had the opportunity to travel to Brussels for one of our regular meetings of all the Foreign Secretaries and European Ministers across the 27 member states of the EU. Among the issues that we discussed were Zimbabwe, climate change and how to deliver on jobs and economic growth&#151;some of the big issues contained within the treaty and enabled by the Bill. Gathered in that European meeting were the great democracies of Europe&#151;the 27 Governments on the left, right and centre of European politics&#151;all of which are committed to more effective European delivery, seized by the importance of climate change, and aware of the pressing need to deliver further for those Europeans who are currently out of work. Each and every one of those Governments was committed to the details and the principles of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

 I have twice asked the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) what the Conservative party&#146;s plan would be if the Bill were lost tonight. What is their plan B for what the United Kingdom should do if the treaty of Lisbon is lost tonight? Does my hon. Friend know what their position is?</p>

<p><a name="st_o446"><a name="080311140000026"><a name="80311-0020.htm_spnew12"><a name="080311140000617"><b>Mr. Murphy:</b>
 At the minimum, their approach would thrust the European Union back into a period of introspection that would jeopardise stability and jobs across the European Union. Never mind plan B; we are not even clear about what the Conservatives&#146; plan A is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para26"><a name="080311140000031">I said on Second Reading that every conservative Government in Europe and every major conservative opposition party in Europe supported the Lisbon treaty. I asked then, as I do now, which other conservative party in Europe supports the British Conservative party&#146;s opposition to the Lisbon treaty and its recipe for isolation. I will give way to any Conservative Member who wishes to answer that question.</p>

<p><a name="st_o451"><a name="080311140000032"><a name="80311-0020.htm_spnew17"><a name="080311140000622"><b>Mr. Francois:</b>
 Can the Minister explain why Mr. Peter Gauweiler of the CSU recently referred the Lisbon treaty to the German constitutional court on the grounds of his belief that it might be unconstitutional?</p>

 A month of preparation, a month in gestation, a month of research, and that is all that the hon. Gentleman could come up with. The fact is that the great democracies of Germany and its centre-right Government are endorsing the treaty, the French Parliament has already ratified it, and the new Spanish Government are committed to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80311-0020.htm_para27"><a name="080311140000034">What would this great &#147;not letting the matter rest&#148; coalition look like? It has a new member: I discovered only yesterday, when I was in Brussels, that the French hunting party has now come out against the treaty. Given Sinn Fein, Marianne Thieme&#151;who, as we all know, leads the Dutch party for the animals in its opposition to the treaty&#151;and the now infamous Philippe de Villiers, part of the leadership of the French hunting party, we have three allies to fill this great chamber of Europe. That still leaves 23 empty seats for the great European coalition of international Governments.</p>

 I was enthralled by my hon. Friend&#146;s list of supporters of the Conservative position, but he forgot to mention the Democratic Unionist party. The hon.

 I am extremely pleased to be given the opportunity to take part in this short debate about an important issue that affects my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0803121000025">For many years the regeneration of Newton Aycliffe town centre has been an unresolved issue for my constituents who live in the town. Since I was elected MP for Sedgefield in July 2007, making progress on the regeneration of the town centre has been my main focus of attention in Newton Aycliffe. Tonight, I shall report on the progress that has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0803121000026">The whole debacle of the regeneration of Newton Aycliffe town centre stretches back not just two or three years but more than four decades. The people of Newton Aycliffe have been living with the problem for a generation, but what I shall announce this evening can, I believe, start to breathe new life into the future of the town centre. Before I outline the history of the problems with the regeneration, I shall state where we are at present and why there is room for optimism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0803121000027">Over the past eight months, I have been working to resolve the ongoing problems with the regeneration project with Sedgefield borough council, Freshwater, which owns the town centre&#151;we must not forget that it is privately owned&#151;Durham county council, the County Durham primary care trust, the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys mental health trust and Great Aycliffe town council. My predecessor, the right hon. Tony Blair, arranged for the involvement of those partner organisations in the project. They all sat down together at the beginning of last year and now hold meetings on a regular basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0803121000028">Over the past few years, the main sticking point has been the former health centre, whose dilapidated state is a disgrace to the NHS and an embarrassment to Newton Aycliffe. By the end of 2007, after much delay, the County Durham PCT moved its staff out of the health centre. Most are based at the primary care partnership at Cobbler&#146;s Hall in Newton Aycliffe, where they will continue to deliver clinical services on a temporary basis until the town centre is redeveloped. The mental health trust, which provides the substance misuse service, is seeking planning permission for change of use of a property in Newton Aycliffe and will be leaving the former health centre shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0803121000029">The health centre shared its building with the library. Durham county council has found a site to which the library can move on a temporary basis. It will be sited in a demountable building on land formerly occupied by a petrol station, once the site has been cleared. The site is opposite the police headquarters so the library will remain in the centre of the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0803121000030">Next to the library is another dilapidated building, where Age Concern runs a drop-in centre for elderly people, known locally as the Cubby. The proposal is that space be made available in the library to accommodate the elderly people who use the Cubby. Once that has been achieved&#151;over the next few months&#151;it will be time to demolish the building that houses the former health centre and library.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>11 Mar 2008 : Column 257</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0803121000031">Last week, I received written confirmation from the County Durham PCT that demolition will happen once the final moves have taken place. Freshwater has confirmed to me that Dalton way, a mothballed row of shops next to the former health centre, will also be demolished. That is excellent news and is the start of the town centre&#146;s regeneration. However, regeneration is not just about moving services into temporary accommodation; it is also about finding a permanent home for them. That is why it is planned to turn the leisure centre into a community service hub where the health centre and library will also be permanently based. The relevant partners in that aspect of the development will meet later this week to start threshing out the details. In May, public consultation will take place, led by Freshwater, which will detail its plans for the town centre development and listen to people&#146;s views. All that is good news for the people of Newton Aycliffe but I understand their frustration, because I share it. My office is situated in the town centre, at 5 Upper Beveridge way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0803121000032">It is important to outline briefly the history of Newton Aycliffe to show how we arrived at a situation in which we are faced with a town centre in need of regeneration. As a result of the New Towns Act 1946, the Newton Aycliffe (Designation) Order was made on 19 April 1947 and Newton Aycliffe became one of the first wave of six new towns designated that year. The others were Stevenage, Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Harlow and East Kirkbride. However, the birth of Newton Aycliffe is locally considered to be 28 June 1948, when Lord Beveridge cut the first sward. On 9 November, he opened the first new house. This year&#151;2008&#151;is therefore a special year for Newton Aycliffe; it is the town&#146;s 60th anniversary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80311-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0803121000033">In the 1940s, only 60 people lived in the area that was to become Newton Aycliffe. With the advent of the second world war, the Aycliffe area was designated the perfect location for a royal ordnance factory because it was away from existing communities. At its peak, some 16,000 people, mostly women, worked in the factory. One of them was my grandmother. They worked in 1,000 flat-topped concrete and brick buildings spread over 1 square mile. The site was suitable partly because it was close to the Great North road, now the A1(M), and had a small railway station&#151;the same station at which Robert Stephenson conducted his first train run, with locomotion No. 1, in 1825.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080311/debtext/80311-0022.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para0"><a name="0803121000034">After the war, the ordnance factory was run down and some of the buildings were sold off to private companies. That become the nucleus of Newton Aycliffe&#146;s industrial estate, which is now the largest industrial estate in County Durham, with more than 250 companies employing between 8,000 and 9,000 people. It was inevitable that a growing industrial estate miles from anywhere would lead to the building of an urban area, and eventually a new town was proposed, with a corporation to oversee its development. The first chair of the corporation was Lord Beveridge. A friend of mine, John Moran, who has lived in Newton Aycliffe for almost 50 years, is a bricklayer and helped to build more houses in the town in those early days. He remembers Lord Beveridge visiting the building site  <br>

on Crosby road one day, wearing his trilby, overcoat and that traditional building-site apparel, a pair of spats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0803121000035">Newton Aycliffe was the smallest of the new towns. It was planned to cover an area of 880 acres and cater for a population of 10,000 people, 6,000 of whom would work on the industrial estate. In his 1952 pamphlet &#147;New Towns and the Case for Them&#148;, Beveridge described the first inhabitants of Newton Aycliffe. He said that the town consisted</p>
<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="0803121000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;largely of young married people....As a consequence the town overflows with young children, it is a town of toddlers, or those just past the toddling age; it is a town of few adolescents and up to present, only three grandmothers in its 1,000 of population.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0803121000036">Of the town&#146;s first 500 inhabitants, many came from all over County Durham, including such areas in my constituency as Ferryhill and Chilton. Many more travelled from Birmingham, London, Oxford, Coventry, Somerset, Scotland and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para3"><a name="">The town grew steadily, but had no amenities. Every school, church, community centre and doctor&#146;s surgery had to be built from scratch. The first row of shops opened on Neville parade in 1952, and boasted a post office, a greengrocer&#146;s, and a fishmonger&#146;s. The first shops in the town centre started to be built in 1957, when the population target for Newton Aycliffe was doubled from 10,000 to 20,000, so that it could reach its industrial potential. By 1959 there were 49 shops in the town centre, of which 39 were let.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0803121000037">At the time, a road ran through the town centre along Beveridge way, but it has been pedestrianised. Many constituents remember the town centre from those times; they say that it was vibrant and full of flowerbeds, and that it was somewhere that people wanted to go. From my understanding, the problems with the development of the town centre started in the early 1960s, when Lord Hailsham, as Minister for the North East, produced a report entitled &#147;The North East&#151;A Programme for Regional Development and Growth&#148;, which proposed additional industrial land for Newton Aycliffe and a new target population of 45,000. Even then the figure was seen as highly optimistic, but the corporation started to consider the future of the town centre in the light of the new target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para5"><a name="0803121000038">The development corporation&#146;s annual report of 1963 records that</p>
<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="0803121000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;because of the possibility of the town being doubled in size there has been no further development in the town centre, apart from the completion of a large supermarket&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0803121000039">There were further delays while consultants prepared a master plan. A report was commissioned in 1964 but did not materialise until 1966. The plan was to build a new town centre a quarter of a mile away, and to connect the two by a pedestrian walkway. That proposal was rejected and it was agreed to expand the existing town centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0803121000040">In 1968, the Secretary of State agreed to phase 1 of the town centre&#146;s development, which provided 14 new shop units and a modest amount of second-floor office accommodation. In 1970, Darlington rural district council built the leisure centre that now stands on the corner of Beveridge way, with a &#163;100,000 contribution from the development corporation. The centre was further extended by Sedgefield district council, the successor local authority, in 1974. In 1972, phase 2 was agreed and led to more shopping and office space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0803121000041">Between the publication of the Hailsham report and the completion of phase 2 in 1975&#151;a period of 12 years&#151;the town centre changed, some thought, architecturally, for the worse. In his book &#147;Aycliffe and Peterlee New Towns&#148;, Garry Philipson said that much of the problem could be attributed to</p>
<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="0803121000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;indecision and consequent lengthy delay regarding the new towns&#146; target population and, subsequently, the form of town centre redevelopment.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0803121000042">By 1980 Newton Aycliffe&#146;s population stood at 26,000. A fresh target was set the following year which envisaged a population of 32,000 in 1991, a figure dramatically lower than the 45,000 set by Hailsham. The population in 2008 is only about 27,000. In 1984 the town centre was sold off to the Grainger Trust, which in 1990 sold it to Freshwater property investors. The following year the Avenue comprehensive school was closed because of falling school rolls. The school was next door to the town centre and was demolished in the early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0803121000043">It was not until 1999 that the county council agreed to sell the land to Manchester-based developers CTP. In 2000, CTP and Tesco announced a plan for a 68,000 sq ft supermarket as part of a &#163;25 million town centre makeover. The owners of the existing town centre opposed the proposal on the grounds that the Tesco store would be too large, and integration between the new development and the existing town centre would be poor. As a consequence, there was no agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0803121000044">The borough council agreed to go ahead with the development in two phases. Phase 1 consisted of the new Tesco store, eight retail units and a youth centre. The development was completed by 2004. Phase 2 was to include a pedestrian plaza, health centre and library and community facilities. In 2006, Somerfield supermarket closed with the loss of 63 jobs in the town centre, mostly as the result of competition from Tesco. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0803121000045">The agreement between Durham county council and CPT expired before the development of the second phase could start. The council stated at the time, in May 2007, that despite</p>
<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev3"><a name="0803121000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;assurance after assurance . . .the development never came&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0803121000046">That was the view of Chris Tunstall, deputy chief executive of the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0803121000047">That is how we reached the present position, but as I said, there are grounds for optimism because things are starting to move after much pressure and after getting people to sit down and sort the problem out. Some may say that we have been here before, and we have. That is why I will continue to press hard for action rather than talk. Action is starting to happen, but my anger will match that of my constituents if the promised action is not forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0803121000048">Slowly, retailers are beginning to show confidence in the town once more. A new store will be moving into the town centre in the coming months where Somerfield once had a supermarket. That may be of little comfort for my constituents in Newton Aycliffe, but criticism of town centres in new towns is not restricted to the town centre that we are debating tonight. It has been a concern for many new towns. The Transport, Local Government and the Regions Committee report &#147;The New Towns: Their Problems and Future&#148;, published in July 2002, stated in paragraph 18:</p>

<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev4"><a name="0803121000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At the centre of New Towns, a shopping centre has been developed to meet the needs of the surrounding populations. Many have suffered from poor design and layout. Most are now out-of-date and as a result, residents are choosing to shop in other locations.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0803121000049">In paragraph 21, the report went on to say:</p>
<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev5"><a name="0803121000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many of the local authorities are seeking to redevelop the shopping centres but they are hindered because they do not own them.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0803121000050">That is true of Newton Aycliffe town centre. Freshwater, which owns the site, however, is showing renewed commitment to the town centre&#146;s redevelopment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0803121000051">In the book on Newton Aycliffe and Peterlee by Garry Philipson from which I quoted earlier, the author pointed out the fundamental problem with the development of town centre shopping. Referring to both Newton Aycliffe and Peterlee, he saw</p>
<a name="80311-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="0803121000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the reluctance of developers to invest in two small New Towns with limited prospects of growth, both sited in an impoverished region.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0803121000052">He wrote that in 1988.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0803121000053">That was then; this is now. Today, the north-east is growing at a faster rate than any other region in the country. Unemployment in my constituency is at or below the national average. Back in the 1980s, it stood at 40 per cent. in some areas of my constituency. Employment is at high levels. I read in the papers yesterday that the north-east is exporting more than it is importing, part of which, no doubt, is down to the businesses on Newton Aycliffe&#146;s industrial estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0803121000054">It is time for developers and everyone else who has the regeneration of Newton Aycliffe town centre at heart to step up to the plate and deliver. The people of Newton Aycliffe have waited long enough. Newton Aycliffe is a dynamic town, with a strong community spirit, and in 2008, the year of the town&#146;s 60th anniversary, my constituents there can look forward with confidence. All they want is a town centre that they can proudly say is at the heart of their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0803121000055">I conclude by asking the Government to consider two proposals. First, will my hon. Friend the Minister ensure that the Government&#146;s regeneration agencies work with the local authorities responsible for Newton Aycliffe to ensure that the town delivers its full potential as a sustainable community and strategic growth point for County Durham? As we approach the creation of a new unitary authority for County Durham, does he agree that that new authority has an important strategic role in delivering for the people of Newton Aycliffe?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0803121000056">Secondly, the Government are developing a radical policy on the creation of eco-towns&#151;there are to be 10 by 2020. That is an excellent approach to marrying together sustainable communities and the need to tackle climate change. However, as they will be new towns, I strongly believe that the lessons of the existing new towns should be taken into consideration as plans progress. They need to be places where people can live, work and, dare I say, shop in harmony. Can the Minister tell me if the lessons, both positive and negative, from the past 60 years of new town development will be fed into the decision-making process on eco-towns?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0803121000057">Newton Aycliffe is a great town and one that I am personally very proud to represent.</p>

 It gives me real pleasure to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson), who is my next door neighbour in Parliamentary constituency terms, on securing this debate. He has been in this House for only a relatively short time but he has impressed all sides with his tenacious campaigning on behalf of his constituents in Sedgefield and his knowledge of and passion for raising the skills levels of people both in his constituency and in our wider north-east region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0803121000059">I am aware that revitalising and regenerating Newton Aycliffe&#146;s town centre was a hot topic in the by-election that enabled my hon. Friend to come to this House. True to his word, he has been resolute in his promise to his constituents to raise this matter in the House. I was particularly impressed with the fact that he has also kept his constituents closely informed about this matter. I understand that he wrote to more than 1,000 people who have expressed an interest in the subject of Newton Aycliffe town centre, informing them that he had had meetings with the private owners of the centre, parish, borough and county councils, and the primary care trust. He is a strong campaigner on this matter. He demonstrated that in his maiden speech, and he did so, in an excellent fashion, here again tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0803121000060">The Government strongly believe that facilitating and enabling town centres and other service centres within regeneration areas to achieve their potential is an important part of maximising economic growth and realising the sense of place and high quality of life that we all wish to obtain. The Government&#146;s policies and approach towards town and city centre development have underpinned successful regeneration across the country, and we now need to reflect on how we can build on that success and drive improvement and investment forward to improve still further areas like Newton Aycliffe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para27"><a name="0803121000061">Government policy acknowledges that places are different. For example, Newton Aycliffe is different from Sedgefield village or Trimdon colliery&#151;other parts of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency&#151;and will have distinctive strengths that require nurturing and challenges that need to be addressed. That can be done only with a wider, deeper and more meaningful involvement with the local communities affected. Councils can take on the role of strong and strategic local leadership, with central Government encouraging local priorities and innovation. What is also vital to appreciate, particularly when, as in my hon. Friend&#146;s case, the town centre is privately owned, is that partnership working and good, strong and mature co-ordination between private, public and community organisations, tailored to the specific area, is the best way to succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para28"><a name="0803121000062">My hon. Friend asked me how we could ensure that the regeneration activities work with the local authorities responsible for Newton Aycliffe to ensure that the town delivers its full potential. I absolutely agree with the concerns he expressed. He will no doubt be aware of the sub-national review, in which we propose that the regional strategy for planning&#151;the regional spatial strategy&#151;and the strategy for economic development&#151;the regional  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 Mar 2008">

economic strategy&#151;form into a single integrated strategy. We are proposing more delegation of funding for One NorthEast as the regional development agency in our region and a new economic development duty for local authorities. That renewed clarity of roles for RDAs and local authorities will address the concerns raised by my hon. Friend. On the sub-national review, he will wish to note that we are preparing consultations on those reforms, which we will publish shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para29"><a name="0803121000063">I also agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s point about how the creation of a new unitary authority for County Durham has an important role in delivering for the people of Newton Aycliffe. Incidentally, I thought that he was excellent on this subject on the BBC&#146;s &#147;Politics Show&#148; on Sunday. I would suggest that the partnership approach that I mentioned earlier will need to be established quickly with the new unitary authority to ensure that the council addresses the needs and aspirations of the people of Newton Aycliffe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para30"><a name="0803121000064">I understand that sometimes the processes of land assembly, property purchase, negotiation with landlords and tenants and, importantly, consultation with local people and agencies take time and I know that the communities in Newton Aycliffe and the wider borough of Sedgefield have sometimes expressed their impatience with that process. However, it is to the credit of all concerned, particularly my hon. Friend, who has done much to engage with local people on this matter and broker a deal with the relevant players, that the people, businesses and public agencies in the town can look forward to a revitalised town centre built on partnership and long-term sustainability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para31"><a name="0803121000065">As my hon. Friend said, Newton Aycliffe town centre is in the process of a major redevelopment around the old Avenue school site. That redevelopment has seen the creation of a new library, community centre, supermarket and a wider range of leisure and retail units, adding something like another 16 acres of commercial and recreational opportunities for the people of Newton Aycliffe. I am aware that this new redevelopment will be based around a new town square, which will be the central point between the old and the new town centres. The sense of place that I mentioned earlier is so important. I strongly believe, as does my hon. Friend, that the public realm is vital in creating that positive sense of place, and that the development of well-planned areas with high quality design and construction attracts people to live, work and relax in them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para32"><a name="0803121000066">What my hon. Friend has described tonight is an emerging success story, with private developers and public agencies locked into an agreement to transform the main area of the town centre. I understand that there are still some property moves and demolitions to be undertaken, but we, and the people of Newton Aycliffe, can look forward with renewed confidence to the return of the busy and bustling town centre that the town deserves to have. That is particularly good news for the town and excellent timing, because it will help us to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para33"><a name="0803121000067">The Government are keen to see a co-ordinated and holistic approach to regeneration, with an emphasis on ensuring that our towns and neighbourhoods are connected and have the right mix of economic activity to provide for more and better jobs, decent standards, a  <br>

choice of decent housing and excellent public services close to the community. My hon. Friend has already raised with our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health the matter of the &#163;250 million access fund, which will establish 150 new GP-run health centres and improve access to first-class health facilities in areas such as County Durham. My hon. Friend promised his constituents that he will continue to bang on about matters relating to the health centre in the town and, thanks to his efforts, work is progressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para34"><a name="0803121000068">Housing is something that greatly interests me and I know that Newton Aycliffe, like my own constituency, and the rest of the Sedgefield constituency, has seen significant development and improvement in its housing stock over the past 10 years. In addition, the nearby industrial estate continues to be a major source of investment and employment. The industrial estate is the largest business location in County Durham, covering some 230 hectares and is located close to major road links in the north-east such as the A1(M). I am confident that the industrial estate will provide still more enterprise and employment opportunities to County Durham and Newton Aycliffe in the years to come, following further investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para35"><a name="0803121000069">One of the big successes of this Labour Government has been the neighbourhood renewal fund, which was charged with reducing the inequalities in our most deprived areas. That was done through the national strategy action plan, &#147;A New Commitment to Neighbourhood Renewal&#148;, which set out the radical vision that within 20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live. As a result of that commitment, the north-east region has received more than &#163;377 million of neighbourhood renewal funding since 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para36"><a name="0803121000070">Town centres such as Newton Aycliffe have benefited from elements of that investment, and Sedgefield borough council and its partners have received more than &#163;7 million as part of neighbourhood renewal fund moneys.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="80311-0022.htm_para37"><a name="0803121000071">Although, as my hon. Friend said, unemployment levels in Newton Aycliffe, the wider Sedgefield constituency and the north-east are at record lows, more needs to be done. That is why we recently announced the new working neighbourhoods fund to drive down unemployment still further in our disadvantaged communities and help councils and community groups optimise the talent and enterprise in our neighbourhoods.</p>

received from the neighbourhood renewal fund. That funding will provide a further boost to the regeneration efforts of the area and should directly link into the capital investment and other investments planned for Newton Aycliffe town centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="80311-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0803121000073">An improved, more economically active town centre in Newton Aycliffe, close to a revitalised Aycliffe industrial estate, promises investment, jobs, and better opportunities for communities. I know that local partners want to factor in a vibrant town centre in their broader strategies for renewal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="80311-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0803121000074">I do not want to dictate the way in which local councils and community groups should allocate that additional funding, but they could, for example, set up job advice and skills schemes in the town centre and in the community buildings that are being built. Financial incentives will be available to local authorities that are successful in reducing worklessness. I hope that such a co-ordinated approach will help ensure that Newton Aycliffe town centre has a vibrant future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="80311-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0803121000075">My hon. Friend mentioned his belief that town centres do not exist in isolation, and that their connection to local jobs and housing markets is crucial to their sustainability. He also mentioned his hope that we will address and learn from the lessons of the past about the new growth points and eco-towns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80311-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0803121000076">Growth points are key to concentrating future growth in existing urban centres. They can also act as a successful catalyst for improving areas and town centres. With that in mind, my hon. Friend may be interested to know that the Durham housing and neighbourhoods board has submitted to the Government a bid for a new growth point in the south and east Durham areas. Newton Aycliffe is included in that bid as a key urban centre and focus for significant housing and economic development. I would like to tell my hon. Friend that we will make an announcement on the growth point bids that have been selected for development shortly, and I am sure that he will take a keen interest in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="80311-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0803121000077">Again, I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. I pay tribute to the work that he has done in brokering an acceptable deal for the regeneration of the area, and assure him that the Government will continue to invest in areas that require assistance in regenerating and revitalising communities such as those that he represents in Newton Aycliffe.</p>
