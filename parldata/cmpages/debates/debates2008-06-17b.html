 I very much welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement, as will many campaigners up and down the country and in the House.

Will the Secretary of State assure the House that the review will not have the effect, however inadvertently, of kicking the issue into the long grass, because, as the case of Linda O&#146;Boyle proved, patients want and need the change in the policy now, not in a year&#146;s time?</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend. He, too, has raised the issue in various debates in the House. The guidance goes back at least to 1986 and probably before then. I have no need to ask Professor Mike Richards&#151;he will do this anyway&#151;to talk to Members, such as the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), my right hon. Friend and others who want to raise specific issues. That can be done in the time scale that has been set&#151;certainly, Professor Richards thinks that it can&#151;and, as I say, that will ensure that I do not stand at the Dispatch Box merely repeating guidance that has existed for 20 or 30 years.

 The hon. Gentleman raises a very important issue. The scenario that many in the NHS feared, which has led to the guidance over the years, is that a patient in the first bed on a ward would be treated completely differently from the one in the second bed, because of their ability to pay. That is not the argument that has been raised by hon. Members in the House. I understand very clearly the fundamental points that are being made, particularly about Mrs. O&#146;Boyle, who did not know that there was an obligation to pay for treatment until she had received it. But the hon. Gentleman, from his experience in the NHS, raises the fundamental, key issue, which I hope he will accept is very clearly set out in the terms of reference.</p>

 Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that the review will not result in a lottery system in the NHS, whereby people who can afford to pay can buy better treatment than people who cannot afford to do so? Most hon.

Will he assure us that the review will not open up that avenue?</p>

Friend should be reassured that we are reviewing how the system works in the 21st-century NHS, and that the outcome is not predetermined. Professor Mike Richards is a respected clinician: he led the development of the cancer plan and cancer strategy, and until recently he was chairman of the National Cancer Research Institute. All the cases that I have examined, including Mrs. O&#146;Boyle&#146;s, relate to cancer&#151;mainly bowel cancer and kidney cancer. Professor Richards has spent his whole life in the NHS, so he is the perfect person to review the situation very quickly. The report will be published, so hon. Members will have the chance to see the results.</p>

 Desperately ill patients and their families are often vulnerable to the false hope provided by miracle drugs, which are sometimes touted in the media. What consumer advice&#151;it is almost consumer protection&#151;will be given to those people so that they do not waste their time and money or expend their hope on what are cul-de-sacs so far as treatment is concerned?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises another dimension to the issue. Professor Richards led on the cancer strategy, which was published in December and pointed out the need to get cancer drugs through the process much more quickly. Consumers who are considering drugs that are available on the internet should, first, take the advice of their clinician; secondly, check whether the drug is licensed; and, thirdly, if it is licensed, ensure that they know where it sits in relation to the NICE process. We can speed up the NICE process, and we will comment on that in the next-stage review, which will be published shortly. The internet contains a range of drugs, some of which are licensed and some of which are not. We must be vociferous in ensuring that consumers get the right advice, and we must do what we can to ensure the proper regulation of such drugs.</p>

 I am sure that the House is grateful to the Secretary of State for initiating the review. The Secretary of State will also appreciate that we have not had access to the terms of reference. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State, taking account of the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) on behalf of Mrs. O&#146;Boyle and her family, were to agree that we need to examine two principles. First, if patients access private treatment beyond the boundaries of NHS care, it should not mean that they lose their entitlement to NHS care. Secondly, NHS care itself should continue to be both comprehensive and free based on need, not ability to pay. I gather from the terms of reference that the Secretary of State has included the latter principle, but has he included the former?</p>

 I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has not had a chance to see the review&#146;s terms of reference, but that sounded like an attempt to pre-empt the outcome. We are clear that someone who has had private treatment can return to the NHS for treatment, and we are also clear that people who have had NHS treatment are perfectly entitled to obtain private treatment. The ambiguity occurs over the term &#147;an episode of care&#148; and whether someone can buy a drug that is not available on the NHS and ask the NHS to pay for its  <br>

administration as part of their treatment. I want Professor Richards to examine that area, and I do not want to predetermine the review. Professor Richards is well aware of the problems experienced by Mrs. O&#146;Boyle and others, because he deals with such issues all the time. When the hon. Gentleman sees the terms of reference&#151;I will not take up the House&#146;s time by reading them all out, because there are quite a few words&#151;I hope that he will be assured that that point has been addressed. If not, the issue is not party political, and he is welcome to come and see me&#151;indeed, I am sure that Mike Richards would be keen to talk to him.</p>

 I look forward to discussing the matter with Mike Richards. The Secretary of State will appreciate why I mention &#147;comprehensive care&#148;. The review particularly relates to many of the new cancer drugs. Mike Richards and the NHS also need to address how patients who rely on the NHS for their treatment can be sure that they will get comprehensive treatment. For example, I have a list of 20 European countries where Erbitux, the brand name for Cetuximab, which was privately provided for Mrs. O&#146;Boyle, is routinely made available for patients with colorectal cancer. In the NHS, Mrs. O&#146;Boyle was told that that drug was not available. Surely we must address that question, too.</p>

 I do not believe that that is about the terms of reference. The issue is how we deal with the NICE process. Cetuximab was a specific issue and it had not been through the NICE process. The PCT decided that the circumstances were not exceptional and, therefore, the treatment was not given. There is a whole different dimension to the issue under discussion. The fundamental problems that Professor Richards will look at are confined not to cancer drugs but to drugs per se. There may be many other issues and unintended consequences, because we have been concentrating so closely on the understandably controversial issues surrounding Mrs. O&#146;Boyle and others. But Professor Richards&#146;s remit will be to look right across the range. The worst thing that could happen to the review would be if he were to concentrate on one particular area and on a few particular drugs, and then miss the fact that unintended consequences apply to other illnesses and to other drugs.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a very important point. He will know that the prevalence of HIV in England is one of the lowest in Europe&#151;comparable to that in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. Nevertheless, he is quite correct: about 31 per cent. of those who are infected are unaware of the fact. The steps that the Department has been taking have been, first, to focus on publicising the importance of early testing and on providing extra resources; secondly, to improve timely access to NHS testing, particularly in a variety of settings, not just in genito-urinary medicine clinics; thirdly, to look very specifically at where the highest risks are and to ensure that information and support are provided to those groups to encourage them to come forward for testing; and, finally, to undertake work with those in the voluntary and third sectors, as well as with local health authorities, to try to remove the stigma and the perceived discrimination that many people fear in order to encourage them to come forward.</p>

 As my hon.

 The Minister will know that IVF treatment was suspended in Northamptonshire because of lack of money.

Secondly, I will certainly be making sure that the Department contacts the manufacturer to ensure that it fulfils its responsibilities to people who have been affected in the UK in the same way as it is now compensating people in the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80617-0003.htm_para4"><a name="08061769000141">The debate about social inequality is beset by stereotypes and simplification. Sometimes stereotypes give us an indication of the truth, but they frequently conceal more than they reveal. So, we hear a lot about the north-south divide, and unemployment and incapacity benefit figures are frequently portrayed exclusively in terms of decayed former industrial communities in the north or in the Welsh valleys. Sometimes Tower Hamlets is contrasted with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in what is frequently described as a tale of two cities, revealing the stark divide in average incomes, house prices and life expectancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80617-0003.htm_para5"><a name="08061769000142">Such attention is broadly welcome because it highlights the continuing extent&#151;and in some ways the worsening or intensification&#151;of the toxin of inequality. It is even more corrosive than poverty, in its own insidious way, as has been so well documented by academics such as Richard Wilkinson. Inequality damages health, undermines community cohesion and is now understood to be more closely correlated with crime than poverty itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80617-0003.htm_para6"><a name="08061769000143">Inequality is poorly understood. Last year&#146;s report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation confirmed that people&#146;s knowledge about inequality is limited, and attitudes are complex, ambiguous and apparently contradictory. In turn, policy makers know little about how the perceptions people have are formed, or changed. We could simply choose to ignore the ramifications of inequality, precisely because public attitudes are complex and contradictory. But by doing so, we would be turning our backs on a very real problem. Over the past 20 years a consistently large majority of people have considered the gap between rich and poor to be too large, and only a small minority of people feel that the Government are doing too much to address the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80617-0003.htm_para7"><a name="08061769000144">My Bill is intended to make a small contribution to increasing awareness and understanding of social inequality. I seek broadly to mirror the important work done by primary care trusts in their annual public health reports, which have come into their own in recent years as an essential source of data about health inequalities. By requiring all local authorities to produce an annual audit, based on a core basket of indicators, I would hope to achieve three things. First, I would like to get beyond stereotypes, whether of the north-south divide kind, or the Tower Hamlets versus Kensington and Chelsea variety. The reality is far more complex than such stereotypes would have us believe and generalisations limit understanding, not deepen it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80617-0003.htm_para8"><a name="08061769000145">Secondly, I hope that the process of producing and publishing annual audits would generate interest and debate among local policy makers, the media and others, precisely because the information would be local. Of course, there are no guarantees that such interest would sharpen the focus on deprivation and inequality, but it would certainly offer communities a set of tools to hold policy makers to account. That is certainly the experience of PCTs and public health reports in recent years.</p>

The local councils that make up my constituency&#151;Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea&#151;consistently come near to the top of national league tables for wealth and income. The prosperity of Knightsbridge, Belgravia and Chelsea, where some councillors think that international bankers constitute a &#147;hard to reach group&#148;, masks the fact that, as recent reports have confirmed, the Mozart estate in Queen&#146;s Park in my constituency is the most deprived neighbourhood in the whole country, and Westbourne ward has the country&#146;s highest proportion of children in workless households. But I&#151;and my colleagues in other areas with generally affluent average figures&#151;struggle to get the implications of that understood locally and nationally, and families and pensioners living in poor neighbourhoods in such areas lose out in consequence.</p>

Obviously, I would want short profiles of all neighbourhoods, which currently stay anonymously labelled as &#147;super output areas&#148; buried in the Office for National Statistics. Which are the most prosperous areas and which the poorest? We already have information on employment levels, and the number of children in workless households&#151;that is, families surviving on less than &#163;10 per day for fuel, food, clothing and treats. I would want to include data that exist but are unpublished, collected in school information profiles. League tables offer us information on key stage results and useful, though poorly understood, contextualised added value, but they should be complemented by the information that we hold on all schools about free school meal entitlements and other proxies for deprivation.</p>

On the same day, the British Medical Association delivered to Downing street a petition against the Government&#146;s polyclinic proposals consisting of 1.2 million signatures. Patients care about the future of their local surgeries and about their GP services. They and GPs are concerned that the Government&#146;s top-down, one-size-fits-all imposition of polyclinics in London and in each primary care trust across the country will reduce access to their GP services and undermine the GP-patient relationship, which is at the heart of the successful delivery of health care.</p>

 I will come to the hon. Lady in a minute. The first point to make clear is that the Government could have gone ahead in a far simpler, better fashion. They could have offered primary care trusts extra funding to provide additional practices in under-doctored areas. They could have offered funding to each primary care trust across the country to enable them to provide access to diagnostics and additional therapies in each area, in places that would have made sense from the point of view of local GPs. Everywhere that I have been&#151;that is quite a lot of places&#151;GPs would very happily have got together and agreed where it would be appropriate for such diagnostics and therapies to be available.</p>

 Yes, it is, and that is the way in which the Government now work. It is simple to say why GPs and patients across the country are angry: it is because, contrary to the Government&#146;s rhetoric about local decision making, and contrary to the Minister&#146;s rhetoric about all the proposals coming from primary care trusts, it is an imposed plan, generated inside the Department of Health and adopted by Ministers who should have known better.</p>

 I assure my hon. Friend that certainly GPs in Chelmsford do not think that he is scaremongering in any way. Mid Essex PCT is being forced to have a polyclinic in Chelmsford and GPs in the area are extremely worried that it will have a serious and negative impact on their practices, because of the nature of the things being imposed on them.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has gone to the heart of the issue. At the moment, the Government require PCTs to publish memorandums of information before in effect tendering for the new polyclinics. We have seen the tender documents from 58 PCTs, which identify 608 GP surgeries in proximity to proposed polyclinic locations. Because the Government have insisted that the new polyclinics should register patients, the local practices identified in those documents will see their patient lists undermined, some of them potentially fatally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80617-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08061769000185">The Secretary of State has said that no GP surgery will be closed as a consequence of opening polyclinics, but how can that be true? The Government amendment does not refer to the polyclinics proposal for London, which we should address for a second. The Prime Minister got up at the Dispatch Box and said that there would be 150 polyclinics, that each polyclinic would have 25 GPs and that each polyclinic would serve 50,000 people. The consequence of that would be the closure of more than 70 per cent. of existing GP surgeries in London.</p>

If the polyclinics are not additional and the GPs in them are the same GPs who currently work in their own surgeries&#151;or, for that matter, salaried doctors in PCTs&#151;then a number of surgeries will have to close. That was the clear implication of the Government&#146;s proposals for London. If that is not the case and the GPs are genuinely additional GPs in additional GP practices, where will the money come from? We have done that calculation, too. If the Secretary of State is to be believed and the provision is all additional, the cost of that number of GPs in that number of surgeries would be &#163;1.6 billion a year. However, the Government have allocated &#163;250 million over three years, so the situation simply does not add up. One of two things must be true. Either the GPs will be moved and the practices will be moved from their present locations into larger polyclinics, or additional services will be provided and additional costs will be incurred. The Government have not answered the question about which one of those two things it will be.</p>

 In my PCT, the thinking concerns creating a polyclinic based on a hospital. That would reduce inappropriate accident and emergency attendances by people who are not registered with doctors, which hammers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument that there is a one-size-fits-all solution. Is it not true that in 1981 the Acheson report addressed the issue of single-handed practices, particularly in London, where single-handed practices were over-represented? For 16 years, Conservative Governments made progress&#151;not enough in my view&#151;on reducing single-handed practices. Although there is good practice in some single-handed practices, by and large the quality of care is not as good as that provided by other practices. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his party stands four-square behind all single-handed practices, regardless of the quality of care?</p>

the specific design for a polyclinic&#151;25 GPs, 50,000 people, &#163;800,000 a year rent, a number of out-patient attendances, the employment of a consultant and the provision of a number of nurses. I did not make that up; the Prime Minister stood at the Dispatch Box and paraded the fact that there would be 150 polyclinics in London. It is absurd that the hon.

 My hon. Friend has said that the situation is absurd, but there is a further bizarre twist. Is he aware that the Darzi clinics will not be subject to monitoring by health overview and scrutiny committees?

I have been to rural areas and talked to the head of the local medical committee in north Yorkshire, and it is completely absurd that a town such as Scarborough, which has many health needs but is not under-doctored in terms of GPs, should have money spent on it in that way.

So when the Secretary of State says that he is perfectly willing to campaign on the issue, perhaps he would like to tell all the people of London that the distance to their GP surgery will triple.

We know that patient choice and preference show that they value continuity of care even more highly than rapid access to care. We know that integrated care is about a lot more than putting all the services in one large building.

 One of the justifications for polyclinics is the extension of GP availability. Healthcare for London quotes the patient survey of 2007 as saying that the majority of patients are dissatisfied with their GP&#146;s opening hours. However, the British Medical Association quotes the same survey as saying that 84 out of 100 people are satisfied with their GP opening hours, so is it not better to listen to individual patients and individual GPs? I have not had one GP or patient from my constituency contact me to say that they are in favour of polyclinics.</p>

 The hon. Lady is referring to the Healthcare Commission report, which was not a London-only survey and which showed a high level of satisfaction with GP opening hours. However, the 84 per cent. in favour left some 6 million people throughout the country who were dissatisfied. When one looked into the figures, one found that people from black and minority ethnic communities, such as the Bangladeshi community, those from poorer backgrounds and, in particular, those from London were much less satisfied than the rest of the country. According to a BMA survey, 60 per cent. of London GPs say that their facilities are unsuitable for current needs, 75 per cent. think that they cannot meet future needs and 36 per cent. doubt whether their facilities could be adapted to meet the access requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005.

They are designed purely and simply to increase capacity. The average primary care trust has around 55 GP practices that will continue to provide services to their patients as they do today. In addition to those practices, each PCT will also now have a GP-led health centre, funded from ongoing additional investment, attached to which are only three conditions. No. 1 is that the centre should be in a central location; it should be accessible. No. 2 is that it should be open from 8 am to 8 pm, 365 days a year. The third is that any member of the public must be able to use the centre either to book a GP appointment or to turn up to see a GP or nurse without the need to be registered at the centre&#151;in other words, people can continue to be registered with their local family doctor and benefit from the continuity of care that is provided.</p>

 The Secretary of State is trying to share as much information with the House as possible. Is it not true that there are two other conditions? One is that no primary care trust can say, &#147;No, we don&#146;t want to do it.&#148; The second is that there is a rule that no existing GP-led health centre&#151;that is to say, a wide practice&#151;can turn itself into one of these new GP-led health centres.</p>

 Further to the point raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), if the Secretary of State looks at areas such as Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, he will see that there is a geographical problem. If he is simply imposing a top-down restructuring of the type that he is describing, a single polyclinic in just one area in a place the shape and size of Cornwall will clearly have a destabilising and destructive impact. Why does he not allow that local community to design services that best meet its needs, rather than imposing this top-down, centralised restructuring? Why will he not allow the local community to design its own services and achieve the aims that I think he desires?</p>

 We have specified three conditions. The centres must be centrally located, must be open from 8 am until 8 pm seven days a week, and must allow people to use their services on a drop-in basis as well as to be registered if they wish.

For those without transport, it can take a whole day to get to the doctor and back, via the pharmacy. If then, they are required to visit the hospital for blood tests, x-rays or anything else, that will take them another day. There is a tentatively enthusiastic welcome to a super surgery or polyclinic that will allow them to do all these things on one day, under one roof.&#148;</p>

 The hon.

Members, in the private sector&#151;to come into consortiums with it, and it will provide the building. That is nothing to do with the Government or the 150 new GP-led centres.</p>

As we will not be removing existing GP surgeries, the time for the Opposition to criticise these proposals will be when and if these new facilities remain empty and unused once they have been established. I confidently predict that that will not be the outcome, and that historians of the health service will look back on this peculiar spat as the time when producer capture killed off the little credibility that the Conservatives ever had on health issues.

 It is surely a spectacular achievement by the Government to have taken a concept that is clearly worthy of consideration and development and, in the space of nine short months, turned so many people against it. The reason for that is the central imposition from Whitehall, which will require every PCT to introduce a GP-led health centre.</p>

GP-led health centres are, at the very least, embryonic polyclinics. They look to most independent observers very much like the same thing. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) and my hon.

 Does the hon.

 That might be a concern, but my argument is that these new mechanisms for delivering care should be piloted.

We saw the consequences of imposing an entirely new system across the whole country, without proper piloting, and it ended in disaster, causing many problems for junior doctors. Did the Government learn their lesson from that gross error? No, they did not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08061775000010">Here we are again, imposing a system from the centre despite all the evidence, which I shall come on to, from the King&#146;s Fund and many others, which ought to be enough to make the Government stop and think, and learn lessons before proceeding further. In future years, this case will provide us with yet another perfect case study of how rushed central imposition fails, with the waste of resources that always happens when attempts are made to impose a measure from Whitehall, with the failure to develop policy based on evidence, and, critically, with the alienation of professionals and communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08061775000011">Let me deal with the subject of the alienation of professionals. The Government have decided to pick a fight with the BMA, and with GPs in general. They quickly dismiss the BMA, accusing it of being luddite and resistant to any change, and saying that it always has been like that and always will be. That view results in the Government closing their mind to legitimate concerns from many doctors about the implications of the proposals. It also closes their mind to the risks of undermining what is already very good in our primary care system. Primary care in this country is the envy of much of the rest of the world. We must never be complacent about the need to improve primary care  <br>

when it fails, but there is a real risk that the proposals will undermine much of what is so good about the system that we have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08061775000012">Alienating communities is not the way to empower communities or local commissioners. The primary care trust in Birmingham mentioned by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak might well have its own plans about how it wants to develop services in that community. In my county of Norfolk, the primary care trust has not even finished a review of its estate since it was created in the autumn of 2006, yet this change is being forced on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08061775000013">These decisions should surely be made locally, and should be based on what works best in the area. They should be based on what services are being developed to provide the services talked about in the proposal&#151;such as the community hospitals, which are so critical in serving rural areas. They should be based on the quality of primary care. It is variable; surely that points to a need for local solutions, rather than having Whitehall simply impose its proposals. Surely local commissioners should make such decisions. What are the important principles that should apply, and what evidence is there that existing provision is failing? What evidence is there that polyclinics will provide solutions to any of the failures that we identify?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08061775000014">The principles behind the proposal are important. First, clearly there are real issues to be addressed in connection with the concept of breaking down the divide between primary and secondary care. The case for providing care closer to home is an important principle, as is the quality of care provided to the patient. As for whether there is a need to improve what we already have, as I have said, we must not be complacent. There is a divide between primary and secondary care, and we should consider all ways of reducing that divide, to ensure that there are better working arrangements between consultants in hospitals and GPs working in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08061775000015">The quality of primary care is generally, but not universally, excellent. The Royal College of General Practitioners is aware of that; it recognises the variability of care across the country, and the fact that in deprived areas there are fewer GPs. There are concerns that some single-GP practices do not provide the quality of care available elsewhere. Some are very good, but others do not offer care of a sufficient quality. There are financial incentives that encourage GPs to work in the leafy suburbs, but not to work&#151;or stay&#151;in the poorest communities. Those financial incentives need to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08061775000016">There are also concerns about the patient experience. The Secretary of State made the point that if a person has to visit a GP, then a pharmacy elsewhere, and then a hospital for a further check-up, perhaps after an operation, they may make many long journeys. That can be extremely onerous for the elderly and people who live in rural areas. At the beginning of the week, I spoke to a constituent who described making a 60-mile round trip to the acute hospital in Norwich for what turned out to be a two-minute check-up appointment following an operation. None of us can be happy with that situation, so we must have open minds and be willing to consider ways of improving the patient experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08061775000017">It is worth while considering new models of care, looking at what works in other countries, and trying to learn the lessons.

social care, and there is a citizens advice bureau in there, too. To all intents and purposes, it looked like an incredibly impressive facility, so I am certainly not dismissive of the concept&#146;s potential to work in certain defined conditions, but when the King&#146;s Fund looked at the evidence, it raised serious concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08061775000018">The King&#146;s Fund first looked at other countries. There is some bizarre cross-dressing going on; it talked about the original concept coming from the Soviet Union and being developed in many eastern European countries that were part of the Soviet bloc, yet those countries are now moving away from that model, and towards a much more open primary care market. Meanwhile the United States, Germany and Canada are very much moving in the direction of the polyclinic model. As two groups of countries are moving in diametrically opposite directions, the changing enthusiasm for polyclinics surely ought to make us wary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08061775000019">The King&#146;s Fund also warns that what might look very attractive and work effectively in the States or Germany cannot be translated to this country. It makes the point that there are far more doctors per 1,000 people in Germany, for example, than in this country. So caution is required about simply adopting something that looks good elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08061775000020">The King&#146;s Fund clearly recognised the potential for such new concepts of delivering care, but it found no systematic evaluations of polyclinic models in other countries. The Government, however, appear determined to proceed without that evidential base. The King&#146;s Fund had real concerns about what it saw overseas. It saw that, in many cases, the fact that professionals were working together under one roof did not automatically lead to integrated care; it saw a lack of integration between polyclinics and hospitals. It raised concerns about a lack of continuity of care, whereby the patient did not see the same doctor every time. That is one of the issues that cause elderly people a lot of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08061775000021">The King&#146;s Fund found concerns about a decline in professional motivation and development, where consultants who might previously have been based in hospital centres of excellence end up in more remote settings away from professional colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08061775000022">Bizarrely, given the Government&#146;s claims, the King&#146;s Fund identified a lack of patient choice. Given some of the concerns that have been raised by the BMA and others about the ultimate position with small GP practices closing, the result could be that people in a local area end up with less choice about their primary care centre. They might have no choice but to go to the local polyclinic. That looks very likely to be the case in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08061775000023">The King&#146;s Fund also looked specifically at the local improvement finance trust schemes already operating in this country. It specifically examined 12 LIFT schemes that it considered bore all the hallmarks of the polyclinic model that the Government seek to pursue. It said:</p>
<a name="80617-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="08061775000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If anything were to demonstrate the benefits of the polyclinic model in England, it should in theory be evident in LIFT schemes.&#148;</p>

It found little evidence of innovation in this country&#146;s existing polyclinic model. It found that local authority social services, which were supposed to  <br>

be integral to those centres, had &#147;fallen by the wayside&#148; and were not continuing to participate in them because of tight local funding streams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08061775000025">Crucially, the King&#146;s Fund found a lack of clarity about responsibility for strategic development&#151;no one in charge, determining the strategic development of those centres. It found a lack of clarity about who was responsible for overall clinical governance in those facilities. Surely that should disturb the Government. It found that payment by results&#151;the Government&#146;s mechanism for funding care, which is a blunt instrument&#151;is causing acute hospitals to have their funding streams undermined where such centres exist, because the polyclinics do the more routine procedures, thus leaving the acute hospitals to do the more expensive procedures, while receiving the same tariff. They are losing income for the simple procedures and receiving too low a tariff for the more complex procedures. All that is swept aside in the Government&#146;s determination to rush headlong down this route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08061775000026">The King&#146;s Fund also found that none of the 12 existing schemes demonstrated savings or improvements in costs compared with previous models of care. They had struggled to persuade GPs to relocate, and had been developed because of a political imperative to introduce them, rather than being based on patient need. The report raised the specific fear that polyclinics would, in effect, become white elephants. It also noted the concern about access. It drew specific attention to the fact that if people have to travel further and for a longer time to their primary care centre&#151;particularly in the more deprived communities, where people might not have access to cars&#151;they are less likely to use that facility. Surely, again, that should be a concern in London, given the proposals that the Government are intent on pursuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08061775000027">When the King&#146;s Fund examined the 12 existing cases, it identified a failure to shift any care from remote acute hospitals to polyclinic settings. It is essential to secure local leadership and a shared ambition, which is usually lacking when a model is imposed on an area by Whitehall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08061775000028">The King&#146;s Fund has stated that, critically, the Government have not answered the question about who will lead on either strategic direction or clinical governance. Until the Government clearly indicate their intentions on centrally imposed GP-led health centres, there will be massive concern that the fears identified by the King&#146;s Fund in the existing centres will be realised right across the country, because we have not learned the lessons from the pilots. Foreign evidence also points to the central importance of leadership in such centres. The existing LIFT schemes and the foreign experience should be enough to persuade the Government to pause for thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08061775000029">My plea to the Government is to develop pilots with proper investment. The King&#146;s Fund has stated that the focus is often on simply creating the building within which services are provided, without investing in change management, which involves changing services and the way in which patients are treated. We should develop those models, extend the evidence base, sort out the question of leadership and explore the range of models, which include hub and spoke, and locating all GPs in the same building.</p>

Recently, three GP practices were privatised&#151;there is no other way to describe it. Three popular practices were required to bid to continue their existence. They met all the quality requirements, and in the assessment they did better than the private sector bidder on all of them, but the private sector bidder put in a lower bid in terms of costs.

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para24"><a name="08061775000038">UnitedHealthcare, a subsidiary of an American outfit, secured the contract. I expected&#151;perhaps rather cynically&#151;that it would put on an absolutely wondrous show in the three practices that it had taken over, so that they would serve as loss leaders and as an example of what a good job it could do. My cynicism was not justified, because although a man called Neil Bentley from the CBI has declared them to be a success, he obviously lives in an evidence-free zone. Since the new company took over, appointment times for each patient have been reduced from 15 minutes to 10. If the visit or appointment is unscheduled, people get only 5 minutes and are told that they can talk about only one problem, even if they have more. The new company has not complied with the extra opening hours that the contract specified, and which it undertook to deliver. It closed a baby clinic and then had to reopen it in response to a public outcry. There are rumours&#151;although they are denied&#151;that the company is in the process of going back to the primary care trust to ask for more money.</p>

These, we are told, will provide community-based diagnostics. There are apparently three proposals for polyclinics in my constituency, and as part of the move to community-based diagnostics, one will be at University College London hospital and another will be at the Royal Free hospital, so we will actually have hospital-based diagnostics and&#151;this will be a novelty&#151;hospital-based community and GP services. Originally, polyclinics were to be targeted at under-doctored areas and populations, which might be worth while if it were the only way to secure the extra doctors and better services required to meet people&#146;s needs. But those needs vary from place to place, depending on the geography and on the nature of the population. I have always believed in horses for courses, but I do not think that the Government do. In London, it is certainly not horses for courses but &#147;Thou shalt have a polyclinic.&#148; I also believe that it would be a good idea for these things to be tried out in pilot schemes in various parts of the country.</p>

I am sure that the Minister would have to confirm that when he talks to Health Ministers from abroad they are envious of the impact of GP services on keeping down costs. It looks, from such evidence as is available, as though where polyclinics, or something like them, exist, more investigations and tests are prescribed, often wastefully, as in the United States&#151;perhaps less so in Germany&#151;and  <br>

It appears that that scheme will involve everybody who goes there for GP services, as well as everybody who goes to accident and emergency and can walk into the place, as opposed to arriving by ambulance. In effect, far from there being a shift to community services, we are moving towards provision being increasingly concentrated in the hospital. Will the doctors there be able to refer people to other hospitals instead of University College hospital, where the polyclinic will be located?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para28"><a name="08061775000042">Then there is the question of the impact on the area&#146;s existing GP services, which are convenient and familiar&#151;two things that appeal particularly to older people, disabled people and families with children. It is also the case that nearly everyone looks for some continuity of care by seeing the same doctor, if at all possible.</p>

That is not clear at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80617-0008.htm_para30"><a name="08061775000044">That brings me to the question of who will own the polyclinic. Will it be a private sector outfit? Will UnitedHealthcare, which has already taken over the three GP practices in the area, be able to bid for and take over the polyclinic? If so, that will be despite the fact that its owners have been indicted for fraud and every form of swindling of taxpayers, patients and doctors in the United States. If it gets the polyclinic contract, will it also get the out-of-hours contract, for which it is believed to be bidding? If so, we would end up with a US company having something approaching a local monopoly in part of my area. I remind Ministers that the first priority and statutory duty of the people running a private sector company is to put the interests and needs of shareholders first. It is not just me who says that.

Professor Ara Darzi, who is a most distinguished surgeon and a highly intelligent and charming man, put forward the polyclinic proposals for London. He is a Minister in this Government. Mr. Paul Corrigan, who used to work at Downing street, is the London director of strategy and commissioning in London, and the benighted Lord Warner is chair of the provider agency in London, following his departure from office as a Minister just before all the trouble arose over the problems of junior doctors. Let us assume for a minute that there is no Government influence in the matter.

As I mentioned in my intervention on the Secretary of State, it is quite clear that the PCT is not leading the proposals.

The development has been five years in the making, with full support from the PCT, and will provide services in addition to GP services.

 That is absolutely right. Obviously, the PCT would not earn brownie points if it failed to go along with these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80617-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08061794000028">When I heard about these proposals, I immediately thought, &#147;Why should these new services threaten existing services?&#148;, but it is quite clear that the health centre is expected to take on 6,000 patients, as is the GP-led centre. Yes, they will also take people who are not registered and there is certainly a need for the proposed services, but the GPs say they would be delighted to provide those services if only there were an opportunity for them to expand existing provision. It seems, however, that the rules say that the premises have to be completely new, so they are not in accordance with the idea of expanding existing GP provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80617-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08061794000029">When I started to investigate these issues I was worried, so I went back to the Darzi interim report and tried to find the logic behind these proposals. I found that Darzi had noted that life expectancy was lower in areas where there were fewer GPs per head of population. That may well be the case, but I am not sure that the conclusion follows&#151;that the way to deal with the problem is to develop 150 GP-led centres and to provide new GP practices in areas where there are health inequalities. It is not exactly logical to deduce that that is the way to deal with the problem. I read the report, but I could not understand the thinking that led Lord Darzi to decide that this was the solution to under-doctoring. I certainly could not understand why he should view it as a blueprint to be applied across all PCTs. The under-doctoring in my constituency, for example, is not particularly great and it is spread out&#151;there is no single location where there is a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80617-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08061794000030">It seems to me that the Government should stop portraying the debate over these issues in terms of the BMA and the Tory party being opposed to genuine locally led improvements in service. That is not the case. Two of the GPs who contacted me about this issue are members of the Labour party and they are actively interested in improving services to their patients and reducing inequalities. One made a submission to the Select Committee on Health and is active in the Socialist Health Association. These are not people who naturally look to the Conservative party to champion their cause. They are very worried&#151;and their worries were confirmed by a conversation I had with the lead officer at the PCT&#151;that this is just an excuse to bring in the private sector and provide competition, which is seen as the way to make GPs buck up their ideas and improve their services. I do not think that the GPs in my area need that kind of competition. They want improvements in service. They put in bids to expand their practices. They are outraged because they were told a year or two ago that they should cease providing Saturday morning services and are now being told that that is what they must provide.</p>

patients when they want to find out whether it would be a good idea to move to their practice. That is already possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80617-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08061794000033">Many GPs would like to provide the proposed services, but they say that there is no level playing field. The new provision is being procured through the standard procedure, which gives large alternative provider medical services an administrative advantage. Those services are bidding for other contracts and are set up for that kind of work, which is not the case for GPs. Some GPs who have expressed an interest in bidding for the services were given 24 hours&#146; notice of a bidder event day. Most of those who have looked into the possibility of tendering do not believe that they are in a position to do so. It would divert their attention from what they should be doing, which is providing high-quality services for their patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80617-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08061794000034">I ask the Government to look seriously at the criticisms made today, particularly by Labour Members. We believe that the Government have much to be proud of in terms of developments in the health service. There is no doubt that health services have improved dramatically since 1997. We have 5,000 more GPs, and GPs now have more time to spend with their patients. However, the Government should not simply dismiss the concerns of GPs because they think that they are being oppositionist for opposition&#146;s sake. There are many good reasons why the BMA in general and GPs in my constituency are concerned about the proposals. They believe that they will destabilise existing services. How will a practice that is expanding, taking on an additional 4,000 patients, continue when there is going to be a new health centre over the road, potentially taking on 6,000 patients? It will have to take on additional patients if it is to continue to receive funding beyond the five-year allocation. In the end, the money will be allocated to the general pot and there will be no specific allocation for the proposed services.</p>

great play of that recently when he visited the constituency next to mine, just outside Basingstoke, to talk about the future of polyclinics or GP-led health centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08061794000040">The problem we face in my constituency is that the Government have great house building targets for Basingstoke&#151;with which many local people, including me, do not agree&#151;that are not matched by a similar expansion of local surgeries, including GPs&#146; surgeries. About 1,000 houses a year are being built, there has been a 13 per cent. increase in the number of babies born in our local hospital, and the fastest-growing group of people in my constituency are those aged 65 and over: the pensioners of north Hampshire. However, we are seeing a real lack of support for the development of those important primary health care services in my community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08061794000041">Let me give three examples. Merton Rise is a family development north of Basingstoke. The plan was to have a GP&#146;s surgery at the heart of it, but that has been axed. Rooksdown, in the neighbouring constituency of North-East Hampshire, is also a family-based community. For four years, a portakabin has delivered important GP services to families who have produced not just one or two but as many as three babies while they have been living in that community. In the ward of South Ham, 25 per cent. of residents are over 65, and the largest number of 70-year-olds in the borough live there; however, its 1960s GP&#146;s surgery is bursting at the seams and long overdue for replacement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08061794000042">Although it is clear that Basingstoke greatly needs investment in primary care, no money has been forthcoming. However, the town has been identified as the favoured location in Hampshire for a town-centre polyclinic. Our PCT has told us that we must have one&#151;we know that it has little choice in the matter&#151;and it will be a significant distance from the communities that I have described. Moreover, the main rationale for the polyclinic is that Basingstoke is a commuter town. Polyclinics may have a role to play in urban and metropolitan areas, but they do not meet the urgent and pressing needs of families and elderly people in the outlying suburbs of Basingstoke. There is a need for basic GP provision, not a centrally dictated solution to a problem that is not the first priority for local residents. It seems perverse to spend money on increased access for commuters rather than mothers with young babies and the over-70s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08061794000043">Basingstoke&#146;s town centre already has plenty of GP provision, for historical reasons. We have a newly located GP&#146;s surgery, offering an extended range of services, right next door to our station. However, I understand that the present rules will not allow it to bid for a polyclinic, so there is a possibility of duplication where we really do not need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08061794000044">The Government have put great emphasis on new funding, but it is not altogether clear that the message has reached the PCT in Hampshire. The matter was discussed in some detail at a PCT board meeting in March. According to the board papers, the chairman of the PCT patient and public involvement forum asked whether any services would have to be cut</p>

 If patients can register with an expensively laid-out new centre, they will take their money away from the GP&#146;s surgery&#151;perhaps in the countryside, in an area such as the East Riding of Yorkshire&#151;with which they are currently registered. That would undermine the funding of the surgery, and lead to the closure of GP services in areas such as Leven and Beeford in my constituency.</p>

 That is an excellent point. My constituency also contains rural areas. I have already received letters from areas north of Basingstoke such as Bramley, where it is feared that the viability of providing GP services will be undermined. It is not, however, just a question of money. My main worry is that Hampshire PCT&#146;s attention will be diverted from resolving Basingstoke&#146;s genuine primary care needs. The PCT has just undergone an enormous reorganisation, and is now the largest in the country. It is clear that it has been struggling to deal with specific local problems, including the delivery of primary care in Basingstoke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08061794000048">During Health questions earlier today, the Secretary of State said that the Government had no intention of removing existing services, but by definition money will be diverted&#151;whether it comes from the Secretary of State or the PCT&#151;from solving the problems in existing services and ensuring that they can meet the needs of local residents. We must look after the elderly and families, those who need support the most, before turning our attention to other priorities that the Government may have&#151;priorities that may be absolutely right for metropolitan and urban areas such as London, but do not hit the mark when it comes to our problems in Basingstoke.</p>

 There is something funny about this debate. I am the only practising GP left in the House of Commons, and apparently I am the only one with a good word to say about polyclinics. I honestly believe that they will give patients access to services that currently require some to travel many miles, and to which many others simply do not have adequate access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08061794000050">In my view, Ministers have given sufficient reassurance that most of the new services will be in addition to the existing ones. GPs will be able to work on a hub and spoke model, retaining their own practices if that is what suits the locality, or to locate their practices in polyclinics, maintaining the integrity of those practices while having access to all the extra services that are currently not so accessible.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08061794000053">The National Health Service Act 1946 allowed health centres along the lines proposed by Dawson to be set up but did not make their adoption mandatory, despite Bevan's enthusiasm for the idea, owing largely to opposition from the professionals. Their opposition stemmed from</p>
<a name="80617-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="08061794000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the BMA's hostility to any proposal which appeared to turn GPs into public servants&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08061794000054">Unsurprisingly, therefore, by 1963 only 18 purpose-built health centres were in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08061794000055">Vested professional interests were also partly to blame for the failure of the East German polyclinic model to survive reunification. In 2005, an article in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> by German academics explained:</p>
<a name="80617-0010.htm_brev3"><a name="08061794000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;State owned policlinics were one component of primary health care in former East Germany, housing general and specialist doctors and dentists. This integrated model was efficient and cost saving: facilities and laboratories were shared, alternative treatment and prevention strategies were coordinated, and referrals to specialists were well monitored, as well as each patient&#146;s case. Policlinics did not conform to the West German concept of independently contracted doctors paid on the basis of an item of service, so they did not survive in East Germany after 1995.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08061794000056">However, five years later, in 2000, the polyclinic model was back on the agenda in Germany, having been reinstigated by German policy makers in a bid to</p>
<a name="80617-0010.htm_brev4"><a name="08061794000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;increase cooperation between general doctors, specialists, and hospitals; to improve communication between institutions; and to reduce healthcare costs.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08061794000057">That illustrates that we need to be extremely wary about the opposition to the current polyclinics proposals expressed by professional trade unions such as the BMA. The BMA says that it is not opposed to the polyclinics model per se, but that they need to be introduced gradually over time and not be imposed centrally, and that proper regard must be paid to the specific character of each local health economy. That is a perfectly sensible position to adopt, except that the BMA has been saying exactly that from 1920 onwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08061794000058">As long as the polyclinic model remains an aspiration rather than a specific policy objective, the chances are that we will never see them in place across the country. As one speaker said last week at a meeting on polyclinics of the all-party group on pharmacy that I chaired, the irony is that the polyclinic model now being proposed has in fact existed for years in one branch of associated health care at least: veterinary care. In that field, large, one-stop, city centre clinics, comprising both generalists and specialists, and with impressive on-site diagnostic and treatment facilities, have been in place for years and have worked very well. It is a pity that the owners of the animals that are benefiting from that kind of one-stop, integrated care are still waiting for something similar to materialise in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08061794000059">Other health care systems around the world have, of course, been using the polyclinic model for years. The polyclinic proposal is far from being the untried, untested, experimental model of care that many in the media have claimed. As the NHS Confederation has stated:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08061794000060">The case in favour of polyclinics is, in fact, unarguable. They provide an unrivalled opportunity to create larger groupings of primary care professionals, and to create a critical mass that will allow an enhanced range of services to be provided. They exploit economies of scale to provide greatly extended diagnostic support with rapid access and turnaround, and a range of other services that are difficult to offer in smaller practices. They reduce the need for patients to travel to hospital by relocating high volume work that does not require hospital infrastructure. They will integrate services to break down the traditional barrier between primary and secondary care and provide opportunities for specialists to work alongside their colleagues in primary care. They will also create space for other services, including community health services and other related health, social care, leisure, housing and benefits services that patients, professionals and the community will value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08061794000061">There is, of course, a range of issues around how, where and why polyclinics are to be implemented, but none of the concerns that have been expressed is insuperable. The idea that they will inevitably undermine the direct relationship between a GP and their patient, for instance, is wide of the mark. The Berlin polyclinic, Polikum, uses a web-based scheduling system to ensure that patients who want to see their own primary care doctor can do so. They may only be able to see their GP during certain periods of the week, but that is no different from how the current system works. As now, patients have to weigh up whether a familiar face is more important to them than speed of access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08061794000062">Nor is it necessarily true that patients will have to travel further to see a GP. The hub and spoke model suggested in the Healthcare for London plans offers the potential to preserve local access while at the same time providing a community health care hub that offers a broad range of diagnostic and treatment services. In Liverpool, for example, the local PCT has set up a network of neighbourhood health centres and NHS treatment centres. Under that system, no patient is more than 15 minutes&#146; walking time from GP services while there has been a corresponding shift of services out of hospitals and into the community closer to where people live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08061794000063">I suggest that the real issue is not whether the principle behind the polyclinics is the right one&#151;I do not know of any serious commentator who fundamentally disagrees with them&#151;but relates to their implementation, about which legitimate fears have been expressed. For example, the risk is that they could end up duplicating existing services provided in the community, and therefore waste money by creating overcapacity. If, however, their implementation is properly planned and managed and due regard is paid to current services, there is good evidence to suggest that they will help us make more efficient use of existing resources. Well-organised and integrated systems improve cost-effectiveness, reduce follow-up appointments and duplicated tests and improve the quality of care. The Kaiser Permanente model in the US shows us how this can be done, and provided that the polyclinic service contract is properly set and   <br>

monitored, there is no reason to think that the advent of new providers will impact negatively on the quality of care offered to patients. After all, GPs are, and have always been, independent, for-profit contractors operating within the NHS. Those are the rules GPs elected to play by when the NHS was set up. With proper debate and consultation and due care taken in the commissioning process, there is every reason to think that polyclinics can lead to substantial benefits in terms of the quality of care offered to patients.</p>

If extra hours and extra capacity are needed, some of the existing health centres around the country&#151;this is certainly the case in my area&#151;are closed from 6.30 pm and throughout every weekend, so spare capacity exists that could be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80617-0010.htm_para34"><a name="08061794000076">In Worcestershire, the GP-led health centre is likely to be in Worcester, the largest town. If only the money for such services were given to the PCTs without strings attached, it might be feasible in Worcestershire to put in place three of these health centres&#151;one in each major town. That would spread the benefit of 8 am to 8 pm opening and the benefit of such centres being open for the entire weekend across the county, but, as it stands, only those who are near enough in the city of Worcester will benefit. Such an arrangement would almost certainly do away with the need for new premises, because that existing spare capacity could be used. That would lessen the worry about continuity of care, and about the lack of local knowledge and of previous knowledge about patients, and it could even mean a rotation between different practices within a given area. Such an arrangement would be ideal. I am asking the Government to get away from insisting that these must be new services, because they could be additional services in areas where there is the capacity to provide it.</p>

 One of the most disappointing things about this debate and the motion is that they are focused entirely on the providers and not on where they should be focused&#151;on the patients. That says an awful lot about the stance of the Conservative party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08061794000083">The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) said that nobody had spoken in favour of polyclinics, although my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) just did so. One of the reasons why that has been the case is that nobody has a health centre in their constituency. Interestingly, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) was calling for pilot schemes. I can tell him that we have quite a number of pilot schemes. In fact, he referred to some of them, in the sense that 12 areas have health centres, and Wigan is one of them. Indeed, Wigan was one of the first boroughs to have a local improvement finance trust&#151;LIFT&#151;centre. Parts of the borough have some of the worst health statistics in the north-west and, thus, in the whole country. It is also one of the most under-doctored areas in the country.</p>

Member for North Norfolk, has made a number of comments about health centres. I do not recognise those comments in respect of how we run the health centres and our LIFT programme in Wigan. For instance, it mentioned poor management, but each of our six health centres has a manager in charge to ensure that the organisation within, and between, the services provided is properly carried out. The King&#146;s Fund also mentioned a lack of innovation, but Wigan has a new and important innovation&#151;our &#147;Find and Treat&#148; approach, whereby local GPs, through the health centres, go into the community seeking people who are particularly vulnerable to strokes and cardiac problems and try to bring them into the health centres for treatment. Rather than waiting for people to come once they have had their stroke or heart attack, when it is often too late, GPs are going out to ensure that we can treat them before that happens.</p>

 Most of the speeches that I have heard today did not attack polyclinics per se and did not say that they cannot contribute to local health needs. The main issue taken up by those opposing the Government plan is that polyclinics are to be imposed from the centre on every area, even when there would be better ways of spending the money. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) talked very well about how the money could be used creatively, using existing assets to deliver much more benefit for patients.</p>

services and better outcomes for the patients. Our health centres in Wigan are doing that. They have the strong support of my three colleagues who also represent the borough&#151;my right hon. Friends the Members for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) and for Leigh (Andy Burnham), and my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley). They all support the health clinics and the extension of the health clinic principle throughout the borough. Our six centres are all large, modern, adaptable buildings. The primary care trust arranges the sub-leases and each local health centre provides a massive range of services. Fundamental to that is a GP practice&#151;or in several cases, a number of GP practices, all of which are local and none of which is provided by Virgin or any of the other organisations that have been mentioned. They are all local GPs who have voluntarily gone into those health centres to ensure that they can provide a better service from a better facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08061794000087">Most of the centres also have a pharmacy, and the centres provide an enormous range of services. We are talking about child care, audiology, district nurses, community mental health, out-of-hours nurses, family planning advice, diabetic retinopathy&#151;I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford knows what that means&#151;integrated therapy for children with special needs, minor surgery units, podiatry, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, and older people&#146;s services. That list goes on and on, and many of those services are provided in most of the clinics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08061794000088">I want to give a couple of examples of what is done in one or two of the health centres, particularly the Platt Bridge health centre, which is in the Makerfield constituency. It covers a former mining community with immense health and social problems, and severe deprivation&#151;it is in the 3 per cent. most deprived super output areas in the country. The health centre is marked out not because of the services it provides, although those are excellent&#151;they include a hydrotherapy service&#151;but because of the way in which my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield managed to get the primary care trust and the local authority to work together so that this is not just a health centre. It is in a huge complex that includes a school, library and community centre, all of which work together to provide a major centre for that deprived community, which has been given a belief in itself and confidence in its future. That would not have been provided unless the LIFT programme had provided the PCT with the catalyst for that centre.</p>

It has a 19-bed physiotherapy unit, but what sets Boston House apart from all the others&#151;and is especially important for the people of Wigan&#151;is the fact that it has an 18-bed renal dialysis unit. People from Wigan who needed dialysis used to have to travel to Salford or Bolton, which took a full day. That was disruptive and in some cases distressing for the patients and their families. Now, they can have dialysis in Wigan, and that is much less disruptive. I have talked to the patients involved and I know that it has massively improved their quality of life.</p>

 One of the problems with this debate is that so many people say that it might not be the answer in their area, but not one of the hon. Members who has said that has had experience of it working in their constituencies. If hon.

Instead of going along with the BMA&#146;s claims, hon. Members should come and see the reality on the ground. Then they might change their minds. The first three health centres in Wigan were not built in my constituency, and I knocked on the door of my PCT to ask when it would get one. Now it has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08061794000093">We have two other health centres in Wigan. The Sherwood Drive health centre has GPs and provides minor surgery services, a pharmacy and, after a recent extension, a dental practice. The Beech Hill health centre, which is my local one, is a GP centre with a pharmacy attached, and it provides numerous other services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08061794000094">Boston House health centre was provided by the LIFT programme, the Sherwood Drive health centre was provided by a private sector company, which has since sold it to the PCT, and the Beech Hill health centre was one of the very earliest health centres, built in the 1960s, and the GP practice has now moved into a modern centre. So there are many ways to provide those services. It is not a question of one size fits all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08061794000095">We will not rest on what we have done, excellent though that is. We welcome the extra funding for the health centres and we hope to have more such centres in the future. For example, one will complement the walk-in centre in Leigh, a second will be based in Ashton and a third in the Whelley/Scholes area in my constituency. The PCT has plans for three further primary care centres, plus one GP-led health centre in Wigan town centre, which will provide the services that the Secretary of State described earlier. In addition, it will provide services for homeless people, which are important.</p>

 Because we have been so under-doctored, and GPs surgeries have been poor in the past, people have used accident and emergency at the hospital instead. Wigan A and E is a major trauma centre&#151;it is next-door to the motorway&#151;and has a high-dependency unit and an intensive care unit. Using doctors trained to provide those services for what is, in essence, primary care had a deleterious effect. The health centres, with their longer opening hours and wider range of services, have a beneficial effect. We need more such health centres, because we want to shift the NHS from being an organisation that treats ill health to one that intervenes to prevent people from getting ill.</p>

 I wished to speak only because I have been genuinely shocked by aspects of the campaign that has been waged on this issue. Perhaps I am too easily shocked, but there has been a dishonesty in some of the campaigning that has caused much anxiety and even illness in some people. I had an elderly lady phone my office this week, and she said that when she had gone to her GP surgery she had been told that it would close. I checked with the PCT which told me that the surgery had plans to expand. It may seem clever to campaign in that way, but for people who claim to be concerned with the health of others, it is having a serious and damaging effect.</p>

That was because the GPs, represented by the BMA, would not have them. It has taken us a long time to realise that having a network of well equipped and professional health centres will have an immeasurably beneficial effect on the health of the population.</p>

It was essential that that situation be transformed, and I can report that in many respects it has been. Because of investment, we now have a raft of state-of-the-art health centres across the district. Nobody would now claim that such developments are not beneficial to the health of the population. The idea that anybody could have resisted the development of health centres sounds so ludicrous now, and it will seem ludicrous in the future that anybody could resist the development of the next stage in health care, which is what we are talking about now.</p>

We need only think of the arguments that we have had just to get a modest increment in evening or Saturday morning provision, which was standard when I was growing up&#151;it was quite normal to have evening surgeries or Saturday morning surgeries.

All we had, when children were inconvenient enough to get ill out of doctors&#146; surgery times, was the prospect of a visit from an out-of-hours person who knew nothing about us and had no diagnostic back-up of any kind, or of taking the children down the local accident and emergency, which was probably inappropriate. The idea of having an intermediate centre for such situations, just so that tests could be done and people could be checked over, seems a genuine extension of patient choice.</p>

 Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright), I think that the BMA&#146;s &#147;Save our Surgeries&#148; campaign has been disingenuous. It has created unnecessary fear and worry that GP surgeries around the country are about to close. That is simply not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08061794000114">I want to talk briefly about the example from north Lincolnshire. My right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) intervened earlier on this point. Parts of Scunthorpe are very deprived, and they also have few GPs, so there is a plan for a GP-led health centre in Scunthorpe. Doctors have been saying that because of that plan other GP surgeries are under threat, particularly in the rural parts of north Lincolnshire. North Lincolnshire MPs went to the primary care trusts to ask what that was all about, and they guaranteed that the money for the centre was additional and that there was no threat to any other GP practice in north Lincolnshire. In fact, they wanted to invest more money in those other practices. People will still have access to their GP, and it is wrong to tell those people that their GP surgeries are about to close.</p>

 If the hon. Lady has been following the debate, she will have heard that patients can register with the new centres. If they move their registration from their former rural practice to the new centre, the rural practice will lose that patient and the income and could therefore become non-viable. It is not true to say that this is pure additionality, and the hon. Lady should perhaps have picked up on that by now.</p>

 I think that I regret allowing the hon. Gentleman to intervene. He has been talking about people&#146;s GPs, the services that they provide and how much people appreciate those services&#151;but people will stay with their GP if that GP provides a service that they want. If they want something else, they can transfer, as they can now. They can transfer from one GP practice to another if they want additional services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80617-0011.htm_para26"><a name="08061794000117">Earlier this year, I went out and consulted my constituents at random about what they wanted to see in primary care, what they wanted from their GP and what type of opening hours they wanted. I wanted to ask 150 people, but through a quirk I ended up with 151. When I asked whether they wanted GPs to open at more convenient times to meet their needs and their lifestyles, only one person opposed that, while 150 wanted access to GP services for more hours. As for evening appointments, 150 people wanted them and one person did not. There was not such strong support for weekend appointments, which were wanted by only 144 out of the 151.</p>

One reason that struck me came from working women with young families. Although there is meant to be more equality in society, when it came to taking the kids to the doctor it  <br>

was still the woman who had to do it. Generally speaking, she would have to take time off work, and the kids might also have to miss school. That was one reason why those women wanted early morning appointments or appointments later in the evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08061794000119">In the Cleethorpes constituency, there are still a number of single-handed GP practices. That was another factor in people wanting more access. For example, if women had an older male GP, they felt uneasy about seeing him about issues to do with sexual health and said that they would prefer a larger health centre so that they could have that choice and have access to the type of clinic that they would not necessarily get in a single or double-handed GP practice. Plenty of people are perfectly happy with that set-up, and no one is suggesting that it will change. However, in my area patients have demonstrated a desire for more than just those single-handed GP practices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08061794000120">There are now health and medical centres in Cleethorpes and Immingham, just as there are in the area represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner). The people who can access those health clinics really appreciate being able to use their services. Immingham is quite isolated from other urban areas in the constituency. The town&#146;s GPs came together and relocated to one building. Some people in the area had a bit of a pop, saying, &#147;Oh my God, we&#146;ve got fewer GP surgeries now.&#148; Technically that was true, but only because the GPs had all moved out of dilapidated premises and into a brand-new purpose-built primary care centre, where people can use a variety of services. My hon. Friend gave a list of the services, so I will not go through the complete list again. People can have their blood tests and X-rays done there, which means that they do not have to travel to the hospital in Grimsby, which is not easy to do from Immingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08061794000121">The British Medical Association was therefore wrong to say that such health centres will always mean that people will have to travel further. That is rubbish; my constituents do not have to travel, because services are being provided on their doorstep. Recently, another GP-led health centre&#151;the Beacon medical centre&#151;opened in Cleethorpes constituency, and the people being treated there think that the wide range of services is excellent.</p>

We are no longer in the days of Dr. Finlay and his sidekick, moody grumpy Dr. Cameron &#151;perhaps it is the name that makes the Conservatives so keen on their old-fashioned ideas. Those days are long gone. People&#146;s lifestyles are pressured. They have many demands on their time, and we have to make sure that primary care evolves and adjusts to meet their needs. If we do that, the NHS will be around for another 60 years after celebrating its 60th year next month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08061794000124">The debate was opened by the shadow Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), who gave a timely and devastating critique, mentioning the potential serious problem and the detrimental impact on patient care. He was right to highlight the problems of potential closures, the potential increase in travel distances, and the danger to the fundamental GP-patient relationship. In direct contradiction of what the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) said, he mentioned the dynamic, strong feelings that patients and GPs have on the issue. He also highlighted the funding uncertainties: where will the money to support the policy come from? Even more importantly, he mentioned the fundamental lack of evidence to support the Government&#146;s policy, in relation to quality, access and service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08061794000125">We then heard the Secretary of State&#146;s response. He is usually highly polished and has a Teflon quality to him, but today he was clearly slightly over-excited, rattled and very confused. I suspect that he does not really want to have to defend the policy, because he knows that it does not make sense, particularly in the context of localised decision making&#151;an idea that the Government trumpet&#151;and clearly he was not enjoying himself. He tried to make a difference in definition between polyclinics and GP health centres, but it was clear from other contributions that they are the same. He quoted a London MORI poll in an attempt to support his policy, but the only recent poll that matters in London is the mayoral election, which was clearly won by Boris Johnson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08061794000126">The Secretary of State took an extraordinary, uncharacteristic and slightly sarcastic sideswipe at the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), who made an extremely thoughtful and balanced contribution. Like us and, I suspect, the Liberal Democrats, she is trying to argue for more devolved decision making on how the money is spent. The Secretary of State&#146;s response to her contribution was extraordinary. Tellingly, he confirmed that primary care trusts would not be allowed to convert and expand existing practices, even if that was in patients&#146; interests; there had to be a new polyclinic or GP-led health centre in every primary care trust, and even more in London. He made a bizarre attack on Conservative party policy, which is to try to find ways of improving primary care in socio-economically deprived areas, so that we can reduce health inequalities and improve things for those who do not have sufficient access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08061794000127">A significant contribution was made by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), who rightly confirmed the necessity of local decision making. He made a critical point about the importance of continuity of care, and about the danger that GPs&#146; understanding of individual patients&#146; medical histories could be eroded by the policy direction being taken. We next heard from the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) who, let us not forget, is an ex-Secretary of State for Health. The current Secretary of State&#146;s view is that there is uniformity of opinion in London that polyclinics are a good idea, but that view was clearly shot to pieces by the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. The right hon. Gentleman was right to highlight the fact that the drivers of the polyclinics policy are Ministers in the Department of Health. The  <br>

He was right to challenge the idea that the proposals would be the best use of resources in his constituency. In a lucid, considered contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) highlighted concerns in her constituency. At the time of his speech, the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) was the only Member to have supported the Government line. He is clearly very knowledgeable about the health service as a result of his professional qualification and his career, so it is sad that he always rises to defend Government policy, irrespective of what it is. He does not, perhaps, use his expertise and knowledge to make constructive suggestions for the Government. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) made a telling contribution, as always. He made one particularly good point: the policy should not be about buildings, but about patient services and pathways. That is one of the fundamental errors in the direction of Government policy.</p>

We are not its representatives; we are here to fight for patients and the improvement of patient services. We are not against polyclinics or GP-led health centres per se. In fact, when they are supported by patients, GPs and the local community, we will be supportive and will facilitate them and enable them to be introduced. However, the decision should be taken locally, and should be based on clinical evidence, and evidence on health inequalities and prevention measures. There should also be a comprehensive understanding of the impact on existing provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08061794000130">The House needs to understand that we are not talking about a minor tweak to primary care. The establishment of polyclinics and GP-led health centres will be the largest change to primary care since the establishment of the NHS. In many places, including the Secretary of State&#146;s constituency, it has been said that the change would act as a catalyst for the reconfiguration of local GP services. It should be for local primary care trusts and patients, not Ministers in the Department of Health, to make the decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08061794000131">Of course the Secretary of State is right that there are circumstances in which health centres of polyclinics would have a beneficial impact. He rightly gave the example of preventing multiple appointments and additional travel, particularly for the elderly and the vulnerable. We also recognise that there should be greater access to diagnostics and follow-up appointments, and it may be that such centres are the appropriate place to provide those services, but not everywhere, not uniformly, and particularly not in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08061794000133">The Secretary of State confirmed for the first time that, on average, there will be five GPs per centre outside London. That amounts to an additional 605 GPs. Where will those additional GPs come from, in the context that there were only six more last year, if they do not come from surgeries that are already in place? Why will Ministers not allow PCTs to invest instead, where appropriate, in community hospitals or other GP-led health centres&#151;a point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) and for Scarborough and Whitby? Why will Ministers not allow additional facilities to operate in non-spearhead PCTs&#151;for example, outreach services?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08061794000134">The policy is confusing. Lord Darzi said in his framework document that PCTs would not be allowed to reconfigure services until a PCT clinic review has taken place, giving evidence of the benefits. Where is the evidence&#151;I hope that the Minister will explain this&#151;to support the supposed benefits of a centrally prescriptive solution that is odds with locally determined reconfiguration? I suspect that the answer to those questions is that a one-size-fits-all proposal is not really about patient outcomes, but about political outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08061794000135">There is an inherent contradiction between devolving commissioning responsibilities to a PCT through practice-based commissioning, and proposing a centralised approach to service design, with plans for polyclinics or GP-led health centres in every PCT. The Opposition will not coerce doctors into polyclinics against their will. GP-led health centres should be able to offer additional services, such as physiotherapy and phlebotomy, but they can be provided in other facilities as well in the existing system. This is not just about new buildings. Under the next Conservative Government, primary care will be patient-centric, responsive to local communities and free to innovate, ultimately to drive better patient outcomes.</p>

 Our primary care system of family doctors has served this country very well and is the envy of the world, and the Government are investing record sums in it. Funding for GP services has increased from &#163;3 billion in 1997-98 to &#163;7.86 billion in 2006-07. There are 19 per cent. more GPs today than in 1997. Incidentally, there were 273 more, rather than the six more mentioned by the Conservative party, in 2006-07 alone. They are better rewarded than ever before. More doctors are in training to become GPs, and vacancy levels for jobs are the lowest for many years.</p>

But in every recent survey of what the public would like improved in the health service, being able to see a GP at times that are more convenient for them comes top. That is part of the reason why in March we agreed with the BMA that surgeries offering opening in the evenings and weekends will be rewarded.

That is why we announced last autumn an extra &#163;250 million to enable the local NHS to establish a new GP-led health centre in every PCT in England and extra GP surgeries in the least well-served areas. That is additional money on top of, not instead of, the record sums already going into existing GP surgeries. No one will lose their current family doctor as a result.</p>

The centres will be particularly welcome for people who work full time or commute, who currently find it hard to visit a GP, and they will also take pressure off accident and emergency departments, which deal with a lot of people who should see a GP. The only requirement we are placing on the centres is that they should be open seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and offer appointments and walk-in services.</p>

He quoted the King&#146;s Fund report, which was much more balanced than the impression he gave&#151;but of course, it was an analysis of a policy that is not being proposed.</p>

He also said he was concerned about the provision of dental services. He might like to suggest that the PCT considers including extra dental services in the new centre. That is exactly what many PCTs up and down the country are doing. He asked whether the services need to be provided under one roof. No, they need not.</p>

It need not be a new building; it can be an expanded existing building, and we have repeatedly made that clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para24"><a name="080617101000010">I make the same assurance to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor). The new services can be part of an existing system, and there is nothing to stop Worcestershire adopting the kind of model that he favours. If he wants to make that case to Worcestershire PCT, he is very welcome to do so. The current proposal is for Worcester, but if he wants to persuade the PCT that his model is better, I wish him good luck. Of course, I would be very happy to meet him, as I always am.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para25"><a name="080617101000011">My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) made a very strong case in support of the improvements that we are making to primary care, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner). He well knows that he will get not only a new health centre but three new GP practices in one of the most under-doctored areas of the country. He also made an important point about the huge public health benefit of investment in primary care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para26"><a name="080617101000012">My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) gave an example of some of the disgraceful and irresponsible scaremongering by the BMA and the Conservatives that has caused unnecessary anxiety to patients, including his constituents. My hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) also welcomed the new investment and improvement in services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para27"><a name="080617101000013">My right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) referred to a procurement that has nothing to do with the extra investment that we are announcing but is an ongoing process of PCTs procuring new GP services. His local PCT says that it is perfectly happy to defend the way the procurement was carried out. If it is not happy with the provider&#146;s performance, it can terminate or not renew the contract. I understand that the proposal for a new health centre in his area involves housing it in a local hospital because that is an accessible point locally, unlike in some other parts of the country where hospitals are not necessarily as accessible as other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para28"><a name="080617101000014">It is not only patients who welcome the new services. Anna Waite, a Conservative councillor in Southend, told her local paper two weeks ago that</p>
<a name="80617-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="080617101000571"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;this is a big step forward. A large surgery with easy access and in the right location will be ideal. To be open seven days is fantastic.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80617-0012.htm_para29"><a name="080617101000015">Labour Members are delighted to have been given another opportunity to defend the Government&#146;s record on the NHS and highlight the further improvements under way in primary care. We do not think it unreasonable, given the record sums going to GP practices, that people should be able to see a GP in the evening and at weekends. We will not reverse those improvements or give a veto over health policy to the doctors&#146; trade union, the BMA. I recall a similar campaign by the Conservatives this time last year against what they claimed was a programme of hospital closures. That campaign was humiliatingly abandoned when they were forced to admit that they had got their facts wrong. I predict a similarly bruising fall from this bandwagon.</p>

Since we debated the matter in July 2007, the situation has deteriorated. Last July, the prison population was more than 80,000; now, it is more than 83,000&#151;an increase of almost 3,000, even after factoring in the early release scheme that started in June 2007. Last July, the Government had released 3,800 prisoners early; now, they have released 26,300 prisoners early. The prison estate is running at 99.8 per cent. of total capacity. In July, 86 prisons were overcrowded; now, 89 are. In July, 60,337 prisoners were in overcrowded jails; at the end of May this year, there were 63,176&#151;another increase of 3,000.

That is why the debate has had to be called. We have repeatedly asked Ministers to explain how they are going to provide the necessary prison capacity to hold all those sentenced by the courts, but instead of action we have been presented with a litany of poor excuses. Ministers say that they have provided 20,000 new prison places, and I am sure that we will hear it said again this evening. They do not say that almost 17,000 prisoners are now doubling up in cells&#151;twice as many as when Labour came to power; that those extra places have been provided by doing such doubling up; and that almost one quarter of the entire prison population are housed in cells that are designed for one fewer person.</p>

Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, they started the programme too late and it is already falling behind. Ministers say that they are tackling reoffending, but reconviction rates have increased. Even after the counting change, which Ministers are now so quick to fall back on, reoffending rates by ex-prisoners have risen since the Government came to power.</p>

 The Secretary of State shakes his head, but in a letter on 27 November 2007, he confirmed to me that there was an increase in actual reoffending by ex-prisoners between 1997 and 2004.

It has managed to release a record number of prisoners early on to our streets. We have now had 10 months to evaluate the end of custody licence scheme: a policy that has greatly damaged public confidence in the criminal justice system, that was described by the previous Lord Chancellor as &#147;simply wrong&#148;&#151;a month before he introduced the scheme&#151;and that was dubbed a &#147;very temporary measure&#148; by the former Prime Minister.</p>

The rate of release is running well ahead of initial projections. When the latest figures were published, I wrote to the Secretary of State to ask for an explanation. He replied by saying that the original estimate was quickly updated after the scheme started&#151;in other words, the Government got it wrong in the beginning. He now admits that revised projections after the first week of the scheme led to a projected one-year total of 28,600 prisoners to be released early. But that revised&#151;and, I assume, current&#151;projection is still a gross underestimate. We have looked at the rate of releases, and we expect the total to be more like 31,000 in a year&#151;5,000 more than Ministers cited when the scheme was launched.</p>

expect at least another 15 months of this policy, and along with it another 35,000 prisoners being let out early on to our streets. Will the Secretary of State confirm today that what the Prime Minister said was right, and that no decision will be taken on ending this disgraceful scheme until September next year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80617-0013.htm_para11"><a name="080617101000541">We should reflect on the price of this policy, which is much more than mere numbers. More than 500 violent offenders were released early in March, taking the total number of violent prisoners released to almost 5,000. A total of 820 offenders have been recalled to prison while on end of custody licence, 144 of whom remain unlawfully at large. At least 451 crimes have been committed by prisoners who should have been behind bars. Almost every day, the media report another victim of a criminal who has, in one way or another, been released from prison early. The Secretary of State plays down the importance of this. He recently said:</p>
<a name="80617-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="080617101000576"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I understand public concern about it but it is only two and half weeks off a sentence.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80617-0013.htm_para12"><a name="080617101000542">Only two and a half weeks? Frankly, I find that response complacent. It is no consolation to the hundreds of unnecessary victims of crime. Two and half weeks was time enough in the case of Amanda Murphy, a teacher who was beaten to death by her violent partner just days after he was released early from prison. Only last week, we learned of the case of Derek Burns, a violent offender with a string of previous convictions, who stabbed his partner in the back with a 10-in meat cleaver when he should have been in prison. He told the paramedics:</p>
<a name="80617-0013.htm_brev5"><a name="080617101000577"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I cannot believe they let me out. I told them I would do it.&#148;</p>

 There is obviously a problem with prison overcrowding. Does the hon.

Will his party commit to expanding that service so that it could take them instead of their being put in prison?</p>

 I agree about the problem of prisoners with serious mental illness, but there are two points to make. First, if, instead, they are put into places where they are treated, those are likely merely to be secure places of a different kind. Many of us&#151;including, I suspect, the Secretary of State&#151;would agree that that is a desirable thing to do. Secondly, the Bradley review is investigating how such people could be diverted to places where they can be treated properly. Although the hon. Gentleman might be able to say that that reduces the prison population, and it may be highly desirable that those offenders are not treated in prisons where it is not appropriate for them to be detained, it will not necessarily reduce the overall numbers of people in some form of custody.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the recidivism rate for those who are treated in mental health institutions is only 10 per cent., compared with the figure for those who have been in prison? In time, therefore, the prison population would be reduced because recidivism would be reduced.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Indeed, a reduction in reoffending is an important way of reducing pressure on prison population growth in the long term, and the point that he makes may represent one means of achieving that. I doubt that there will be disagreement between hon. Members of any party about the desirability of removing offenders with serious mental illness from our prisons. The issue is one of resources and potential expense. It is true that there has been a big displacement of prisoners from former mental health institutions into the criminal justice system; it is not just the prison system that has picked up on that, but the police. We all recognise that problem.</p>

 I will come on to explain to the hon. Gentleman, if he has not read our policy document, that we propose an increase in capacity above what the Government propose to deal with overcrowding. On the question of how to deal with mentally ill prisoners, we shall await the outcome of the Bradley review, and if the hon. Gentleman is sensible, he will do the same. I must make progress, but I hope that I have answered the many questions put to me by the Liberal Democrats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80617-0013.htm_para17"><a name="080617101000557">I have a second question for the Justice Secretary. The Government told us that 2,500 new prison places would be delivered last year, but they comprehensively missed that prison-building target. They managed to increase capacity by just 1,367 places&#151;just over half their target&#151;and there is no sign that things will be better this year. Since January, there are nearly 3,500 more prisoners in our jails, but far less than half that number of new places. Let us remember that most of those new places are just last year&#146;s new places delivered late. Strip those out, and prison capacity this year has increased by fewer than 300 places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80617-0013.htm_para18"><a name="080617101000558">With prison capacity and early release, the familiar pattern of this Government&#146;s policy continues: release criminals more quickly and build prison places more slowly. The Government will not admit that even if they deliver the promised extra places by 2014, total prison capacity will still be many thousands of places short of their own median projection for the prison population by that time. They published a consultation paper on titan prisons, and they say that they intend to press ahead with plans to build three massive prisons&#151;in the north-west, London and the south-east. Those prisons will take up 50 acres, which is a footprint larger than two Wembley stadiums. They will be the biggest prisons in Europe, in the face of all of the evidence that smaller prisons are more secure and superior for the purposes of rehabilitation. After all the urging by prison reform experts about the importance of local family links to the reduction of reoffending, why are the Government pursuing the policy of titan jails?</p>

 Given the Government&#146;s record of not consulting local communities, even over bail hostels, does my hon. Friend expect them to consult local communities on titan prisons?

 I agree with my hon. Friend. I believe that the Government have pursued the policy of titan prisons&#151;a name that they chose&#151;because they wish to subvert local planning procedures and thereby increase capacity without having to obtain the consent of local people.

 The plans that we have set out effectively propose diverting resources spent on reconvicting prisoners in order to try to prevent them from reoffending, which would be the transfer of resources that the right hon. Gentleman seeks. All of us want to see a reduction in the long-term growth of the prison population, but the question is how that is to be achieved. The Government&#146;s approach is wrong, as I am about to set out, and those who believe that there is an easy way of preventing the sentencing of prisoners in the first place by diverting prisoners into community sentences in which the public have no confidence are misguided.</p>

They pretend, in the words of the amendment, that it is about delivering &#147;greater consistency in sentencing&#148;, but there is already a statutory duty on the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the Sentencing Advisory Panel to promote consistency in sentencing. It is by no means clear whether the Government have any idea of how compliant judges are with the guidance of the Sentencing Guidelines Council at the moment.</p>

The Government&#146;s proposals are nothing other than a back-door attempt to manage down the prison population by fettering judicial discretion. As we have said before, linking sentencing to resources in that way is wrong in principle because it would provide a formal mechanism for the Executive to exert control over sentencing and the judiciary.</p>

In the light of that, any artificial method of linking sentences to resources would be dangerous and wrong. Violent crime has doubled under Labour. If that trend were to continue under a system that links resources to sentencing, we may find sentences for violent offenders would be shortened because of a lack of capacity.</p>

 No, and I shall deal with that point later. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s claim that violent crime has doubled is untrue. He must know that two separate changes occurred in recording crime&#151;one in 1998 and the other in 2001. Both increased the recording of all crimes. In 1998, the change increased the recording of violent crimes by 80 per cent. overnight. The problem that we faced, to which we have now adjusted, was that, under the system that the Conservative Administration used, an awful lot of crime was not properly recorded.</p>

 The Government always fall back on the defence of counting changes. As the Secretary of State knows, even with those changes, violent crime has increased under the Government. Does he at least concede that? A huge amount of crime continues to go unreported.

 I am in no sense in denial about the matter. When increases in crime occur, I am ready to admit to them. It is important in such a debate to deal with reliable statistics.

 I certainly do not concede that. The Government have progressively ensured that the Office for National Statistics is entirely independent&#151;I personally supervised that policy over 11 years.

 I doubt whether the Leader of the Opposition said that. Of course, some crimes&#151;for example, acquisitive crimes&#151;have decreased, but the right hon. Gentleman should know about public concern, especially about violent crime. The publication of crime figures is not properly independent of Government. It is our policy that they should be independent so that they are not capable of manipulation and we have a proper index of the amount of crime in which the public and all hon. Members can trust. Unfortunately, the Government&#146;s consistent manipulation of crime figures means that that trust in the figures does not currently exist.</p>

I repeat the point that I made to the Secretary of State. If a sentencing commission is introduced, we may find ourselves in a position whereby sentences for violent offenders, irrespective of any decision by the House, could be shortened due to a lack of prison capacity. Indeed, I assume that that is the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s real objective. Ministers would avoid their responsibility to ensure public safety, and effectively outsource sentencing decisions to a quango. Linking sentences to resources will entail a massive reduction of judicial discretion.</p>

It said that recidivism rates for young criminals remain some of the highest in the developed world and that they &#147;have not significantly changed&#148; since 1997.

We have to create regimes where offenders work hard, learn skills and get support to break their drug addiction, so that they leave less likely to reoffend.

Ministers are constantly buffeted by events. We were the ones who led calls for stronger sanctions and robust enforcement for knife crime; then the Government followed us with calls for a presumption in favour of prosecution. We led calls to tighten the bail laws; and only now, four months on, do the Government bring forward their own narrow and rather unimpressive consultation document.</p>

If Ministers are simply to attack every positive proposal for change, if they are going to resist every new idea and if they are just going to maintain their tired refusal to act, the future really is bleak: prisons in a permanent state of overcrowding; ever more desperate emergency measures to bring the situation under control; turf wars between Government Departments and conflict with the judges whose independence is threatened; the biggest jails in Europe warehousing offenders; prisoners transported hundreds of miles around the country in a search for available places; drugs freely available in jails, which should be places of security; short-term prisoners being released with little or no support in the near certainty that they will reoffend. Politicians should not use the word &#147;crisis&#148; lightly, but the prison system is in a state of crisis. If Ministers do not think so, they do not deserve to be able to continue to run the system.</p>

 On reconviction rates, my mind goes back to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which introduced the much vaunted drug treatment and testing order&#151;a brilliant solution to our problems! Does the Secretary of State know that in fact there was a 90 per cent. breach of those and an 80 per cent. reoffending rate&#151;historically, terribly high&#151;which is why they were simply dropped?</p>

 The drug treatment and testing orders were reformed into a better and more effective system. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am making a serious point about community punishments to the hon.

Lord alone knows what he is going to be complaining about tonight when it is 83,000. By definition, community offenders are not locked up and it is more difficult to deal with them.

Member for Arundel and South Downs criticises our record on prisons. I am very happy to compare our record with the record of the previous Conservative Administration. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is no good his saying that he does not want to do that, because it was some time ago.

It was a rare month between 1982 and 1995 that police cells were not used, and in considerable numbers. On average in 1992, more than 1,000 prisoners were housed in police cells every night, and that was by no means a record.

 Of course I do. I think it was the answer to the hon.

As it happens, the record in that respect is very good as well. In 1996-97, there were 1,115 absconds. That was cut by more than 50 per cent. by 2007-8. The question for Conservative Members is this: are they saying that in the unlikely event of their gaining office they will close all open prisons, or are they saying that if they keep them open there will be no absconds?</p>

We have delivered more than 23,000 additional places since 1997, at twice the rate achieved by our predecessors, along with a commitment to increase the total to 96,000 net and 101,000 gross by 2014. There is some flexibility in the system.</p>

All the evidence that I have suggests that it is well on time and, in some cases, ahead of time. I am not sure where the hon. Gentleman&#146;s information originated. Over the past 12 months 2,422 places have been delivered, and we plan, and fully expect, 2,700 to be delivered in this calendar year. It is also a great credit to the Prison Service that not only is it delivering those places but&#151;here I touch wood&#151;in 11 years there have been no category A escapes.</p>

There are seven 12-year-olds in custody, not the hundreds implied by some lobby groups, and they are there because they committed very serious offences.

 On the prison building programme, does the Secretary of State accept that even if the so-called titan prisons are built on time, on the basis of the current figures he is planning that they should be more than 30 per cent. overcrowded?

 In prisons, there is always&#151;and there will always be under any Government, in my opinion&#151;a level of what is described as overcrowding, which is the amount above what is called normal capacity. I can conceive of no Government deciding to increase prison places by half the number of prisoners. Regardless of whether they are categorised as overcrowded, all but  a few current prisons are very different from those of  20 or 30 years ago.</p>

It is easy for the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman blithely to assert that instead of building one prison for 2,500 on a footprint of 50 acres or hectares, it would be easier to build five prisons of 500 places. Would that we could. What happens the moment that we try to build prisons, for example at Beam Reach in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), or in South Suffolk where there is also a suggestion that a prison should be built&#151;and in both places land is available? What happens is that we do not get co-operation from the local Conservative Members; instead we get opposition, with the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) saying they will not have any more prisons in that area. We face a problem, therefore. I understand why the public are always unhappy about a new prison being built&#151;although they are equally unhappy about a prison closing once it has been built. However, the truth is that this appears to be a cost-effective way of delivering this number of places on time.</p>

As he says that people are released without any check on their circumstances and where they are going to go, I should tell him that they are released 18 days early with all normal arrangements, including supervision, that would apply, depending on their sentence length, were they released 18 days later.</p>

Let us consider what happened in the past three weeks in relation to very short-term predictions. There was a sudden and quite unpredictable increase in the prison population of getting on for 350 last week. Very tiny changes in 300 to 400 courts across the country can lead to a big aggregate increase in the prison population. We are working extremely hard, with the fastest ever creation of prison places,  and the moment I judge that it is safe to do so, we will end ECL.</p>

Parliament does have a critical role to play in setting the framework for sentencing, and in deciding on the level of taxpayers&#146; money to be spent on prison places and probation services that arise from that framework. That is nothing to do with linking individual sentences to the availability of resources. We make different judgments from those in the United States, which typically spends four or five times as much on prison places and has four or five times as many. We spend more per head than other jurisdictions in Europe, apart from Portugal. There is an argument for spending some more, and we are doing that, but we do not want to see either the low level of sentencing that some European countries have or the very high level that some states in the US go in for.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) on one point&#151;there is a crisis in the prison system. It has a record population of 83,000 and there are predictions, as we have just heard from the Lord Chancellor, of further increases. Overcrowding is increasing again. There is a breakdown in the capacity of the system to deliver rehabilitation programmes, which is causing chaos, especially in the indeterminate sentences for public protection&#151;people cannot get out of prison until they complete their programmes, but there is no capacity to deliver those programmes. That leads to a situation that is unsatisfactory to the extent of being illegal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para5"><a name="080617116000149">Prisoners travel up and down the country, sometimes effectively and sometimes not. In fact, I recently visited Bedford prison, where I was told that the equivalent of the entire population of the prison turned over once every 50 days. In those circumstances, delivering rehabilitation is near to impossible. In addition to that, reoffending rates are high. It is that crisis that has led to the use of early release schemes and home detention curfews. I think that the hon. Gentleman is right that those programmes are being used without proper consultation because of the need for speed and the need to deal with the crisis. However, I part company from the hon. Gentleman on the reason given in the motion for the crisis. In effect, the Conservative motion says that the crisis has come about because the Government did not build enough prison places, and will continue because the Government will not deliver extra prison places in the future. That is not why the crisis is with us; it is with us because the wrong people are in prison.</p>

that would mean serious policy changes that would have to be implemented over an extended period. I will return to that subject later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para8"><a name="080617116000152">First, I want to talk about the extraordinary statement in the first line of the Government amendment, to which the Lord Chancellor alluded. It is the line in which we are invited to welcome</p>
<a name="80617-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="080617116000203"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Government&#146;s record in cutting crime by a third&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para9"><a name="080617116000153">as though the Government could claim credit for the reduction in crime. I agree with the Lord Chancellor that there has been a reduction in crime, especially according to the British crime survey figures, although there has been a slight increase in recorded crime, but that is mainly in line with recorded crime figures across Europe. As he said, there have been a number of accounting changes that could easily explain that increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para10"><a name="080617116000154">There has been a fall in crime, and there are three things to say about that. First, the reduction started in 1995, not 1997. Indeed, since 1995, crime has gone down by way over 40 per cent., and there were bigger falls per year in the final years of the Major Government than under the Labour Government. The second point is that there are no obvious differences between the trends in Britain and the trends in other western developed countries. In Canada, for example, crime is at its lowest for 25 years and has also fallen by a third since the mid-1990s. According to the international crime victim survey, in France, crime has almost halved since 1995. The survey also shows that in the three European countries that have kept comparable figures for the longest, namely Britain, Finland and the Netherlands, the pattern of crime over 30 years has been near identical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para11"><a name="080617116000155">It seems impossible to claim that the fall in crime is anything to do with this Government&#146;s policies. Indeed, it is quite difficult to claim that it has anything to do with any Government&#146;s policies. We are seeing the same pattern across the western world, which means that the fall must have more to do with social and economic conditions than with the details of Government policy in one country or another. Of course, this Government have form when it comes to claiming credit for global changes. They claimed the credit for improvements in the global economy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="080617116000156"><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew5"><a name="080617116000271"><b>Dan Norris (Wansdyke) (Lab):</b>
 Is that why Liberal Democrat policy is not to imprison drug offenders?</p>

 That is not our policy. Our policy is to imprison offenders. If offenders happen to be drug addicts, they should receive treatment in prison, if prison is the appropriate sentence for their crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para12"><a name="080617116000158">Let me return to the point about claiming credit. What will happen when those chickens come home to roost? Researchers have found an overall relationship between property crime and economic conditions. The Government have claimed the credit for reductions in property crime in times of economic prosperity, but will they bear the blame when those conditions change and crime rises? If they do, I will be surprised.   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para13"><a name="080617116000159">The third point to make about the claim of the fall in crime since 1997 is that, since crime seems to have fallen nearly everywhere else in almost exactly the same way&#151;except in Belgium, where something odd happened that no one can quite work out&#151;Britain remains near the top of the list for the rate of victimisation. Some 22 per cent. of people are the victims of crime in this country in an average year, as opposed to 15 per cent., which is normal for the developed world. So it is true that the situation here is better than it was, but it is not good, and it is still not good compared with other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para14"><a name="080617116000160">A more important question than whether there has been a general reduction in crime&#151;a reduction in crime has happened everywhere&#151;is whether we are doing as well as we could to prevent crime and to reduce reoffending, and it is not obvious to me that we are. Reoffending rates are extremely poor in Britain. The debate between the two Front Benchers was about whether the rates are worse or remain the same. The plain fact is that they are bad. About two thirds of offenders reoffend within two years. The reoffending figure is 73 per cent. for men between the ages of 18 and 20 who are given custodial sentences, and it is even higher for some sub-categories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para15"><a name="080617116000161">By contrast, in countries such as Denmark, which is very similar in many ways to ours and very similar even in having only a slightly lower crime rate than ours&#151;it is not in the category of countries, such as Portugal, that have very much lower crime rates&#151;reoffending rates are astonishingly lower. In 2003, the rate was 27 per cent.</p>

 Has the hon. Gentleman looked further into that research on reconviction rates and realised that the longer that people spend in prison, the less likely they are to reoffend and that the reoffending rate for people who spend four to 10 years in prison is about 33 per cent., which means that prison works?</p>

<p><a name="st_o336"><a name="080617116000163"><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew8"><a name="080617116000274"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 I have heard the hon. Gentleman make that point in the past, but that figure is produced by the fact the people in that category commit very different crimes from the people in the categories that are given shorter sentences. However, he is right in one respect: we should be looking at what works to reduce reoffending. That is the crucial question. If prison worked in the way that he thinks it does, I would be prepared to think about it as a way forward; but, unfortunately, in general, it does not. Short sentences especially do not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para16"><a name="080617116000164">We know about a number of different ways to sentence offenders that work better. The most obvious one is restorative justice, whereby the offender is confronted with the victim and with the harm that has been done to the victim. Reconviction rates in restorative justice have been consistently found in scientifically controlled experiments to be much lower than when offenders are given other sentences. The difference varies between 15 and 26 percentage points lower&#151;a vast improvement. It works even better for some more serious crimes than for less serious crimes. It also helps victims with the trauma and pain of being victims and helps them to overcome their experience. One of the big questions that those of us who have been victims of crime always ask is, &#147;Why me?&#148; Restorative justice helps to deal with that feeling.   <br>

 The evaluation was published on Monday. I am not trying to catch the hon.

 That is good news. I hope that the evaluation shows that restorative justice was successful in that experiment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para17"><a name="080617116000167">I do not want to go through all the other possibilities on sentencing, but I must mention some of them. There is good empirical evidence that shows that specialist courts, such as drug courts, work. Some interventions outside the criminal justice system work, too. For example, early intervention has been mentioned, and it will reduce crime in the longer term. Even simple things such as teaching basic social skills to children and teaching basic parenting skills to adults work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para18"><a name="080617116000168">Even after offending behaviour has been noticed, some evidence suggests that some forms of therapy work&#151;for example, cognitive behavioural therapy works&#151;but it is also true that other forms of therapy do not work. The important point is to act on what the evidence tells us. There are other ways in which we can act on evidence: hot-spot policing works; other forms of policing do not. There should always be room for new proposals, as long as they are independently evaluated and we work to the evidence rather than to the prejudices of the people who are advancing the ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para19"><a name="080617116000169">The right hon. Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) is no longer with us, but he mentioned Lord Ramsbotham&#146;s suggestion of young offender academies. That idea is worth trying, because it would build on what we know helps to reduce reoffending. We know that reoffending is higher where offenders have no job, where they are homeless, where they lack close relationships and where they are addicted to drugs and alcohol. Aspects of Lord Ramsbotham&#146;s proposal attempt to deal with each of those problems and with other problems that we know on the evidence are related to success.</p>

<p><a name="st_o339"><a name="080617116000170"><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew11"><a name="080617116000277"><b>Richard Younger-Ross:</b>
 Is my hon. Friend surprised that such proposals have been tried in the past? A particularly successful scheme, which taught young offenders crafts and furniture restoration, was tried in Wilton, but it was closed down under the Conservatives, who believed that short, sharp shock was a better policy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o340"><a name="080617116000171"><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew12"><a name="080617116000278"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 That is certainly the case, and I will move on to discuss what does not work. Other approaches may work, such as community justice panels, which have been tried in south Somerset&#151;there is some evidence that that approach is successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para20"><a name="080617116000172">We know that certain things will not work. Titan prisons have been mentioned, but the evidence suggests that they are unlikely to be successful. What do we know about unsuccessful interventions? Short, sharp shocks did not work; boot camps did not work; and there is increasing evidence that antisocial behaviour orders and tagging do not work. What do all those  <br>

things have in common? They are all tough-sounding, popular and populist, but, most importantly, they do not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para21"><a name="080617116000173">The same is true to a large extent, although not to a complete extent, of prison. Prison is by far the most popular sentence with the public, the media and the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), but it does not work, at least not in the way it is implemented in Britain. That takes us back to the question why our prisons are so ineffective compared with, for example, prisons in Denmark. The Government amendment boasts about the Government&#146;s prison-building programme, which is bizarre in a country where prison is so unsuccessful. That approach might make sense in another country where prison is more successful, but not here. So, the central point is that over the years, vast resources have been poured into policies that we all know do not work. It presumably happened because those policies, as my hon. Friend mentioned, are more popular than the policies that we know will work. So, what do we do? It is not enough to say that sentences must be tough if toughness means ineffectiveness. Effectiveness should be the touchstone of policy making, not toughness. But the issue is worse than that. If we put into ineffective policies public money that we could have put into policies that work and reduce crime, in effect we allow more crime than there would have been had we put the money into the right policies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o341"><a name="080617116000174"><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew13"><a name="080617116000279"><b>Sir Alan Beith:</b>
 I am reluctant to interrupt the careful flow of my hon. Friend&#146;s argument, but is not part of the problem the fact that some of the interventions that would work most effectively to prevent crime are completely outside the budgetary arrangement of the criminal justice system, residing in fields such as education, social services and the care system for children and young people? Effecting a transfer from the criminal justice system to those areas is something that our system seems congenitally incapable of doing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o342"><a name="080617116000175"><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew14"><a name="080617116000280"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 It does indeed seem to be incapable of doing so, and that is one consequence of our system&#146;s over-centralisation. Once one places all the power in central Government, one ends up with such silos. It might be easier to undertake such work if we were to localise the system to a greater extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80617-0017.htm_para22"><a name="080617116000176">The point that I was trying to make was that every pound that we spend on an ineffective programme as opposed to on an effective programme is a pound that effectively increases crime. That means that Governments in search of popularity have been responsible for there being more crime than there should have been. We need to think about the issue in a new way. Perhaps the way to put it is like this: those who fail to take effective action against crime and instead take ineffective action are objectively pro-crime; they allow extra crime to happen. That is precisely what we must stop. A consensus among politicians of all parties&#151;I do not exclude my own from this&#151;has brought us to this situation of crisis, record prison populations and unsatisfactory short-term expedients, such as early release schemes and the extension of home detention curfews. We must move away from that system of thought. We need a new consensus&#151;within the bounds of morality and common decency&#151;that is built around what works, because until we reach that new consensus, we will continue to suffer more crime than we need to.</p>

 I am sure that there is no great difference between us, but I should make two points. First, manifestly, in one sense, prison at all times does work. By definition, anybody who is incarcerated is not at large to commit further offences. That is self-evident. The second point, which may be nearer to that of the hon. Gentleman than I am comfortable with, is that some regimes work better with certain kinds of offender than others, and we need to have a better understanding of how that process works.</p>

I would plead with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs not to prejudge the report that the working group will produce. There has been a great deal of thought and work on the part of all its members as to how they should proceed.

Guidelines Council have, to some extent, an influence on judicial decision making. There is still a lot of scope for those who decide on sentences to be able to decide within the ranges that are produced what is an appropriate sentence in an individual case. They are not tied down by the guidelines, but the guidelines must have some influence on the decisions that are arrived at. There is already an element of that in the system, if not to the degree considered by Lord Carter.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman touches on an interesting area of conflict between the Executive and the judiciary. At the moment, the court of criminal appeal provides the sort of guidance that the Secretary of State and the right hon. Gentleman have been looking for. If the new body comes to fruition, it will be an executive body that provides yet another layer of &#147;guidance&#148; on sentences. Although there may be some variation in sentencing between magistrates court areas, does he not accept that the variations often reflect differences in local concerns? What may be an appropriate sentence for a crime in the Liverpool area, where a particular type of crime is prevalent, may not be necessary in another part&#151;</p>

 Order. May I remind the hon. and learned Gentleman that interventions are meant to be brief? There are still a number of Back Benchers wishing to make a contribution to this debate.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman is presumably aware that the Sentencing Guidelines Council already exists and is a long way along the road of publishing fairly comprehensive guidelines on a large variety of key offences. That process is already under way. The issue of inconsistency between one magistrates court area and another is complicated, and if I got heavily into that, my speech would take longer than it should. For certain offences, there has to be consistency. The hon. and learned Gentleman intervened; perhaps he would do me the courtesy of listening to the response. There are some types of offence&#151;not necessarily those that will be heard in magistrates courts&#151;for which it would be absurd if there were not consistency, particularly more serious offences, and I am sure that he would agree.</p>

When they depart from guidelines, we need to know how they have arrived at a decision&#151;whether it was by taking into account aggravating or mitigating factors. We do not have a great deal of data on that at the moment, and it is difficult to understand what is going on in such circumstances. The working group has conducted a survey of where there are such variations, and those interested in such matters may find its conclusions interesting. It is not complete yet, and the information has not been analysed, but I suspect that the information provided by that survey&#151;probably the first of its kind&#151;will be useful to all of us.</p>

visited Minnesota and North Carolina, which have sentencing commissions. Without revealing too much of the thinking, it is understood that those two types of system are not appropriate for our judicial process. I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to go much further, but difficulties lie in the differences between the sort of legal system that exists at state level in the United States and what we have in this country. The hon. Gentleman need not concern himself overly with the comparisons that may be made between the two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08061817000017">My final point concerns the relationship at the heart of the discussion between the totality of sentencing decisions and the correctional facilities available, and how we arrive at a balance between the two. I probably have more sympathy with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs than I ought to about this, but at the moment we deal with the matter through a form of early release system. That is not unique to this Government; every Government have had to do it from time to time. In my view, that is entirely unsatisfactory because it means that decisions are fairly arbitrarily taken away from the courts. If a court decides that somebody should be sentenced in a given range, and an early release system of some sort kicks in, the offender does not serve the sentence in that range. That is unsatisfactory, yet we currently do that. It is certainly not the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08061817000018">The second method of dealing with the problem is providing sufficient headroom in the correctional facilities that are available so that, whatever the number of people sentenced, there will always be room. That is an attractive proposition, but is any Parliament, when determining the funds for social policies&#151;health, education and so on&#151;likely to vote sufficient funds to a prison estate that will be larger than anyone can predict to ensure that there is never a crisis in the prison system? I suspect that, if we are honest and realistic, that will never happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08061817000019">There must be a system of balancing the two methods. Overcrowding is the other method that has been mentioned, but what constitutes overcrowding is a difficult debate to hold, and I should probably not follow that route, other than to acknowledge that it is one way in which to deal with the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08061817000020">I honestly believe that there is scope for changes that should attract a consensus in the House. I hope that the hon.

I hope that they will give it serious attention and accept that, although I sit on it, the group set about its work on a non-partisan, non-party political basis. I did not make my contributions on a party political basis. We have given the matter serious thought and I hope that those who read the report will recognise that, whatever its conclusions, it has been produced in a non-partisan spirit, in the hope of attracting some consensus.</p>

In the time available, I want to focus on sentencing, especially in relation to two crimes and our approach to them. First, I want to consider knife crime. We are in the age of the blade, and all hon. Members will have been horrified in the past few months by so many nasty knife crimes around London and other cities. Some have been mentioned tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08061817000023">I have been in court and listened to witnesses describe what it is like when somebody brings out a knife&#151;the flash of steel, the terror, the legs turning to jelly; the evil of a knife when it is shown to one. I heard a troubling statistic when the Violent Crime Reduction Bill was considered in Parliament three years ago and I asked about knives in schools. I was told that, according to Government figures, some 20,000 children aged 11 to 16 carried a knife into school for offensive purposes and some 40,000 children aged 11 to 16 carried a knife into school for defensive purposes&#151;60,000 children with knives in our schools.</p>

How can it be, in this age of the blade, that 60,000 children are taking blades into school? What about the children outside school, across the cities? How many tens of thousands are carrying knives? How many hundreds of thousands? If Government figures say that 60,000 children are taking knives into school, we are facing a true tragedy, but we have not got to grips with it.</p>

It is no wonder the public are in despair. Can someone not get to grips with knives in school? What are we going to do? The police and head teachers have plenty of powers already. Somebody, somewhere, has got to send out the message that it will not do for 11 to 16-year-olds and 16 to 18-year-olds to carry knives, and that it will be punished with custody.</p>

Something has to be done. Prison costs &#163;800 a week; residential rehab, on average, costs &#163;675 a week.

 I am conscious of the time, so I shall be brief in order to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) to share his important thoughts with us. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) on making a speech that was brief, but also wise and thoughtful; he is a man of great experience and integrity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08061817000037">The Secretary of State was slightly embarrassed earlier when my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) reminded him of the record prison population&#151;and rightly so, because overcrowding is unhealthy, it increases risk and is perhaps itself unlawful. My concern is for prison staff, as I believe overcrowding is increasing the number of assaults on them. It clearly causes great stress within these facilities. Indeed, prison officers are often going off work with stress, which in some cases leads to long periods of sick leave because of the extra pressures in overcrowded prisons. The Government have a duty to look after not only the prisoners but, perhaps even more so, the prison staff within their employ. They are failing to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80617-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08061817000038">I would like to focus on Shrewsbury prison, which is a major prison in Shropshire and the nearest to my own constituency. The prison provides accommodation for 181 prisoners, but the actual population, on the basis of figures released just a few months ago, is 329. That means an overpopulation of 182 per cent. Shrewsbury prison is the most overpopulated prison in England and Wales. That is a disgrace, not only for those seeking education and rehabilitation within the prison so that they do not carry on reoffending, but for the hard-working, committed and dedicated public servants who staff the prison.</p>

It is wrong that West Mercia police are being called upon time and again to act as full-time custodial officers, taking prisoners not only from Wales but from parts of the west midlands such as Wolverhampton. Once again, that is down to the neglect and failure of the Government. The right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) said earlier that he did not want to be partisan or party political&#151;absolutely not, but it is interesting that those comments are made only when the Government are desperate for friends; when they do not need friends, they are very happy to be adversarial and partisan. On an issue of such importance, it is right that we bring the Government to account, as we are attempting to do this evening.</p>

I believe that there is one ClearSprings bail hostel in my constituency, and possibly three, but there has been no public consultation. There certainly has been no consultation with the local council.

fact, and in many ways it predates even this Government. At the moment, someone sentenced to one year in prison will spend about three months inside, someone sentenced to two years will spend about seven months inside, and someone sentenced to four years will spend just one year and seven months inside. Let us not forget that a four-year sentence is seen as a very serious sentence, and handed out only for crimes such as armed robbery.</p>

 The hon. Lady is trying to do what the Home Office does&#151;blind us with statistics. One of the reasons there are so many people in prison is the number of foreign nationals who were not here under the Conservative Government.

Perhaps that is because they have swallowed too much of the anti-prison propaganda that has been emerging for far too many years from the Howard League for Penal Reform and many similar organisations&#151;which, I might add, are not even prepared to debate the issues in public. Every time I receive an invitation to attend one of their conferences I write back, &#147;Give me five minutes, give me three minutes, give me one minute, and I will stand up on the platform and prove that you lot are absolutely wrong.&#148; They never even bother to reply.</p>

A report produced by the Government back in 2000 suggested that the total cost of crime in our society was about &#163;60 billion a year. In 2003 Lord Carter&#151;another supporter of the Government, I believe&#151;produced a report showing that 50 per cent. of crime in this country was committed by a hard core of 100,000 offenders, of whom only 15,000 were in prison at any given time. The other 85,000 were on the loose, presumably serving community sentences.</p>

we halved the amount of crime in the country. That means that prison is a bargain for the taxpayer, and the more prisons we can build the better.</p>

 I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I do not intend to do that: I intend to go on fighting for what I believe in here. I can also assure him, however, that if I ever were to do it, a large majority in this country would support me. Anyone who has been a victim of crime believes that prison works, and prisoners do not want to go to prison. That is why all defence solicitors try to obtain community sentences for their clients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80617-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08061817000061">Community sentences are not tougher. I have seen them in action. I could tell stories of people serving so-called tough community sentences effing and blinding at staff, demanding that chips be brought to them because they cannot be bothered to queue. I have stood and watched that happen. I have friends in the police force who have seen people serving community sentences who have been unwilling to get off the bus because there is a light drizzle: they do not want to get wet because that would infringe their human rights. That is the reality of community sentences: they are not in the least bit tough, which is why all defence solicitors try to get their clients community sentences rather than prison sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80617-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08061817000062">The arguments about deterrence and reconviction rates do not add up. We know that the rate is about 60 per cent. in generic terms, whether people are serving a community sentence or a prison sentence, but if we break prison sentencing down, as I did earlier, we see that the longer prisoners serve, the less likely they are to reoffend. That is not simply because many are serving life sentences because they have committed murder. Those who are sentenced to between four and 10 years in prison are only 33 per cent. likely to reoffend within two years. The reason is simple: as any prison officer will confirm, those dealing with these people need a bit of time to work with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80617-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08061817000063">This is where I suddenly become a bit more fluffy and <i> Guardian</i>-reading. <i> [Laughter.]</i> Yes, it is a bit of a shock, isn&#146;t it? There are things that I heard earlier with which I actually agreed. Many people who end up in the penal system come from very difficult backgrounds. Typically they have no education and no social skills, and they have drug and alcohol problems. We can all agree on that. But we will not help people like that by sentencing them to a year in prison and then letting them out three months later, returning them to the estates where their problems began.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80617-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08061817000064">I do not have enough time to say more about this now, but I do not believe in throwing people into a cage and leaving them there. I believe that much more needs to be done in prisons to help those with drug and alcohol problems, and to give them the vocational skills&#151;perhaps even academic skills in some cases&#151;that will allow them to obtain jobs in the outside world. At the same time, I would be a little tougher and say, &#147;If they&#146;re not prepared to take advantage of the opportunities that we must put in front of them, they don&#146;t come out of prison.&#148;</p>

 This has been a short and overcrowded debate, and I am sorry that there has not been long enough for other Members to contribute&#151;or for Members of my party to speak for longer, as in the limited time they have had there have been some stellar speeches. That demonstrates that my party, at least, has thought about the questions we face today.</p>

It pains me&#151;not very much, but somewhat&#151;to have to say that the Secretary of State can never be accused of rising to the occasion. I am sorry that he is not present. I think he must be the only Cabinet Minister who is able to make an after-dinner speech well before dinner. It concerns me that he is able to treat a subject of such importance with such levity. I fear that the longer he remains in office, either as Home Secretary or as Secretary of State for Justice, the less chance we have of seeing a coherent strategic approach to the criminal justice issues that our motion describes. Let us hope that the Minister of State, who has thought about these issues with greater concentration, is able to sum up on behalf of the Government in more attractive fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80617-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08061817000068">The Secretary of State rightly said that the number of escapes from category A prisons is now down to more or less zero, but the real issues nowadays for security in prisons is not who escapes unlawfully from the custodial estate&#151;the open estate is a different matter, of course&#151;but what contraband gets in either over the walls or through visitors or prison officers smuggling stuff in. That statement gives me the opportunity to agree with Members who have paid tribute to those who work in prisons: prison and probation officers, those who work in the education service in prisons, and all those who work to keep the people whom the courts have sent to prison safe, in an attempt to rehabilitate and reform them so that they come back on to our streets, as many of them do, in a better condition and fitter to spend their time back in society, looking after themselves and their dependants and paying their way.</p>

It should be a point of shame, especially when one considers what is done for prisoners inside prison&#151;nothing. That is not because the prison officers are not doing enough work or because the educationists are not doing enough to help, but because the Government have so overcrowded the prison estate that nothing meaningful can be done to assist in their rehabilitation.</p>

Nothing will be done in terms either of the moral rightness of the case about which we complain or of public expenditure, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Woking on what he said.</p>

several points that he has made on other occasions. Speeches from Back Benchers ended with a particularly fiery one from the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies). We do have several anger management courses in prison in which he could participate if he so wished. We also heard, as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) pointed out, some thoughtful speeches, not least from the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) and the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins). This last raised the serious issues of knife crime and drugs.

The chance of being a victim of crime is at its lowest level for 25 years and more offenders are being brought to justice. Reoffending rates have also fallen significantly, but we face real challenges that we must address as part of our work on prisons. Members have raised the question of prison numbers and how we can address reoffending. The hon. Member for Cambridge raised the important issue of who we put in prison and whether we need to consider reoffending in a new way. The hon.

We provided 1,700 new prison places last year, and 2,422 to June this year. When the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs says that the Labour Government have failed on prison places, I remind him of the fact that since March 1,240 prison places have been delivered. When he goes, as I hope he will, to visit Stoke Heath, Erlestoke, Albany, Send, Ranby, Lewes, Portland, Stocken, High Down, Blundeston, Wandsworth, Brinsford, Acklington, Kirklevington Grange and Wayland, he will see new prison places tackling the new prisoners who are coming in to those places because we are bringing more offences to justice. I hope we will bring forward more prison places before the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08061817000089">The difference between the Opposition and the Government is that we have put &#163;1.2 billion of new money from taxpayers&#146; resources into the system in this comprehensive spending review settlement. We will put in a potential further &#163;1 billion plus in the next comprehensive spending review&#151;money that I venture   <br>

to suggest the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs would rather put into tax cuts than into public spending and public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08061817000090">Important issues about preventing reoffending were mentioned by the hon. Member for Cambridge and others. It is important that, as the hon. Member for Woking suggested, we look at what we do about drugs and drug dependency. It is important that we do that in the community through better use of community sentences, and that we invest in services in relation to drugs in prison. The hon. Member for Monmouth mentioned drugs in prison, too, and I remind the House that Mr. Blakey, a former member of Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary, has produced a report for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on drugs in prison, which we intend to publish shortly. It considers how we can improve the regime in prisons and the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08061817000091">The question of employment and raising the levels of literacy and skills was mentioned by the hon. Member for Cambridge and is absolutely vital. It is not just about putting people in prison for punishment, although punishment is extremely important but was lacking in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech. It is equally important what we do with people when they are in our system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08061817000092">We certainly have to do more work on education, raising literacy and numeracy and securing support for employment and training. That was why I was particularly keen only last week to join my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan), the Government Whip on the Bench today, in a visit to Wandsworth prison where we saw key examples of training in computers, literacy and cabling. We are working with private sector employers from outside Wandsworth prison and with the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), who is also on the Front Bench today, to look at how we can link employers outside prison with offenders in prison to raise their skill levels, get them into employment and ensure that they have the opportunity to change their lives on their exit from the prison system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08061817000093">As was mentioned, we also need to look at whom we put in prison. Members will know that we have commissioned my noble Friend Lord Bradley to look at the issue of mental health. He will be reporting shortly to the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), the Secretary of State and me on the question of mental health interventions and whether or not we can find alternatives to prison for certain prisoners who have mental health issues. We are also putting in place a range of provisions to consider cognitive behaviour programmes and the need for offenders to complete additional work on those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08061817000094">The hon. Member for Woking also mentioned the important issue of knife crime. I take his points extremely seriously. He will know that we have doubled the maximum prison sentence for possessing a knife in a public place to four years and that we have given school staff extra powers to search pupils for weapons. We have banned samurai swords and supported increased stop-and-search powers for police. Indeed, with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary we have recently introduced 100 portable knife arches and 400 search wands. Knife crime is a serious issue. It does not affect every community in the  <br>

UK, but those that are affected are affected very seriously. I take very seriously the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points about what we need to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80617-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08061817000095">The Labour Government are providing the resources for extra prison places, tackling reoffending and making sure that we reduce crime, as we have done over the past 11 years. I challenge Conservative Front Benchers to ensure that if their party formed a Government, it would provide the necessary resources. It would not do so; it would not tackle reoffending, as we are doing. I commend the Government amendment to the House and oppose the Opposition motion.</p>

 I am grateful for the chance to introduce this debate. Before I go into detail, it is my duty to declare two specific and important interests in this matter. First and foremost, I am obviously a Conservative, and it was the last Conservative Government who introduced the private finance initiative in 1992. I have absolutely no objections whatsoever to well-planned PFIs. They make good financial sense, the risk capital comes from the private sector and a decent cut of any reward is designed to end up in the public purse. The Treasury measures success by the simple yardstick that PFIs must be fair, and above all, accountable. They have a highly detailed standard contract procedure, which is understood by all parties. Private finance initiatives have their critics, and things can go wrong, but they are the most tried and trusted example of private partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08061817001055">My second declaration of interest is much more important. I have a financial stake in the private partnership that we are considering. I live in Somerset and pay taxes to Somerset county council. I have thus become a small shareholder in a huge new joint venture, brokered by the county and run by the global computer giant, IBM. The company is called Southwest One.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08061817001056">The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), will be familiar with many of my concerns because we have discussed the matter privately and in this place. He listened to my speech in Westminster Hall on 26 March on the subject, and I thank him for his response to it. During that debate, I clearly expressed my anxieties about the way in which the company came into being. I feared corruption, and I made that clear at the time. I can prove that lies have been told and, tonight, I will produce fresh evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08061817001057">I should like to make one thing crystal clear. Some have wrongly accused me of sheltering behind the protection of parliamentary privilege. That is incorrect. I have repeated outside everything that I have ever said about Southwest One here. My website and my blog&#151;modesty forbids, but it is called Mogg the Blog&#151;bear ample testimony to that. I have laid myself open to any legal challenge and, as yet, no one has dared challenge me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08061817001058">Southwest One is formed of two councils&#151;Somerset county and Taunton Deane borough&#151;plus one police authority, Avon and Somerset constabulary. I remind the House that its business partner is IBM. Hon. Members will be surprised to learn that IBM owns 75 per cent. of the company. That means that, if Southwest One ever makes a profit, the &#147;Big Blue&#148; will pocket three quarters of it. It is a 10-year venture, which was supposed to save money. Somerset council claims that it will save it &#163;200 million&#151;&#163;20 million a year. Yet the county offers no logical explanation or business realisation plan. Why? There is not one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08061817001059">There is a document, which falsely describes itself as the business realisation plan, but it contains not one single fact or figure. Instead, it is an exercise in vivid   <br>

imagination, probably written by&#151;dare I say it, and show my venerable age&#151;Andy Pandy. Let me give an example. The document states:</p>
<a name="80617-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="08061817001111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Improved supplier service levels will result in authorities delivering higher performance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08061817001060">Excuse me&#151;what is the precise predicted improvement year after year? We do not have any numbers&#151;but there are no numbers. It is all aspirational garbage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08061817001061">When did the document appear? Only the other day, after persistent demands under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 from angry trade unionists. I pay tribute to Unison, which has not stopped its campaign. As a taxpayer and Somerset Member of Parliament, I share its anger and frustration. I gently say that I hope that the Minister does, too. It is no way in which to conduct intelligent business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08061817001062">The Government already rightly publish excellent advice on how to do things. Business Link describes best practice thus:</p>
<a name="80617-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="08061817001112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Success in a joint venture depends on thorough research and analysis of aims and objectives. This should be followed up with effective communication of the business plan to everyone involved.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08061817001063">However, the architects of the joint venture company have strangled information to such a tiny trickle that nobody outside the magic inner circle knows what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08061817001064">Not one elected councillor of any persuasion has been given unrestricted access to the 3,000 page contract, which was signed last September. Most of it stays hidden. Councillors, the unions and the public who, like me, pay for all that, have been treated like mushrooms. We have been left in the dark and, every now and then, some smug soul chucks a bucket of manure over us. The last big bucket of dung was delivered yesterday by the very man who boasted that not a single job would be put at risk by the deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08061817001065">As the Under-Secretary knows, I am talking about the chief executive of Somerset county council&#151;a man who has lied consistently to everyone at all stages. Yesterday, he calmly told an audience of more than 200 councillors, almost in a throwaway line, that restructuring services throughout Somerset would probably mean a 30 per cent. cut in the total work force. That would mean Somerset county shedding 5,000 jobs in front-line services and almost 200 each for the five district councils. However, some of those councils do not employ 200 people directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08061817001066">Mr. Jones was not authorised or expected to say what he did; it just slipped from his lips like a blob of saliva. He is a man who claims to be guaranteeing the jobs in Southwest One, but he has now told us that thousands of other jobs will be sacrificed by the people of Somerset. That is the ultimate betrayal, and the unions and others now call him Alan &#147;Judas&#148; Jones. The current leader of the council, Jill Shortland, is trying tonight to explain away his words, by claiming that any job losses can be achieved by natural wastage. But the only natural wastage that most people want to see is the immediate departure of that incredibly dangerous man, who has cocked up and covered up for far too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08061817001067">We do not even know for sure who is on the board of Southwest One. There are quite a few bods from IBM, naturally, and a couple of harmless councillors who would not say boo to a goose or recognise a balance sheet if it bit them, like a goose, on the bottom, as well  <br>

as the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police force, who apparently has the right to sit on a public board. I do not think that I have heard of an arrangement quite as dodgy as that. I am also reliably informed that the chief executive of Somerset county council is another regular attendee at board meetings, but that is hearsay. Mr. Jones has always sworn blind that he plays no active part in Southwest One. I am afraid that that now looks like another whopping lie.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08061817001068">I intend to dwell on Mr. Jones for quite a while. He more than any other public official has been involved in the formation of the company, and it is his ruthless tactics that we must expose. Mr. Jones has a habit of falling out with people and then covering it up. The first effective manager of ISiS&#151;the improving services in Somerset programme, which was the precursor to Southwest One&#151;was a bright and attractive young lady called Jenny Hastings, a constituent. She and Mr. Jones worked effectively and closely, but then there was the falling-out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08061817001069">All councils have a procedure for resolving grievances&#151;we all know that; we are Members of this place&#151;but in that case there must have been something extremely difficult to resolve. The timing was uncomfortable. The Audit Commission was about to examine the county&#146;s books. Somerset&#146;s quest for five shining stars would have fallen flat on its face if the chief executive had been embroiled in a tacky public industrial tribunal. It took the services of ACAS to thrash out an agreement, under which Mrs. Hastings departed amicably&#151;and silently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08061817001070">The process also cost an awful lot of public money. I would like to know how much. I made a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 more than a year ago, but the council is still dragging its feet and delaying a response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08061817001071">Mr. Jones&#146;s reputation in county hall is a legend&#151;a remarkable achievement. I am told by the unions that anthrax is more popular than Alan Jones, but I would not know personally. I am no friend of the Liberal Democrats&#151;the Minister knows that, and you certainly do, Mr. Speaker&#151;who hold political control, but I am appalled and horrified by the manner in which Alan Jones manipulates them. There is no better example of that than what happened to one councillor, who was the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats on the county council.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman&#151;that councillor&#146;s name is Paul Buchanan. As Liberal Democrats go, he has the sharpest of brains. He was on the ISiS project, he worked with Jenny Hastings and he knows where all the bodies are buried. He has made no secret of the fact that Alan Jones would be out if he became leader, which he was destined to do. Unfortunately, that claim may have been a bit of an error. Last April, Alan Jones reported Paul Buchanan to the Standards Board for England&#151;no fewer than 50 different trumped-up charges were made against the man.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08061817001074">I sit on the Select Committee on Public Administration, but I am afraid that I do not have a high opinion of the Standards Board for England. The Government&#146;s motives for creating it were sound, and rightly so. After all, we must expect high standards of all our elected councillors and elected representatives. However, the Standards Board system allows injustice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08061817001075">Alan Jones was able to make those absurd complaints, and because of the way the board is set up, it is obliged to take them seriously, regardless of their nature. As a direct result, Jones silenced his most powerful internal critic. Suddenly, anything and everything that Councillor Paul Buchanan might have been able to say fell under the cloak of sub judice. That scuppered his political chances as well&#151;conveniently. Irrespective of political persuasion, nobody wants a new leader with a shadow of an investigation hanging over him, so the Liberal Democrats ditched their best man, and little Mr. Jones must have relished every second of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08061817001076">The original 50 charges, incidentally, were rejected very quickly indeed, but Jones, as usual, came back with fresh new charges. Inexcusably, the Standards Board is still wading through them. This dreadful system has permitted a brutal injustice in order to protect a dangerous unelected megalomaniac as he pursues the goal of a high-risk and very dangerous private partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08061817001077">I am now in a position to prove that one high-level official in county hall acted in support of the chief executive and gave false testimony to the Standards Board. The Secretary of State said in March, and the Minister repeated it in my Westminster Hall debate, that I should take up my concerns with the district auditor. I thank the Minister for that advice; I have done so. However, I am sad to report that the district auditor considers my evidence outside the strict remit of his accountancy, so I have no option other than to call in the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08061817001078">I am also concerned about the involvement of Avon and Somerset police in all this. Alan Jones hired the wife of the chief constable to negotiate directly with the preferred bidder, IBM. Now the chief constable himself has the right to sit on the board. I believe that that is too close for comfort and sets a dangerous precedent. Mr. Jones is now beginning to admit some of the ghastly truth about this deal. It will lead to job cuts. Even the police&#151;Avon and Somerset constabulary&#151;are talking seriously of shunting and shredding the front-line office staff in 19 police stations across the force area. The Minister is based in Gloucestershire and I am sure that he would have something to say if his police force were affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08061817001079">Southwest One is currently trying to drum up extra trade in Essex, Torbay, Plymouth and Cornwall. Cornwall is becoming a unitary authority and I would say to that council, &#147;Please look carefully at what you are doing; you are being led by the nose; if you go down this line, your expenses, accounts and accountability will be given to IBM based in Southampton&#148;. The same goes for Plymouth. They are both good councils; both need, dare I say it, guidance away from this mad scheme. I think that they should be afraid; they should be very, very afraid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08061817001080">The ethos of Southwest One is cut-price. The figures do not add up because there are no figures to see. If the other authorities sign up, they will be recklessly risking public money, but this is the way that IBM likes to do business: cutting margins, cheeseparing, getting less for more. The more it makes, the more it takes. Remember that IBM owns 75 per cent. of the action. New software arrives soon; it is called &#147;SAP&#148;, but everywhere SAP has been sold to local government, there have been huge  <br>

operational problems and big costly overspends. That has happened in Bradford, it is about to happen in Somerset and we are going to pay through the nose for it as taxpayers and as local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08061817001081">IBM put in the Rural Payments Agency computers, but we would have been better off with a bag of kiddies&#146; counting beans than with the mess that was made there. I do not blame the Government; I blame the systems. IBM lost the Department for Transport &#163;970 million&#151;do not take my word for it; the National Audit Office nailed it a couple of weeks ago. IBM cares about only one client&#151;IBM&#151;but that is business, is it not? One has to be tough to flourish and picking a global partner requires similar expertise to be able to counter and understand what is happening. That is what is missing, and that is what I want to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para30"><a name="08061817001082">Councillors in Somerset have had to rely on reports from a small group of officers, unaccountable to anyone, whose future careers are entwined with Southwest One. Councillors have found it incredibly difficult to represent the public interest because they are not getting impartial advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para31"><a name="08061817001083">I have a handful of positive suggestions for the Minister to consider. When it comes to Government projects, it is mandatory for the 4Ps agency to do regular reviews. Why not extend that to local government? Just an idea. How about beefing up the Audit Commission so that it can handle these highly complex deals? Either that or allow the National Audit Office to do the job, which would of course come under the Select Committees of this House. Specialist training for councillors on scrutiny committees would be welcome. They could learn about, and hopefully understand, what they ought to be looking for. Please, may we have clear Government guidance on the use of the magical cover-up phrase &#147;commercial confidentiality&#148;? In Somerset, that phrase has been used time and again to explain away unnecessary secrecy. It is the motto of the county now. It has dropped whatever it used to be and it is now &#147;Commercial confidentiality&#148;. It is used at every turn. Finally, a good deal is only as good as the cost and benefit realisation plan. We must have a mandatory standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para32"><a name="08061817001084">I am trying to be constructive for the future because I believe that, in Somerset at least, the project has been a complete disaster. Wool has been pulled over the eyes of the elected councillors and Alan Jones is clicking away with his knitting needles. I have been challenged to go and look at the contract. I have offered to take two forensic accountants, one business lawyer, Sir John Banham if he will come&#151;I hope that he will&#151;and possibly a couple of other people to help me. It will take six to seven days to go through it. However, I will not be allowed to see the whole contract or the whole business plan. I will not be allowed to see the correspondence on what made the deal possible and why the group was chosen over British Telecom and Capita. It is a joke. It is a sham. The group is hiding. Why?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80617-0021.htm_para33"><a name="08061817001085">The unions have been ignored and a cover-up has been the order of the day. It is, I am afraid&#151;I say this gently&#151;no good for the Minister to say that this is a matter for the councils concerned. It has moved on from there. I am afraid that it is no good telling me any more that the district auditor is the person to go to. We have brought the matter up with the Minister and in business questions already.</p>

 Not for the first time&#151;for the second, I think&#151;I am left somewhat breathless in a debate with the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger). He speaks with passion about the issue. If he carries on at this rate, the Parliament channel will be competing with the &#147;The Apprentice&#148; and other programmes for viewing figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para0"><a name="08061817001088">The hon. Gentleman is right about my response: it will be similar to the debate in March. I know that he is anticipating that in my comments about the role of the district auditor. If he has serious allegations to make about corruption, then he has made his views clear in no uncertain terms about the chief executive of Somerset county council and the chief constable of the constabulary. He did that in the previous Adjournment debate on 26 March and has used his parliamentary privilege to do so again today. As I said, the district auditor and the Serious Fraud Office are the places for him to go. He has indicated that that is what he intends to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08061817001089">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this second debate on an issue that is fundamentally about Government PFI contracts. He has made it clear that he does not have a problem with PFI or with partnerships as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08061817001090">I began my response to the debate in March with a warning, and I feel that I should do so again. It is important to recognise that although local authorities are increasingly strong and independent bodies, they are ultimately accountable to local residents, and must ensure that they act in a professional and responsible manner. Clearly there has been a breakdown in their relations with Members of Parliament&#151;certainly with the hon. Member for Bridgwater&#151;but ideally they should have a good rapport with MPs as well. I have run-ins with my own local authorities, for these things do not always run smoothly, but in an ideal world that would be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08061817001091">In particular, local authorities are responsible for the proper administration of their own financial records within the framework set by legislation&#151;including the duty of best value and public procurement law&#151;and codes of practice issued by professional bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. For that reason, the specific questions raised by the hon. Gentleman can be answered directly only by Southwest One and by Somerset county council, Taunton Deane borough council and Avon and Somerset constabulary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08061817001092">As I have said, if the hon. Gentleman has specific evidence of financial irregularities or a failure to follow due process in the establishment of the Southwest One partnership, he should present it to the district auditor. I am well aware that he has already done that to some extent. The district auditor is the right person to investigate such matters. If the hon. Gentleman has more serious allegations of corruption, they should be presented to the Serious Fraud Office. I realise from what he has said  <br>

tonight that he feels somewhat fettered, and does not feel able to speak to the local constabulary, because part of his issue is with them in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para5"><a name="08061817001093">Central Government cannot and, in my view, should not be involved in every action that councils take, and I think it right that neither Ministers nor officials have been involved in the development of the Southwest One partnership. However, owing to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s obvious concern about this project&#151;not least that expressed in the debate in March&#151;the Department has made inquiries of the Audit Commission and Somerset county council. I have to say that, so far, no evidence of wrongdoing has been presented to or uncovered by either the auditors or the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para6"><a name="08061817001094">Two auditors have been involved in reviewing the work to establish Southwest One. The Audit Commission appointed Grant Thornton to act as external auditor in 2006-07, and from 2007-08, the commission itself has acted as external auditor. Both auditors recently reported to Somerset county council, and I should say in fairness to them that they have been broadly positive about the processes that they followed. Grant Thornton summarised their opinions as follows:</p>
<a name="80617-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="08061817001113"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the size and complexity of the contract, it is inevitable that there are some areas of the process where improvement could have been made, but overall our review found that arrangements were sufficiently robust to give us assurance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para7"><a name="08061817001095">The Audit Commission has presented outline findings in similar terms, stating that there was a reasonable process for procurement with planned improved outcomes for the council, that there were appropriate reporting and staffing arrangements, and that the deal had been market-tested and improved through negotiation. The Audit Commission points out that considerable service and financial challenges remain&#151;I know that the hon. Gentleman agrees with that&#151;and the council needs to invest properly in the management of the contracts. In a project of this size, that is not surprising, but I hope that the partners in Southwest One will take on board the conclusions and redouble their efforts and prove this project a success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para8"><a name="08061817001096">Both in this debate and when the hon. Gentleman spoke to me earlier this evening, he mentioned his concern about jobs; he fears that 5,000 jobs may be lost under some kind of redundancy scheme. However, in fairness to the hon. Gentleman&#151;and also the local authority&#151;he did make it clear that the county council has changed its position on that, and is now saying that any changes would be due to &#147;natural wastage&#148;; those are his words, not mine. Accountability for all these measures is ultimately through the ballot box at local level. Local authorities have to be able to demonstrate best value to their residents, but also, in an ideal world, work in partnership with local Members of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para9"><a name="08061817001097">In broader terms on commissioning, procurement and shared services, central Government can&#151;and do&#151;facilitate the sharing of experience and expertise so that councils can make the most of the opportunities for more efficient and effective service delivery that are available through partnership with the private sector, the third sector, or other parts of the public sector. The hon. Gentleman was generous in his praise of the Government, and of the guidance and the work being done to support local authorities on that path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80617-0022.htm_para10"><a name="08061817001098">Many authorities are already benefiting from having entered partnerships: more than half of all councils say that they are engaged in, or are considering entering  <br>

into, a service partnership, and that they expect to obtain savings of up to 15 per cent. as a result&#151;savings not to be sniffed at. Let me cite as an example a partnership involving one local authority that covers customer services, revenue and benefits, property services, ICT and human resources. That has generated a variety of benefits, in this case including 12 per cent. cost savings on the services transferred, and improved service delivery such as better council tax and national non-domestic rate collection rates. Those are some of the advantages that can be gained through better partnership working.</p>
