 (Lab): What estimate he has made of the number of people who would be (a) arrested, (b) brought to court and (c) imprisoned if khat was classified as an illegal drug. [41769]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60116-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 No such estimates have been made. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has carried out a comprehensive study into the harms associated with the plant khat. The Council&#039;s report is currently with the Home Secretary and will be published in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60116-01_spnew0"><b> Paul Flynn: </b> 
 Is not the call for a ban on khat based on the naive, mistaken belief that banning drugs eliminates their use, while in fact the reverse is true? Millions of people in Britain use illegal drugs every day. Would not a ban on khat drive a wedge between the police forces and the Somali and Yemeni communities, encourage khat users to use far more addictive and dangerous drugs such as alcohol and tobacco and change legal businesses into criminal ones overnight, and also place a burden&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60116-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. That question is far too long.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60116-01_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 My hon. Friend and the Government have a rather different view of the control of drugs. It was due to concern about the health and other impacts of khat use in the communities that he mentioned that the issue was referred to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. The council has made its assessment and its report and the Home Secretary is considering it. He will make his decision and an announcement in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60116-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Humfrey Malins  (Woking)</b> 
 (Con): In the courts where I sit, there is no link at all between the consumption of khat and crime. The danger of banning such a substance is that the price will shoot up, supplies will drop and more people will turn to crime to fund

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 546</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their habit, so may I urge the Minister to focus more on crack cocaine and heroin and to take no steps, for obvious reasons, on that particular substance?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60116-01_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to emphasise that the Government&#039;s priority is class A drugs&#151;heroin and crack cocaine&#151;which do the most harm, but the Home Secretary is considering the report from the advisory council. He will have heard the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments and will make his decision in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60116-01_spnew5"><b> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East)</b> 
 (Lab): The noble lord, Lord Adebowale, the chief executive of Turning Point, said of khat:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;It is a social care issue and it requires a social care response. We need to be looking at the whole range of people&#039;s needs from physical and mental health right through to employment and family support services.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">Will my hon. Friend take Lord Adebowale&#039;s opinion into account before he makes his decision?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60116-01_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Not only that, but Lord Adebowale and Turning Point, the organisation that he heads, have done important work in that area. Indeed, Turning Point submitted a report to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which is among the range of evidence being actively considered by the Home Secretary.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60116-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Edward Garnier  (Harborough)</b> 
 (Con): As the Minister will know, the use and trade of drugs are behind the majority of criminal activity and social problems in this country. Sixty per cent. of those arrested, convicted and imprisoned reoffend, so what are the Government actually doing to deal with the underlying problems that drug use reveals?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60116-01_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 A great deal. The drug interventions programme, which is at the heart of what we are doing in relation to drug-misusing offenders, is the key. More than 2,000&nbsp;drug-misusing offenders a month are going into treatment through the programme. At the same time, crime levels are falling. That has to be a good message, which I hope will be welcomed by the hon. and learned Gentleman. With the intervention and the investments we are making drug-related crime is falling while the numbers coming into treatment are increasing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60116-01_spnew9"><b> Kerry McCarthy  (Bristol, East)</b> 
 (Lab): I want to reiterate what the Minister said about the demand for the criminalisation of khat coming from the Somali community, as that is certainly the case in my constituency. I also support calls for more emphasis on serious drugs such as crack cocaine, so are there are any plans to repeat Operation Crackdown this year, which was a great success last year?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60116-01_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 It will be very much for police forces to decide on how to take forward their new powers in relation to Operation Crackdown, which closed down crack houses and not only took out those who supplied drugs in our communities, but did so most effectively with the active co-operation of local communities. My hon. Friend&#039;s comments on khat are noted, and the considerations continue.

 (Con): What assessment he has made of proposed arrangements for local accountability of policing following amalgamations of forces; and if he will make a statement. [41778]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60116-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Clarke): </b> 
 The Government have already set out our plans for accountability in our 2004 White Paper, and they are being actively developed with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities. Those plans for direct accountability include appointment throughout the country of local neighbourhood police teams whose names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses will be available to every citizen, which will be completed by the end of 2008; publication of local crime data, for which local police will be held publicly accountable; and regular partnership meetings at basic command unit level, where police will discuss local questions with elected councillors and others, combined with question and answer sessions open to the public, media and community groups.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60116-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 Does the Home Secretary accept that under the current arrangements we already lack adequate directly elected, local accountability and that the move towards larger forces will merely make this matter worse? For example, in Hertfordshire we currently have a police authority of 16&nbsp;members, none of whom is directly elected, but nine of whom are at least county councillors. If we move towards an eastern region force, which is one of the options that the Government are considering, we will have a police authority of up to 23&nbsp;members, of which at most two will be Hertfordshire county councillors. Is the Home Secretary merely making a bad position worse?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60116-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am afraid that I cannot accept that the current situation is satisfactory. There is not sufficient accountability at the moment between local police officers and their immediate local community at beat level; there is not sufficient accountability between basic command unit commanders and local elected councillors and local people; and there is not sufficient publication of data locally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">A lot of good things are happening and moving forward, but the White Paper in 2004&nbsp;set out a stream of ways in which accountability has to be increased. That is the most important thing for us to fix upon.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60116-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 Does the Home Secretary appreciate the real concerns and disquiet across the country about police force amalgamations and accountability to local communities? Surely, the issues involved are complex, so why are the Government rushing the changes through? What is the hurry? Why cannot more discussion take place and more time be taken before decisions are made?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 548</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60116-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 There is not the slightest rush in this regard. The hon. Gentleman is completely wrong. We set out our proposals clearly in the White Paper and I set out, in a public speech last July to all police authorities and all chief constables, how we intended to go. We refined those proposals in September last year. Police authorities and police forces were then asked to discuss this matter fully and come up with proposals, and I am glad to say by the 23&nbsp;December almost all of them did so, despite some of the misleading publicity at that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">Where there is a voluntary agreement&#151;I emphasise the word &quot;voluntary&quot;&#151;between police authorities and forces, we will proceed immediately. Where there is not such an agreement, a statutory four-month period for full discussion is required. I am sure that the kind of debate that the hon. Gentleman wants will take place in areas where there is such disagreement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60116-01_spnew15"><b> Rob Marris  (Wolverhampton, South-West)</b> 
 (Lab): Part of local accountability is to do with local funding. Will my right hon. Friend say what would happen, for example, in the greater west midlands if there is amalgamation, where the precept levels between the different police authorities are markedly different?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60116-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, three of the four forces in the west midlands region favour this amalgamation. There are issues, as he rightly says, about the precept and how it can be brought together effectively. That is precisely one of the issues on which the forces have made proposals and which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will discuss with them. I can assure him that we will come to a sensible conclusion in that regard, but we will not allow that to present a blockage to the sensible proposals supported by three out of four forces in the west midlands.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60116-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Brian Jenkins  (Tamworth)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is correct to emphasise the basic command unit, which meets the population face to face in its daily working arrangements. However, when he talks about consultation, does he realise that many people, particularly in the shire counties, would want a guarantee that in any amalgamated force the police officers from our shire counties are not sucked into the west midlands? How can we have real accountability, rather than consultation, under his arrangements?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60116-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is entitled to ask for that guarantee. It is a fair question and my answer to it is the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commitment that I gave in my initial answer: the absolute commitment to neighbourhood policing with a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local policing team&#151;with named officers and named community support officers working with that neighbourhood&#151;the point being to ensure that they are not obstructed from their day-to-day policing of a particular locality because the force is not large enough to deal with the crises that emerge from time to time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">My hon. Friend is right to raise that matter and I can give him the pure, solid assurance that it will be respected in every approach. I think that every community in the country will want to see us fulfilling our manifesto pledge to neighbourhood community policing across the whole country&#151;in every community, whether shire or not&#151;by 2008.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60116-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</b> 
 (PC): The Home Secretary will undoubtedly appreciate that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 549</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>policing is always by consent, and that the quid pro quo for that is good local accountability. Will he explain how the awful vista of one force for the whole of Wales will increase local accountability in the north of the country, when it takes five to six hours to drive from Cardiff to north Wales?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60116-01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Precisely by the means I described a moment ago in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins). Of course it is important that there is proper accountability in the local village, the local ward and the very local area. In the Government&#039;s opinion, that requires police who are dedicated to working in that local area with community support officers. That will apply in north Wales, south Wales, east Wales and west Wales. It also requires that, at the level of the district council and the basic command unit, there is proper dialogue between the police and the other agencies, including elected councillors, about how we ensure that policing&#151;at the end of the day, it is an all-community responsibility and not simply a responsibility for the police&#151;is done in the most effective way. That will happen in north Wales and south Wales, and that is the right way to go.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60116-01_spnew21"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham)</b> 
 (Lab): In my right hon. Friend&#039;s proposals for an all-Wales force is it his intention to have on the police authority a representative of each of the 22&nbsp;local authorities in Wales?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60116-01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 That is one of the issues that has been raised in the responses from the Welsh forces. It is a very reasonable response, and my hon. Friend&#039;s point is also very reasonable. We are looking at the exact detail of how to bring that about, but I can certainly say that we are looking at it with a very positive approach.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60116-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone)</b> 
 (Con): The Home Secretary may know that there is significant opposition in Staffordshire and my constituency of Stone to the proposals that the police forces in the west midlands be amalgamated. To what extent does he really believe that when we are dealing with regional systems such as would be set up in the west midlands, the philosophy and the attitude that is relevant to dealing with very large urban areas such as the west midlands would be applicable to rural constituencies such as Stone and others in Staffordshire?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60116-01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I have been very encouraged&#151;it is an important point to emphasise&#151;by the extent to which chief constables, chief officers and police authorities of all types from all parts of the country are utterly committed to the neighbourhood policing idea. Why? Because they know that crime will be best prevented by having police on the beat in the local community working with the local community. Whatever type of force we talk about&#151;whether it is in Stone in Staffordshire or in the centre of Birmingham&#151;that ideology is there and established, and it is a core part of our proposals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60116-01_spnew25"><b> Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody  (Crewe and Nantwich)</b> 
 (Lab): Excellent though the Home Secretary&#039;s ideas undoubtedly are, I hope that he will understand that, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 550</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>much as we in Crewe admire the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, there are reservations in our minds as to how much accountability there would be for those of us at the bottom of a very large regional area if decisions were taken elsewhere and in an urban setting. Will he give us a very clear idea of how that point will be dealt with?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60116-01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Well, Madam Speaker&#151;I do apologise, Mr. Speaker. I was slightly distracted for a second.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">I certainly know that my hon. Friend can punch her weight in these arguments, and her key point about reservations is a fair one. It is a fair one to put to me as Home Secretary and to my colleagues to ensure that we provide the assurance that she is looking for. [Hon. Members: &quot;Answer the question.&quot;] I am indeed answering the question, and I will continue to do so. The answer is that I can give her the absolute assurance that the responsibility for policing will lie in local communities in the way that I have described and that accountability will not be diluted by larger forces at the strategic level. That is the absolute assurance that I give her and the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60116-01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Mark Oaten  (Winchester)</b> 
 (LD): If the Home Secretary really wants accountability, will he make two commitments today? The first commitment is that no merger can take place unless local elected police authority members have actually voted for it. The second commitment is that every council tax payer will be told exactly how much the mergers will cost and will see what the cost is when they get their bills in April. Unless he makes these two commitments, we will end up with a situation in which local people will have even less of a say but will have to pay even more.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="60116-01_spnew28"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am familiar with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s leadership bids in relation to these matters. I can give him a commitment on the second of his points, but not on the first. The commitment that I can give him is that the full financial facts in relation to any particular proposal will be in front of everybody including council tax payers in any locality. I cannot give him the commitment that police authorities around the country would have a veto on change. That would be utterly ridiculous in circumstances in which the police say that we have to ensure that our policing meets modern 21st century needs. That is what I am determined to deliver.

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the essence of local accountability is related to the neighbourhood policing model? Will he thus commend the work of South Wales police, especially the Bridgend division, which is not in a pilot area, but is bringing forward many elements of community policing well in advance of the pilot areas? Will he consider joining me and my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) when we spend a night with South Wales police a week next Friday?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="60116-01_spnew30"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_o5">The commitment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) to neighbourhood policing is absolutely central. In commending Bridgend police and the approach that they have taken, may I add that it is important to publish figures on local crime? I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cite the example of my own constabulary, the Norfolk constabulary. Every week, the <i>Evening News</i> <i>Norwich</i> publishes a detailed account of crimes committed&#151;such as burglaries and car thefts, and information about the streets on which they have occurred&#151;precisely so that local people have information about the crime that has been going on in their patch. That provides accountability in a direct way and it should proceed.

 (Con): Of the dozen or so police regions that we are about to have under the Government&#039;s proposals, how many have the unanimous support of their constituent police authorities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o37"><a name="60116-01_spnew34"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Of the regions, I think that none has the unanimous support that the right hon. Gentleman talks about. However, I can say that there is a clear majority of police authority support in several regions, and that is the way that this is being taken forward. I was amazed to see the proposals that were brought together today to bring politics into policing by making elected politicians directly responsible for operational policing. If the right hon. Gentleman had been elected Leader of the Opposition, I know that he would not be putting forward anything so foolish.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="60116-01_spnew35"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 I will bring the Home Secretary back to Government policy for the moment, shall I? The reason why there is no unanimous support for the regions is pretty clear from what has been said already. The proposal will cost hundreds of millions of pounds. It will dilute accountability throughout the country and disrupt police operations. It is based on an analysis with logic that has been described as flawed by one of Britain&#039;s leading professors of statistics, and it is opposed by the Association of Police Authorities. It is opposed because there is a better alternative: the proposal described as federal, which means that there is co-operation between abutting police authorities on matters on which they have a strategic or common interest. Why has the Home Secretary ruled out that very sensible proposal out of hand?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o39"><a name="60116-01_spnew36"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Of course co-operation is a good thing. It happens in policing every day of the week in every part of the country and we want to encourage it&#151;it is the right way to go. However, the fact is that when trying to deal with strategic police priorities, serious and organised crime and counter-terrorism, there must be operation at a strategic level. It is not me who is saying that, but the police themselves through Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary and senior police officers. The right hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that there is controversy about the proposal, but the fact is that in region after region, the senior police believe that it is the way forward to meet the needs of the 21st century. It would be better for the official Opposition to get involved in the debate instead of trying to make elected politicians directly responsible for operational police decisions.

To that end, on the day that the article appeared in a daily newspaper I instructed the director general of IND to present to me how the matter would be investigated. That investigation is now under way. It is headed by the non-executive director of IND, with support from within. I have undertaken also to publish as fully as I can the results of such an inquiry.

 The Government have made a commitment that by 2008&nbsp;every area in England and Wales will benefit from dedicated and visible neighbourhood policing teams. To support this commitment, we will increase the number of community support officers to 24,000&nbsp;by 2008, and we are making significant additional resources available through the neighbourhood policing fund.

At present, Knebworth and Codicote share a CSO who, in turn, must share transport with several other officers based elsewhere in the county. That reduces the amount of time that he can spend on the beat and makes policing less effective.

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s question, which shows that, such is the success of CSOs, communities increasingly want them to be in two places at once.

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that it is indeed the case that CSOs are additional to police officers. He will know that the strength of the police force is significantly greater now than it was in 1997. CSOs are playing an extremely valuable role, the very nature of which means that they are out and about in their community and highly visible. They are increasingly valued by communities, but he is right that they should always be additional to the basic policing strength. It is for chief constables to decide how best to deploy the resources at their disposal.

In our Green Paper, &quot;Rebuilding lives: supporting victims of crime&quot;, we set out plans to improve support for victims of crime by refocusing the criminal injuries compensation scheme to provide more financial help for those most seriously injured and immediate, practical help for other victims through victim care units.

How can we do more to help people such as a constituent of mine, who is due to receive only half of the &#163;8,000&nbsp;loss that he suffered after being deceived into paying for stolen goods?

 My hon. Friend is right that one important way to make criminals pay for crime is to recompense victims. We have put more effort into compensation orders, but the current collection level is unfortunately only 60&nbsp;per cent., which is inadequate&#151;it is better than it used to be, but it is still inadequate. My hon. Friends in the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Solicitor-General are working together to ensure better enforcement of compensation orders and fines, including blitzes, the roll-out of the Courts Act 2003&nbsp;and other actions, which I predict will improve the situation in general and for my hon.

 That is precisely the point. The biometrics that the ID cards will possess and those that are already being introduced in passports provide the assurances for the non-biometric schemes, which my hon.

 The number of antisocial behaviour orders issued, as notified to the Home Office, from 1&nbsp;January 2005&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;June 2005, in the local government authority area of Coventry city council is 12. During that period, a total of 142&nbsp;ASBOs have been issued in the west midlands criminal justice system area.

<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60116-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Cunningham: </b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend recall that Coventry Members of Parliament pushed for the introduction of ASBOs? Indeed, Coventry was one of the first places in the country to use them, but how many people have reoffended in Coventry and the west midlands?

 The hon. Gentleman will know that we have made about 9,000&nbsp;forms obsolete. We have also introduced video identity parades, and parades that used to take weeks to arrange can now be done in a matter of hours. We are trialling hand-held computers in a whole range of forces, so that police officers do not need to go back to the station so often. The police have also issued more than 170,000&nbsp;penalty notices for disorder. This has saved them thousands of hours of police officers&#039; time, which can now be used to tackle the problems that the public think are a real priority.

Under the respect action plan, we want to consult on a closure order that will give the right to close either residential or licensed premises within 24&nbsp;or 48&nbsp;hours, to bring respite to communities that are suffering from serious antisocial behaviour. We want to ensure that there is a power for conditional cautions, so that people can be made to do visible unpaid work very soon after engaging in their antisocial behaviour.

I do not have a league table&#151;I do not want to judge people on how many orders they have&#151;but many police areas and local authorities have now got their act together and are able to obtain the orders. The hon. Gentleman said that 40&nbsp;per cent. of the orders are breached; 60&nbsp;per cent. of them are not, which means that peace and harmony have been brought to those communities. When they are breached, it is vital that enforcement action is taken swiftly in the areas that are using these powers.

 There have been some 1,371&nbsp;voluntary returns to Iraq since July 2003. In 2004, the Home Office announced its intention to commence an enforced returns policy to Iraq. As with all nationalities, removals will be enforced on a case-by-case basis, and the immigration service will return people only to those areas of Iraq assessed as being sufficiently stable and where we are satisfied that the individual concerned will not be at risk. The first enforced returns to Iraq took place on 20&nbsp;November 2005, when 15&nbsp;Iraqis were removed on a forced basis.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="60116-05_spnew9"><b> Ann McKechin: </b> 
 The Minister will appreciate that a large number of Iraqi applicants have now been residing in the United Kingdom for more than three years. They come from the parts of Iraq to which we are unlikely, in the short to medium term, to be able to guarantee them a safe return. As a result, they are left in a very unsatisfactory limbo. Will the Minister consider either granting an amnesty to these people or allowing them to work for a limited period until we can determine whether the security position in Iraq, especially in the Baghdad area, is likely to improve?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o104"><a name="60116-05_spnew10"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has asked an entirely fair question. There are no plans for any such amnesty for asylum seekers&#151;from Iraq or any other nation&#151;whose applications have failed. In relation to whether those who cannot immediately be returned should be allowed to work or afforded some kind of temporary status, these matters are always kept under review, so I would never say never.

 I can only repeat what I said in my previous answer. All cases that are deemed ready for enforced returns are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, regardless of the circumstances and regardless of the country. Rather than narrowing that down to particular segments of the failed asylum seeker community as the hon. Gentleman suggests, I would prefer to keep it at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level at which the personal circumstances and the circumstances of the country for that individual, on a case-by-case basis, must be paramount. I repeat, however, as I said last week, that it must be in everyone&#039;s interest that when people, for whatever reason, fail in their application for asylum, we must collectively do all that we can to ensure voluntary rather than enforced returns.

 As the recent report on the DNA expansion programme confirms, the national DNA database is a key police intelligence tool and provides the police with around 3,000&nbsp;intelligence matches each month, which are critical leads for police investigations. There has been a fourfold increase in the number of detections obtained through the use of DNA between 1999&nbsp;and 2005.

 I am grateful to the Minister for that answer. He will know that 88&nbsp;murders once considered cold cases have now been solved thanks to the DNA database.

 I could not agree more with my hon. Friend&#039;s points. In particular, people who have been arrested for offences and whose DNA has been held have been linked to 3,000&nbsp;offences, including 37&nbsp;murders, 16&nbsp;attempted murders and 90&nbsp;rapes. Those leads are giving justice to families who could not previously have their case concluded. The database is extremely important and provides the police with a vastly important intelligence tool. We should celebrate its expansion rather than, as some others have done, seek to nit-pick and carp at every available opportunity.</p>

It is a near copy of the provisions relating to the provisions on sexual orientation, which the Minister will be aware were not in the original Bill as introduced in the House of Lords, but were by the time it came to be considered by this House. That was partly as a result of the pressure applied by other hon. Members, including those, such as myself, who signed early-day motion 710&nbsp;in the name of my hon.

<a name="stpa_3">There are three reasons for including the provision now: the need for protection, administrative efficiency and compliance with EU law. Society is much more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepting of transpeople today. The Gender Recognition Act 2002&nbsp;was passed unopposed with all-party support, a far cry from 1994&nbsp;when there was widespread discrimination against transsexual people, which led me to found the parliamentary forum on transsexualism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">At that time, Ministers tolerated blatant discrimination in employment against transpeople. Nevertheless, discrimination continues. It took five years to see the introduction of the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999, which amended the Sex Discrimination Act to prohibit discrimination in employment and vocational training. However, those regulations do not extend to discrimination in the supply of goods and services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The media have reported several cases involving transsexual people refused access to pubs. Press for Change, the lobby group on behalf of transpeople, is particularly concerned about young transsexual people who are forced to leave home when relationships with their families break down. Discrimination by private and institutional landlords means that these young and vulnerable transsexual people often encounter great difficulty in finding accommodation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The more widespread problem is that without legal protection against prejudice, many transsexual people censor their lives by taking care to avoid situations where they feel discrimination, knowing that the law currently leaves them with no redress. In that regard, we have made little progress since the time shortly after I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was elected in 1992, when I was approached by a transsexual woman who was absolutely terrified of her gender status becoming known by her employer. It was that kind of discrimination that led to legal challenge and to the regulations that I have mentioned.

<a name="stpa_7">In relation to the provision of goods and services, a few test cases have so far come to court, but most potential litigants stand down when advised that they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no case as the law currently stands. As I have said, the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations amended the Sex Discrimination Act in 1999&nbsp;to prohibit discrimination in employment and vocational training. This was done to implement the 1996&nbsp;ruling in the European Court of Justice in the case of P <i>v</i> S and Cornwall county council. That was the case of a transsexual woman who, having initially been promoted by the council, was then sacked by it when she informed it that she was going to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;She is right in saying that there is nothing to prevent the Government from acting. However, as I indicated, we are in discussion with our partners in Europe. We have a draft directive as of three months ago, and it appears that there will be legislation on the matter. The Government welcome that and believe that it is right to have that dialogue with our European partners, come to a conclusion and then take the matter forward.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A, </i>16&nbsp;March 2004; c. 186.]</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">That conclusion was reached later in 2004. European Council directive 2004/113/EC, of 13&nbsp;December 2004, implemented the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to, and supply of, goods and services. However, no provision was made in the Equality Bill to implement the directive, which surely would have been the obvious means of dealing with the issue. The Equality Bill is therefore the second missed legislative opportunity to provide that protection for transpeople.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">One major concern that the Government expressed about introducing such protection through the Bill was that a substantial amount of work would be required in considering whether any exceptions were necessary. Given that the 1975&nbsp;Act already contains exceptions to cope with single-sex facilities, it should not be considered problematic that new exceptions are required to permit continued discrimination against transpeople. However, there are likely to be rare and complex situations in which exceptions may be needed&#151;probably those involving people in the process of changing gender. The new clause would address that by introducing a power for Ministers to issue regulations creating exceptions. It is intentionally constructed as a replica of clause 81, which creates a power to introduce goods and services protection on the ground of sexual orientation. The new clause can therefore be presumed to be acceptable to the Government as a workable framework.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">However, the power to make regulations would allow Ministers to make any special provision that might be necessary, and it would ensure that Parliament does not have to satisfy itself at this stage that all possible exceptions have been considered. The provision allows more time and flexibility to ensure that the protection can be provided now, and in a way that works.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">Ministers have argued that it is not the right time for such a step. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford), the Minister referred on Second Reading to the Government&#039;s equalities review and the discrimination law review, with a view to the inclusion of any changes in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promised single equality Act. However, as the Government are aware, waiting for a single equality Act would risk leaving the UK in breach of its obligations 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 569</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>under EU law. The directive that I mentioned earlier, which implemented the principle of equal treatment in the access to and supply of goods and services, does not explicitly refer to transpeople or to gender reassignment. However, the minutes of the Council meeting include an explicit note that the directive should be determined in the light of the 1996&nbsp;European Court of Justice ruling in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the P <i>v.</i> S and Cornwall county council case, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned earlier also. In that case, the European Court of Justice held that the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex should be construed to include discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment.

<p>
<a name="60116-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Goods and services protection for transpeople will therefore be required no later than December 2007, when the directive enters into force. It is very unlikely that a single equality Act will be passed by Parliament and have entered into force in time to meet that obligation. It would, of course, be possible to implement earlier the directive to implement goods and services protection by making regulations under the European Communities Act, which I understand is the Government&#039;s intention. That appears, however, to be little different from using the Equality Bill now to create a power for regulation, and I am therefore confused about why the Government are not taking that opportunity, particularly as it would enable some areas not included in the European directive to be addressed. Some areas protected by the goods and services protection provided under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975&nbsp;fall outside the scope of the EU directive. Education, as a reserved area, is one example, and media representation another. Clearly, in introducing regulations under the European Communities Act, the Government will not be able to extend protection in those areas.

 I respect the hon. Lady&#039;s record in this field and strongly support her new clause. I put it to her that the Government&#039;s rationale for not acting now is no more compelling than the rationale that they offered in the other place in the first instance in respect of the similar problem of goods and services discrimination against lesbians and gay men. In fairness to Ministers, I may say that on that occasion, not least under pressure from the noble Lord Alli, the Government saw sense and conceded the need to act. Should they not do so in this case, too, on grounds both of equity and of efficient use of parliamentary time?

 I was coming to the point about administrative efficiency and entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. In fact, in many ways the issues concerning transpeople are perhaps a little easier for the Government to deal with than those concerning lesbians and gay men; we already have gender regulations in relation to employment, which cover many complex areas. I have with me, for example, a guide to the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999, which covers employment where it is required for employees to share the same accommodation. A lot of issues that might require detailed scrutiny have already been dealt with in those regulations.

<a name="stpa_15">Work is already under way within the Government on regulations to implement the Equality Bill&#039;s provision for protection against discrimination in the supply of goods and services on grounds of sexual orientation. Many of the issues raised by discrimination against transpeople are similar to that.

<a name="60116-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_16">Even if the Government introduce regulations, however, goods and services protection will not be comprehensive for transpeople. The means by which the Government propose to implement the EU directive will result in our missing the opportunity to introduce protection in these crucial areas. In addition, it will add unnecessary complexity to the law. It therefore makes administrative sense for the work on discrimination against transpeople to follow on quickly from the work on sexual orientation, rather than being left until the Equality Bill has passed through the House. For those reasons, I hope that the Government will accept new clause 9&#151;I know that they are committed to introducing this protection for transpeople.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I apologise for raising this point now, because it does not directly relate to the business at hand, but I wanted to give you notice of this point of order. I hope that this is an apposite moment. You will know that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway) is not present and, indeed, is incommunicado. However, he managed to sign last Thursday 12&nbsp;early-day motions, which appear on today&#039;s Order Paper. One of them, early-day motion 1297, is about abandoned animals at Christmas, but I do not know whether cats were included. Is it in order for an hon.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60116-07_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Eleanor Laing  (Epping Forest) (Con):</b> 
 New clause 9&nbsp;should be an essential part of this Bill. As my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bercow) said most eloquently a few moments ago, there is no logical reason why protection from potential discrimination on the ground of transgender should be treated any differently from protection from potential discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. The Opposition were pleased that the Government were flexible, far-seeing and honest enough to accept the amendments in the other place that have led to the addition to the Bill of protection from potential discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. It is a matter of simple logic and reason to say that the same protection should be afforded to people who have chosen to change gender. We have already passed legislation to make formal the status of transgender and we all appreciate that there is no reason why people should not have that protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_17">I understand why the Minister is likely to argue that the Government do not want to include the new clause at this time: they want to give the matter further consideration as it is part of an ongoing review. We discussed the matter at some length in Committee in a constructive debate. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) proposed the new clause in a thorough and meaningful way and she speaks for many, many Labour Members. She speaks for many Conservative Members, too, and she has the full support of the Opposition Front Bench.

 I have little to add to the words of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), who put the case well. Although it is welcome that during the passage of the Bill the Government have extended goods, facilities and services protection on the ground of sexual orientation, there seems no reason not to extend the provision on the ground of transgender.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_18">In Committee, the Minister was pressed repeatedly to give an assurance that the directive implementation date of December 2007&nbsp;would be fully met, yet failed, unfortunately, to produce any such reassurance. I accept the need to get the measure right and iron out the fine details, but as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak said, this will be the second missed opportunity to address that aspect of inequality. In 2004, the then Minister said that a review was ongoing and that something was expected within a year. However, almost 18&nbsp;months later we are no further forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_19">The simple reality is that if we wait for the Act to be passed, we will have missed an opportunity to implement the directive fully and to extend the provision, because, as has already been pointed out, education and the media are not covered.

 I, too, signed the new clause moved so ably by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) and, on the basis of our past association during the passage of the Gender Recognition Act 2004, I want to say how much I admired both her constructive approach to those macro-debates and the clear way in which she proposed the new clause. On both, more often than not, I agreed with her&#151;and, indeed, with other Members. This is not fundamentally a party political issue. That is why the Government should catch the tide and eliminate discrimination in one of the few remaining areas that is as yet inadequately covered by our legislative arrangements, and should do so in the way that the hon. Lady put so clearly to the House. She invites us to accept a new clause that is framed to give the maximum possible flexibility of detailed implementation, if there are detailed or technical issues that need further thought and ultimate resolution&#151;as there usually are, in my experience. I am with her on that.

<a name="stpa_20">I regret that owing to other duties, which we sometimes have, I have been a country member of the debates on the Equality Bill.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_21">I have three points to put to the House. First, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disagree slightly with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, who rightly said&#151;I do not disagree about this&#151;that there have been great advances in our approach to transgendered people. Nevertheless, my experience of people in such a situation is that there is still a real sensitivity and scope, to put it no less strongly, for wide misunderstanding among the general public of the position of transgendered people, not least because they are such a small minority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_22">Frankly, I would have known little about it, and might have had less sympathy than I have, if one of my constituents, who is very articulate, had not been able to brief me extensively during the passage of the Gender Recognition Act 2004. My constituent has gone through a marriage annulment and, I think, the first civil partnership in the country under the accelerated procedure. I was delighted to congratulate her on that relationship, which I hope will last. She is an excellent person who shows some measure of the quality of people who are transgendered and who are being disregarded and sometimes demeaned by society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_23">There was some unpleasant press comment last week about somebody who had sought a reversal operation after an initial operation. That was the old Adam coming out, at least in the press, in people who are still unsympathetic to transgendered people. It seems 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 573</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>offensive to have a situation in which the small number of transgendered people&#151;probably a handful in each constituency&#151;feel that they are being singled out at a time when other people&#039;s inequalities are being addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_24">Secondly, I should like the Minister to comment on another issue in her response. I remember well from our exchanges in Committee, when considering the 2004&nbsp;Act, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak bringing forward some interesting legal opinion and comments&#151;on which we did not have a wholly satisfactory answer from the Government&#151;in the relation to The Hague convention on the operation of private international law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_25">Increasingly, there will be situations&#151;I notice the Minister looking a little quizzical&#151;where persons who find themselves translated to the UK, either as temporary visitors or permanent residents, may have private rights attaching to them through their membership of other member states of the European Union. That creates a further anomaly that Ministers may need to consider, quite apart from non-compliance with the European directive in time, which I would have thought they would take seriously, but instead they seem to be taking a casual attitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_26">Thirdly, on discrimination, it seems daft that under the legislation shopkeepers, for example, will no longer be able to refuse services or the supply of goods on the grounds of people&#039;s sexual orientation or their religion, or for any other reason, but that the one area where they could continue to refuse would be in relation to transgendered issues. That seems grossly unfair and sends exactly the kind of signal on persecution, or demeaning people, that we should not be sending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_27">Having not participated in the debates in Committee, I thought for an awful moment that the Government might, in some strange way&#151;perhaps as the index of the ignorance that is still widely attached to such sensitive issues&#151;have thought to themselves that the provisions on sexual orientation that they were making would, in some sense, cover gender reassignation. Of course, the provisions will not do that because gender reassignation has nothing whatever to do with sexual practices or orientation, nor does it imply anything for them. In that sense, if we are to rake around in moral concerns, it is much less &quot;reprehensible&quot;&#151;I emphasise the inverted commas&#151;to have undergone gender reassignment than to have a particular sexual orientation. I have no objection to the law dealing with those issues either, but I do not understand why the Government are so diffident about this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-07_para13">
<a name="stpa_28">Finally, I shall emphasise a point that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak made so eloquently. Her new clause is an entirely facilitative new clause. It provides for an order-making power and not for a precise set of criteria. Therefore, if there is a problem it is possible for Governments to accommodate that. However, to accommodate it by doing nothing at this stage will facilitate the condoning and permission of discrimination in this very narrow area for an indefinite period of a year or two, when that has no justification or merit and should be stopped.

 The problem with having to save up points is that one does not have time to make them all in an intervention, so I shall ask only one question.

 I want to comment on the two examples that my hon. Friend gave&#151;single-sex hospital wards and prisons. The Prison Service has been working on guidelines on the treatment of transsexual prisoners for at least two years. I have tabled several parliamentary questions, and the last I heard was that those guidelines are almost ready or imminent. As for single-sex wards, the issues they raise are similar to those relating to joint accommodation in employment. I do not see that those issues are so problematic that the Government are prevented from accepting the amendment.

 I think that the Minister is giving way to me rather than to her right hon. Friend, and I am grateful to her for doing so. As she knows, I hold her in the highest esteem, so I do not say this with any personal malice or resentment&#151;but having listened very carefully to what she has said in the past 10&nbsp;minutes, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am none the wiser. It may be that I am a slow learner. Does she accept that, to me, her answer is thoroughly impenetrable? I cannot fathom a single good reason why the Government can act in a year or so&#039;s time when no great issue of minutiae or detail is involved, but are somehow incapable of acting now, as the House would prefer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60116-09_spnew8"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 What I have said is that because the EU directive sets out the matter, we are in a position to work through regulations to meet that time scale. We want to consider issues that go wider than the EU gender directive as part of the discrimination law review. I sincerely believe that there is a great deal to be gained from simplifying our legislation and having all discrimination law in one Act that sets out everyone&#039;s human rights, because equality affects us all. That is what I am trying to achieve through the discrimination law review.

<br>&nbsp;<br>for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), but I wish to return to what the Minister said. It was difficult to engage as fully as we might have wanted, given that she wanted to make her position clear before taking interventions. I wish to make two points, but I do not speak for the mover of the new clause who, I am sure, will present her own view. We do not doubt the Minister&#039;s personal commitment to the issue that is before us, nor, indeed, the Government&#039;s overall objectives in creating a climate and a statute requiring non-discrimination. In those terms, her answer was particularly disappointing, as it was when I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raised the matter in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_40">The Government have decided, I am pleased to say, to take order-making powers in respect of sexual orientation. The hon. Member for Buckingham (John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bercow) has already recognised that there is a moral imperative to do that because of the problems that are people have to face. There are two imperatives. First, there is the moral imperative, which is no less than the imperative that has already been conceded in respect of action following the enactment of the Bill in respect of sexual orientation discrimination. Therefore, it is hard to understand why the Minister does not take the opportunity of ensuring that she has regulation-making powers that will enable holistic regulations and laws to be made that cover also education and media portrayal, which are exempted from the European Communities Act 1972.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_41">The second imperative is the time scale that is placed upon us by the implementation date of the European directive. As I understand it, that does not apply in respect of sexual orientation. I think that the Minister said that she will definitely meet the deadline through the use of the European Communities Act regulations. If that is so, why not do the whole thing properly and have one consultation approach in time for the deadline and use the same mechanisms as have been proposed, which we are delighted to see, for dealing with sexual orientation discrimination?
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60116-09_spnew10"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this is not a matter only of principle, although the principle is itself extremely important? It is also a matter of practicality. Does he accept that unless the change is made sooner rather than later, it logically follows that the number of instances of discrimination will be that much more numerous? For transgendered people, discrimination and denial is not an occasional exception, it is a regular occurrence.
</p>








<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60116-09_spnew11"><b> Dr. Harris: </b> 
 That is right. It will not surprise the hon. Gentleman to know, given that my party introduced a single equality Bill proposal in another place through Lord Lester some years ago, that we believe that every year and every month that is wasted in not initiating quicker action in these areas will lead to more discrimination. However, we welcome the fact that the Government have made significant advances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_42">The Minister gave two examples that came after she said that work had to be done to understand the sort of discrimination that was faced. I am sure that she did not mean this, but to the outside world that might seem as though the Government and those who helped to draft the law do not understand the sort of discrimination that is faced by transgender people. However, through the work of hon. Members such as the hon. Member for

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_43">Given that the Government will have to deal with the issue of hospital wards and prisons to implement the European directive deadline by the end of 2007, using regulations under the European Communities Act, it is not a convincing or logical argument to say that it is not possible to proceed through regulation-making powers in the Bill to provide a complete approach. Those matters will have to be dealt with in any event.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_44">If the Minister were to say that there were real difficulties in terms of education or media portrayal, which would take longer than the available time scale, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not accept that but it would be logical. In choosing the hon. Lady&#039;s examples from areas that fall within the deadline with which she must abide if she is not to fall foul of the European directive, she is not using either the logical or the strongest of arguments. Regardless of the intentions of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, who will decide these issues for herself, I think that my hon. Friends will be keen to see the House divided on the issue, given that we have not had the undertakings or understandings that we deserve.

Friend the Minister to reconsider her response in the light of the provision, which does not bind the Government or put them into a straitjacket.

 The Minister has given certain assurances. Does my right hon.

 My hon. Friend is right, but I am trying to find a new way. It is possible, but far from certain, that the Bill will be amended today, and if it is amended the House of Lords will be able to reconsider the matter. The House of Lords can do anything when it reconsiders a Bill&#151;it is not bound by the rules of procedure of this House&#151;so it could bring the Bill back. Alternatively, the Government could provide an assurance in response to my hon.

<a name="stpa_49">On whether the Government can reconsider the Bill in the House of Lords if it is amended in the House of Commons, my hon. Friend the Minister referred to two other avenues by which such legislative protection could be introduced within the lifetime of this Parliament. It would help if she were to repeat her assurance that the issue will be addressed within the lifetime of this Parliament and that there will be legislative provisions rather than simply a Green Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_50">The Minister discussed the simplification and codification of anti-discrimination legislation and I share her objective, because the complicated layers of anti-discrimination measures that have built up over the past 40&nbsp;years bedevil people in enforcing their rights. However, the wording of clause 81, which contains the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power to make regulations on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and which I support, is, with one or two key changes, almost exactly the same as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that of new clause 9. If it is too complicated to accept new clause 9&nbsp;and introduce another layer of anti-discrimination legislation, then that argument can also be used in relation to the provisions on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in clause 81.
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60116-10_spnew5"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that new clause 9&nbsp;does not mean that action will be taken, because it only says &quot;may&quot;? I have made the precise commitment asked for by my hon.

The point of the new clause is to say that transgender rights in respect of non-discrimination in goods and services should be put through at the same time as those given to people discriminated against on the grounds of religion or sexual orientation. This excellent new clause gives the House that opportunity. That is why the Minister&#039;s promise of tomorrow is not good enough for many of us.

 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_54">New clause 10, which is in my name, has the support of Liberal Democrat Members. It deals with guidance in relation to school transport and wider parts of the Bill. It seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State issues guidance setting out how the provisions of part 2&nbsp;on school transport and wider matters will be implemented. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>We ask that such guidance as the Government are, I hope, planning to introduce shall have particular regard to the obligations retained for all schools, which are public authorities under the Human Rights Act 1998, to comply with the duty of non-discrimination, irrespective of the exceptions that apply under the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_55">Clearly, there are exceptions in respect of discrimination law, but there is an overriding provision to respect human rights, especially in relation to non-discrimination&#151;that is not a free-standing provision&#151;in relation to certain other rights covered in the Bill, and that exceptions as implemented have to be for a legitimate purpose and must be proportionate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_56">In particular, the new clause draws attention to the duty not to discriminate on the grounds of religion and belief and to carry out public functions with due regard to the Human Rights Act in relation to school transport under various sections of the Bill that deal with the subject. Crucially, the new clause suggests that this part of the Act should not come into force until the guidance under the new clause has been issued. The reason is that there are still major concerns about how the exceptions will be implemented in a way that is fair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_57">I want to spend the rest of my short remarks reading from the fourth report of 2005&#150;06&nbsp;by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which deals with the Equality Bill. The report makes two important recommendations in this area. The first is in paragraph 41&nbsp;and says that the Committee did


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;not consider the exceptions under clause 49&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_58">&#151;it is clause 50&nbsp;in the version of the Bill that we are considering&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;to be incompatible on their face with the Convention rights, they may in our assessment fail to prevent discrimination which would be contrary to the Human Rights Act.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_59">The Committee drew attention to the recommendations made in its previous report&#151;the 16th report of 2004&#150;05&#151;and went on to say that it hoped


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;that the Bill would provide for statutory guidance to be produced before Part 2&nbsp;comes into force, making clear that all schools that are public authorities under the Human Rights Act retain obligations to comply with ECHR rights of non-discrimination, irrespective of the exceptions which apply under the Bill. It is essential for any difference in treatment to be objectively justified in order to comply with Article 14&nbsp;ECHR.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_60">That is clear and speaks for itself. However, I would like to note a Government amendment that I presume we will reach, if not debate, later that recognises that, in this area, the Government have limited the exception available to faith schools in respect of their ability to discriminate on the ground of religion by subjecting a pupil to any other detriment and, indeed, to expulsion if, for example, the child changes religion, having been admitted to a faith school. I warmly welcome the fact that the Government have considered what was debated civilly in Committee and accepted that that was unnecessary and went too far. The need for guidance still applies and I want to hear how faith schools will apply their exceptions and what the Minister will say in respect of the time scale for guidance, as well as what that should cover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_61">On school transport, the Minister will remember that there is a long-standing thorny issue in respect of the appropriate guidance. In Committee, I set out my

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 587</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>concern and that of successive Select Committees at the inadequacy of the current guidance, and the fact that that is reinforced, if anything, by the explanatory notes to the Bill, which talk only about denominational schools, as if those parents who have children who they do not wish to go to a denominational school do not have the same rights to help if they need it to go a further distance to a non-denominational school. The Minister knows that that is the nub of the point. I refer again to the fourth report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, paragraph 49&nbsp;of which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;We are concerned that this current Bill does nothing to dispel, and may reinforce, the apparent misapprehension of some LEAs that it is permissible to discriminate against children of parents with non-religious convictions in the provision of school transport. We reiterate the concerns of the previous Committee, that guidance for LEAs on this matter&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_62">it exists, as the Minister knows, in the form of a circular letter on school transport from the then Department for Education, dated 21&nbsp;January 1994&#151;

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;is inadequate to ensure compliance with the Human Rights Act, and recommend that guidance should be produced under this Bill which should make clear that, as the Government has previously accepted, there is a duty under the Human Rights Act to make equal provision for school transport to support education in accordance with both religious beliefs and non-religious beliefs.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_63">I stress that the Bill should make equal provision in accordance with both religious and non-religious beliefs.

<a name="60116-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_64">Provided that the education system involves denominational schools, we Liberal Democrats recognise the need to provide help with school transport for children whose parents have religious beliefs and who wish to send their children to a school further away than their nearest one. The Minister will be well aware, however, that the guidance and local education authority practice seem to imply that those who do not have a religious belief do not qualify for the school transport concession.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_65">I hope that the Minister will repeat what she said in Committee by making it clear that the provision applies to those with, and without, religious beliefs, and that clear guidance will be produced in good time. Perhaps she might even ask the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Education Committee&#151;the latter issued a critical report on the School Transport Bill in respect of these matters&#151;to consider the guidance before it is published, in order to ensure that it is absolutely right. I hope, too, that she will put on the record the need for guidance in both those important areas. That way, the problems that parents without religious beliefs face because of the unfair way in which the school transport system sometimes operates can finally be rectified, after many years of trying to rectify them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60116-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 I commend the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harris) on his ingenuity in tabling this new clause, which touches on an important issue. However, my experience of the problems of home-to-school transport as operated in my county, where there is selective education and, therefore, the need&#151;in a way perhaps 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 588</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>similar to that which he described&#151;to do a great deal of juggling to get children to the appropriate school, makes me think that his proposal would cause massive headaches for local education authorities with very little benefit. I am bound to say, moreover, that the Minister would find it difficult to draw up guidelines, and even harder to implement them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_66">If, as a result of this legislation, the Human Rights Act 1998 is infringed because of the way in which home-to-school transport is offered&#151;and in a way that is unacceptable, even allowing for the exceptions provided for in the Bill&#151;I have no doubt that somebody will take that case to court to get the situation clarified. I hope that the Minister is not encouraged by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposals, because they would cause intense muddle and land her and the Government with an impossible task.
</p>

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60116-12_spnew0"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 In Committee, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) tabled similar amendments relating to guidance for school transport, which he then withdrew. In respect of school transport, the Bill contains exemptions for local education authorities and public authorities from the provisions on discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. Local education authorities have a statutory requirement to provide free home-to-school transport for certain pupils and they also have some scope to decide when transport is necessary in other circumstances. Each pupil&#039;s case will be considered on its merits, taking account of all relevant factors, including a parent&#039;s wish that their child attend a school of the religion or denomination to which they adhere. That discretion means that LEAs often provide subsidised transport for pupils of a particular faith to attend a school of that faith located outside the local area. An exemption from the Bill&#039;s discrimination provisions was included to ensure that that practice could continue. Otherwise, local education authorities would be vulnerable to challenge of transport policies that take into account the historical distribution of religious schools, which have often been built on out-of-town sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">I emphasise that local education authorities may&#151;it is, indeed, our view that they should&#151;provide subsidised transport to a non-faith school for a child whose parents are strongly opposed to their attending a faith school close to home. That, too, would be unlawful without the exception in the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60116-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Will the Minister confirm that all those functions are, in fact, judicially reviewable, if a local education authority is not providing them in a fair and reasonable fashion?
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60116-12_spnew2"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 That is certainly my understanding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">The exemption has been included merely as a protection for local education authorities against those who may use religion as the basis for a claim if they have not received free school transport for which they may have applied. There are no new school transport provisions in the Bill that warrant accompanying statutory guidance, yet this is the second time that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has tabled an amendment attempting to introduce such guidance. I have sympathy with some of his concerns 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 589</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about school transport and have already indicated, both in Committee and subsequently in writing, that I agree that policy on school transport needs updating. I can confirm that that is being addressed by the Department for Education and Skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">I have already agreed with the hon. Gentleman that new guidance is needed. I agree that it needs to make it clearer that cases of those seeking school transport to non-denominational schools should be treated in the same way as the cases of those who seek transport to denominational schools. I have indicated that new guidance will be produced, but it can be produced only by the DFES following consultation, development and the passage of the education and inspections Bill, which will, among other things, tackle school transport policy. We do not propose to produce statutory guidance for schools, but non-statutory guidance will be produced, which will make it clear that exceptions under the Bill do not override rights of non-discrimination under the Human Rights Act 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_70">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the explanatory note to the Bill is not properly even-handed and we shall ensure that the note to the final Act puts that right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_71">This Bill is totally different from the education and inspections Bill, which is progressing on a different time scale and is not as far advanced. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns; indeed, the interest he has shown with such tenacity has served to reinforce the need for guidance in this area, but it cannot be given under the Bill. I hope that, once again, he will agree to withdraw his new clause.
</p>








<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60116-12_spnew3"><b> Dr. Evan Harris: </b> 
 The Minister&#039;s excellent speech got better as it went along, and was somewhat better received, at least by me, than the contribution of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who apparently takes the view that guidance confuses rather than guides. I have heard him on a number of occasions eloquently demanding that mystifying pieces of legislation, of which the Government are, no doubt, on occasion capable, should be explained through guidance. I guess that those areas must have been more carefully chosen than the one that I chose today. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall certainly give way to allow him to respond to my gentle teasing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60116-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that I do not think that guidance may not, on occasion, be useful. My experience from having seen home-to-school transport in operation on many occasions is that guidelines are already in force in my local education authority area that are extremely complex. If people fall foul of them, they end up being taken to court. I do not think that a general, Government-issued set of guidelines will easily meet the multiplicity of problems that different local education authorities, each of which has completely different circumstances, face on home-to-school transport. It was the particular guidelines about which I was troubled, not necessarily guidelines in general.

<a name="stpa_72">I understand that another Bill will deal with school transport and, therefore, the Minister feels that it would be more appropriate to update the inadequate guidance under that legislation. People will have to cope for a few more months or years with the existing guidelines and more judicial review may be necessary. However, I thought that it appropriate to allow the Minister to set out on the record her views as communicated to me about future guidance and the problems with current interpretations. I am especially pleased that she had the good grace to recognise that the explanatory notes continue the culture of assuming that transport on grounds of religion applied only to those with religion and could never apply to those without religion.

When Governments seek to foster those good relations and, indeed, enhance them, they are under a duty to ensure that the institutions and organisations that they create have that purpose. The Commission for Racial Equality has been in existence for all the years that I have been living in the United Kingdom, and I came here when I was nine years of age. The then Government had just abolished, or were just about to abolish, the old Race Relations Board, and its successor was the CRE. So for all the time that I can remember, the black and Asian community has had an institution that was supposed to support and protect it and to speak up for its needs and concerns. In later legislation, even more powers were given to the CRE than the old Race Relations Board had had. Therefore, it is sad that the Government propose to abolish the CRE through this Bill and replace it with an organisation that brings together several other strands of the equality agenda. I want to make it absolutely clear that I support those strands&#151;for want of a better word&#151;having appropriate representation, with a body and organisation that speaks on their behalf, working in like-minded fashion with other organisations to ensure that equality is kept firmly at the top of the Government&#039;s political agenda.

That is a lost opportunity. The Minister will know that at the weekend, under the banner of the former chair of the CRE, Lord Ouseley, several individuals and organisations signed an open letter to her protesting against proposals to abolish the CRE; they accept that a new body may be necessary but the powers that it will be given do not reflect the aspirations and needs of the black and Asian community. They say that in any new body there should be a proper opportunity for the black and Asian community to be represented, hence the importance of the establishment of a race committee.

 If an organisation is not working or if it can be improved, let us improve it. I have my own story about the CRE. When I first came to Britain, my mother went to the CRE to ask for help in a discrimination case that she had. She was then, I think, the only person of Asian origin teaching in the London borough of Richmond and we could not understand why she could never obtain promotion. We went to the CRE&#151;I think I was about 11&#151;and asked it for help. Although it did not help my mother, it did not put me off the concept of the need for an organisation that provides help.

<a name="stpa_87">A lot of other organisations have claims of racial discrimination made against them, and I concede the point that we need a new organisation provided that it makes for better representation. The representation point is of paramount consideration for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrat party, which is always banging on about representation. I have just heard a speech from the president of the Liberal Democrats, and I name him even though I have not given him notice that I would. I have just rushed away from the speech to take part in the debate, but his speech was all about representation. With Muslim people sitting in front of him, he called for more Muslim Members of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I am not familiar with the life of Lord Halifax, but he makes the good point that representation is crucial. When the Minister responds to this first point, I ask her to be absolutely unequivocal. She should not use the words &quot;I hope&quot;, &quot;I wish&quot;, or &quot;there should&quot; because we have heard them before. We are looking for the words &quot;there must be&quot; if we are not to press the matter to a Division.

 On a point of clarification, does the hon.

Is it of equal value, or&#151;I think that this is a perfectly reasonable inquiry and I do not ask it tendentiously&#151;is he arguing his case especially strongly because the CRE 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60116-16_spnew4"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has an excellent record on these issues. Even though he represents a constituency such as Buckingham, which must have a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small percentage of black and Asian people&#151;it is certainly smaller than the 49&nbsp;per cent. figure for my constituency&#151;he still speaks passionately about such matters, for which I respect him. I think that it is a bit of both. People need to identify readily with the commissioners who will speak on their behalf. It might well be that all the commissioners decide at the first meeting that they have a common agenda that they need to take forward, but we need specifics. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood has tabled an amendment to provide for parity for women, which I fully support. Half the commission should consist of women because they make up just over half the population of this country. If we want to go for crude figures and base representation in some way on numbers, we should look at the population of the black and Asian community&#151;it now makes up about 5&nbsp;million of the 60&nbsp;million people in this country&#151;and ensure that it is properly represented.

<p><a name="st_205"><a name="60116-16_spnew5"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me such a candid and straightforward answer. Further to that answer, would he on the same basis argue that because the gay population is by general consent thought to be approximately 10&nbsp;per cent. of the adult population, it would logically follow that if the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body were to consist of 10&nbsp;people, there should be one guaranteed place for the gay community, irrespective of whether Stonewall is arguing for such a position? I am not aware off the top of my head that it is arguing for that, but it is an interesting point to establish.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="60116-16_spnew6"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 It is an interesting point and I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. There should be at least one such guaranteed place. The whole thing about the commission is that a person could be gay, black and disabled, so several different groups could be covered. If we are serious about the equality agenda, we should consider these issues and ensure that people are guaranteed a place on the commission. Of course the gay community must be guaranteed a place, but that is not what is happening at the moment.

 I am listening with interest because I am torn on this issue. There must be representation across the board of the various groups who suffer different forms of discrimination, and there are overlapping areas of discrimination, but I caution my hon. Friend. He has on several occasions referred to black and Asian residents of the United Kingdom, whereas amendment No. 9, which is the linchpin of the group even though it comes at the end, refers to &quot;black or other ethnic&quot; minorities. There is a difference, and I urge him to recognise that difference. There is a significant Ukrainian community in my constituency, for example, and we have a significant Polish community. The discrimination that they face may take a different form from the discrimination faced by members of visible racial or ethnic minorities, but we have to be cognisant of that nuance.
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="60116-16_spnew12"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 We are cognisant of it. However, my hon. Friend talks about the Polish community, which is white.

<p><a name="st_213"><a name="60116-16_spnew13"><b> Philip Davies: </b> 
 Is not the flaw in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument in favour of having certain quotas of people on the commission most evident in relation to disability? In appointing one person with a disability, how on earth is one to define what type of disability that person should have, given that there are so many different types of disability? Should one appoint a person who uses a wheelchair when wheelchair users make up only 5&nbsp;per cent. of people with a disability? It is nonsensical to suppose that one could ever get a cross-section of people with all sorts of disabilities. I believe that there have even been moves to define left-handedness as a disability

 The hon. Gentleman is right to this extent: a person can empathise even if he or she does not have a particular disability. However, I can assure him that people who have a disability know that they have a disability. I remember that when my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and I were trying to set up black sections in the 1980s, the then leader of the Labour party, who is now a Member of the House of Lords, asked us to define &quot;black.&quot; We replied, &quot;People know instinctively whether they are black&#151;they just have to look in the mirror.&quot;

<p><a name="st_215"><a name="60116-17_spnew1"><b> Ms Abbott: </b> 
 My hon. Friend takes us back in time. When he said that the commissioners could be 10&nbsp;white men, the Minister shook her head fiercely. However, the working party that considered the establishment of the commission comprised 28&nbsp;people of whom only three were from visible minorities. Does he agree that that feeds the concern felt by the black and Asian community that we will find ourselves hopelessly marginalised in the new commission?

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60116-17_spnew2"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 That is an important point, which must be pursued. The way in which the consultation process has taken place is regrettable. It has taken place at the time when, following the events of 7&nbsp;July, the Government have been eager to engage with sections of the Asian community by setting up commissions and working parties. As I said earlier, words are okay and statements and speeches can be magnificent&#151;we have made some fantastic statements on diversity&#151;but in the end what counts is our ability to change legislation for the purposes of progress.

 Does my hon.

We have made considerable progress&#151;I do not underestimate that progress when I look at those who occupy the Government Benches and those elsewhere in the country&#151;but the form of discrimination against those who happen not to have a white skin remains.

It is not personal. I think that we have failed in terms of the equality agenda after eight years. I expected more from our Government than we have given. We need to do more. We need more than good speeches about more black people here and more Asian people there. We need to have good laws, which I hope that we shall introduce as part of the measure that is before us. In addition, we must have bodies that will be able to allow the communities to be able to represent themselves. I am sorry that that is not happening. That is lamentable.

<a name="stpa_90">Only this morning, there was an article in <i>The Times</i> about the number of police officers who are not only joining the police service, but leaving it. The police service had 4,629&nbsp;ethnic minority police officers in 2004. That was an 18&nbsp;per cent. increase on the previous year. Hooray. That is a fantastic record. However, 17.8&nbsp;per cent. of black and Asian recruits in 2004&nbsp;resigned or were dismissed within six months of starting their jobs, compared with 7.7&nbsp;per cent. of white officers.

<p>
<a name="60116-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_91">Last year, 12.6&nbsp;per cent. of ethnic minority recruits dropped out of the service within six months compared with 7.6&nbsp;per cent. of white officers, and the figures continue. In that public service&#151;one that is constantly monitored&#151;to see that sort of reaction and to hear stories of racism against police officers makes me wonder what we have been doing over the past generation. We certainly should have done much more. These are lamentable figures for any Government. For me, someone who is passionately committed to the Labour Government&#151;when I told my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) that I was tabling the amendment, he said, &quot;Why are you doing so? You are part of the payroll vote even though you are not on the payroll&quot;&#151;that worries me intensely. I do not mean that as a slight to the Minister because she is not yet on the payroll vote, even though she will be voting for the Bill&#039;s passage through the House.

We have only reacted since 7&nbsp;July last year, because we discovered that some people who are trying to destroy the good race relations that we enjoy in this country do not come from Lebanon, have not been trained in Syria, and do not have Iranian connections. They were born and bred in Leeds. That is the challenge for us&#151;which body will take up that mantle and try to deal with that fundamental issue? Will it be the new commission for integration and citizenship? Will it be part of the Phillips review?

 Before I respond, may I commend my hon. Friend on his work on Britishness?

Nothing that we say takes away from the fact that a black or Asian person who was born in this country, or who, like me, has emigrated here, has a passion for being British. Nor does it take away from our support for the flag or our commitment to the things that are British. A definition of Britishness, besides including a cup of tea, as an article in <i>The Sun</i> said, should include chicken tikka masala and the music on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, which is very much dominated by black British musicians.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for generously accepting my interventions. He has spoken extremely eloquently. If he is not successful in persuading the Government to accept his amendment, does he agree that they should consider including in schedule 1, part of which deals with the appointment of commissioners, provisions to cover the recruitment of a commissioner who is specifically appointed to deal with race relations, of a commissioner specifically appointed to deal with disability rights and of commissioners to deal with other key areas, so at least someone can focus directly on those issues and thus make sure that there is a figurehead for those important campaigns.

 I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, and I accept that he is sincere. The fact is, however, we need proper representation in the Bill. The issue of portfolios is applicable now. The CRE has a number of commissioners, some of whom deal specifically with, for example, the Muslim community. The portfolio issue is a secondary consideration, but the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_97">I listened carefully to the speech by the hon. Member for Leicester, East. When I challenged him on one point, he answered another point, but I still disagree with him on the first point, which amendment No. 43&nbsp;addresses. Given that we are discussing equality, it is strange that the Bill gives pre-eminence to matters concerning race, religion or belief. We discussed that point at length in Committee, where I argued that it is illogical to include the word &quot;particular&quot; in clause 10(4), because it is not right that particular attention should be paid to one of the strands of equality. However, I will not press that point, because other issues are far more important and I do not feel strongly about it. When we made that point in Committee, the Minister gave a reasonable explanation why the word &quot;particular&quot; should remain. I accepted her argument then and, being consistent, I am sure that she will advance it again today, in which case I shall probably accept it once more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_98">The hon. Member for Leicester, East has made some important points. In Committee, I moved amendment No. 52, which suggested that the commission should consist of:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;(d) at least one female Commissioner,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_100">In Committee, my concern, which I still harbour, was that we should be prescriptive on Report, because law is better if it is not vague, but precise. My amendment in Committee, which is similar to the general points made by the hon. Member for Leicester, East this afternoon, would have allowed Parliament to prescribe some of the qualifications for some of the commissioners. It is important that at least one commissioner is female and that at least one commissioner can discuss issues around age from their own experience. I am not sure whether all hon. Members agree that &quot;aged over 65&nbsp;years&quot; is a qualification, and if others think that it should be 70, 75&nbsp;or even older, I would not argue, because the point is sensitive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_101">In principle, it is important that the commission has members who know about discrimination from their own experience rather than from a second-hand, academic or professional understanding. A reasonable proportion of the commissioners should have an understanding based on their own experience, which is different from an understanding derived from academic study or professional experience. I therefore agree with the general principles behind what the hon. Member for Leicester, East has said this afternoon.
</p>

 My amendment was slightly different from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman has suggested that his amendment is better, which is his prerogative. If I had wanted to press the matter to a vote, however, I would have tabled a different amendment. I do not support the letter of his amendment, but I support what he has said in principle. However, I suspect that the Minister will advance a legal argument to try to persuade the House that a provision in schedule 1&nbsp;already covers all those points. Nevertheless, it is important that we have it on record that this House feels strongly that the commission should be composed of people who understand the issues of discrimination against which we are legislating from their own personal experience.

Amendment No. 42, which stands in my name and those of my hon. Friends, relates to the way in which the new commission will be held accountable for the spending of taxpayers&#039; money. I brought that up many times on Second Reading and in Committee. The Minister and the hon.

<p>
<a name="60116-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_104">The cost of the new commission and the work that it undertakes will be very much greater than the cost of the three bodies that it replaces. I am very worried about that. Of course, I accept that as we are widening the scope of the work done by the existing three bodies, excellent as they are, the new operation will cost more than the current one. That is correct. However, there is a difference between more and an enormous amount more&#151;indeed, multiplied several times over.

 I am puzzled by the hon. Lady&#039;s view. She says that the figure has been multiplied many times. The budget for the new commission is &#163;70&nbsp;million whereas that for the existing commissions is &#163;48&nbsp;million. By anyone&#039;s calculation, the figure is not multiplied many times.

<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60116-19_spnew9"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 The Minister is right. The new commission will cost twice as much. We had that argument previously. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that 48&nbsp;times two does not equal 70, but if any hon.

If the Government estimate &#163;70&nbsp;million, the commission will cost more than that.

<p>
<a name="60116-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_105">The current &#163;48&nbsp;million is probably money well spent and I do not therefore argue for a cut in spending on such an important matter. My hon. Friends and I always argue for spending the smallest possible amount

<br>&nbsp;<br>of taxpayers&#039; money, yet if the Government plan to put three bodies under one administrative roof, there must be economies of scale and the current budget of &#163;48&nbsp;million should be reduced. Nevertheless, given that the new commission can rightly cover six strands of work instead of three, that budget will clearly increase. However, if one decreases and then increases a budget, one should not predict spending twice the amount of taxpayers&#039; money.

<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60116-19_spnew10"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 We are considering a new body that will cover six strands, but the difference between 48&nbsp;and 70&nbsp;is less than 50&nbsp;per cent. A 50&nbsp;per cent. increase would be 72. I understand the hon. Lady&#039;s position but, if she believes that &#163;70&nbsp;million is too much, how much would the Conservative party be prepared to pay to tackle discrimination?

<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60116-19_spnew11"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 At present, discrimination is tackled by &#163;48&nbsp;million a year and it is well done. I pay tribute to the three bodies that currently carry out the excellent work.

I fear that the new body will cost more than twice as much as the current bodies.

<a name="stpa_115">I have tabled amendments Nos. 23, 24&nbsp;and 20.

<br>&nbsp;<br>working for the existing organisations over the years. A number of members of staff have expressed their concern to the all-party trade union group representing the Public and Commercial Services Union, of which I am the chair. They are worried about continuity of service and the application of TUPE&#151;the Transfer of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_116">Amendment No. 23&nbsp;addresses the issue of continuity of service by ensuring that all the staff from the former commissions transferring across to the new commission will be deemed to have continuity of service for the purposes of the civil service compensation scheme. This means that if, for example, a member of staff were to be compensated for redundancy, their service on the existing organisation would be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_117">Many hon. Members will think that that would naturally be the case, but I have raised the issue because of the recent experience of staff at the Learning and Skills Council, which is implementing massive redundancies. Many of its staff had previously transferred from the training and enterprise councils, and they thought that that service would be regarded as part of the continuity of their employment. However, many of the staff who are facing redundancy have had their entitlement calculated only from the creation of the LSC. Their service with the TECs has not been taken into account, and their supposed continuity of service has not been recognised. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister could place on the record the assurance that, for the purpose of the civil service compensation scheme, all the staff transferring from the three existing commissions will be regarded as having continuity of service.
</p>








<p><a name="st_253"><a name="60116-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Boswell </b> 
: I have some sympathy with the point that the hon. Gentleman has made about the Learning and Skills Council. Does he agree that there is already an exemplary code of practice for the handling of transfers and redundancies in the public sector? Should it not, therefore, be a matter of general principle that that should apply to all such cases, rather than a particular one being exempt?
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60116-20_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 It is true that there is a code of practice&#151;it is helpful and it should be applied generally. It would be reassuring, however, if the Minister could put on the record that these particular members of staff will be protected. I say that because of the experience at the LSC, which undermined the morale of the large numbers of people who had transferred across from the TECs and who thought that they had some security.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_118">Amendment No. 24&nbsp;also deals with staffing. It would ensure that the TUPE regulations apply to all staff of the former commissions, whenever they transfer to the new commission. Again, I seek a statement on the record from the Minister to reassure the staff who are now being identified for transfer. The transfer from the existing commissions will be a staggered process. Most of the staff at the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Disability Rights Commission will transfer to the new body in 2007. However, staff at the Commission for Racial Equality will not transfer until 2009. As this is a piecemeal process, rather than a wholesale transfer of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_119">Furthermore, some members of staff are anxious that the TUPE regulations do not cover all matters and that they will not be fully protected.
</p>








<p><a name="st_255"><a name="60116-20_spnew3"><b> James Brokenshire  (Hornchurch) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point. Does he agree that for the new commission to be effective in its roles and responsibilities, it is important that there is continuity of staffing so that the knowledge and experience gained by the staff of the existing bodies is properly transferred to the new commission? The doubts that the hon. Gentleman is raising about TUPE and continuity of service might encourage existing staff to look for other opportunities, rather than transferring across.
</p>








<p><a name="st_256"><a name="60116-20_spnew4"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 I have no doubt that the staff who serve the existing commissions will seek to serve the new one with the same commitment and dedication that have made the existing ones so successful. The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, however. We need to reassure those members of staff who are transferring across that they are secure in their employment, and that they will have the opportunity to continue what for many of them is a vocation, as a result of the dedication that they have demonstrated over the years. The last thing that we should be doing is undermining their morale or their commitment to their work. I would therefore welcome an assurance on the record from the Minister that TUPE will apply at each stage of the transfers from the different bodies, no matter when they occur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_120">I mentioned that the TUPE regulations were not effective in guaranteeing full protection in regard to a whole range of issues. They allow flexibility for the employer, but they do not apply to fundamental issues such as pensions. I hope that the guidance that has been issued for past civil service transfers to new organisations&#151;and even to organisations outside the public sector&#151;on issues such as the protection of pensions and ensuring that alternative proposals are put to staff in full consultation to give them that protection, will apply in this instance as well, so that we can offer security to those members of staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_121">Amendment No. 20&nbsp;is about representation. The three existing commissions have secured representation from both sides of industry, including the trade union movement. There have been trade union nominations&#151;usually two per board&#151;to each of the existing organisations. The reason for that is that the bulk of the casework of those organisations has arisen as a result of discrimination in employment. It was therefore natural to ask the organisations with experience in employment relations&#151;both employers and trade unions&#151;to nominate people to sit on the commissions&#039; boards. It is interesting that the nominations from the trade unions have largely involved women and representatives of the black and ethnic minority groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_122">I am worried that there is no commitment in the Bill to seek trade union representation on the new body, and I ask the Minister to assure us&#151;in any form of words that she can give us this evening&#151;that at least some 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 613</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>direction will be given to the new body to consult and involve the trade unions and, if possible, seek nominations from them, and not just for commissioners. An alternative might be to ensure that there is adequate trade union representation on the advisory bodies that will be established to advise the commission on individual inquiries and on the overall direction of policy. In that way, we would achieve a representative body that would be effective in building on existing experience, which has largely been focused on issues relating to employment rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_123">We welcome the Bill, but it is on these points of detail that the new body will fail or succeed. I hope that the Minister will respond flexibly so that we can genuinely take into account the issues raised in this debate. In that way, we would demonstrate that the House of Commons has a value, even at this late stage of the Bill, in ensuring that the legislation will be effective.

: I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz). I have not changed my view on these issues since Second Reading, although I have become far more aware of the strength of feeling on them in the black and ethnic minority community. I want slightly to hold the hon. Gentleman to account for his accusation that we do not take equality issues seriously. I think that it was Lord Lester, in another place, who made a serious attempt to introduce a single equalities Act, and I believe that we had a debate on equal opportunities in 2000.

<p><a name="st_258"><a name="60116-21_spnew1"><b> Keith Vaz: </b>

 I have no quarrel with that argument and I am sympathetic to the intent of the amendments.

<p>
<a name="60116-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_124">In some respects, the key question that needs to be considered is whether one has to have experienced an issue in order to be able first, to understand it, and secondly, to deal with it. I am not sure that I have the answers, but to return to an issue outside the equality agenda, one of the most emotional and sometimes traumatic experiences through which a woman can go is giving birth. A lot of evidence shows that having an understanding midwife will make a big difference to that experience. The key question is whether the midwife has to have given birth in order to understand the experience fully. That might seem an odd parallel, but some would argue that experiencing birth oneself is very important, while others would say that training, empathy and so on can overcome such problems.

<p>
<a name="60116-21_para2">

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 614</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>listening to the hon. Member for Leicester, East, it is clear that there will be wider implications if we do not take seriously the discontent in the black and ethnic minority communities. I would react with absolute horror to a commission that was made up of 10&nbsp;white men, but I do not think that that will happen. I wonder whether for once we should trust those concerned to get on with it rather than prescribing it in the Bill. I do not know the answer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">The hon. Member for Leicester, East also lauded the Commission for Racial Equality, saying that it was the one place where black and ethnic minority communities could go if they had a problem. Is that really the case? Although the issue was mentioned when I had briefings with the CRE, it did not seem the most important thing on the agenda of those to whom I spoke. It was only after the Bill&#039;s Second Reading that other representative bodies of black and ethnic minority communities came forward and it became obvious that there was a huge amount of discontent. Why did the CRE not make that feeling known at the very beginning? Would a single equalities commission, with a range of people with experience of different discriminations, and with a strong responsibility to consult, be a better way forward?
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="60116-21_spnew3"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 The hon. Lady mentioned that she wishes to trust the new body on the issue of representation, but why should we? We are parliamentarians, and there is a common agenda. To borrow the words of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), if we want to be clear why cannot we be clear here, rather than leaving it to another body to make the decision for us? If we do not legislate clearly, and if we leave wooliness and vagueness, of course people will take advantage of that. Why are the Liberal Democrats not prepared to support the amendments?

<a name="60116-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">Were we to go down a quota route for the different strands of discrimination, we would be faced with some real problems. Gender is potentially the biggest source of discrimination in society, but I would not necessarily insist on a 50&nbsp;per cent. gender representation. Racial discrimination might be one of the more acute problems in society, but we run the risk of having a committee&#151;I hesitate to use the word &quot;tokenistic&quot;&#151;whose members are chosen because of what they are rather than because of what they can do and how they can progress the agenda.

 We have no particular problems with that, but that is the whole difficulty. Ideally, I would prefer there not to be different provisions for different strands of inequality.

 Does the hon. Lady accept that the first qualification for being a

<br>&nbsp;<br>commissioner is a general understanding of the power processes in society, which could be satisfied by any member? There is also a need for knowledge of and interest in particular issues such as disability, for knowledge of issues from the perspective of a commissioner from Wales or Scotland, and for a guarantee that there will be commissioners who have direct experience of the application of racism, for which Labour Members are arguing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_265"><a name="60116-21_spnew8"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 The issue of direct experience is fraught with problems, particularly in relation to disability. As has been mentioned, someone who uses a wheelchair has a different perspective on life from someone who has visual impairment or a hearing problem. Do we need to have people with direct experience of and an interest in a particular issue&#151;we must not lose sight of the human rights aspect&#151;and how relevant is it to be pigeonholed in such a way? I am not entirely convinced that that is necessary if other provisions are in place to make sure that the necessary groups are consulted adequately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">One of the other problems, which one of the amendments attempts to address, is that black and ethnic minority communities undoubtedly experience discrimination, as do women. All the evidence shows that a black ethnic minority woman will experience more and enhanced discrimination. There is a case for considering some of the wider causes of discrimination in a more holistic way, rather than trying to tackle each separate strand. That is why I welcome the human rights-based approach.

 I will pose to the hon. Lady the question that I attempted to pose to the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), although I am not sure that she quite understood it. Schedule 1, in part 5, contains provisions for a disability committee. The wording of that part of schedule 1&nbsp;is on all-fours with amendment No. 9. Does the hon. Lady support the inclusion of a disability committee provision in the legislation, and if so, can she say that she supports amendment No. 9? If she does not support the inclusion of such a provision in schedule 1, why, if she wants to consider matters holistically, has she not tabled an amendment to remove it?

If the Minister can reassure us on that point, there may for once be a case for saying let us trust the group and allow it to go ahead.

It is acceptable because this House apparently, and quite rightly, is going to accept that at least one disabled person should serve as a commissioner. I do not understand why the Government have said that, as a matter of principle, there should be representation for disabled people on the commission but that that should not apply to women or members of black or other ethnic minority groups. That is why the amendment proposes that no fewer than half the commissioners should be women and that no fewer than one quarter should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds. That is the same aim as that of amendment No. 10, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East.

<a name="stpa_140">Other Members referred to the third Government argument, which is that to appoint commissioners in such a way would reflect silo thinking. I understand the point and entirely oppose silo thinking in the commission&#039;s work. When the commission was proposed, I supported the idea of a single commission for equality and human rights, precisely because I oppose silo thinking. There were those in the disability movement, as in other equality strands, who had grave reservations about that idea. I had practical reservations about the manner in which the commission might be set up but, in principle, I have always supported a single commission, precisely because I oppose the silo mentality.

People could be discriminated against on the grounds of race and gender, race and disability, disability and orientation, or goodness knows however many different circumstances. It is right to have a single commission to provide a service to people who allege discrimination; that is the only idea that makes sense. People being referred from one commission to another would not promote equality or human rights.

Having commissioners who are disabled, or who have experienced discrimination as women or on the ground of race, would strengthen the commission, not weaken it.

Notwithstanding the question of consistency, it makes very good sense to create such a committee.

<p><a name="st_278"><a name="60116-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 It is a genuine pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry), who has considerable expertise in the field of disability and with whom, through my own involvement in that area, I have collaborated constructively in the past. He made some trenchant points about not thinking within a silo mentality. From my own experience, I came at the issue with an interest in disability and found myself driven by the fact of discrimination to take a lively interest, too, in issues of gender equality and race equality. In the end, they become indivisible, which is the compelling case for having a single commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_155">I like, as it were, to play mental games when anticipating ministerial arguments, and I have been trying hard to do so on why there should be any justification for the special treatment of disability in the Bill. One could say it is because Bert Massey and the Disability Rights Commission were not very happy about it, and that is certainly true. That may well be reflected in the Bill, but in trying to produce acceptable and defensible arguments for the Minister&#151;I offer them to her for nothing&#151;there seem to me to be two.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_156">First, the Disability Rights Commission is relatively new in comparison with the other equality bodies. Secondly, the nature of the discrimination concerned is, as it were, more by analogue than by digital: whereas one is either a racist or one is not, and one is either a feminist or one is not, the test in relation to disability is whether reasonable adjustments are being made, which is a much more opaque area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_157">Having said which, I have absolutely convinced myself that those arguments are implausible. To return to the beginning of the Report stage, it seems that the Government have already conceded the primary point, as they did on the first group of amendments about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difference between sexual orientation and transgendered people. Having provided to legislate for one group, it seemed difficult to many of us not to legislate for the second. Having provided to legislate for disability, it equally seems difficult not to argue the case for legislating on race. I was particularly attracted by amendment No. 16, at least in that it provides an instruction to Ministers on good practice, which they should adopt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_158">As the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) developed his case with his characteristic charm and eloquence, I found myself increasingly warming towards it. As I went through the nature of the argument in the same way that I did on the amendment spoken to by the hon. Member for Kingswood, I anticipated all the ministerial problems. I am sure that the Minister has a great big brief in front of her&#151;I speak from experience&#151;that bears the six-letter word &quot;resist&quot;. It will say that first, we need flexibility, and, secondly, it would be insulting to type people by their particular cases. How can we know that people are not multifunctional in two or three areas of disability? Why should we seem to single out one group when we cannot, for example, appoint a transgendered person because we would run out of places on any reasonably sized commission? Would that not send the wrong signals? And Ministers have the right intentions anyway. I think that the Minister has to show the House tonight that the Government do have the right intention, which is to produce a multifunctional and effective commission that is seen to represent the interests engaged in this important area.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 622</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_159">The one point on which I perhaps did not quite agree with the hon. Member for Leicester, East&#151;I think I did not; it may have been misinterpretable&#151;was his remark that there are good race relations in this country. I think that that is the case, but we have an obligation to maintain perpetual vigilance, at which I see him nodding. One does not have to agree with every last word that Trevor Phillips said in his rather controversial speech at least to be aware that things can go wrong. Indeed, in other countries with rather less of a multiculturalist tradition than ours&#151;France, in particular&#151;they have gone wrong. We should be conscious that at the very moment when we think things are all right, they may be formally so but that does not necessarily mean that there is deep engagement. That will take more than one generation to achieve and will vary very much with levels of education and experience in particular areas. I am conscious of what one of my colleagues once described as the kind of polite apartheid that can apply in some cities: different ethnic groups may stand off without actually falling out with one another but find little affinity or involvement. That is not a happy position, although those are perhaps wider issues that we cannot develop in full tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_160">Implicit in what the hon. Member for Leicester, East said was the idea that the Bill is all about something real&#151;a significant economic imbalance. If one considers the proportion of people from ethnic minorities who are unemployed, the rates of pay that those in work receive and the general economic position, the figures are still depressingly unpositive. There is a problem and we cannot fail to start by acknowledging that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_161">If that is the economic side, the other side is representation or stakeholder involvement, which is what the amendment and the debate are about. If people do not feel that they have a stake in this country and that their interests are being taken seriously and represented, we should be ashamed of ourselves in this place, but whether we are or are not, we are building up problems for the future. We have to involve all our people, and I did not need the recent change in the leadership of my party to reinforce my views in support of that. If one is a one-nation politician of any party, one is about bringing people together and recognising that they have views, aspirations, fears and experiences that need to be taken extremely seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_162">In relating all that to the substance of the debate, it seemed to me that I should like three sets of assurances from the Minister. The first is on the wider work of the Commission for Racial Equality. It would be useful if she could put on the record how some of the other functions&#151;what I might call the positive functions&#151;of the CRE are to be discharged, particularly its work on local racial integration. Many of us feel strongly that that should continue and be safeguarded, and is&#151;in a sense, although I do not wish to give a hierarchy&#151;more important than the mere legal enforcement of equality. Both are extremely important, but the positive approach, which says, &quot;Let&#039;s encourage good practice and good race relations&quot;, is an important part. Some of that activity may transfer to the new commission, but it would be useful if the Minister could confirm that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_163">The second issue is economic imbalance and I hope that Trevor Phillips&#039;s commission will carry out some studies on that. My party will not prescribe a magic

<br>&nbsp;<br>solution that would somehow produce economic equality overnight, but no one should be comfortable unless we are working towards that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_164">The third issue is the institutional and operational matters that are under debate in the Bill. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) was right to mention staff issues because, in my sad experience, they are not always well handled by Governments, of whichever party, in legislation. The issue of participation is central and whether we have a separate race committee or another structure&#151;the Minister may come up with a good argument on that&#151;the institution will not work unless people feel comfortable with it and that it has some relevance to them.

<a name="60116-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_165">The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) mentioned India, and I should point out that Lord Irwin, as he then was, was rather a rather liberal&#151;if it is not derogatory to use the word these days&#151;Viceroy, but he was wrestling with a commission that was a non-starter because it was all Brits and no Indians. That does not work, because any structure needs to be acceptable to the various communities involved.

Does a midwife have to have given birth to be a suitable person to deliver a baby? What we are talking about here is not a one-off function: it is an ongoing advocacy and representational role, and that is the important point that we have to bear in mind.

 I agree, and had I wished to indulge myself earlier I would have taken up the hon. Lady on a related point to her analogy of the midwife. At least part of the case that she made is that a midwife, whether or not she has given birth, should be experienced and knowledgeable about people giving birth and, by definition, sympathetic to them. A midwife should not be multifunctional and also act as a physiotherapist, occupational therapist or speech therapist in her spare time. Therefore, we need people on the commission who are heavyweights, who understand what is involved and who can engage with and win the confidence of the minority communities, minority interests and others who might be discriminated against.

Nor was it because in an ideal world it would not matter what colour MPs were. The idea was that representation mattered because of what it said about an institution.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government level: lowest common denominator equality, which is no good for anyone, although it provides a laugh for some people who are hostile to the whole notion of equalities in principle. Lowest common denominator equality sells every equality strand short. Sadly, it is my experience that if race is merged with other equalities issues, without sufficient thought and care about the structures, race inevitably falls to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottom of the agenda. That is why, when the Government set up a working party to look into the matter, out of 28&nbsp;people there were only three visible minorities. When we say that we want not just assurances but legislation and structures, we are not looking in the crystal ball, we are reading the book.

<a name="stpa_174">It astonishes me that two years after my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East and I took a group of concerned parliamentarians to see Ministers, the Government have not moved on the issue. As I said earlier, I am arguing not for a hierarchy of equalities, but that, based on my experience of working on equality for 30 years&#151;not just as an MP, but in my trade union and my community&#151;all the equality strands have a distinct character. On employment, for example, the problem for most white women is how to get through the glass ceiling: the problem for most black people is how to get through the door. Of course, the commission must broker a collective view at the end of the day, but unless there are people on it who understand the distinctions between the challenges faced by disabled persons, by people whose problem is their colour or by women, we shall end up with lowest common denominator solutions that pay lip service to, but do not address, the difficult issues.

<p>
<a name="60116-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_175">Many issues concerned with race are difficult. This society still finds it difficult to face many of the realities about race. When I started raising the issue of the underachievement of black boys, white people asked me whether it was not a little embarrassing to talk about that. I was not afraid to talk about it, because the issue is real and it needs to be addressed. However, if we have a commission with no structures and without the right legislation, the temptation will be to duck the difficult issues; there will be lowest common denominator equalities.

<a name="60116-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_176">Ministers talk about empathy and hoping. No individual in the black community is more committed to institutions, to the state and to making things work through the political process than I am, but there are persons out there in our communities who are really not that interested in middle-class white men empathising with their situation; they want representation and stakeholder involvement. We have heard about Lord Halifax and the end of the Indian empire, but I have to tell the House that the days of white men empathising with the situation of other people have long been left behind. I do not say that because we are not all people and because everybody cannot represent everybody else, but because institutions are more than the sum of their parts. They are about what they say&#151;the message they give to a society. So when Ministers tell me that they hope that the commission will not be all white men, what do they mean? They are Ministers. If they want to ensure that the commission has proper representation, the remedy is in their hands. They can put those matters on the face of the Bill.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;The Equality Bill does not recognise the unique devolution arrangements in London. The Bill should establish a London Committee, in line with the decision-making committees proposed for Scotland and Wales.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_184">Just as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood has said, if this is okay in relation to a disability commissioner, if it is okay to have a race commissioner and a race committee and if that is all right for Scotland and Wales, it should be all right for London as well. London has more extensive discrimination problems, but also more positive experiences than the other regions on how to bring about solutions to the problems that we face in the discrimination streams. There is a big case for the London committee. That London context provides unique lessons, opportunities and challenges with regard to equality and diversity. London is one of the most diverse cities in the world and is certainly unique in the UK context.

 My hon. Friend made the point that we will be losing the race equality councils and the local connection.

There are also more ethnic minority businesses in the capital&#151;a greater concentration of them.

 I understand the argument of London versus the regions, but many of us in London have supported measures to tackle unemployment by the devolution of decision making and administrative units to the regions. However, any such moves must take account of the impact that they have on human beings. We have many staff in the existing organisations and 60&nbsp;per cent. of the CRE&#039;s staff are from ethnic minority groups, 40&nbsp;per cent. of the DRC&#039;s staff are disabled and 80&nbsp;per cent. of the EOC&#039;s staff are women. Many of those groups also have caring responsibilities, with their roots in London.

Lady first said that the costs would be many times more than current costs, and then that they would be twice as great. When she was told about the Government&#039;s estimates, she understandably said that she was sure that the overall bill for the six strands covered by the Bill would be more than twice the &#163;48&nbsp;million that the current three strands cost, or more than &#163;96&nbsp;million. Leaving aside for a minute the start-up costs&#151;there are start-up costs for a new organisation&#151;relocation costs and so on, I will wager her &#163;100, payable to a charity, that the costs in the first year will not exceed &#163;96&nbsp;million.

 I did answer the question.

Friends had tabled an amendment to remove the provisions in schedule 1&nbsp;on the disability committee. She responded that I was urging her to do something that she had not the power to do, but that she hoped to be in ministerial office soon&#151;I thought that that was rather optimistic of her. Forgive me if I misunderstand the procedures of the House after nearly five years here, but I thought that any hon. Member could table an amendment on Report. The hon.

That is not to say that the other four strands are unimportant, I hasten to add, but disability is mentioned at least twice in the Bill&#151;in relation to a commissioner with a disability and a disability committee. In race, we are dealing with an incredibly important strand to me, the Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton, South-West, which was previously represented by that notorious racist Powell. Such matters are extremely important in my constituency. There is a contradiction in relation to a race committee and I beg the Minister to explain that contradiction. If she does not, amendment No. 9&nbsp;and those that flow from it will be extremely attractive to me.

<a name="stpa_208">Hon.

Many of us are familiar with their work and the important role that they play in our constituencies, particularly among those who have experienced discrimination or unfair treatment because of their race or religion. I met recently with the chair of the British Federation of Race Equality Councils; the federation is concerned to ensure that the councils&#039; work is able to continue and I look forward to continuing our discussions to ensure that that is the case.

We are working closely with employee representatives and senior management of the existing commissions to develop the most effective way forward in that and related matters. We have established a union forum to act as a consultative mechanism on the commission for equality and human rights between the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commissions and recognised trade unions, with Government participation.

<a name="60116-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_212">The provisions of clause 39(5) will, in effect, safeguard the existing terms and conditions of those staff who transfer into the new commission and ensure that their period of employment continues with the new commission without being counted as a break in service for either employment or pension rights. I hope that that answers my hon. Friend&#039;s specific question. TUPE applies to all contractual terms and conditions and includes an existing right to a redundancy payment. In addition to that statutory protection, it is Government policy to ensure that staff who transfer from one public sector organisation to another are no worse off as a result of that transfer.

Black and minority ethnic groups have lobbied strongly for a race committee to be set out in the Bill and for there to be a designated race commissioner, as that would guarantee for them that their concerns would be considered by the new body. However, had that been placed in the Bill, other strands would also have sought to have a committee to represent their interests and we would be setting up a federated structure&#151;an approach that we had specifically rejected for good reasons and that would go against the overwhelming consensus for an integrated approach.

It is part of the Government&#039;s programme to develop the equality debate and to look at what we need to do in the 21st century. The review chaired by Trevor Phillips will therefore have a significant influence on the commission&#039;s work programme.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. We want to set up a body that is independent of Government. Indeed, there was a great deal of debate in the other place about the extent of its independence. Part of the commission&#039;s role is to comment on what the Government are doing, so we need to limit Government interference. A number of amendments were tabled to make the commission more independent.

<p><a name="st_334"><a name="60116-29_spnew6"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 Following the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), the Minister has moved forward and has used the word &quot;impossible&quot;. She believes that it is impossible, once the new body has been set up, to fail to establish committees. In response to my hon. Friend&#039;s question, she talked about Government intervention, so if the commission does not set up committees will she introduce legislation to make sure that its structure reflects the united views of the House? The hon. Members for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) and for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) both support the principle of the amendments, but they will leave the practicalities to the new body. If the commission does not deal with such matters itself, will she take action to make sure that it does?
</p>








<p><a name="st_335"><a name="60116-29_spnew7"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 Powers are available to the commission to do so, and I have made my expectations clear. It is therefore not wise to move straight on to talk about new legislation or intervention.

<a name="stpa_229">The Government are committed to ensuring that race equality concerns will be central to the commission&#039;s work. We have considered the issue carefully and provided a number of measures in the Bill to ensure that that is the case. We have given the commission new powers to address hate crimes and prejudice against groups in society. We have given it new powers to assess and enforce compliance with the public sector race duty. We have made a commitment to the continued funding of race equality councils and of others involved in local race equality work to ensure that those important initiatives continue to flourish. I will follow up recent discussions with the British Federation of Race Equality Councils to ensure that that is the case. Representatives told me they were reassured by our plans. They are doing important work and have made a commitment to work with us as we move towards the establishment of the commission for equality and human rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_230">We should not forget that the commission, because of its cross-cutting remit, is better able to address the concerns of all black and minority ethnic groups in our society&#151;young people, children, women, lesbians, gay men, disabled people and older people. Children have not been raised specifically today, but they are one of hon. Members&#039; concerns. Children are people and they have human rights, just like everyone else. The commission will play a key role in promoting understanding and respect for children&#039;s human rights. I have every confidence that the new commission will be able to do as much, if not more than our existing arrangements. The commission will not be tackling equality in an ethereal way&#151;it will respond to the different and specific needs of various groups of people. We believe in equality but, as has been said, equality is not about treating everyone the same, but about responding to their specific concerns. I hope that what I have said will give assurance and confidence to hon. Members who are concerned about these issues, although I accept that words are not always enough.

I have met and spoken to many people, some of whom believe strongly that the measures that my hon. Friends have proposed should be included the Bill. I am nevertheless grateful that they have committed themselves to continue this work and that they have reiterated their support for the overall vision of the new commission. I am personally committed, together with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), immediately to initiate a work stream that will directly involve members of the black and minority ethnic communities and others. That will explore how, for example, the race equality and good relations functions of the new commission could be framed, including its important focus on race and faith communities. The work, which we have asked our officials to begin scoping, will consider how the new commission can engage communities in identifying the strategic priorities for its work on race equality, and how its governance and committee structures can be configured to deliver that. The recent discussions with the British Federation of Race Equality Councils, to which I have referred, are a good starting point.

<p><a name="st_360"><a name="60116-30_spnew14"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 Amendment No. 11, like most of this group, is minor and technical. It corrects an anomaly in referencing in the Bill. Our intention is to oblige the commission for equality and human rights to inform the recipient of an unlawful act notice of the effect of the commission&#039;s clause 24&nbsp;power, which enables it to apply to a court for an injunction in England and Wales or an interdict in Scotland to prevent discrimination. As drafted, the commission&#039;s obligation is restricted to informing the recipient of an unlawful act notice of its power to apply for an injunction in England and Wales, but not Scotland. That is not our intention. Amendment No. 11&nbsp;therefore extends the obligation on the commission to include a reference to its power to apply for an interdict in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_237">The motion to transfer clause 28&nbsp;is also a minor and technical matter. It does not alter the content or effect of the clause but moves it to the end of part 1. Clause 28&nbsp;gives powers to the Disability Rights Commission for matters concerning rented accommodation in Scotland in the period before the new commission is operational. It is therefore more appropriate for it to be located at the end of part 1&nbsp;under the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; heading than with clauses that confer enforcement powers on the commission for equality and human rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_238">More important, in its current position, the commencement of the clause would, because of clause 42, end the transitional period that precedes the new commission taking on its powers in October 2007. Unlike the other clauses, the commencement of which ends the transition period, clause 28&nbsp;does not confer any powers or duties on the CEHR.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_239">The substance of the Disability Rights Commission&#039;s equivalent powers for rented accommodation in England and Wales, which were conferred by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, will come into force on 4&nbsp;December 2006. As explained in Committee when the amendments were tabled, we are working closely with the Scottish Executive to ensure that the DRC&#039;s powers in relation to Scotland come into effect on the same day as in England and Wales. The transition strategy for the commission has been planned to allow time to ensure that the most suitable candidates are appointed to the board. Ending the transitional period prematurely by leaving the clause in its current location would seriously jeopardise an effective transition. It is therefore necessary for the clause to be moved as proposed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_240">Amendment No. 12&nbsp;is also a minor technical amendment, which, I hope is self-explanatory. It simply corrects the grammar of clause 46(3)(b). It makes no change to the effect of that paragraph.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_241">Amendment No. 15&nbsp;is a more substantive amendment, responding to concerns raised earlier as well as in the fourth report of the Joint Committee on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 647</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Human Rights. In Committee, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) tabled amendments to modify the exemption for schools of a religious character from the discrimination provisions. I promised to consider his arguments, which appeared to have some substance, and the amendment is the result. The Government are committed to maintaining the status quo as far as the right of faith schools to operate as such is concerned, and that necessarily means that they must be free to discriminate on the ground of religion to the extent necessary to make that a reality. In view of that need, faith schools are currently exempted entirely from the provisions specific to educational establishments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_242">We remain convinced that faith schools must be exempt on admissions and on provision to pupils of access to any benefits, facilities or services. In common with other schools, they are also exempt regarding the curriculum and acts of worship or religious observance organised by or on behalf of the school. However, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon argued that making it lawful for faith schools to exclude a pupil or subject a pupil to any other detriment on the ground of religion or belief goes beyond what is needed to protect their position. We have given the matter much consideration since Committee and officials have been in discussion with the Anglican and Catholic Churches.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_243">Exclusion from school is a serious matter that neither the Government nor schools take lightly. Existing guidance for schools sets out that a pupil&#039;s behaviour must be the only factor to consider in matters of exclusion. It therefore would not be right for faith schools to exclude an existing pupil purely on the ground of religion or belief. I do not believe they would wish to do that but it would be wrong to give the impression in the Bill that the Government are in two minds about the matter. We therefore propose to remove that exclusion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_244">Detriment is a wide concept that is loosely defined in law. We have been trying to identify any actions that constitute direct or indirect discrimination, falling within that term, that faith schools would wish to take, that they would be justified in taking and that would not be adequately protected by other exceptions to the measure. So far, we have drawn a blank.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_245">On the other hand, it is possible to think of unreasonable and unjustifiable actions&#151;and, let me say, highly unlikely ones&#151;that the exception might appear to allow. Hence our conclusion that we should also remove that exception. It is unnecessary and risks giving the wrong impression. Let me make it clear that nothing about the amendment is intended to suggest that we believe that faith schools are likely in practice to discriminate against children of other faiths or of none. In the absence until now of legislation on such matters, I am not aware of any evidence to the contrary. The amendment simply recognises that exceptions to discrimination law must be tightly drawn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_246">During the passage of the Bill, the education exemptions, especially those regarding faith schools, have been the subject of much consideration and debate, not to mention a raft of amendments. That has demonstrated the depth of feeling, the importance and necessity of exemptions and the need to strike the right

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 648</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>balance between the protection of pupils and the needs of schools. We have listened to and carefully considered views from both sides of the debate and believe that we have now struck the right balance. However, the Bill contains regulatory powers to alter, add or remove any education exemptions. We believe that those powers are crucial, since if, in practice, there is evidence that the exemptions for schools are not working as we intend, the necessary changes can be made, following full consultation with all key stakeholders.

<p><a name="st_375"><a name="60116-31_spnew6"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 I should like to speak to amendments Nos. 21&nbsp;and 22, which deal with legal assistance and casework. Amendment No. 21&nbsp;deals with legal assistance. At present, the Bill states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;The Commission may assist an individual who is or may become party to legal proceedings if&#151;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_249">It then lists various caveats in regard to that. My amendment would change the wording to provide that the commission


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;shall consider any application for assistance from an individual and provide assistance if&#151;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_250">I take the view that it would be wrong and short-sighted for the new commission not to have a duty at least to consider all applications for legal assistance that come before it. The existing commissions have that duty, and its omission in regard to the new body amounts to a breach of the no regression principle established by the Government. There is no requirement to provide legal representation in all cases; it is a discretionary power that is exercised in a limited number of strategically important cases. This is a fundamental principle of access to justice and its omission from the Bill effectively removes the right of a victim of discrimination to apply for assistance and to be assured that their application will be considered by the new body.

<a name="60116-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_251">In amendment No. 22, I want to insert casework into the operation of the new body because casework has been an important part of the role of the existing bodies, and yet at least one of them, at the end of last year, abolished its casework unit, citing the fact that it did not expect casework to continue under the new body.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_252">People can receive three different types of support from the existing commissions: legal support, which means full legal support and financial assistance; casework, which is largely a hand-holding exercise providing support and advice to people in vulnerable situations to develop their case; and information in the form of paper briefings. A commitment is needed that casework will continue under the new body. It is feared that a few will be offered legal support in high-profile cases while the rest simply receive a briefing pack after having phoned an outsourced call centre helpline.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_253">The existing staff of all the bodies and, I believe, the existing commissioners value casework highly. It is the majority of their work and leads to many small wins&#151;not the high-profile cases with legal support that receive the most publicity&#151;that have a real effect on people&#039;s lives. People will be better represented if the casework continues, and I seek the Minister&#039;s assurance that it will be an element of the continuing work under the new body.

<p><a name="st_376"><a name="60116-31_spnew7"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for tabling his amendments. As hon. Members might be aware, the other place had an extensive debate on the issues raised, but I am pleased to make the case here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_254">On amendment No. 21, we have said consistently throughout consideration of this Bill that it is not our intention that the new commission will provide legal assistance for every meritorious case. It will simply not have the resources to do so, any more than the current commissions can support every case, as they do not have the necessary resources that that would entail. We have said consistently that it is our intention that the new commission will use its enforcement powers in an effective and strategic way. That applies equally to its power to assist individuals in bringing proceedings before a court or tribunal. We cannot see the case for placing an express obligation on the commission to consider every application. In practice, it will need to consider all applications if it is to identify which, if any, it wishes to support. As a public body, the commission has an implicit obligation not to act unreasonably, and could be challenged if it ignored applications that it received.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_255">Amendment No. 22&nbsp;seeks to add casework to the list of legal assistance that the commission can provide alongside what is already listed&#151;legal advice, legal representation, facilities for the settlement of a dispute and any other form of assistance. Our view is that that amendment is also unnecessary, as the commission for equality and human rights will be able to provide casework advice under the powers contained in clauses 13&nbsp;and 29. Clause 13&nbsp;will allow the commission to provide general advice and guidance on matters that are not the subject of legal proceedings. Where legal proceedings are envisaged, casework advice is included within the reference to legal advice and representation in clause 29. Specifying casework separately would cast 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 651</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>doubt on whether the references to advice and guidance and legal advice and representation cover casework and imply that it is something different, which it is not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_256">Amendment No. 44&nbsp;would permit the commission to meet the costs of the other party in the event that an individual that it was supporting lost the case before a court or tribunal. At this stage, I should make it clear that the commission may meet any costs awarded by a court or tribunal against an individual that it was supporting. This is the case with the current commissions and will be so for the new commission. However, the amendment seeks to go further than securing that position. It would create a power for the new commission to meet the costs of the other party even where no costs had been awarded by the court or tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_257">Hon. Members will doubtless be aware of the concern expressed in the other place about small firms and charities being treated unfairly or oppressively when the commission uses its enforcement powers. There was extensive debate in the other place on that matter and I am grateful for the opportunity to set out our thinking on how the new commission will engage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_258">First, we do not have to fear unreasonable or oppressive action by the commission. The commission will work primarily through promoting good practice, helping bodies comply with the law and fostering constructive links with a wide range of bodies, including small businesses and charities. The commission will need to be sensitive to the concerns of its stakeholders. If it fails to do so, it will lose authority and public support. It will, of course, need to consult on its strategic plan, which will include its legal and regulatory strategy. I hope that that alone should provide reassurance against the commission taking an arbitrary or unreasonable approach. However, I recognise that it is possible that a small organisation could find itself defending an action brought with the commission&#039;s support, but there are checks and balances that ensure that a body in this situation is not disadvantaged. Most legal proceedings on discrimination are brought in employment tribunals. Employment tribunals are specifically designed to have straightforward procedures that make formal representation unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_259">I am not persuaded that we should give the commission the power to meet the costs of the other side in such circumstances. The commission will use its power to support individual litigants in proceedings that it believes will have a strategic effect. It would be inappropriate for the commission to then meet the costs of the other party. I do recognise the concerns, but there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill to prevent this situation from occurring.

<br>









<p><a name="st_382">The amendment is about legal matters in Scotland. I am not a lawyer and I am not Scottish, so I shall speak briefly and hope that the Minister can let me know whether there is a concern. I will probably find myself forced to accept what she says.</p>













<p><a name="st_383">The powers in the clause were amended in the House of Lords following an amendment tabled in Committee by my noble friend Lord Lester. This was responded to by the Government at a later stage by effectively disapplying parts of section 7&nbsp;of the Human Rights Act. However, it is not clear that the provision would allow a Scottish commissioner to have the same powers without this change in statute in UK law.</p>













<p><a name="st_384">Elsewhere in the Bill, we have made provision for the Scottish Parliament, if it decides to have a human rights commissioner, to have similar powers. Therefore, I seek to probe whether there has been an omission in the drafting. I fear that the amendment may not be quite right, which I regret, but I would be grateful if the Minister explained whether the change was necessary or whether we would need further primary legislation if the Scottish Parliament chose to go down this path, the idea being that we should not stop it doing so.</p>











<p><a name="st_385"><a name="60116-32_spnew2"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 The legal effect of this amendment is highly ambiguous and for that reason alone the Government must oppose it. In particular, the reference to clause 31(1) does not work. If the purpose is to override the victim test in section 7&nbsp;of the Human Rights Act, we do not think the amendment is clear enough to achieve it. However, it is clear that the amendment is intended to deal with a matter&#151;namely, the powers of a person established by Act of the Scottish Parliament&#151;that falls within the area of devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament. It is therefore not a matter on which this House can properly legislate without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_260">If and when a Scottish commissioner for human rights is established by Act of the Scottish Parliament, it will be possible to consider whether any further provisions need to be made in relation to reserved legislation to give the commissioner the powers that he or she needs to carry out their duties. If so, the appropriate way to deliver the objective would be by way of an order under section 104&nbsp;of the Scotland Act 1998. Such an order would be taken forward by agreement between the Government and the Scottish Executive, and would be subject to scrutiny here in Parliament.

We will issue a Green Paper on the review&#039;s findings before the summer, which will ensure that we can also give full consideration to emerging findings from Trevor Phillips&#039;s review into the fundamental causes of inequality.

<a name="60116-33_para9">

 For once, I can say yes to the Secretary of State. He hopes that we will all support the Bill. He commends it to the House, and so do I. We have supported it from the beginning, and indeed since before the general election. I support it because its main cause is freedom&#151;the freedom of every individual in our society to live their life as they choose or, indeed, as they have to, for it is not always a matter of choice, regardless of their circumstances, whatever they may be.

<a name="stpa_275">Throughout the Bill&#039;s passage, we have spoken about the six strands of equality. It is not, in fact, about just six strands. The principle of the Bill is an integrated approach against discrimination for any reason, and not just for the six strands we refer to technically. It is therefore essential that the new commission should command confidence. I hope that the cross-party support that the Bill has received this evening and throughout its passage will give the project a good start. I look forward to the outcome of the equality review, to which the Secretary of State referred, and to our taking the whole matter of achieving further equality another step forward at some time in future.

Those bodies include statutory bodies, pressure groups and charities, which have contributed over a long period to our debates. Their knowledge and experience have been brought to bear on the Bill through Members of this House and of the other place and that is why we have had such constructive and informed debates. I hope that everyone who has urged the introduction of this legislation will feel that an enormous step forward has been taken when we give this Bill its Third Reading this evening.

Secondly, I am concerned about extra burdens on small businesses, which must not be allowed, because that would undermine employment and the economy. Thirdly, I am also concerned about the risk of excessive and dogmatic adherence to political correctness. It has not happened during the passage of the Bill and I hope that it does not happen when the Bill becomes law. Fourthly, I remain, of course, concerned about costs.

 I welcome the principle of a unified commission and I congratulate Ministers on introducing this important legislation. I also wish to congratulate those groups in the black and minority ethnic communities&#151;Operation Black Vote, the 1990&nbsp;Trust and the race advisers to the Mayor of London&#151;who have worked so hard to put race on the agenda in the context of these debates.

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 658</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>However, I remain concerned about the position of issues of race in the new commission, the finances available for work on race in the new commission, the law enforcement work of the new commission and, perhaps above all, the support that will be available for local race equality councils. As I said on Report, some of the most valuable work funded by the CRE was carried out by local and regional equalities committees.

We have listened carefully to what Ministers said about race and we shall follow how things unfold as we build the new commission, but it would be a mistake for Ministers to believe that the debate about race and the commission is over: for my hon.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) wanted to be here, but has been called away to another engagement. She has asked me to pass on her thanks to those who have worked on the Bill. She subscribes to the views that I am about to set out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_283">The Bill is a liberal one; the capital L could apply to the Equality Bill introduced in the House of Lords by my colleague, Lord Lester. I understand that the Government will try to bring it forward soon, but that is a debate for another day. The Bill is liberal because it provides for a mechanism whereby the human rights of individuals can be if not guaranteed, at least looked after and promoted by the commission. It is also liberal, as it attempts to end certain aspects discrimination in a reasonable and balanced way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_284">One of the joyous things in the experience of those of us who have worked on the Bill is that we have not heard the negative charges, previously made in the House, that there is an equality industry or a discrimination lobby. I am grateful to Members on both sides of the House that we have confined the debate to the issues, without straying into those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_285">The Government are generally to be commended on the Bill, especially in its present form, as it has been significantly amended in both Houses. The commission to be set up under part 1&nbsp;is a good structure; it does not include everything that the Liberal Democrats wanted, but it scores well in comparison with the ideal set out in the Paris principles. Government amendments, especially in the House of Lords, have improved the Bill, particularly part 1. It is appropriate to recognise that and to pay tribute to Ministers. The fact that there were no Divisions in the Standing Committee and only one on Report&#151;not on a principle, but on the timing and speed of the promotion of transgender equality and non-discrimination&#151;shows a spirit of collegiality and a shared sense of purpose in bringing the Bill to the statute book.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_286">Much of the credit must go to the Ministers who steered the Bill through the House. I echo the views of the Secretary of State about the way in which the Minister for Women and Equality handled the complexities of the legislation. It was not straightforward and, as we saw today, sometimes she had to deal with points and concerns expressed by Members on both sides of the House, which is never easy. She carried it off commendably.

It was certainly a pleasure to work with him, and the fact that the Government were willing to listen and to make changes&#151;albeit not all that we wanted&#151;made it a productive experience.

Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). He was not a member of the Committee but he has always had concerns about these matters and puts them clearly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_289">We still have concerns about part 2, but the fact that the House of Lords removed harassment issues from the Bill left a core in part 2&nbsp;that we could all generally support. As Ministers will know, there are concerns about the existing width of the exemptions under clauses 57, 58&nbsp;and 59&nbsp;and, indeed, about whether clause 60&nbsp;is strictly needed, given that organisations that seek to use a test should have an ethos that requires that test. Nevertheless, the Bill is much better than before, and credit is due to the Government, as well as Opposition parties, for reaching this point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_290">It was a pleasure to serve on the Committee with the hon. Members for Epping Forest and, of course, for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), both of whom are forensic yet charming&#151;a rare combination in lawyers, unless someone is paying them a great amount of money.

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_291">Part 3&nbsp;is a crucial and welcome addition to the Bill, because we all know the problems that people face with discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. However, the fact that pressure needed to be applied to provide part 3&nbsp;hints at the hierarchy of discrimination and inequalities. We therefore wish good speed to the discrimination law review, to produce a single Equality Bill and then an Act, which will end the debate about hierarchies once and for all. Of course, part 4&nbsp;is key, because we will not achieve full equality for men and women until public authorities have a positive duty to promote such equality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_292">In conclusion, we are still in the early days of the era post the Human Rights Act 1998. A great deal needs to be done to raise public awareness about people&#039;s rights and, in particular, about public authorities&#039; duties to ensure that they do not discriminate against people or breach human rights&#151;but we hope that, one day, they will have a duty to promote human rights. It is with great pleasure that I wish the Bill well. I hope that it receives Royal Assent and look forward to its enactment. I hope that the whole country benefits from the measures that will be set out in statute that we have debated these past few weeks and months.

 I endorse all the compliments that have been given in the Chamber this evening. I served on the Standing Committee and spoke 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 660</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on Second Reading, and it has been a hugely positive process. It was a pleasure to sit and simply listen to the debates prior to Third Reading, and I will keep my remarks extremely brief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_293">Like everyone else, I think that creating a single commission is an extremely good move forward, because of all the advantages that a single commission ought to have. We talk about a single, unified body being accessible and coherent, which is a great concept, but we must get it right in practice. So what do we mean by the word &quot;accessible&quot;? We mean that the messages sent from the new body must be extremely clear, and an awful lot of proactive work must be done to inform people about the new commission, especially those who may wish to use it. The word &quot;coherent&quot; means a shared culture, consistent ways of working, shared good practice and an ability to deal with multi-stranded, complex cases. All that is not easy to deliver, and the key to doing so is the appointment of an extremely talented and able chief executive, as well as the commission under that person. I am sure that the Government will pay particular attention to the appointment of the chief executive, because that is critical to the success of the commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_294">I welcome the provisions in the schedules to the Bill that make it necessary for the commission to work towards developing a strategic plan through consultation and preparation. It will be required to set out the activities that it will cover, the timetable that it will use and to set priorities. I also welcome the duty imposed on the commission to review and revise its strategic plan as it moves forward. That is extremely important but, as important, is the link between that process and Parliament and the fact that the strategic plan and its revision will be laid before Parliament. Only through such a transparent process will this accountable body of Parliament have a regular opportunity to scrutinise in detail the work of the commission. If we cannot do that, there is no point in having a commission. It must be made accountable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_295">Similarly, all the commission&#039;s processes of monitoring the law and the progress made must be examined. Again, there must be a link with Parliament and reports must be laid before us. There is also a connection between the consultation that all those processes demand and the absolute necessity for having the strong regional footprints to which the Minister has referred throughout the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_296">People who know me know that I have a particular interest in disability issues. I am very pleased with the proposals to integrate more closely the commission&#039;s duties and functions in relation to disabled people with its duties and functions in relation to other groups. Nevertheless, the Disability Rights Commission is a very junior member when compared with the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality. I am therefore pleased that disability issues are recognised in statute by the fact they will have their own committee, albeit with a sunset clause, which is right.

: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak after the hon. Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman). Like me, she has concerns about the impact of the battle against discrimination on people with disabilities. There are fundamental opportunities for the disability agenda, and I wish to direct my comments at that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_298">Some hon. Members may have read the story on the BBC website last week about the disabled man who was left stranded at Euston. He had arrived 20&nbsp;minutes early to catch a Virgin west coast train to Liverpool. He had booked help but, when he arrived at Euston, he was told that no help was available and that station staff were too busy. He called three times before eventually being told by someone from Network Rail that it was just one of those things. Sometimes one misses a train. The person who missed the train happened to be Bert Massie, the head of the DRC, but it is an example of the discrimination and difficulties that disabled people face every day of every week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_299">The story illustrates the fundamental role of the DRC. It is not just a body that campaigns for appropriate legislation and for the implementation of that legislation; it is also a body that must highlight abuses of the system and use the power of publicity to highlight the problems. It is vital that that campaigning role is not compromised in the new much larger body, and that is why I very much support the amendments eloquently proposed by the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_300">There have been huge advances on the disability agenda in the past 10&nbsp;years, starting with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which was piloted through the House by the shadow Foreign Secretary and former leader of the Conservative party, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). The National Disability Council and the Disability Rights Commission were established. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001&nbsp;got rid of discrimination involving access to education, and EU regulations in 2003&nbsp;ended exemptions for certain categories of employers. Of course, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005&nbsp;was passed last year. Running through all that legislation has been an understanding that when dealing with discrimination against disabled people, the issues are different from those involved in other types of discrimination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_301">There is a need for an element of positive discrimination for disabled people. Most legislation on race, sexuality and gender makes no mention of a specific gender, race or sexuality. We must give people with disabilities proactive help if they are to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of society enjoys. An element of judgment must be applied when implementing disability legislation. We require employers to make &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; and public authorities must have &quot;due regard&quot; to promoting equality of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 662</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>opportunity. Such judgment is required because significant costs are attached to disability legislation. It is right to spend that money&#151;for example, the rail industry will spend &#163;142&nbsp;million on upgrading rail carriages between now and 2020&#151;and the costs must be carefully thought through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_302">It is not enough for people with disabilities for us simply to eliminate negative attitudes and stereotypes among those who do not have disabilities. We can be as progressive, enlightened and compassionate as we like, but that alone will not solve the problem of the old lady who is stuck in her flat because of her disability. That is why we must realise that different measures are necessary if we are to deal with the problems faced by people with disabilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_303">I welcome the Bill from the perspective of the disability agenda, but I urge the Secretary of State to consider two vital roles that the new commission must have when it is set up. First, it must carefully monitor the implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, especially in respect of transport. I have mentioned the upgrading of rail carriages, but there is a question whether audio-visual facilities are needed on buses so that people can hear and see when they reach the right bus stop more easily than they can at present. There is also a question whether the legislation should be extended to aviation and shipping. For example, there have been well-publicised cases of disabled people who have tried to get Ryanair flights, but have been treated in a way that most hon. Members would find utterly appalling. The sooner the Act can have teeth to stop such incidents from happening, the better for thousands of people with disabilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_304">Secondly, I hope that the new commission will look beyond the DDA to new areas in which it might have a role. I hope that it will examine whether disabled people should have a right to independent living and whether elements of the DDA should be extended to schools and communal areas, which are not covered at the moment. I hope that the commission will consider whether there should be a more generous interpretation of mental illness rather than the current fairly strict one. I hope that it will examine whether the Act should apply to volunteering, which is a vital way back into independent living and the world of work for a number of people with disabilities. I hope that it will consider whether something should be done for carers, who are vital to improving the life chances of many people with disabilities, but are not especially helped by legislation as it stands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_305">I hope that the commission will examine the link between disability and poverty. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that the percentage of people of working age with disabilities who live in income poverty is double that of people who do not have disabilities. It also found that that number is rising, while the percentage of children and pensioners living in income poverty is falling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_306">Finally, I hope that the new commission will consider bold measures to eliminate discrimination in areas such as health care, housing, benefits and social services, in all of which there are substantial battles that must be won if we are to secure equality of opportunity and equality of esteem for people with disabilities.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 663</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_307">Disability is not something that affects only a small minority: one in seven people in this country have disabilities and one in 10&nbsp;care for someone with disabilities. I will turn 40&nbsp;this year; by the time I am 85, there will be four times as many 85-year-olds as there are now, and many of them will have disabilities. I therefore hope that as we move forward with the new commission we will continue to make progress for people with disabilities. We must be vigilant against losing the focus that to date has been so successful for people with disabilities and others. We need to recognise that we are at the start of a journey in relation to tackling discrimination and improving the life chances of people with disabilities and we must match the legislative progress that we have made in the House with practical progress on the ground. Only by doing that will we achieve equality of opportunity and equality of esteem for disabled people and ensure that they become not just aspirations for those who seek to eliminate prejudice, but realities for those who suffer it.

 We can see that there is genuine consensus on the Bill both inside and outside the House. My hon. Friend the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on bringing the work on the legislation to this stage with that level of consensus. That is good.

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_308">I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that there is no real need for the Bill to create a separate committee for London. As the MP for a Greater Manchester constituency, I think it is important that we all support the basing of the commission in Greater Manchester and acknowledge that doing that in no way downgrades any of its functions. Manchester is a great area in which to live and work, and the Worsley constituency is a very convenient place from which to travel if one is based in Manchester.

<p>
<a name="60116-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_309">The public sector duty to promote gender equality is vital and I hope that we will see public authorities in their role as employers taking proactive steps to improve the position of women in employment. As I noted on Second Reading, there are a great many issues for them to concentrate on. The duty to promote equality will help to deal with the way in which caring affects people&#039;s ability to work. That has just been mentioned by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt). As we know, carers are a key group in our society, accounting for 10&nbsp;per cent. of our population, and in some age groups, carers&#039; ability to work is affected by their caring responsibilities. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland has a separate strand to promote equality between those with dependants and those without. Although there is to be no separate strand on caring responsibilities in the work of the new CEHR, I hope that it will become a priority for the new commission, as it is for the Government.

<br>&nbsp;<br>equality in ways that will help other groups who suffer discrimination in employment&#151;for example, people who face the difficulties of balancing work and caring responsibilities.

<p><a name="st_428"><a name="60116-36_spnew0"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 The fifth of April 2005&nbsp;witnessed the first of the two Second Reading debates on the Bill that this House has had. On that occasion I had the privilege of expressing my strong and vociferous support for the Bill, and in a thinly attended Chamber I took 25&nbsp;minutes to do so. Tonight, I shall be much briefer because I am conscious that others wish to contribute to the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_311">This is a first-class Bill. It was given an extremely pithy and eloquent recommendation to the House by the Secretary of State about half an hour ago. It will establish the commission for equality and human rights. It will legislate to prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities on grounds of religion, belief or sexual orientation, and it will impose a duty on public authorities to promote gender equality. These provisions are all extremely welcome, and in two specific senses. First, they are welcome in the sense that they are not merely aspirational or the expression of a theory. They will make a concrete difference in terms of improving people&#039;s lives, which has to be the ultimate test of the appropriateness of a particular piece of legislation. Secondly&#151;this is not insignificant either&#151;they send out a signal as to the type of society in which the House believes, and I believe that the legislation is good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_312">In all courtesy to the Minister, whose stewardship of the Bill I greatly respect, I think that she would be unwise&#151;and she is not&#151;if she were not fully to heed and reflect on two of the most powerful, impassioned and convincing speeches that I have heard in the House in a long time, namely those from the hon. Members for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott). Their speeches gave a real meaning to the idea, old-fashioned though it might be, that one comes into the Chamber and listens open-mindedly to a contribution with no preconceptions and is influenced in one judgment by that speech. That is the best tribute that I can give to those two hon. Members. My thinking was influenced as they spoke.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_313">The Bill was good before and, as a result of amendments in the course of legislative scrutiny, it is better now. I think that it is unlikely that the House will be divided tonight, but if there are people who are genuinely opposed in principle to the Bill, they might wish to test their opinion in the Lobby. However, I strongly support the Bill and, if there is a Division, I shall express that support by going, with pride, through the Aye Lobby.

</p>








<p><a name="st_429"><a name="60116-36_spnew1"><b> Keith Vaz </b> 
: I begin by thanking the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) for his kind comments about both me and my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott). We are not used to having such nice things said about us. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 665</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I return the compliment because the hon. Gentleman always makes thoughtful and impassioned speeches from the Opposition Benches.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_314">I shall be brief. What is good about the Bill is that it has the support of both sides of the House. Many speeches today were based on the experience of so many Members. I shall concentrate on the issue of race, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, because it is obviously of constituency interest to me. Forty-nine per cent. of my constituents are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin, so it is an issue that I have followed during the 19&nbsp;years that I have been in Parliament. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree when I say that I cannot remember a time when there has been such a consensus over an issue of this sort. It is so good to see such a consensus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_315">I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for going to such an extent to meet the objections that we expressed in the amendments that we tabled. It is good to hear from the Secretary of State, because he is the man who will be making the appointments to the new commission. His statements tonight about it being inconceivable that the commission could be formed without proper representation of the black and Asian communities is something that we warmly welcome. I look forward to seeing those appointments when they are made. I am sure that a number of the groups that have been involved in putting forward views on the Bill, such as the CRE, the 1990&nbsp;Trust and the Greater London authority, will want to put forward their representations as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_316">I was pleased by the points made by the Minister when she said clearly that if the structures were not put in place the Government would have to think about what they needed to do to ensure that objections were met. As I have said, that is a clear statement. I know that she fell short of a commitment to me to bring forward legislation, but there are many Members in the Chamber&#151;I see my hon. Friends the Members for Tooting (Mr. Khan) and for Brent, South (Ms Butler) and others&#151;who would be prepared to bring forward a private Member&#039;s Bill to ensure that the commitments that have been made from the Government Dispatch Box are adhered to by the new commission. I hope, however, that we will not need to do so. I share the optimism of my hon. Friend the Minister, who performs her duties with enthusiasm. I remind her that it is high time that she joined the payroll vote after her sterling efforts on the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_317">I end by thanking two Ministers who are not in the Chamber, but who have had an important say in the progress of the Bill. I am grateful to my near neighbour, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and to Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, who has always taken a strong interest in these issues. He was excellent when the Bill was in the Lords, and in his ministerial capacity he has gone out of his way to make sure that he uses the power of appointment&#151;one of the most important powers available to Ministers&#151;to ensure that a number of black and Asian people have been appointed to positions in his portfolio. Ministers should remember that when they exercise power, but I wish the Bill and the commission well.

<p><a name="st_430"><a name="60116-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth  (Aldershot) (Con):</b> 
 I strongly support the observations made by my neighbour and hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt). If the Bill achieves what he hopes it will achieve it will serve some useful purpose, but I have reservations about it. I do not wish to rain on anyone&#039;s parade, but it is important that such concerns, which extend beyond the House, are expressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_318">I have grave concerns about the Bill because of its likely impact on freedom of choice and expression. It is likely to reinforce the situation in which certain minorities no longer command equality but are, indeed, placed in a position of superiority. Anyone who expresses a contrary view will then be exposed to the threat of prosecution. There are genuine fears about the Bill. The Secretary of State has tried to assure us that the Bill removes fear, but in many quarters ordinary decent and reasonable people fear that it will serve not to remove fear, but to increase it. That is not an off-the-cuff assertion, but is backed up by facts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_319">Mr. Ed Greening, for example, has been removed from Wiltshire&#039;s adoption panel because he believes that children thrive better in a normal home, with a man and a woman as adoptive parents, than in a homosexual household. The Labour Government have gone further and in &quot;Supporting Families&quot; they state that marriage is the

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_321">To most normal people in this country, that will be a statement of the bleeding obvious, but in the current climate, which has been reinforced by the Bill, it is likely to attract a police interview.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_322">Indeed, that is what happened to Lynette Burrowes, who said in a Radio 5&nbsp;Live interview that she did not think homosexuals should be allowed to adopt. PC Plod was dispatched because, according to a Scotland Yard spokesman,

<a name="stpa_323">ominously reminiscent of Robespierre&#039;s committee of public safety&#151;to investigate homophobic, racist and domestic incidents because they were &quot;priority crimes&quot;. My son is a young solicitor, and I suggest we ask the parents of the young solicitor who was killed last week whether that should be a priority crime, rather than some of the things to which the police must now devote their time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_324">New Labour&#039;s new thought police were soon pursuing the chairman of the Muslim Council of Britain, Sir Iqbal Sacranie. He, too, was investigated for expressing a view that is a central tenet of his faith. The same thing happened two years ago to the Bishop of

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_325">That is simply unbelievable. For the expression of a deeply held Christian view by a bishop of the established Church, of which Her Majesty the Queen is supreme governor, to be subject to a police caution is a measure of the depth to which we have sunk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_326">As we read in yesterday&#039;s <i>The Mail on Sunday</i>, the Association of Chief Police Officers has issued a guidance note, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;if a complainant feels his allegation is not being taken seriously&#151;even if it isn&#039;t true&#151;he will have been &#039;victimised&#039; by police .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The onus falls entirely on the police to manage the interaction to ensure that the victim has no residual feelings of secondary victimisation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para16">
<a name="stpa_327">The police are in a no-win situation&#151;it does not matter how careful they are because they will be judged on how the alleged victim views their attitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para17">
<a name="stpa_328">I fear that the Bill will accelerate the process of intolerance against Christian views. I am pleased to say that no action was ever going to be taken against Sir Iqbal, but the lack of prosecution resulted from the public authorities&#039; burning desire not to be seen to offend Muslim opinion. By contrast, Christian views can be offended with impunity: &quot;Jerry Springer&#151;The Opera&quot; was deeply offensive to many Christians, but their concerns were loftily dismissed by Michael Grade and the BBC.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-36_para18">
<a name="stpa_329">The padre of my church, to whom I was speaking yesterday, has recently returned from operations in Iraq. Over Christmas, he protested to Channel 4&nbsp;about the trailer for a programme called, &quot;The Magic of Jesus&quot;, but the operator to whom he spoke simply put the phone down on him. Would either Channel 4&nbsp;or the BBC have dared to stage a play making fun of the Prophet Mohammed? I suggest not. However, it is true that a play that offended a minority group in Birmingham, and which caused it to react violently, was abandoned.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_338">When we talk about the respect agenda, we are talking about the need to regroup people around the common rights and responsibilities that we all share. The human rights in the European convention on human rights are a reasonable representation of those rights and responsibilities. Save those that we would all want to be absolute&#151;life, freedom from torture, the prohibition on slavery and the right to a fair trial rights&#151;the rights are conditional. They carry with them internally the rationale for the responsibilities that are required as a result of having them. For instance, in a democratic society the right to respect for the family can be interfered with if there is a necessity to do so in the interests of security, public safety, economic well-being, crime prevention, health, morals or the rights and freedoms of others. Set out in the convention is the concept that rights are available only in so far as they are compatible with corresponding duties or respect. No one can rely on their right to family life in their home if they are using it to blast music at others, perpetually playing it so loud that it is terrifying in itself because the defying of all decencies is so blatant. It will be necessary, in the interests of a democratic society, to protect the rights and freedoms of others by dealing with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_339">There is, of course, an overwhelming test of proportionality, but the values implicit in human rights are good, because otherwise, however we do it, we are imposing our own values on the disrespectful person. The validity of those values is contestable. Someone might say, &quot;Who is the judge to decide that my music is too loud?&quot;, or &quot;Who is the prosecutor who brings the case to impose his values on me?&quot;, or &quot;What right has the neighbour to complain just because she does not like my music?&quot; If we balance people&#039;s mutual rights to a private life, taking into account the broader interests of society, we find that we have, at the very least, a rationale for what we impose that is grounded in values that run well with democratic society. Those values are demonstrable and explicable and can become a currency by which we all interact with each other, but they cannot become so if they are not promoted. That cannot be achieved by court cases on narrow legal points. The commission has a duty to drive human rights with the bite of legal powers, but the job of promoting them is a key part of that.

 I originally wanted to call the debate, &quot;Financial crisis in Hertfordshire hospitals&quot; but a wise-looking man in the Table Office said that only the Government can declare a crisis in this country, so I had to resort to calling it merely, &quot;Financial deficit in Hertfordshire hospitals&quot;. However, to my constituents, many of whom are watching the debate, it is a genuine crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_346">In Welwyn Hatfield and Hertfordshire, circumstances developed that led to an acute hospital, which was responsible for all manner of health care, becoming little more than a community or cottage hospital. It all started approximately six years ago, when the original two trusts merged to form a single East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust. At that time, we were reassured beyond doubt that it was simply an administrative merger that would make the trust&#039;s running costs much lower.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_347">Time went on and we found that the Tewin children&#039;s ward was being closed down. To our surprise and without notification, the ward was initially closed at weekends, and then permanently, so that people who would otherwise use the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City were expected instead to take their children 14&nbsp;miles up the motorway to the Lister hospital in Stevenage. That might have been okay if, as we were promised, the paediatric assessment unit had remained open for the first 24&nbsp;hours of stay. However, constituents learned with some surprise last year that the paediatric assessment unit would also be closed at night, leaving a PAU in place only in the daytime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_348">Far worse and much more specific, the deficit of some &#163;49&nbsp;million in Hertfordshire health care this year has compounded matters so that, in East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, a rescue plan has been put in place. It is always said that it is bad news when the experts are called in to talk about how to make further cuts, and so it was when PricewaterhouseCoopers came to the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust to explain how more money could be saved to try to right the deficit that had got out of control. A deficit amounting to &#163;49&nbsp;million over the next three years has been projected. As a result, in addition to losing the children&#039;s ward and the night-time operation of the paediatric assessment unit, we are now to lose all children&#039;s services during the day, all our blue-light accident and emergency services, and all our maternity services. My twins, Tabytha and Noa, who were born there just 20&nbsp;months ago, will be among the last children to be born at that hospital because the maternity services are to close. That is not all. All operational activity is to cease. There will be no further operations if the restructuring plan is put in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_349">The list goes on, and it is an extensive one. Similar situations are being experienced by my colleagues around the country. This is all in the name of recovering

<br>&nbsp;<br>from a financial deficit that is simply going to put lives at risk in Welwyn Hatfield and other parts of Hertfordshire.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a disgrace that these cuts are being implemented for reasons not of clinical need, but of financial mismanagement?
</p>








<p><a name="st_448"><a name="60116-38_spnew3"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to pinpoint that issue. When the children&#039;s services were first being closed, the bosses of my NHS trust made it sound as though the cuts were all to do with clinical outcomes. Now, however, they do not even pretend that that is the case. They simply say, &quot;We must cut this deficit.&quot; The carrot that they hold out in regard to these significant cuts to hospital services is that one day, somewhere along the line&#151;perhaps in about 2013&#151;we might get a hospital in Hatfield. A &#163;550&nbsp;million private finance initiative project has been on the cards for some years, yet as it supposedly gets nearer, the completion date gets further away. It is three years since the project was announced, yet its completion date is now three years further away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_350">We learned this morning from the front page of <i>The Times</i> that certain multi-billion pound PFI schemes are likely to be scrapped. When we put the Hatfield scheme into that context, we realise that it is worth more than &#163;500&nbsp;million and that, so far, PFI has paid for only &#163;2&nbsp;billion of investment in total, so this project represents a quarter of the entire PFI budget to date. This morning, we found out that projects worth a further &#163;12&nbsp;billion are among those that Ministers are reviewing. I ask the Minister this evening whether she can confirm that the Hatfield PFI project was included in those projects that might not now happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_351">I understand, because I am in close contact with the health bosses in my local trust, that the problems there are systemic and that they go back many years. Every year for the past six years, there has been a need for interim funding to the tune of &#163;15&nbsp;million to &#163;16&nbsp;million, year on year. I put it to the Minister that that is not simply a question of a local health trust spending money badly, although there might well be some of that involved. This is the story of the county of Hertfordshire, which simply does not get the per capita spending that it requires.
</p>








<p><a name="st_449"><a name="60116-38_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Gauke  (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend has mentioned a systemic difficulty in his part of Hertfordshire, and I can confirm that we have similar problems in west Hertfordshire. I should like to elaborate on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) about the fact that the proposed cuts are driven purely by financial rather than clinical need. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead and I met the chief executive of the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust shortly after the general election and made it absolutely clear that we believed that the cuts were being driven by financial need. I fear that my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) faces the same problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_450"><a name="60116-38_spnew5"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is exactly right. West Hertfordshire has similar problems driving similar, rather draconian solutions, which mean cuts in services to local people.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_352">Let me ask the Minister a simple question. How will a trust that has run up such deficits over the past few years, that thinks that its problems are probably systemic&#151;that additional funding is simply needed on a per capita basis&#151;and that is in so much financial difficulty today, ever be able to afford a repayment on half a billion pounds of extra debt? I am sure that she will explain to me a list of facts of figures, and I understand and welcome the fact that more money has gone into health care. I do not welcome the fact that that money is not getting through to the front line, however. In our local health care economies, our hospitals are suffering cuts. My hospital is suffering really sharp, deep cuts that are making a horrendous difference to people&#039;s lives. It is no good listing how many extra doctors, nurses and consultants there are in Welwyn Hatfield and our part of Hertfordshire if there is no hospital for them to work in. That is the simple problem that we face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_353">I would wager that the money has gone into all manner of different areas. We know, for example, that the consultant and GP contracts have been expensive to fulfil. We know that the 1&nbsp;per cent. on national insurance hit no organisation in this country harder, in an attempt to help the health service, than the health service itself, which paid that 1&nbsp;per cent. We know that money has gone into various layers of bureaucracy. When constituents write to me to ask why they have not had an operation, I often have to refer to a ladder including the Secretary of State for Health herself, the regional health offices, the strategic health authorities, the primary care trusts, the NHS acute trusts&#151;the list goes on. There are simply too many layers involved in the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_354">If somebody has a heart attack in Hatfield, for example, and they are expected to be driven in, for whatever reason, a private car 17&nbsp;miles up the motorway to Stevenage, they will find that the motorway is clogged at rush hours, as it is every single day. It is impossible to see how we will get emergency care to that constituent on time. We are reaching a life and death situation.

 Is my hon. Friend aware that it is not just constituencies such as his that are affected? In extremely rural constituencies such as mine, the financial deficits in the NHS and the failure of money to reach the front line is leading to cuts and threats of closure to community hospitals on which the old, vulnerable and poor most depend. That crisis affects the whole NHS, across the whole country, not just Hertfordshire. Will he congratulate the more than 60&nbsp;campaigners from across the country who attended the Community Hospitals Acting Nationally Together conference today, held jointly with the Community Hospitals Association, to work to change the Government&#039;s mind?

I know that community hospitals do a wonderful job, but I am afraid that an extra hospital will be joining his CHANT group because of those closures. That is a huge worry&#151;

Can she reassure us that it is not part of the cuts mentioned in today&#039;s newspaper&#151;the go-slow on &#163;12&nbsp;billion of PFI projects? Is Hatfield caught up in that number?

<a name="stpa_356">From what I understand, there has been a debate in recent years in the area about how services might be improved for the future, part of which has been about the hospitals and what they have provided and can provide in the future.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-39_para2">

Over the three years covered by the allocations, PCTs will receive an average increase of 30.8&nbsp;per cent. The most recent round of revenue allocations, covering 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, represents &#163;135&nbsp;billion investment in the NHS, a huge amount.

 The Minister, in the style of all Ministers of this Government, runs out the figures, but why are so many primary care trusts in deficit? Why are they expecting to go further into deficit this year while getting that increase?
</p>








<p><a name="st_455"><a name="60116-39_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The trusts in deficit are in a minority in the NHS. Most are balancing their books and achieving good quality outcomes from less money than is sometimes provided in areas that are in deficit. It is important to ask that question. We are addressing the issues in different ways&#151;by payment by results and so forth&#151;but there is a question about why, in some of our poorer neighbourhoods where the health inequalities are very clear, we are getting better value for money in delivery of health care than in other areas. As a direct result of the allocation, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield&#039;s local PCT received &#163;98.5&nbsp;million in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;and will receive &#163;119&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;129&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08.
</p>








<p><a name="st_456"><a name="60116-39_spnew4"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 I am pleased to hear about those increases for the PCT, but does she accept that the problem in Hertfordshire is with the NHS acute trusts and not the PCTs, which are running in balance? The trusts are massively in deficit, by &#163;43&nbsp;million.
</p>








<p><a name="st_457"><a name="60116-39_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I appreciate that, but that is another reason why these trusts have to be brought into balance, as there can be knock-on effects in terms of primary care delivery. Therefore, primary care trusts who oversee this area in terms of spending obviously are mindful of what is provided in the hospitals, but are mindful also of what they want to fund in the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60116-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_359">The hon. Gentleman will agree that, as I said earlier, a number of services could be provided outside of hospitals. Indeed, a number of services could help in the long, medium and short term to prevent people from turning up in hospital. There is accident and emergency provision in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area, but decisions have been taken as to who should provide a blue-light service and who should not. But as I understand it, that does not mean that that there is no 24/7&nbsp;accident and emergency coverage in his area.

Given such investment, all NHS bodies should be able to plan for, and achieve, financial balance each and every year. I should point out that the majority of NHS organisations are both delivering service improvements and living within their set budgets, but we recognise that a minority of organisations face challenging financial agendas.

For example, the Watford health village project, which will lead to the redevelopment by early 2013&nbsp;of Watford general hospital and the immediate surrounding area, is proceeding well. One partner, the East of England Development Agency, recently agreed to contribute &#163;750,000&nbsp;over the next two years to pre-planning work for this scheme.

It opened to patients in September 2004, and in its first year alone it cared for some 1,500&nbsp;people from throughout east and north Hertfordshire. There is a new combined breast cancer and magnetic resonance imaging unit at the QE2&nbsp;hospital, and the revamped Hertford county hospital was officially opened on 9&nbsp;September. It will provide a range of services and open its doors to local people to provide a range of treatments. The capacity being built through those developments is doubtless welcomed by MPs throughout the county.

That does not mean that there is a freeze on hospital PFI projects. We have just given two NHS trusts&#151;Oxford Radcliffe and Portsmouth Hospitals&#151;the go-ahead for construction.

Obviously, we are still keen to keep on track with the biggest hospital building programme in the history of the NHS.

Organisational changes to make sure that people are fit for the jobs they do will deliver around &#163;3.6&nbsp;million. In addition, maximising income on work undertaken on both NHS and private patients is expected to generate income in the region of &#163;600,000, which will help to offset the deficit.

 In the short time that we have left, can the Minister tell me and my constituents, many of whom are here tonight, whether the so-called reconfigurations&#151;cuts to us&#151;will cost lives in Welwyn Hatfield?

 It is important that health trusts manage a proper service that takes account of the finances, use the record investment that we have provided to invest in services and, importantly, look at how they can deliver a better health service, including preventing people from ending up in hospitals with sicknesses that could be dealt with outside and doing

That is an important part of how we create an NHS fit for the 21st century.

<a name="stpa_367">In terms of future investment and development in the area, the proposed changes and efficiency savings are linked to the reconfiguration of services. It is about looking at where we can save money to invest in the future, as well as dealing with the deficit. There are questions to be asked about how a minority of trusts have got into deficit and how they can contribute to getting themselves out of that situation.

A range of services needs to be provided, both inside and outside hospitals, to meet the needs of local populations. I know that the SHA is committed to achieving financial balance across the whole of its health economy. It is preparing the outline business cases for its 10-year plan &quot;Investing in Your Health&quot; for health services in both counties.
