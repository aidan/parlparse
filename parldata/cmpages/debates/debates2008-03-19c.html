 Does the Minister not realise that the programme of rural post office closures that his Government are completing will at one swift move destroy any prospect of reducing social exclusion in rural areas, particularly as they are removing any possibility of profitable post offices remaining in shops, and even disallowing shops that have operated a post office from offering any services that might compete with the Post Office?

 We recognise that post offices play an important social and economic role in rural areas, but, as the hon. Lady knows, the post office network is costing the taxpayer about &#163;3.5 million a week, which amounts to half a million pounds a day, and the cost per transaction in some of the 800 smaller post offices in rural areas is &#163;17. That is simply unaffordable. We will, however, maintain a subsidy of &#163;150 million a year to maintain a national network of post offices in rural areas, and we will apply minimum access criteria so that 95 per cent. of the population in rural areas will have access to a post office within three miles. I would be interested to hear whether the hon. Lady or any other Conservative Members, including those on the Front Bench, will match our commitment to spend &#163;150 million&#151;</p>

We must recognise that, because if people are poor, they are poor, regardless of whether they live in a rural area or in the middle of a council estate.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and we have a programme to tackle social exclusion in rural areas precisely because poor people in such areas require that. That is also why we give a massive subsidy of &#163;55 million to local authorities for rural transport, in order to provide bus services for people in rural areas. That is why we have pledged to build more affordable homes&#151;some 10,500 more homes in rural areas by 2011. That is why we fund third sector organisations&#151;not least community transport schemes&#151;to provide help and support to people in most need in rural areas. I am pleased to be able to say that two of our family nurse partnership programmes&#151;which are programmes to help poorer families&#151;will be piloted in rural areas, to ensure that those from rural families will, like everybody else, have the successful start to life that they deserve.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that according to Save the Children 1.3 million children in our country live in severe poverty, and yet the take-up of benefits by families entitled to them is poor. One of the most effective ways of getting across the message of take-up campaigns is to use post offices; indeed, in rural areas they are the only institution of that kind. Why is the Minister closing post offices?</p>

 Earlier comments have rightly focused on families and children, but we should address older people as well, especially in England. Older people are disproportionately represented in the rural population&#151;the average age in rural areas is 50, and in urban and city areas it is 42&#151;and they are particularly prone to poverty, deprivation and exclusion, and are less likely to take up the benefits to which they are entitled. Will the Minister use his cross-cutting powers with the Department for Work and Pensions and other Departments to raise awareness of benefits among older people in rural areas, who might not have access to relevant information, so that he and his Government tackle the poverty that many such older people are having to endure?</p>

 We will happily take forward the challenge that my hon. Friend has given to me. He will be pleased to learn that only last week I spoke at a conference in Leicester that examined the valuable role that older people play in communities. He will know that we have published a public service agreement called &#147;Later Life&#148;, which spells out a range of new targets and new actions, be they about older people playing their part in communities, dealing with social exclusion and poverty, or providing better health services, safer neighbourhoods and independent living. Many older people want the ability to make a positive contribution to their community. The new free local bus travel anywhere in the country will certainly benefit many older people, as will the increased winter fuel payment of &#163;50 and of more than &#163;100 for older people. Such measures will directly address some of my hon. Friend&#146;s key questions about tackling pensioner poverty.</p>

 I do not doubt the Minister&#146;s good intentions about tackling social exclusion in rural areas, but the common thread running through all this, whether we are talking about crime, schools, the delivery of medical services, sport, entertainment or leisure, is transport, which is not working in rural areas. Will he please get a cross-government initiative going to tackle the issue? It is no good giving free bus passes to pensioners if there are no buses, and it is no good providing free school transport if children cannot get back to enjoy the rest of the benefits of the community in which they live.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that we must do more to ensure that proper services are provided in villages and rural areas. I represent some 60 villages in my constituency and I work closely with them on integrating services, supporting village halls and providing rural transport. He is right to say that we must provide access to services, not only for older people through the use of free bus passes, but for children and young people. That is why we have a presumption against school closures in rural areas and why we are building more affordable homes. I know that some Conservative Members are opposed to home building, but such homes are vital for young people who want to have a house in their own village rather than leave it. That is why we support organisations such as Action with Communities in Rural England&#151;ACRE&#151;which is a strategic partner of the Cabinet Office in developing new policies and strategies to ensure that we address the specific issues of social exclusion and creating strong rural communities.</p>

 Is it not now clear that the crucial access criteria for the closure of post offices will leave thousands of elderly and vulnerable people isolated from the services on which they depend, with walking routes that are dangerous to the alternatives and no public transport available? Were Ministers in the Cabinet Office consulted on the social exclusion implications of those access criteria? If they were not, what is the point of their having responsibility for social exclusion? If they were consulted, why did they make such a Horlicks of it?</p>

 Once again the right hon. Gentleman lays down a challenge about the extent to which older people are being included in the discussions, but I notice that once again he has signally failed to match our commitment to provide the exact subsidy that he seeks, which will enable the post offices to remain open. I will give him more time at the Dispatch Box to answer my question: will he match our &#163;150 million a year subsidy to support the rural and urban network?</p>

 It would be great to get an answer to the question that I asked and I am sorry that the Minister has failed to do that. It is perfectly clear that the total incompetence of this process is leading to hundreds of completely viable post offices facing closure, creating huge problems for thousands of vulnerable people. What does the Minister think that his constituents in Corby will make of his fulminating in his local paper against post office closures in his constituency when those closures are being forced through by his Government? Will they not conclude that the Government are now shot through with hypocrisy?</p>

 My Corby constituents hold me in extremely high regard. They like the fact that I stand up and campaign on their behalf. The fact that we now have a new town centre, a new railway station, two new secondary schools, a new hospital, brand new housing and a regenerated growth economy with low unemployment and higher wages might give some indication that the people of Corby are very pleased with the conduct and performance of their local Member of Parliament. They will not be persuaded by a sham campaign by the Conservative party, which is pretending to support post office openings at the same time as failing to commit to match the Government&#146;s pledge of a &#163;150 million subsidy until the year 2011.</p>

 Many people across the UK and in Northern Ireland are alarmed at what appears to be a sustained campaign for the demise of the post office network, particularly in rural areas.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to press for a subsidy for the post office network to maintain those post offices that are not financially viable. I am pleased that he will support the &#163;150 million a year in subsidy that we are giving to the Post Office until the year 2011. I assume that he will support that, and I hope that he will persuade some of the other parties in this Chamber to support that &#163;150 million subsidy, too.</p>

 There is a transformation taking place in care for the under-fives. There are 1,500 children&#146;s centres now, and there will be 3,500 in 2010.

What would be a terrible mistake is the Conservative policy to take &#163;200 million out of the budget of Sure Start centres. The Conservatives must explain how many areas will have their Sure Start centres closed as a result. They are proposing doing the worst by young children by cutting back on vital provision in early years learning.</p>

<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="08031951000166"><a name="80319-0004.htm_spmin5"><a name="08031951001089"><b>The Prime Minister (Mr. Gordon Brown):</b>
 The primary duty of Government, and our abiding obligation, is and will always be the safety of all British people and the protection of the British national interest, so, following approval by the National Security Committee and the Cabinet, the Government are today publishing the first national security strategy. It states that although our obligation to protect the British people and the British national interest is fixed and unwavering, the nature of the threats and the risks that we face has in recent decades changed beyond all recognition and confounds all the old assumptions about national defence and international security. As the strategy makes clear, new threats demand new approaches. A radically updated and much more co-ordinated approach is now required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08031951000167">For most of the last century, the main threat was unmistakable: a cold war adversary. Today, the potential threats that we face come from far less predictable sources, both state and non-state. Twenty years ago, the terrorist threat to Britain was principally that from the IRA; now it comes from loosely affiliated global networks that threaten us and other nations across continents. Once, when there was instability in faraway regions or countries, we had a choice: to become involved or not. Today no country is, in the old sense, far away, when the consequences of regional instability and terrorism, as well as risks such as climate change, poverty, mass population movements and even organised crime, reverberate quickly round the globe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08031951000168">To address these great insecurities&#151;war and terrorism, and now climate change, disease and poverty; threats that redefine national security not just as the protection of the state, but as the protection of all people&#151;we need to mobilise all the resources available to us. They include: the hard power of our military, police, security and intelligence services; the persuasive force and reach of diplomacy and cultural connections; the authority of strengthened global institutions, which can deploy both hard and soft power; and, not least because arms and authority will never be enough, the power of ideas and of shared values and hopes that can win over hearts and minds and forge new partnerships for progress and tolerance, involving Government, the private and voluntary sectors, community and faith organisations, and individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08031951000169">The foundation of our approach is to maintain strong, balanced, flexible and deployable armed forces. I want to pay tribute to Britain&#146;s servicemen and women, and those civilians deployed on operations, who every day face danger doing vital work in the service of our country, and in particular to remember today the sacrifices made for our country by all who have been injured or who have lost their lives in recent years in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theatres of war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08031951000170">To raise recruitment and to improve retention in our armed forces, we will match our new public information recruitment campaign, launched this week, with the Government&#146;s first ever cross-departmental strategy for supporting our service personnel, their families and veterans. This will be published shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000171">In the past two years we have raised general pay levels and introduced the first tax-free bonus of nearly &#163;400 a month for those on operations, as well as a  <br>

council tax refund, and today the Secretary of State for Defence is announcing new retention incentives for our armed forces. There will be increased commitment bonuses of up to &#163;15,000 for longer-serving personnel, and, starting with a new &#163;20 million home purchase fund, we will respond to the demand for more affordable home ownership for servicemen and women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08031951000172">I can also inform the House that, to meet the threats ahead, after a trebling of its budget since 2001, the Security Service will rise in number to 4,000, which is twice the level of 2001. I can also inform the House that we will be increasing yet again, this time by 10 per cent., the resources for the joint terrorism analysis centre, which brings together 16 departments including the police and intelligence agencies, and giving it a new focus on the longer-term challenge of investigating the path to violent extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000173">I can also confirm that, to meet future security needs, we have set aside funds to modernise our interception capability; that at GCHQ and in the Secret Intelligence Service, we are developing new technical capabilities to root out terrorism; and that the new Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, which we set up last year, will provide a higher level of protection against internet-based threats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08031951000174">The strategy published today will be backed up by a new approach to engage and inform the public. Two years ago, we removed from being classified as secret the information on threat levels for the UK. We will now go much further. Starting later this year, we will openly publish for the first time a national register of risks&#151;information that was previously held confidentially within Government&#151;so that the British public can see at first hand the challenges that we face and the levels of threat that we have assessed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08031951000175">To harness a much wider range of expertise and experience from outside Government, and to help us plan for the future, we are inviting business, academics, community organisations and military and security experts from outside Government to join a new national security forum that will advise the recently constituted National Security Committee. Having accepted the recommendation of the Intelligence and Security Committee&#151;I thank it for its work&#151;to separate the position of Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee from policy adviser to the Government, and having appointed Mr. Alex Allan as Chair of the JIC, I can confirm that, as proposed by the Butler review, his responsibility will be solely to provide Ministers with security assessments formulated independently of the political process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08031951000176">We will also immediately go ahead to introduce a resolution of both Houses&#151;in advance of any future legislation&#151;that will enshrine an enhanced scrutiny and public role for the Intelligence and Security Committee. This will lead to more parliamentary debate on security matters, to public hearings on the national security strategy, and&#151;as promised&#151;to greater transparency over appointments to the Committee, so that the Committee can not only review intelligence and security but perform a public role more akin to the practice of Select Committees generally in reporting to and informing the country on security matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08031951000177">Emerging from all the experience and lessons learned of the last decade is the clear conclusion that we are strongest when we combine the resources of our military, police and security and intelligence services with effective  <br>

diplomacy, and when we work closely with international partners to confront the new global challenges and bring about change. This approach emphasises the importance of strengthening our key diplomatic and military alliances: with the United States, our strongest bilateral partner; with NATO as the cornerstone of our security; with our central role at the heart of an outward-facing European Union; and with our long-lasting and deep commitment to the Commonwealth and to working through international institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08031951000178">I can tell the House that Britain will be at the forefront of diplomatic action on nuclear weapons control and reduction, offering a new bargain to non-nuclear powers. On the one hand, we will help them, and we have proposed the creation of a new international system to help non-nuclear states to acquire the new sources of energy that they need, including through our proposed global enrichment bond, and we are today inviting interested countries to an international conference on these important themes later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08031951000179">In return, we will seek agreement on tougher controls aimed at reducing weapons and preventing proliferation&#151;first, by ending the stalemates on the fissile material cut-off treaty and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and, secondly, by achieving, after 2010, a more robust implementation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty with the aim of accelerating disarmament among possessor states, preventing proliferation and, ultimately, freeing the world from nuclear weapons. And, as a new priority to meet the dangers both of proliferation to new states and of material falling into the hands of terrorists, we propose not only tougher action against potential proliferators such as Iran but new action against suppliers. We are seeking to strengthen export control regimes and build a more effective forensic nuclear capability in order to determine and expose the true source of material employed in any nuclear device. Having already reduced the number of our operationally available warheads by 20 per cent. and made our expertise available for the verifiable elimination of warheads, I can confirm that we, Britain, are ready to play our part in further disarmament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08031951000180">As great a potential threat and as demanding of a co-ordinated international response is, of course, the risk from failing and unstable states. Again, the national security strategy published today proposes a new departure&#151;and, again, it is a lesson learned from recent conflicts ranging from Rwanda and Bosnia to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. It proposes to create a stand-by international civilian capability so that for fragile and failing states, we can act quickly and comprehensively by combining the humanitarian, peacekeeping, stabilisation and reconstruction support that those countries need. In the same way as we have military forces ready to respond to conflict, we must have civilian experts and professionals ready to deploy quickly to assist failing states and to help rebuild countries emerging from conflict, putting them on the road to economic and political recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08031951000181">I can tell the House that Britain will start by making available a 1,000-strong UK civilian stand-by capacity that will include police, emergency service professionals, judges and trainers. I am calling on EU and NATO partners to set high and ambitious targets for their contributions to such a force.</p>

As we assume our presidency of the UN Security Council in May, we are proposing an appeal by the UN Secretary-General for a co-ordinated crisis recovery fund to provide immediate support where reconstruction is needed, to which Britain will be prepared to contribute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08031951000183">Specifically, because we know the importance of peace in Darfur, I am announcing today more help from Britain to train, equip and employ African troops for the joint UN-African Union peacekeeping operation. Given the importance of safeguarding peace in Somalia, I can announce that Britain will help to pay for 850 Burundian troops as part of the African Union peacekeeping force there. Given the critical importance of economic and political reconstruction complementing military action as the elected Afghan Government face down the Taliban, we are proposing an integrated civilian-military headquarters&#151;headed by a civilian&#151;that will now be constituted in Helmand. And in Iraq, where we have already brought electricity and water supplies to more than 1 million citizens, we are stepping up our contribution to the work of long-term economic reconstruction by supporting the Basra development commission, led for the British by the businessman Michael Wareing who is doing an excellent job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08031951000184">In order to maximise our contribution to all the new challenges of peacekeeping, humanitarian work and stabilisation and reconstruction, the Secretary of State for Defence is also announcing this afternoon that, as part of a wider review, the Government will now examine how our reserve forces can more effectively help with stabilisation and reconstruction in post-conflict zones around the world. With this year being the 100th anniversary of the Territorial Army, I want to pay tribute to the servicemen and women in our reserves, who provide such an essential element of our nation&#146;s defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08031951000185">Mr. Speaker, the security strategy published today also makes it clear that, as well as being able to respond to crises as they develop, we need to be able to tackle the underlying drivers of conflict and instability. Those include poverty, inequality and poor governance, where by focusing on areas where poverty breeds conflict, we have quadrupled Britain&#146;s aid budget and we are pushing for bold international action to meet the millennium development goals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08031951000186">The second set of underlying drivers is climate change and competition for natural resources, where we are leading the way in arguing for a post-2012 international agreement and for a new global fund to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change, including in the areas most under stress and therefore most likely to suffer instability as well as humanitarian disasters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08031951000187">The third drivers are disease and global pandemics, where, with the World Health Organisation, the priority is to improve early warning systems, to increase global vaccine supplies and to help put in place a more co-ordinated global response. Given the importance of building stability and countering violent extremism in the middle east and south Asia, we are also increasing the number of Foreign Office staff there by 30 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08031951000188">Among all the security challenges to citizens of this country covered by the new strategy, the most serious and urgent remains the threat from international terrorism. As the head of MI5 has said, Britain is facing 30 known plots and is monitoring 200 networks and about 2,000 individuals. There have been 58 convictions for terrorism in just over a year and the Home Secretary is announcing today that we will have four regional counter-terrorism units and four regional intelligence units, significantly increasing anti-terrorism police capability in the regions. Since the events of 11 September, on suspicion of being a threat to national security or fostering extremism, 300 individuals have been prevented from entering the country. Now&#151;backing up the unified border agency, compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals and our proposals in the Counter-Terrorism Bill that would allow us in unique circumstances to extend detention to ensure full investigation of terror threats&#151;the Government will match stronger action against those whom we suspect of stirring up tensions with collaborative work with our European partners to strengthen the EU rules on deporting criminals&#151;a matter that I shall discuss with President Sarkozy when he visits Britain next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000189">For action against terrorism and against organised crime, it is important to strengthen Europol and Eurojust, to ensure the rapid and secure exchange of information across borders, and to speed up the extradition of criminals and the confiscation of their assets. Starting with the United Arab Emirates, we are signing more agreements so that once the assets of a convicted criminal are seized in one country, with the assistance of the other, both countries will get a share of the proceeds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08031951000190">Our new approach to security also means local resilience against emergencies: building and strengthening local capacity to respond effectively to a range of circumstances from floods to potential terrorism incidents. That means not the old cold-war idea of civil defence, but a new form of civil protection that combines expert preparedness at local level for potential emergencies with a greater local engagement of individuals and families themselves. Next month the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will report on additional measures that we propose for young people in colleges and universities, in prisons and working in faith communities to disrupt the promoters of violent extremism, all building on the support of the vast majority of people of all faiths and all backgrounds who condemn terrorism, terrorists and their actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80319-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08031951000191">The national security strategy shows a Britain resolute in the face of an unstable and increasingly uncertain international security landscape. It demonstrates the lessons that we and other countries have learnt in recent years: that we must expand our policing, security and intelligence capacity&#151;and we are doing so; that we must do more to prevent conflict by, for instance, more effective international control of arms&#151;and we are doing so; and that we must strengthen the effectiveness of international institutions to promote stability and reconstruction, for which we have presented proposals today.</p>

We also support the idea of a cross-cutting manifesto for forces&#146; families. I set it out in my party conference speech two years ago, and I am glad that it is bearing fruit.

The statement has been a long time coming, and at first sight it looks&#151;and sounded from the Prime Minister&#151;rather more like a list than a strategy. It would help if instead of announcing a series of things that the Secretary of State for Defence or the Home Secretary is to announce, the Prime Minister simply told us more clearly what will change and why the position will be different. Owing to the tenor of his approach, that did not come across at all clearly. That may be because the strategy has had a very difficult birth. According to sources inside Downing street,</p>

The need for a national security approach is clear: the threats to our national security, from terrorism to climate change and energy security, have proliferated, and the Government must adapt to deal with them. That is why, in 2006, my party said that it was time not just for a national security strategy but for a national security council. Does the Prime Minister agree that a national security strategy will work only if it is put in place and carried out properly? To achieve that, three things must happen. First, institutions in the UK need to be properly organised to deliver a national security approach. Secondly, we need to understand fully the connections between foreign and domestic policy, and how they impact on our security. Thirdly, and vitally, any strategy will make sense only if the Government follow through and take all the necessary practical steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08031951000201">Let me take each of those in turn. Can the Prime Minister explain why the Government have decided to set up a national security forum&#151;another talking shop&#151;instead of a proper national security council? Surely, a proper national security council would have dedicated staff&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Perhaps the Prime Minister will sit and wait, then he can answer the questions at the end. A proper national security council would have dedicated staff and decision-making powers. It would be at the heart of Government, with all the relevant Ministers, and it would be chaired by the Prime Minister. We do not have that; we should have it. Can he explain how a forum and an existing Cabinet committee can drive the implementation of a national security strategy across all Departments? Are we not in danger of having a talking shop and confusion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000202">On the connection between foreign and domestic policy, is there going to be a properly joined-up approach? The Prime Minister talked about a single security budget, but will it genuinely cover all the areas? For instance&#151;and I have asked him about this before&#151;will the single security budget include special branch, which is currently funded by separate forces? The United Kingdom must retain the power, properly funded, to intervene abroad militarily when necessary, as the strategy says, but we must understand that military operations abroad have consequences for security at home. As the Joint Intelligence Committee warned, our interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which we supported, increase in the short term the threat of terrorism domestically in the UK, yet we have to ask whether all the necessary action was taken domestically at the time. It is clear that the answer is no.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08031951000203">That leads to the third issue&#151;the importance of following through on the national security strategy. The Prime Minister has a number of questions to answer. First, why, despite Government statements to the contrary, has he still not banned Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is clearly a gateway group that seeks to poison young minds against our country and way of life? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> He says, &#147;My goodness&#148;, but the previous Prime Minister said that he would ban it, so why has it not happened? Why, despite rightly preventing the preacher of hate, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, from entering Britain following our recommendation to do so, has he not followed the lead of the Irish Government and excluded Ibrahim Moussawi, a spokesman for the terrorist organisation, Hezbollah, who recently conducted a speaking tour of the UK? Why has his Government allowed public money to end up in the hands of extremist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood? Does he understand the damage done to our reputation by the perception that the UK has allowed itself to become a terrorist breeding ground and a threat to others? Why, despite the urgent need to secure our borders, does he still refuse to create a proper border police force with enforcement powers? What is holding him back from those obvious and necessary measures?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08031951000204">May I end by asking the Prime Minister to begin his response by answering the following question? A national security approach will not succeed unless we learn from the mistakes that have been made in the past. In the statement, he talked about learning the lessons from conflicts such as Rwanda and Iraq. With  <br>

that in mind, does he not think it is time to establish the promised inquiry into the conduct of the Iraq war? To say that that cannot be done while our forces are still in Basra is effectively to kick this into the very long grass, and it flies in the face of the fact that the United States, for instance, has held such inquiries. When he stands at the Dispatch Box, will he answer that question and tell us when we will have that inquiry, which, if we are to make a national security strategy work, is clearly needed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o107"><a name="08031951000205"><a name="80319-0005.htm_spmin1"><a name="08031951001093"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his support for the standby facility and for the co-ordination of our efforts in Helmand. I am grateful, too, for his support for our armed forces and security services generally. I am afraid, however, that only he can trivialise a national security statement. If he had done his research, he would know that there is a National Security Committee, which includes the Chief of the Defence Staff, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, the heads of all the intelligence agencies&#151;MI5, MI6 and GCHQ&#151;the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, and the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, who attend the meetings. The terms of reference are to consider issues relating to national security and the Government&#146;s international and European policies, as well as their international development policies. What the right hon. Gentleman is asking for we have already. It is chaired by the Prime Minister, and it met only last week. It meets regularly to look at the relationship between domestic and international issues, and it has been in existence for several months, apparently without his knowing about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para9"><a name="08031951000206">The right hon. Gentleman raised the question of an inquiry on Iraq and asked what lessons we have learned. I made it very clear in my statement that we are expanding our policing, security and intelligence capability. We want to do more on the early prevention of conflicts by more effective international control of arms. We want to strengthen the international institutions to promote stability and reconstruction, and, of course, our forces, including the security forces, are always vigilant. As for an inquiry, four inquiries have reported to the House on conditions related to the action in Iraq. It would not be a good use of Ministry of Defence resources to have to reply to an inquiry, when we have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would not be right, when we have troops in danger and at risk, particularly in Iraq, for the country to turn its attention to an inquiry instead of doing everything we can to protect them. We will therefore be consistent in our judgment, even if his party is not consistent on this matter, that the right time to look at these issues and review the lessons learned is when our troops have finished the work in Iraq, which they are conducting with great efficiency. They deserve our full support, the wholehearted attention of the Ministry of Defence and the support of all the institutions of government.</p>

As I said at the beginning of the statement, there is growing recognition that we cannot distinguish between issues that are somehow &#147;over there&#148;, as if they have no effect on our country, whether they concern the environment, terrorism or national disasters, and what happens in our own country. It is a fact, as we found with 11 September, that the richest citizen in the richest city in the richest country  <br>

can be directly affected by what is happening to the poorest citizens in the poorest countries in other parts of the world. Our security strategy must reflect that, which is why we are looking at what we can do internationally on the control of weapons and to rebuild international institutions. That is why, too, we are looking at what we can do domestically do improve our resilience.</p>

Three hundred potential terrorists or people suspected of extremism have been refused admission into the UK in recent years, so we are alert in taking action against those who pose a danger. As he knows, the decision was made to refuse Mr. al-Qaradawi a visa&#151;he has not applied for entry into the UK&#151;for this country. Mr. Moussawi came to the UK in December and again on 28 February. On both occasions, his visit passed without incident. In all those cases, however, we keep matters under review. In relation to Hizb ut-Tahrir, I have said that we will be vigilant in examining its activities. Our consistent advice is not to give that organisation the oxygen of publicity by banning it. We wish, however, to keep it under review. We will always take the action that is necessary, but we will look at it case by case, and everyone with a sensible voice on these matters in the House would propose that we do so.</p>

Before dealing it, may I say that we have witnessed some breathtaking political opportunism, because the leader of the Conservative party pressed for an inquiry into a war that he and all his colleagues signed up to support lock, stock and barrel, with no questions asked? Perhaps we need an inquiry into how his party has flip-flopped on Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para12"><a name="08031951000210">I agree that an overarching view of the different threats to our nation&#146;s security is necessary.

What we have heard today is an assessment of what the threats are, but not quite yet a strategic overview of how all those threats will be tackled. I hope that more time will be made available to the House to examine the document in greater detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80319-0005.htm_para13"><a name="08031951000212">Does the Prime Minister agree that many of the threats he has enumerated&#151;terrorism, climate change, cross-border crime&#151;cannot be dealt with by the United Kingdom on its own, and, indispensably, we can deal with them only as full and committed members of the European Union? I noted that in his statement he referred to the EU only third after the United States and NATO as a crucial forum in which many of the collective security threats will be tackled. Does that attach enough significance to the extent to which our membership of the EU affords us a certain safety in numbers?</p>

Why, for instance, has he entered into a secret deal with the United States Administration to base George Bush&#146;s &#147;son of star wars&#148; missile defence system on British soil? Does he seriously think that that enhances our national security?</p>

We all agree that we need a rules-based multilateral system to safeguard all our security. Does he, however, think it is compatible with that view of the value of a strong, multilateral, rules-based system that he has been completely silent&#151;so far at least&#151;on President Bush&#146;s veto of the proposed ban on the use of torture by American military personnel around the world?</p>

For that to be the case, does he also agree that any measures that infringe on our liberty in the name of security must be based on overwhelming, compelling evidence that they are necessary, and does he truly think that the Government have yet marshalled that overwhelming, compelling evidence in favour of their proposal to extend further the period of detention without charge?</p>

The Chief of the Defence Staff said only a few days ago that the forces were now better equipped than at any time for 40 years. That is because we have not only increased the budget for defence, but we have made available what are called urgent operational requirements to the Ministry of Defence, as a result of which &#163;3.3 billion has been spent in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past two years&#151;exactly the money the right hon.

of detention, he&#151;and even the Conservative party&#151;has supported the Liberty proposals that say there may be circumstances in which more than 28 days is necessary for arresting and interviewing someone before charge. I believe he should look seriously at the similarities between the original Liberty proposals and those we are putting forward. We are not saying that in every circumstance someone who is detained must be detained for up to 42 days; we are saying that there should be a reserve power and that if the Home Secretary, with others, decides it should be used, she would come to the House of Commons and ask for that power to be activated. That is very similar to the power proposed by Liberty that the right hon. Gentleman supported because he recognised that there may be circumstances in which it might be necessary to go beyond 28 days. That is not what is at dispute, even though he wants to think that is the issue. The issue is the mechanism that we use.

Will he and the Defence Secretary look to give an enhanced domestic role to the TA in dealing with security incidents at home, should they happen? If there is a major terrorism incident in this country, the regular Army and our security services will be hard-pressed. There could be an ideal role for the Territorial Army both in contributing to the security containment zone that will have to be set up, and in terms of the specialist units and dealing with the clean-up and the aftermath.

 I very strongly welcome the parts in my right hon. Friend&#146;s statement about nuclear weapons, not least because the terrorists&#146; capacity to obtain them is a serious one. In the same vein, does he recognise that biological and chemical weapons possibly pose an even bigger threat? It is probably easier for terrorists to obtain access to those weapons because of the nature of them. Will he give the same urgency to dealing with chemical and biological weapons&#151;the so-called &#147;poor man&#146;s nuclear weapons&#148;?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who takes a huge interest in these matters having been a Minister at the Foreign Office. He rightly says that although I emphasised in my statement the measures that we wish to take to promote nuclear disarmament, references are also made in the national security strategy document to the dangers and risks posed by chemical and biological weapons. He is right to say that the dangers of those weapons falling into the hands of potential terrorists mean that we have to examine not only the owners of those weapons but who is supplying them. We now have excellent ability to do post-fact detection of who the supplier is, which should enable us to locate the suppliers of chemical, biological and nuclear weapon parts and take strong action against them. That is an important part of the national security strategy that we have published.</p>

Gentleman: this is a human tragedy that is being acted out, involving a threat to the lives of young children as well as to those of adults. He rightly says that we should consider a no-fly zone. The problem with such a zone, as I have said before in this House, is that we are dealing with an area the size of France&#151;a massive geographical area. Therefore, the aircraft requirement to be able to police a no-fly zone is way beyond what countries are prepared&#151;or able at this time, because of other action in Afghanistan and elsewhere&#151;to supply. That is the problem in respect of a no-fly zone at the moment. People must be realistic enough to recognise that it is difficult enough to get the supply of helicopters that he is talking about, so staffing and policing a no-fly zone is very difficult, even when aerial bombings, which are completely unacceptable, are taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80319-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000237">As I said last week in the House, the way forward in Darfur is to get the peace negotiations started again, to get both sides&#151;not only the Government, but the rebel groups that never came to the original proposals for the peace talks only a few weeks ago&#151;to the talks and to get the African Union and United Nations force in to back up whatever settlement can be agreed. Those are the priorities, and I hope that we can move forward on them with speed.</p>

May I suggest that the basic lesson that we can learn from America is that an organisation is most successful&#151;the National Guard is the only part of the American armed forces that is fully recruited&#151;when it is led at all levels by volunteer reserves, when it has a real footprint in every part of the country and, above all, when it is used as a force in its own right, be that for combat, peacekeeping, disaster relief and so on, and not merely as a provision of spare parts for the regular counterparts?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right about the importance of taking action on climate change. That is why not only are we making proposals for international action to secure a post-2012 agreement, but we are proposing that the World Bank should take on a new role as a world bank for the environment, as well as for development, so that it can provide money for energy-efficiency schemes and for alternative sources of energy to be invested in by some of the poorer countries in the world. International co-operation is vital to deal with the problems of climate change. She probably knows that we are sponsoring a major afforestation project in the Congo basin.

Yes, I am afraid that it was our dear friends the Liberal Democrats, who will do anything to get elected. They will cuddle you during the daytime only to cross you by nightfall. They scandalously seek and practise power without responsibility.</p>

It was a great evening, as you may recall, Mr. Deputy Speaker, when the Conservatives gained 921 seats. The Liberal Democrats, I am afraid, lost 246 seats, but it was described by the then leader of the Lib Dems, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), as a mixed bag of results&#151;not an accurate judgment, I think, of the day&#146;s events.</p>

sea front. Such was the unpopularity of the proposal that it contributed to the Lib Dems&#146; losing control of the town hall. They lost 23 seats, returning only seven councillors out of 51.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80319-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000277">On the election night itself, long after the working day was over, the Lib Dems tiptoed into the town hall, not to clear their desks or pick up their sandals, knowing that they would not be back in office, but to place the final signature on a controversial contract that committed the people of Bournemouth to a massive seafront development that they did not want. Why did they do this? Nobody knows. Even cross-examination by Jeremy Paxman on &#147;Newsnight&#148; could not get the chief local Lib Dem plotter, the aptly named Councillor Fudge, properly to explain that malicious, selfish and vindictive behaviour. Yes, there were inquiries. Even the Electoral Commission got involved, but it was eventually determined that nothing illegal had been done. Morally and ethically speaking, however, I believe that the Lib Dems are guilty as charged as they deliberately burdened a town with a development that it did not want and the new administration with the costs that it campaigned so hard to avoid.</p>

How would it work? It would require all local authorities to introduce a policy preventing major financial or controversial decisions being made in the four weeks leading up to an election. It would be up to the individual councils to determine the size of the budget and the other parameters. All that would be required would be that the matter be debated locally and local decisions be made.</p>

In Southwark back in the &#146;80s, the outgoing Labour administration, thinking that it might be defeated at the polls, entered into a controversial planning application and a land property deal just before the election. The political decision was taken earlier, but the documents were signed on the day before the elections. I understand that that is legitimate if it is a matter of administration rather than political decision. If that is the case, the Bill is not necessary. We have plenty of legislation and plenty of controls on local councils, with an absolute guarantee that purdah applies in local government up to local elections in England.</p>

In fact, the more people encounter the process at first hand, the more they realise that it is not just unfair, but in many respects illogical; not just badly thought-through, but in some cases even avoidable.</p>

<p>I agree with what the Secretary of State has said on numerous occasions: we have to face the facts about the future of postal services in this country. The debate has not been convened whimsically. We understand that the Post Office is haemorrhaging around &#163;4 million a week; that the development of online mail has eviscerated part of the Post Office&#146;s traditional customer base; and that in this difficult business climate, uncertain times lie ahead.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I thought that he might have been giving the Government too much of a defence in respect of the problems facing the Post Office. The effect of online ordering has been to increase the amount of delivery work undertaken by post offices. People order goods online, but delivering those goods is a new business opportunity for Royal Mail, with post offices as collection points.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is potentially right, but we must distinguish between the post office network and Royal Mail, as it is the latter that makes those deliveries. That is an important distinction, and it must be admitted that the internet has displaced much of the revenue-earning activity previously enjoyed by post offices.</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend. He was talking about the process by which the decision about closures was made. One post office to be closed in my constituency is in an area where a significant new housing programme is about to begin. The alternative post office is already notorious for being overcrowded and incapable of being expanded. Does that not suggest that the consultation process was a farce, and that what we are seeing is a lottery in order to meet a Government target?</p>

 My hon. Friend said that the consultation process was unfair, but is it not also fraudulent?

close another office in the district. It is clear that the Government are determined, come what may, to close all the post offices in Cherwell, however good the arguments against doing so may be. The consultation process is therefore wholly fraudulent.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a crucial point. It is something that I want to expand on, ever so briefly, in a few minutes. If I may put it this way, we are involved in a game of pass the parcel. All hon. Members have in their constituencies post offices that are due to be shut, but if they succeed in keeping one office open, another one elsewhere will be closed. Therefore, what might appear to be a local success for one hon. Member becomes a local difficulty for another. That is one of the main problems that we face.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee has reported on post office closures. I put in a very detailed draft of evidence, including nine recommendations for changing the closure programme. However, 50 other hon. Members from both sides of the House also put forward evidence, and they included Front Benchers from the Conservative party. If the hon. Gentleman feels so strongly about this matter, why did he not offer any evidence to the Select Committee?</p>

 Because I think that it is improper for a Front Bencher to try to pre-empt and influence a Select Committee in that way. The proper way for me to speak about these matters is at the Dispatch Box in the House of Commons. That is what I am doing now, on a day when the hon.

 My hon. Friend is wholly right about displaced closures, but the problem is worse than he suggests. In my constituency, the county council is negotiating about taking over the post office at Laverstock on the edge of Salisbury, but despite that, the Post Office is insisting on closing it on 1 April and on removing the post office equipment&#151;even though it might be taken on by the county.</p>

The Committee is chaired by his colleague the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff). It looked at the cost of haphazard closures, and reluctantly accepted that the Government&#146;s plan was the only way forward. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) knows full well what the Committee recommended, and it looks a little sneaky to have this debate today, at a time when the Select Committee is away and the Chairman has no opportunity to reply.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government and the Post Office have carried out the consultation process in an extremely underhand way? The process has been different in different areas of the country, and there have been attempts to gag the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses involved. The Government and the Post Office have tried to prevent any shops that might subsequently be set up when a post office is closed from selling the same products for a year afterwards. That will make it very difficult for a village shop without a post office to carry on trading. Are not all such tactics underhand?</p>

businesses can be allowed to do to enable them to expand and have a prospect of survival, rather than annihilation. We would like them to be able to take on more tasks, so that they can expand the business that they can undertake. Sub-postmasters are entrepreneurs.

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80319-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000353">First, there are the flawed access criteria. They are simple, linear, as-the-crow-flies measures. There is no appreciation in them of hills, crossroads and main roads that have to be crossed. There is no proper appreciation of the nature of a community built around the use of a post office. Furthermore, a lot of the census figures and population figures that the Post Office is using are completely out of date and unrelated to the effective market catchment area of the post offices that are threatened with closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80319-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08031951000354">Many in this House think that the consultation is a sham. They know that the 2,500 figure has been picked out of the air. The Post Office is ramming through the closures, and if a Member of Parliament succeeds in keeping one post office open, another one will shut. Absurdly, someone who phoned up the Post Office and asked, &#147;Excuse me, why is my village post office closing?&#148; was told, &#147;Because the postmaster wants to retire.&#148; &#147;That is not true,&#148; said the caller; &#147;I know it; I am the postmaster.&#148; What is more, community is being pitted against community, because when a post office in one village is saved, another is shut elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80319-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000355">As for the post offices that are told to close, there appears to be no rationale for distinguishing between the ones that the Secretary of State always cites as having only 20 transactions a week, and those that are far more active and very popular, and which are run alongside a profitable shop and are basically viable businesses that are being forced to close for no rational economic reason whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80319-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08031951000356">We are calling for a freeze on the consultation. If the Government doubt whether that is possible, let us point out that, to a limited extent, they have done it already; they suddenly realised that their plans cut across the campaigning period for a local election and, indeed, a mayoral election, in which their own candidate even threatened judicial review because he is so against the policy of the Government whom he is once again pretending to support. The idea that there cannot be a freeze is absurd. There has been a semi-freeze already, and we think that there should be a suspension so that all the new ingredients that have become clear over the past few months can be factored into a revised programme  <br>

premises. A shop is an essential part of any community. It is its focal point, its hub. We are not just talking about the end of the opportunity to go and buy some stamps and post a letter; more often than not, the closure of the shop is in harness, in tandem, or in parallel with the closure of the post office.</p>

 Perhaps I can give my hon. Friend some more ammunition. In Bicknoller in my constituency, we have a voluntary shop and post office. Every single volunteer goes there because they want to, and the postmaster gives everything that he earns back to the post office, yet it is still being shut. When I asked the Post Office why, it said, &#147;It needs to be shut; you haven&#146;t got enough people,&#148; even though everything goes back into that shop to keep it going. Does not my hon.

 The post office network and shops are private enterprises. Families have risked money and borrowed&#151;often against their only residence&#151;to start and run a business. Many who have started to do that only recently, having taken a risk in good faith so that their shop can go hand in hand with the post office, are finding that the rug has been pulled from beneath them, that the shop and the post office will go, and that they may not be able to meet their debts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80319-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08031951000373">I am extremely concerned, as are hon. Members in all parts of the House, about the way that the compensation is working. It is all very well to offer a postmaster compensation in the hope that he will not face financial adversity, should the post office shut, but that compensation attaches only to the post office. As I have already said, many of those enterprises run in parallel with a shop. What is deeply pernicious is the way in which the Post Office is setting terms and conditions on the compensation in a way which, as well as closing the post office, will also destroy the shop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80319-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08031951000374">What the Post Office is doing, which I think amounts to a restraint of the trade of shopkeepers, is saying that if they take the money for closing down the post office counter, they will be prohibited thereafter from doing certain things in the shop. They will not be allowed to sell lottery tickets. They will not be allowed to conduct certain transactions which, in the eyes of the Post Office, might technically compete with it. They will not, for instance, be able to install a PayPoint terminal, which is a revenue-earning service for the shop, but competes with the Post Office. So in offering compensation, the Post Office is effectively putting a restrictive covenant on trade that could be enjoyed by the shop. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon.

 It is standard business practice. I know that as a lawyer working in employment law. There are restrictive covenants in all kinds of contracts with respect to the activities that an individual may and may not undertake. People sign up to that. It is a financial transaction.

It is pretty well word for word the motion before the House today. The only respect in which I have heard that it is thought to be different is the use of the word &#147;instruct&#148; in the context of instructing the Post Office to suspend its consultation. That is dancing on the head of a pin. It would be intellectually dishonest of any Member to think that that gives them a let-out clause.</p>

They instructed the compulsory closure programme to start in the first place, so they can equally instruct the Post Office to suspend it. As I said earlier, in part at least because of the local elections, they have already done just that. So the insinuation of the word &#147;instruct&#148; is no excuse for those hon. Members who have signed the early-day motion not to vote with us tonight.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way; he and I share an interest in some of the post offices scheduled for closure, including Greenodd post office. Does he agree that this should not simply be a case of pushing the issue off into the far future? There is a perfectly good framework that we could use to suspend the process and give local communities the chance to make decisions that affect their lives. I am thinking of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which comes into force as of this September/October. We have the ridiculous situation in which the Government would write to local authorities such as South Lakeland asking what they could do to make communities more sustainable. The response would be, &#147;Well, we would have said that our post offices should be kept open&#151;but you&#146;ve shut them.&#148;</p>

We are not preventing local authorities from making any contribution to the debate about a sustainable future.</p>

Has he noticed that the Government&#146;s amendment explicitly supports that subsidy, whereas the Opposition motion does not? Will he issue a challenge to the Opposition, at least when they come to vote on the substantive motion, to support the Government amendment and the public subsidy to the Post Office?</p>

They are being invited to support a Conservative motion that might will the ends but does not provide the means. I have a lot of respect for the hon.

 I should like to reassure my right hon. Friend that I have no intention whatever of voting for the Conservative amendment, which comes from a party that when in government had absolutely no compunction about closing post offices, schools, hospitals, mines and heavy industry. However, there is real concern in my constituency about the proposal to close three highly efficient and consistently well-used post offices. I entirely accept that the usage of post offices has changed, but the people who use them most consistently and will be most severely affected if they are closed include the elderly, the disabled and single parents with small children. Is it not possible for the Post Office to put forward a proper cost-benefit analysis of what it is proposing as regards closures so that the consultation is genuine?</p>

 When I have dealt with my hon. Friend&#146;s point. When she has made those arguments, as I am sure she will, the Post Office, working together with Postwatch, will have to address them seriously. We acknowledge the substance of her point; that is why we are making &#163;150 million-worth of subsidy available to support a much more extensive network than would have been supported if we were simply considering these issues on the basis of profit or loss&#151;which post offices were making a profit and which were not. That is not part of the access criteria. We are trying to explain how the new network will work, how it can be sustainable and how it can address the concerns that my hon.

Will he explain to the House how that can be justified, and how the notion of the consultation being genuine can be correct if we are talking about such a trade-off?

 No, that is not what the Post Office is saying.

No effort was made by Conservative Ministers at any time in those 18 years to keep those sub-post offices open. Believe it or not, there are still a few hon. Gentlemen here who were Members in the House at that time, and we should hear from them at some point about the attitude they took in their constituencies when those sub-post offices were closing.</p>

 May I cite to the Secretary of State some figures pertinent to what he just said? From 1993 to 1994, the Post Office was in profit by &#163;25 million; from 1995 to 1996, it was in profit by &#163;35 million; and in 1996-97, it was in profit by &#163;34 million.

Member for Rutland and Melton said. For example, it is the biggest provider of foreign exchange in the country and a major provider of car insurance. It has launched a new broadband service in partnership with British Telecom, whereby people can pay in cash if they want.

It has introduced a new secure Christmas pre-payment scheme for savers from this Christmas onwards. The Post Office must travel that road of new services and new reasons to go to post offices, all built on a brand that people can genuinely trust.</p>

That is the basis for the decisions that we have made, after careful consideration, about the best way of sustaining a substantial network of sub-post offices. It will remain a substantial network in the light of the significant changes in the way in which the public&#151;our constituents&#151;use those services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80319-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000509">The current difficulties that the post office network faces have rightly been the subject of many debates. It is undeniable&#151;no one has sought to dispute the facts, because they cannot&#151;that the Post Office made losses of approximately &#163;3.5 million a week, every week, last year, with 4 million fewer people a week visiting post offices compared with just two years ago. That is a drop of nearly 20 per cent. in customers&#151;again, our constituents&#151;who use sub-post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80319-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08031951000510">No undertaking could afford to ignore the consequences of changes of that magnitude. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said today, 800 post offices have fewer than 16 customers a week, and each transaction costs the taxpayer&#151;all of us&#151;&#163;17 in public subsidy. In urban areas, some 1,000 sub-post offices compete for business with at least six other post offices within a mile of them. That is happening at a time when the number of customers is falling. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Opposition Members say from a sedentary position that we are keeping some of those sub-post offices open.

 I should like to reinforce my right hon. Friend&#146;s point. The difficulty with the Conservatives&#146; motion is that it simply calls for a moratorium, because they do not have a policy. They are not fit for government and they do not want to take tough decisions. Some of them do not even seem to understand a sub-post office&#146;s measure of profitability or otherwise and look at it only through the eyes of the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress. The Conservatives do not look at central costs&#151;for IT, IT support, cash handling, delivery, security and so on&#151;when assessing whether a post office is profitable. One cannot look at only one sub-post office, however; one must also look at how much it takes out of central financing. However, the Conservatives do not understand the financing, yet they claim that they are pro-business.</p>

The access criteria that we have set down will ensure for the first time&#151;it is important that hon. Members appreciate that&#151;that almost all the urban population of the UK, that is 95 per cent., will be within 1 mile of their nearest Post Office outlet and that 95 per cent. of the rural population will be within 3 miles. This is the first time that such a safeguard has been provided for vulnerable consumers throughout the UK, particularly in deprived urban areas and remote areas. The additional requirement for Post Office Ltd to take account of factors such as the availability of public transport, local demographics and the impact on local economies when developing its area plans means that the criteria are more robust and should help to ensure an accessible network.</p>

As I said at the beginning of my speech, I appreciate and understand the concerns that have been raised today. All of us understand the importance of such issues. Post office closures have been happening for many years and, as we know, thousands closed under the previous Conservative Government.

During their final term in office, they closed the equivalent of four post offices a week. That amounted to 3,500 during their time in office.

I find it difficult to listen to them when they say they are not opposed to the network change programme in principle and that they are opposed only to the closures in their own backyard.

 I agree with my right hon. Friend. The truth is that the Government are presiding over the managed decline of our post office network. They are choosing to do that because they totally fail to understand the social value of our post offices to the 2 million vulnerable individuals who do not have bank accounts, for example. Those people rely on the post offices to access their benefits. The Government also fail to understand the role of the post office as a social hub for the community, or the economic value of the post office to the surrounding economy.</p>

The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, too, mentioned that. The death of the main shop on a street can often spell the end for the nearby parade of shops as well. In Brent, in my constituency, the post offices are just part of a long line of services facing the chop. The process started with the health centres, as the primary care trusts struggled to scale in their debts. Then police station closures were announced, followed by the closure of job centres. There is a sense that Labour is shutting up shop in our community.</p>

They are the places that people value for getting face-to-face advice, with centres on the high street. They provide vital local services. It is as though Labour is shutting up shop in the very heart of our communities. It is not only vulnerable individuals who are affected by post office closures; they also have a huge impact on small businesses, especially those in which people work from home as they often rely on their post office for posting parcels. When I campaign on this issue, I am struck by the fact that it is often young people who are the first to sign a petition. Perhaps that is understandable when we realise that 11 per cent. of all business transacted in post offices comes from small businesses.</p>

 The real problem with the hon. Lady&#146;s policy is that she wants to get a lump of money from a one-off part-privatisation in order to subsidise a constant flow of need. It is not possible to finance such a flow from a stock of money without having an end point. Her proposal is therefore economically innumerate.</p>

 We want to finance a lump sum in order to modernise the network and to allow investment in infrastructure, for example. We also propose de-coupling Royal Mail from the Post Office, as I said in an intervention on the Secretary of State, to allow it to work with Royal Mail&#146;s competitors and bring in a new revenue stream. We are also arguing for extra revenue streams, just as the hon. Gentleman is doing. What he lacks, however, is any kind of policy for investment in upgrading the network. I cannot see how he can save 2,500 post offices&#151;or even a little fewer, as I am not quite sure what exactly he claims to be saving&#151;without that further investment. We think we can do that, but we do not think we can do any more than that, so I cannot understand how the hon.

There is a huge sense of frustration that the Post Office is allowing only six weeks, which is not long enough for any community organisations to work together to produce a bid to save post offices&#151;either with or without the Sustainable Communities Bill 2007. It is difficult for councils to intervene and almost impossible for them to intervene earlier because they do not know whether the post offices they wish to work with are going to be closed later under the network change programme.

 My hon. Friend rightly raises the issue of consultation. Does she share with me the concerns raised by Purbeck community partnership about the proposal to start the consultation on the network change programme on 15 July and for it to carry on for seven weeks? How can individuals be engaged when, for example, the parish and town councils may not even meet during that period?

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80319-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000595">All this grief and all this political damage are being caused for what is actually a pretty measly amount of money that the Government are saving&#151;just &#163;45 million. We have to ask whether it really will be a saving when everything else has been taken into account. I provided some figures a few moments ago on how much the closure of post offices costs the local economy in urban areas&#151;about &#163;277,000&#151;but that probably equates to the best part of &#163;50,000 in VAT lost to the Treasury. If we add in other costs to individuals, such as being more isolated or the difficulty of picking up benefits, and if we also add in the cost to the community of losing its high street, and then the environmental impacts of travelling further, probably by car, to access the local post office, we have to ask what we are left with. After all, &#163;45 million is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of Government Budgets. We also have to remember that Royal Mail awarded its own board and chief executive more than &#163;7 million in pay and bonuses last year, and well over &#163;5 million in bonuses and benefits alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80319-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08031951000596">As one of my hon. Friends asked earlier, is there really any evidence that the closure programme will actually deliver the increased footfall to make the remaining post offices, which the Government are relying on, profitable? Where is the evidence to suggest that it will not simply cause people to change their behaviour and do business in another way? What of the overall cost to the Royal Mail Group when businesses decide to use a competitor?</p>

 What we want is a sustainable programme, but it is obviously for local councils to decide what they do. Of course the letter placed in the Library by the Secretary of State makes the point that the Government will stop the &#163;150 million subsidy, so councils would then be required to put the extra money in from council tax payers. It is a difficult decision for councils; they need to know that the Government have a long-term plan to ensure sustainability. There are some good  <br>

proposals for councils to work with the Post Office, but I really want something that is sustainable and not just about central Government shifting the blame and the responsibility on to local government, which causes local councils to pick up the costs without any kind of benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80319-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08031951000600">The trouble is, as I have already said, that the Government have no long-term plan to save the network. The access criteria they have devised with the Post Office would be met if we had just 7,000 post offices, which raises the spectre of further closures. Of course, the &#163;1.7 billion that the Government boast about investing over five years already includes the &#163;150 million a year that they had already committed&#151;&#163;750 million overall&#151;and the redundancy package for sub-postmasters, which is &#163;70 million plus some extra for central changes, taking it perhaps to &#163;100 million. The Government have not provided the exact figures on that. By the time we have added that and taken into account general losses that the Post Office incurs each week, it is hard to see how much money would be left for real investment to modernise the Post Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80319-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08031951000601">Additionally, post offices are steadily having every revenue option they have taken away from them, leaving the network with huge uncertainty over the future of the Post Office card account, for example. That is why we must clearly decouple Royal Mail from the post office network, to allow it to develop other business revenues with competitors. I have already mentioned having a parcel depot for other mail delivery companies. There would be all sorts of other options, but not until the brave step of uncoupling Royal Mail from the Post Office has been taken. We urgently need investment in the network. That is why we propose to part-privatise Royal Mail, raising about &#163;2 billion for the Government to invest in upgrading the post office network. Crown post offices, in particular, desperately need investment to allow them to compete on the high street. They need refurbishment and IT investment, and their staff need extra training.</p>

that one cost to the Treasury and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has not been estimated at all&#151;the cost of the closure of other parts of businesses that ineluctably fail as well when the Post Office is removed. I refer to associated VAT costs, for example, which is direct revenue lost to the Government.

An obvious route that has not been discussed so far is development of the Post Office card account. About five years ago, the Government charged banks with making basic bank accounts available to those who needed them, but it simply has not worked. The best part of 2 million people still do not have access to an account, and the increase in basic bank accounts appears to have stalled. It is obvious from the take-up of the Post Office card account that it has been far more popular than the offers of basic bank accounts. It is also obvious that people want to use their post offices to gain access to their accounts and that some banks have been reluctant to allow them to do so. HSBC, HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, still do not allow people to use post offices for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08031951000609">The problem is that there really is not anything in it for banks to offer basic bank accounts to people who are never going to earn very much, and who want to be dealt with face to face. The last thing that the commercial banks want are people who go into branches. They want people who bank by phone and by internet, whereas the Post Office needs footfall. Those are two very different needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08031951000610">It is time that the Government gave banks a choice. They should either force them to make their services available through the Post Office so that all can gain access to their basic bank accounts through the network, or give up on banks and develop the Post Office card account into a basic bank account. In either event, we need a universal service obligation on access to a bank account, and the Post Office should play a role in providing it. That could offer a very fruitful revenue stream.</p>

 Let me begin by explaining some of the background to my interest in this issue. I was a member of the Trade and Industry Committee during the last Parliament, and was involved in the reports that first pressed Post Office Ltd to consider area plans rather than merely deciding where they wanted to change the network&#151;to look at the broader picture, rather than at individual post offices in isolation&#151;and to examine opportunities for post offices to win new business, as well as the constraints imposed by changing patterns of customer behaviour. When Post Office Ltd adopted the principle of area plans, I was a member of the Committee&#151;again, the Trade and Industry Committee&#151;which suggested that its approach to them should be rather different, and that it should change its methodology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000615">The review in Birmingham has not happened yet&#151;it is scheduled for June&#151;but when the urban reinvention programme in my constituency was launched in 2004, I submitted to Post Office Ltd a detailed analysis of the problems with its methodology and some of its conclusions. Along with an excellent campaign by local people, that managed to save two of the five post offices that were slated for closure. Last year I submitted evidence to the Department when it was drawing up the framework that led to the network change programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08031951000616">I have said all that because the discussions that have taken place, and the reports from the Trade and Industry Committee and its successor, have concerned serious questions that arise when we try to grapple with the issue of how to maintain the viable post office network that is so important to our constituents at a time of massively shifting patterns in customer behaviour and preferences. Such changes will affect the number of people who use post offices and the frequency with which they do so irrespective of the number of post offices, and irrespective of Government policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000617">We must ask how much more people use phone lines than they did some years ago&#151;and, in particular, how much they use the internet and other technologies&#151;to gain access to services to which, in some cases, they could have had no access 10 or 15 years ago. We must also ask to what extent they seek to gain access to services that have hitherto been provided by post offices, not simply via technology but via technology outside normal working hours. There are no easy or simple answers to those serious questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08031951000618">I do not suggest that Post Office Ltd gets everything right all the time, or even much of the time. The reports that I have mentioned and the campaigns in which I have been involved convince me that there is an awful lot that it needs to learn about how to go about these programmes, and I expect to cross swords with it again in June. I feel, however, that what does the greatest disservice to our constituents is trying to pretend that the issues are simple, or&#151;when it comes to the practical aspects of the campaign&#151;reducing the argument to whether people are for or against post office closures in general.

interested to see what happens when the debate is reported outside and represented in leaflets. I think that simplicity will find its way straight back in at that point, and that at least one Opposition party&#151;maybe two, maybe more&#151;will try to present the debate and Members&#146; votes in a way that will reduce it to something simplistic and utterly meaningless.</p>

Even when I was helping to question the closures in my constituency in 2004, in some cases successfully, leaflets were appearing from the Conservatives claiming that I was supporting the very closures that we managed to beat off. One Conservative leaflet doctored <i> Hansard</i> to back up its claims, which earned the party and the councillor involved a rebuke from Mr. Speaker when it was reported to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08031951000623">Turning to the situation in Birmingham, and the proposals that are likely to be published in June, I am pleased that criticisms that we made in the Select Committee some years ago have, in theory, been addressed by the Post Office in the access criteria that it has laid down. I say &#147;in theory&#148;, because the evidence is that they have not always been followed through in practice, which is something that Post Office Ltd must address. As a local MP I will only know what the proposals are, and whether there is a problem with the methodology, towards the end of the pre-consultation phase and just before the formal consultation. If and when proposals are produced, and if there is consensus about the methodology and confidence in the way in which Post Office Ltd has drawn up its plan, even if there is disagreement about its substance, the six-week consultation is probably not too bad. In fact, the National Federation of SubPostmasters says that six weeks is probably okay, if the aim is to minimise the period of sub-postmasters&#146; uncertainty. However, problems will arise if there is not consensus about the methodology and people end up having to argue simultaneously about the methodology and the  <br>

proposals themselves during that same six-week period. My message to Post Office Ltd is that it should be open with stakeholders at an earlier stage, and I do not think that that contradicts the framework that it has laid down. I do not buy all its arguments about commercial confidentiality, and I certainly do not think that they should take precedence over letting the public know the things that they need to know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08031951000624">Finally, as we approach the publication of proposals on Birmingham, access criteria will apply, as elsewhere, guaranteeing the maximum distances from post offices. That is important, and it is an improvement on existing measures. The problem that we face in Birmingham, however, does not relate to distance. Birmingham&#146;s neighbourhoods are often compact in size, but they are far from compact in population numbers. There is an average of 377.2 people&#151;I do not know where the 0.2 comes from&#151;per square kilometre in England. In Birmingham, the average is 3,649 people per square kilometre. Under the current post office provision, that is 7,088 residents per post office, which has resulted in unacceptable queues in a number of places in my constituency. The people queuing outside in the rain are often old, frail and vulnerable, and if Post Office Ltd further reduces the number of post offices without taking into account population density figures as well as distance, those queues will lengthen. That will hit customers even more, and it will hit the very trade that Post Office Ltd and the Government are trying to protect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08031951000625">I hope that Post Office Ltd will look at that, and that Ministers will have another word with it about taking those things into account. The framework and the access criteria do not need to change. They are not exhaustive, but they are a guide to what Post Office Ltd should take into account, and population density in urban areas is an important consideration. When Post Office Ltd draws up its plans for Birmingham, it should be open with stakeholders earlier, as there is nothing in the access criteria or the framework that prevents it from doing so. It must rethink the sequencing of involving Postwatch, local government, local MPs and the public. If there is a problem with the methodology, that will have consequences for the extent to which it sticks to the framework.</p>

Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton how much subsidy he proposed. He said different things in the course of his contribution: at one stage, he did not give any commitment at all, but at another, he thought the maximum of the subsidy should be that which the Government have provided. There are consequences that flow from that&#151;there is a financial limit, as the Conservative party, too, has accepted&#151;and we cannot avoid numbers.

 I am grateful to be called so early in the debate. It was clear from the Secretary of State&#146;s response to the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) that the Secretary of State does not have full control of what is going on. In answer to my question about the alleged one-for-one policy&#151;that if one post office was saved another had to be added to the hit list&#151;he said it was not happening, yet he then listed a number of areas where it clearly did happen, and a number of my hon. Friends have been openly told by Post Office management that that policy does exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08031951000639">Some remarks made by Labour Members, including the Secretary of State, serve to underline the existence of a fundamental gulf between their approach and ours&#151;and I am sorry to say that in this context the views of the Liberal Democrats are shaped in the same mould as those of the Government. There seems to be an all-pervasive attitude that the entire debate must revolve around parties outbidding each other on how much subsidy they will give&#151;how much they are going to guarantee. That is nonsense; that is not what the issue is about. Instead, it is about how we can best use what is available, and I shall offer some ideas on that. I should just add that, like the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden), I do not have any special pleading to make, as I do not yet know the proposals for Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08031951000640">The Government&#146;s approach to this matter is marked by four characteristics. There is almost an intention to create confusion about who is responsible: is the Secretary of State driving this, or the Post Office? Whenever a problem arises, it seems that it is automatically the other&#146;s responsibility. There is also a determination to micro-manage this whole process from the centre; as is typical of this Government, there is a refusal to accept that there just might be a better way. Attached to that, there is an aura almost of infallibility: the Government think that they know best, instead of accepting that they may have got this wrong and they have failed to convince anybody of their argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08031951000641">My remarks will come entirely from a rural perspective. I do not intend to refer to urban post offices simply because there are none in my constituency and I do not have a depth of knowledge about them. There are some 7,700 rural post offices, and about 65 per cent. of all rural communities have a post office. By comparison, only 10 per cent. of rural communities have a branch of a bank. That is an important distinction, because it shows that in most rural communities the post office is the only local &#147;financial institution&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08031951000642">Of course, we have to accept that the majority of post offices are loss-making from a purely Post Office perspective&#151;it would be unrealistic to deny that&#151;but we should be looking for solutions. Before coming to that, however, I wish to emphasise the community and social role of a post office. As has been said, it is for many people a gathering place. It is also often combined with a shop and each part of the business gains from the other; attention has rightly been drawn to the amount  <br>

of money people spend in the shop if they have just drawn money from the post office. Post offices are, of course, the outlets for the Post Office card account. I am sure I am not the only hon. Member who has received a lot of letters from people complaining that British Telecom now charges &#163;4.50 when people do not pay their phone bill by direct debit. That demonstrates to me the number of people who still want to do everything by cash. That is another important reason why post offices are important, as is people&#146;s access to their benefits or pensions through them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08031951000643">We have a policy, as, I believe, does the whole House, of wanting to encourage people to work increasingly from or close to their home to reduce travel. That again provides a need for rural businesses to have access to a convenient post office. Even things such as eBay, which is all-pervasive these days, generate more and more business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80319-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000644">The final point to make on the community and social role relates to the access criteria&#151;the belief that the objective should be that virtually everybody is within 3 miles of a post office. We are talking about that distance as the crow flies, but in many rural areas the real distance may be double that&#151;at least 6 miles, if not more&#151;and it may be down narrow lanes, across motorways and so on. The proposal will certainly lead to far more car usage. A few weeks ago, I asked the Secretary of State a parliamentary question as to what assessment had been made of increased car usage and carbon emissions as a result of the proposals. Unsurprisingly, the answer came back that no such assessment had been made. I simply add that people who do not have a car will face a 2-mile walk&#151;a 4-hour walk there and back&#151;and that making such a journey is a near impossibility for somebody who is elderly and vulnerable.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech and is being characteristically generous in giving way. My constituency, like his, has not had the closure announcements yet. Does he agree that if the Tenbury Wells post office were nominated for closure, the nearest post office for people would be in Leysters, which is 3.5 miles away? A bus runs between Tenbury Wells and Leysters, but it does so on the third Wednesday of the month and although it takes only 10 minutes to get to Leysters, one then has to wait five hours before one can go back. Does he agree that that makes the 3-mile criterion, or any of the criteria, completely inappropriate in constituencies such as ours?</p>

 I do, of course, agree. I am sure that all hon. Members who represent constituencies where the consultation process has been taking place will fully understand that the way in which the consultation and the closure process are being carried out involves seriously bad practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08031951000651">My main criticism of this whole sorry saga is that it is a top-down decision. Of course some post offices are very badly run&#151;we have all been to see them, so we cannot deny that. The simple reality is that they could be more successful if they were under different management. Many of them will never be profitable in a purely commercial sense, which is one reason why I have just discussed the social aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08031951000652">However, we ought to help and encourage the better ones to succeed, and the consultation appears to ignore that approach. Some excellent and apparently profitable post offices are being closed. Despite what the Prime Minister said earlier today about the post offices that have only 16 or 20 customers a week&#151;a tiny minority of post offices have such a low level of usage&#151;the reality is that many of them will remain open because of the access criteria and the fact that they are located in the most remote areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08031951000653">What should be happening is that the Post Office should simply set delivery standards and requirements of a sub-post office and tell people how much they will get paid for the work; the figure should be one that does not incur a loss for the Post Office. That would allow the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress to make their own judgments about whether they can operate on that basis. It may depend on what other business they attach to it. Many may say that because they value their community and own the local shop or pub, they are happy to accept a small loss, because the village needs a post office. They may want to talk to local authorities&#151;we have heard of the example of Essex&#151;or other voluntary bodies and the local community. It is not a question of accepting continuous losses&#151;no Government should do that&#151;but of letting the individuals decide whether they can run a business on the basis of the standards and finances laid down by the Post Office, including perhaps subsidising it from other activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08031951000654">All the discussion about new business for the Post Office&#151;the Secretary of State went on and on about it this afternoon&#151;is focused on what is being decided by the Post Office nationally. It is the Post Office in London that is deciding to look out for insurance business, currency exchange or whatever. That is top-down thinking. Instead, the entrepreneurial sub-postmaster should be able to look for his own business. He may want some help from the Post Office nationally, if that can be done, but he should be set free to find other forms of business, perhaps in conjunction with local authorities, that could be related to the post office activity and help to make his business more viable. That is why I wholly condemn the arrangement that will prevent those closing with compensation from providing similar services through other providers. It is true that such constraints are often applied for a year or two in commercial law when someone ceases an activity, but we are not talking about purely commercial situations. The Minister fully accepted that many post offices play a vital social role and the whole issue of commerciality should be pushed to one side, in terms of allowing those businesses to offer PayPal or other services. The issue is access to public  <br>

services, especially in our rural areas, and is accompanied by the issues of the quality of life and social gain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000655">We need a much more flexible approach to the network to accommodate post offices that fail, or what happens when a sub-postmaster wishes to retire or sell up. The system should facilitate a replacement in those circumstances, and that should be self-evident if we want a comprehensive network. We need to review urgently the planning and rating systems to encourage multi-use of our premises. I know that there are good examples of pubs, churches and village halls providing post office services, but they experience difficulties, including in the ratings sector, that need to be considered carefully. In many cases, the post office is part of the only remaining shop in the village and if the post office element is closed, the shop may go down too, especially with the restraint on trade that I have mentioned. The village is then left without any service. The implications for that on the need to travel, car usage, carbon emissions, and the sheer difficulty and harassment for individuals, are obvious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08031951000656">If the Government really care about the post office network, and do not take just a purely mechanistic view of it, the first thing that they must do is get a grip on what the Post Office is doing. Other hon. Members have raised the threats to sub-postmasters and mistresses who face closure. They have been told that if they get early information that their post offices are on the hit list, they must not tell anyone; otherwise, they will not get their compensation. This is all blackmail. It is wrong, and the Government have to get a grip on it. They could do other things. They could make it a condition that the lottery provider ought to enable all post offices, at least in rural areas, to have a terminal. They could say to the Post Office, &#147;Just tell sub-postmasters and mistresses what you want from them, what the services are and how much you are prepared to pay. Let them decide whether they can take it on on that basis and let them go out and look for extra business.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000657">The Government could do all those things. They could reverse the whole process to a bottom-up system, but they will not. That was clear from what the Secretary of State said. No one in government really understands our rural communities. The Government believe in central decision making and that no individual can be trusted to make the right decisions. The main reason that they will not do these things is that they would have to admit that they are wrong.</p>

 Whether the consultation was a sham or not, did not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents have the same experience as mine?

There is another post office only 400 yards away, it is a big town centre that could take the capacity, and there is a regular bus journey of only 10 minutes.&#148; We could see the rationale. However, when I met the Post Office I pointed out that the bus ride, which takes only seven or eight minutes to get to the post office, is not the same on the way back. The people in the Post Office dealt with that with great incredulity. They said that they had never heard of a bus that took seven minutes to go down the road one way and then took longer to come the other way. The point was that the bus does not go that way&#151;it is a circular route. A short journey to the post office becomes a tour round the town to come back. That had not registered on their radar at all. When we reached the final conclusion, which was that that post office should be closed, all I got was a nice little paragraph in the reasoning, something like, &#147;The MP put up a decent argument. We looked into it but we are not doing anything about it.&#148;</p>

Goole post office meant that it could provide more services, including road tax and foreign currency. That shows how much had changed since we started our campaign, and that the decisions amounted to a bit of a curate&#146;s egg.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08031951000669">The result was that there was a change of mind about the office involved, and that the office at Wrawby was suddenly put up for closure, even though it was fine in the initial consultation. I met Post Office representatives and said that that decision was wrong because it meant that people had had to go through the mill twice, when once was bad enough. However, despite my great admiration for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I was told that saving one post office meant that another office would have to go.</p>

In addition, people are making different decisions about how they get their pensions and benefits. It is worth bearing in mind the fact that 80 per cent. of pensioners had stopped getting their pensions from post offices before Labour was even elected. The demographic change is therefore not new, but has been going on for some time.</p>

I sometimes think that they have created problems for themselves, and that they continue to do so. For example, I said earlier that I was very pleased that the office at Reedness was to stay in the shop where it is presently located. The local sub-postmistress is willing to work more hours, but to do so she requires a relatively small amount of IT and a laptop computer. Without that equipment, she is forced to rely on the time that the person from the main post office can give, but the Post Office has refused to provide it.</p>

I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs on the Front Bench, as I have raised this matter with him previously. I hope that he is able to help.</p>

The answer is that the tender from PayPoint was &#163;100 million less than the one offered by the Post Office. Why was it so much lower, and why has no one ever challenged the Post Office about whether it was serious and credible in its attempt to get the business?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000680">John Taylor of the Rawcliffe Bridge post office told me that he wanted to install a PayPoint terminal when the decision about television licence stamps was taken but was told that he could not do so.

I took that up with British Telecom, which simply said, &#147;We&#146;re never going to stop people paying through the post office&#151;obviously, we have links with the Post Office historically&#151;but it is the most expensive way for us to collect our money from customers, and we ain&#146;t going to advertise it, although we&#146;ll continue to accept payments through the post office.&#148;</p>

The report of the Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which has been referred to, said that poor management has been a factor over the years, but that there was greater confidence in the people who are in place now. I really hope that that is true, but we are still waiting to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08031951000683">Local authorities can and should play a role, and I welcome some of the recent developments. My area is covered by two local authorities, one of which is North Lincolnshire council. When the announcement was first made, all that time ago, I had a conversation with Liz Redfern, who was then leader of the council. I asked whether there was something that the council could do. It is fair to say that I met with a polite response but not a great deal of interest. However, in May last year, North Lincolnshire was the only council in the country that went from being Conservative to Labour; I am happy about that, although I am not happy that only one council changed in that way, but at least the council concerned was my local council. Mark Kirk, who is now the leader of the council, is in discussion with its offices on how they can work with local post offices. Perhaps there can be outreach to the villages, too, so that local government services there use the post offices, boost the number of hours, and so make the post offices more viable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08031951000684">My other local council is the Tory East Riding of Yorkshire council, and I have to say that on many issues, including the one that we are discussing, it is very enlightened. Stephen Parnaby, the leader, is doing a good job there. We were county councillors together. He is a good bloke, and he will be pleased that he is in <i> Hansard</i>. He came up with the idea, which his cabinet supported, of the local council becoming a corporate sub-postmaster. If the Post Office approves the idea, the council will be able to deliver post office branch services via its mobile libraries, its customer service centres, which already exist, and village schools. That is a way in which local authorities can make a big difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08031951000685">The council does not pay the tax on its vehicles at post offices, but in the council&#146;s defence, it can be said that there is a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency office right next door to County hall, so it is probably difficult to justify doing so. Again, that is a simple thing that councils can do: they can get all their fleet taxed at local post offices. All hon. Members should ask their local councils whether they do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para28"><a name="08031951000686">I want to mention sub-postmasters. I welcome the package and the fact that, this time, sub-postmasters get something if they have to go, because no such provision was in place before, and that was a mistake. However, what about those who want to go? At least one sub-postmaster in my area&#151;I will not say who it is, because that would set another hare running&#151;really wanted to be let go, under the consultation, but he has been told that that cannot happen. What happens to those people when the process finishes? We need answers to that. We should always remember that in this debate, we are talking about the future and livelihoods of the people who run our post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80319-0014.htm_para29"><a name="08031951000687">We are ahead of most areas; frankly, we are at the end. Goole post office is closed, and the Wroot and Reedness services are staying in the shop. We are trying to work with the council to boost services in those outreach locations. I was speaking to the sub-postmasters in West Butterwick, Eastoft and Wrawby, and for all sorts of reasons that are not the business of the House, none of them is seeking any further involvement with the Post Office. They have made their decisions about what they want to do with their lives, and they want to move on. Frankly, there would be no benefit to Brigg  <br>

 Post office closures have hit many communities extremely hard. The Isle of Wight is no different. In Hampshire and the Isle of Wight consultations were held on 62 branch closures. However, despite many objections, only one branch was reprieved. Does not that call into question the whole consultation process? If a decision cannot be changed, it is not a consultation.

Ten sub-post offices on the island were earmarked for closure. I worked with the rural community council and the chamber of commerce to draft a detailed response, which was submitted during the public consultation process. I should particularly like to thank Joanna Richards of the RCC for all her hard work. The first failure occurred when I did not receive an acknowledgement for the submission.

We raised the matter with John Rattle, head of external relations at Post Office Ltd, who stated in an e-mail:</p>

What assurance can the Minister give to people on the Isle of Wight that in two or three years&#146; time we will not be going through exactly the same process again?

 Consultations have not yet started in my constituency, just as they have not in that of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). As the area plan is drawn together, the local authority will no doubt be contacted to give its view. I have already started to contact my local authority and the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in my constituency to ask for their views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08031951000712">I am writing to the chief executive of the local authority because I want to be sure that he has taken the geographical aspects of my constituency into consideration when he writes to Post Office Ltd to give it information on the area plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08031951000713">The Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform was directed to consider the new post office plan because in previous inquiries, such as that into the urban regeneration programme, our attention had been drawn to the fact that financial losses and haphazard closures were resulting in a run-down of the sub-post office network in an unplanned way that could be greatly to its detriment. Consequently, our report of 7 February concentrated on those areas and, in particular, the consultation process. In paragraph 7, we refer to the complexities of the network and say that in answer to a parliamentary question about what size the network would need to be in order to meet the national criteria, the Government replied that just 7,500 post offices would suffice. We came to the view that it was not satisfactory to accept that the network should continue to shrink haphazardly and drift towards that figure, and that Post Office Ltd. should be obliged to use its best endeavours to keep the network at the figure of 11,500 that has been worked to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08031951000714">In citing that figure, I must also draw the House&#146;s attention to a figure that Post Office Ltd used during the inquiry when it said that there could be as many as 12,000 post offices plus 500 outreach post offices. The eventual figure could therefore be anywhere between 11,500 and 12,200; perhaps the Minister will comment on that when he winds up. In any event, whether there are to be 12,200 post offices plus 500 outreach post offices or 11,500 post offices, there is no doubt that the network will require a great deal of support.</p>

 I am listening with great interest to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s account of the Select Committee&#146;s inquiry. Did it consider options other than closure to maintain the 11,000 post office branches at a profitable level, such as finding cheaper ways of delivering some of the services that are delivered manually over the counter or alternative revenue-raising opportunities for existing branches? If so, what conclusion did it reach?</p>

<p><a name="st_o437"><a name="08031951000716"><a name="80319-0015.htm_spnew11"><a name="08031951001423"><b>Mr. Clapham:</b>
 We were focusing purely on the network change programme, although we moved into other areas in considering how the Post Office may well be better prepared for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08031951000717">During the inquiry we raised four major concerns, which are listed at the front of the report. We say that the six week consultation process was not sufficient. We go on to say that the merger between Postwatch and the consumer council may bring some disruption. We also said:</p>
<a name="80319-0015.htm_brev6"><a name="08031951000718"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Even with the restructuring, the long-term future of the network will depend on the entrepreneurial flair of Post Office Ltd&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08031951000719">That is one of the things referred to by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)&#151;how the Post Office may help to stimulate a more appropriate approach to the consumer in sub-post offices. Fourthly, we made a point about how the post office network should be sustained in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08031951000720">When we considered our first point, we were rather surprised about the lack of transparency in the consultation process. The process begins with an 11-week consultation, which draws up an area plan working with Postwatch&#151;the necessary operating plan within that area. It is not until the 11th week that the local MP is approached, and between those times there is no contact or engagement with the community. We thought that that process needed to be changed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o438"><a name="08031951000721"><a name="80319-0015.htm_spnew12"><a name="08031951001424"><b>Mr. Weir:</b>
 Is the situation not slightly worse? As part of the evidence, we discovered that, on occasion, where a post office was scheduled for closure, and there had been a discussion about transferring business to another branch, business details were not shared between the two postmasters. The receiving branch did not know the closing branch&#146;s information, and vice versa. That seems a bizarre way of going about the consolidation of post offices.</p>

<p><a name="st_o439"><a name="08031951000722"><a name="80319-0015.htm_spnew13"><a name="08031951001425"><b>Mr. Clapham:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, and he raises an important aspect. Because of the opaqueness, there is no connection between the post offices that will be affected by the process. The situation must be clarified.</p>

arguments for its retention. There is a need for change in the consultation process. The Minister may want to refer to this matter later: the appeals procedure is run through Postcomm, but neither the MP nor the local authority has the input that I believe they should have in that procedure. The MP should, for example, be able to get involved in the appeals procedure by making a submission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08031951000726">On the merger involving Postwatch, the thing to remember is that Postwatch has played an important role. When we met the general secretary of the National Federation of SubPostmasters, Mr. Thomson, he paid tribute to the way in which Postwatch had played its part. We looked at other areas of the country, and in Glasgow, for example, we found that 24 per cent. of the post offices identified were changed as a result of Postwatch&#146;s input. Postwatch is an important part of the process. We must be aware of whether it will be able to retain its robustness if it is merged with the Consumer Council. If it loses its robustness it could disrupt the process that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08031951000727">We have heard that some aspects of sub-post offices&#146; business could be developed. We believe that Post Office Ltd could play a more important part in supporting postmasters who want to be more entrepreneurial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000728">We were concerned about whether the network could be sustained. If it is reduced to 12,200 with 500 outreach post offices or to 11,500, it will still need the Government&#146;s commitment of &#163;1.7 billion until 2011. That is an enormous amount for sustaining the post office network. We must also be aware that there will be closures over which neither the Government nor Post Office Ltd have control. If a postmaster wants to retire, the post office could close if no alternative venue is found for it. Even though we believe that a minimum of 11,500 post offices, supported by the money that the Government have contributed, could be sustainable, there will still be fragility around the edges. We must be aware of that&#151;I know that the Minister is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08031951000729">The money that the Government are making available will make the network sustainable. The Opposition did not say whether they would make the same sort of commitment after 2011. They should be prepared to comment on that. Are they prepared to match the Government&#146;s commitment to ensure the continuity of the network?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08031951000730">The suspension for which the motion calls would merely delay the inevitable, caused by the change in market behaviour, which has been detrimental to the post office service. If we are to stop the haphazard and unplanned run-down, we need the sort of plan that the Government have proposed. When hon. Members decide how to vote, I hope that they will vote to ensure a sustainable post office network. That means supporting the Government&#146;s plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08031951000732">I shall be brief because I am aware of the number of Members who want to speak. We are considering a highly emotive subject. In my constituency and those of many hon. Friends and colleagues, it causes as much concern as any other local matter in recent times. Two post offices in my constituency are down for closure. My constituency is small, so that is a high number and I know both post offices well. Without going too far into individual merits&#151;we could all do that&#151;I will make a robust response to the consultation about Moorfield Road and Uxbridge Common Park Road post offices because they are as much a part of the community as the post offices in hon. Friends&#146; rural communities. In suburbia, a parade of shops is exactly like village shops. Moorfield road is on a council estate and the post office is a vital part of the community. Masses of people have written to me about it. I agree that it is not good enough just to get a petition going and to try to make what we can out of the situation. I want to be pragmatic. I want to ensure that my constituents still get what they want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08031951000733">In Uxbridge, we have had the experience of a Crown post office being moved into a branch of WH Smith&#151;the experience has been shared elsewhere&#151;although the move has not happened yet. We had a consultation period, during which I and members of the public raised serious concerns&#151;the move is to the first floor, and we were worried about disabled access&#151;and we received assurances. The post office will open next month and we will be watching it very carefully. However, the important thing is that those services will still be available. I hope that the post office will give the same service, if not a better one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08031951000734">I want to speak as a retailer. As many hon. Members know, my family business has been in operation for a long time, and we have had to deal with changing patterns of what people want in the way of services. Anyone who has been in business for 120 years has to adapt. I therefore accept that things have changed and that that has not been all for the bad. Earlier we talked about eBay, for example, which has meant a lot of people wanting to post things that they are selling on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08031951000735">A few years ago, we started selling stamps in my shop, when the Post Office allowed us to. They proved so popular that people started arriving with parcels that they wanted us to send, but of course we could not do so, because we are allowed only to sell first and second-class stamps, which is fine. However, I thought it would be a good idea to open a sub-post office in my shop. I was not a Member of Parliament at the time, so I was not thinking entirely of the community; I was thinking of business considerations. My shop is big enough, and a sub-post office would have brought lots of people in. However, I was told that I would not be able to have one. What amazed me, however, was that I would have been paid to have one. At that stage, I thought that I would have pay to get the franchise and have that excellent brand&#151;the Post Office&#151;in my shop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80319-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08031951000736">I understand that it is important for a sub-post office to exist in some communities, but that that might not be economical. However, I cannot help feeling that the Post Office has certain services to offer.</p>

face closures, I visited every sub-post office in my constituency in the 11-week period? In virtually every sub-post office I found substantial openness to modernisation and entrepreneurial flair, but from talking to Post Office management at the regional level, I found a gap between wishing the Post Office to succeed and having the vision and creativity to plot a way forward that can save the 11,500 post offices that were mentioned earlier. I am not confident that the management have that vision.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman entirely. It is a great shame and a disgrace that those entrepreneurs are not being allowed to provide the services that they want to provide and that they know their customers want. We are getting a flavour of that from, for example, the talk about the one-for-one closures&#151;I add my name to those who have talked about it. It was less than two weeks ago that I was told about that by the Post Office. If I managed to stop one closure in my constituency, that would be one thing&#151;the Post Office would probably try to find another post office&#151;but actually that did not matter, because there could be another one or even five post offices in London, and then the Post Office would come looking around in Hillingdon. The situation is ridiculous.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree with me about the flawed consultation? When I met the Post Office to discuss the three closures proposed in my constituency, it did not even know that one post office had been closed 100 yd away, in the neighbouring constituency of Epping Forest, because it was not in London. No thought has gone into the process whatever.</p>

 I could not agree with my hon. Friend more. We have been hearing repeatedly this afternoon that the consultation is flawed. That is a point that the Minister must go away with. If one thing is to make the whole process a mockery, it is when the examples that my hon. Friend has come up with are proven to be true. I question whether the Post Office knew this or that thing about this or that post office&#151;frankly, I do not think it did know.</p>

 Another example would be the Lower Richmond Road post office, which is threatened with closure. Post Office management were apparently totally unaware that the Putney hospital site, which is now derelict, was about to be redeveloped as a primary care centre.</p>

 The fact is that these sub-post offices provide something that we all agree is unique and very special. People want them, but some management team comes in and starts to close them completely randomly. This is being done because there are too many in an area; it has nothing to do with which is the most profitable. It is hard to imagine the representative of a chain of retail stores saying, &#147;We&#146;ll close this one and that one because they are making a loss. Those two are making a profit, but it doesn&#146;t matter. We&#146;ll close one of them anyway.&#148; Those involved are not even bothering to look at this.</p>

I asked whether it might double to &#163;40,000, I was told that that would about cover it&#151;maybe. I am not sure that the Post Office wants local authorities to succeed in these initiatives. That is what upsets me, and that is why I am making a plea to Labour Members, many of whom are as upset about these closures as we are, to put aside their hatred of voting for anything proposed by the Conservatives just this once. Many of them have signed early-day motions. It is now time for us, the House of Commons, to say to the Post Office, &#147;Stop! Let&#146;s look at how we can save these post offices.

Despite what has been said today, I am still unsure whether the Conservative Opposition are pledging that amount of money. What I am sure about is that they are not pledging anything more than that, but more will certainly be required if we are to support the sort of motion that the Conservatives have proposed today. They say no closures should happen, but some post offices will still have to close. I am not cherry-picking here and saying that our post offices should not close while everyone else&#146;s should, but it is surely a fact that some post offices will be unviable. That must be the case. Suggesting, as the Conservative motion does, that there should be no closures at all is unrealistic and therefore purposeless. For that reason, I will not support it.</p>

It appeared&#151;I say &#147;appeared&#148;, but I am not sure what tense I should be using&#151;to be that only profitable post offices should be retained. In and of itself, however, that is faulty. If we simply maintain profitable post offices, 4,000 or thereabouts will remain throughout the country, but they will all be in urban areas, able to compete alongside each other while still making profits, but at the expense of other more socially deprived areas. That does not amount to a comprehensive universal service across the nation. For that reason, the premise must be wrong.</p>

That is where I would like to embolden the Minister to take a more robust view of what should happen. Some time ago, I spoke about post offices in my own constituency in an Adjournment debate and had discovered that the Post Office was being subsidised to the tune of &#163;18,000 for each loss-making outlet. That is an amazing sum of money, which had never been available before. It seemed to me then that it would not be necessary to close very many post offices, so I think the Government have been rather unambitious in respect of that 2,500 figure. I know that they often say &#147;up to&#148; that number of closures, but it has been used as the number that the Post Office has taken as necessary.</p>

 Of course not, and if it is wholly profitable, that is great, but it should not be subsidised. The issue I want to come on to is what counts as profitable. What is the proper definition of &#147;profitable&#148;? This is where I want to encourage the Minister to look further into the facts. In connection with the Adjournment debate that I mentioned, I looked into exactly how much it cost to run some local branches in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80319-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08031951000760">The Post Office was happy about handing me the figures until I decided to use them, but as I had not received them in confidence, I was able to share them with everyone. I was told that the post office in Tilling Green, Rye, was costing &#163;18,000 a year to run at postmaster or local branch level, but that the on-cost or central cost&#151;I know that my hon. Friend the Minister still thinks I have not understood the position, but I think I have&#151;was &#163;24,000. In other words, it was costing &#163;18,000 to run the show and &#163;24,000 to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80319-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08031951000761">Then I began to look at the other figures, and I thought &#147;How can this be?

It just cannot work like that.&#148; I wanted to know precisely what central costs were making a profitable outlet unprofitable, so I asked a parliamentary question about it. I am going to press my hon. Friend the Minister a little further in the hope that he can help me now.</p>

My question has still not been answered. Does the Post Office actually know how much it is costing to run the central administration? I do not think it does.</p>

The Government are very bold in the main, but were they bold enough when they allowed the Post Office to consider as many as 2,500 closures? My guess is that it need not have gone as far as that. Certainly it will not need to go as far as that if we can do something about the amount that is apparently being spent by Post Office Ltd, perhaps through incompetence and perhaps not.

I must say in response to what has been said by the Secretary of State and other Members that there is considerable disquiet among many sub-postmasters about the way in which they are represented by that organisation, which appears to have caved in and almost taken the Government&#146;s shilling in going along with the exercise.

I was able to go on for 63 minutes, because of the collapse of business. The Minister responded to that debate and, despite three interventions from me, failed to mention the subject of post offices in Adur and Worthing. I hope that he will have another stab today, because in my constituency we are not losing one, two or three sub-post offices but seven&#151;more than anywhere else in Sussex. It is not 18 per cent. of the sub-post office network&#151;the average across the country&#151;that will be going but 50 per cent. of my sub-post office branches. Mine is a predominantly urban constituency with a high pensioner population&#151; 4.6 per cent. of Worthing&#146;s population is over 85, which is the highest percentage in the country&#151;and those people rely disproportionately on the post office network.

The impact of the closure programme is not about nimbyism but about unfairness and unsustainability. Despite the petition signed by 6,200 people that I presented in the House, the hundreds of letters, the marches and public meetings, and the consultation exercise, which ended on Christmas eve and was truncated to six weeks, we got absolutely nowhere. On 29 January, it was confirmed that every single one of those seven branches would close. At the same time, MPs were invited by the Post Office to inspect the new state-of-the-art outreach mobile post offices, but we will not have any of those post offices in my constituency or elsewhere in Sussex. At the same time, our constituents have been serenaded with adverts for a new Christmas club, which is available at 14,000 post offices branches, if they can find one. At the same time, we have seen the multi-million pound rebranding exercise for &#147;The People&#146;s Post Office&#148;.

It is duplicitous, because it has proved itself a willing henchman following the Government edict that set in train the latest closure programme of 2,500 branches, based on spurious, ill-conceived and self-destructive criteria. Its duplicity is exceeded only by the actions of Government Ministers and Labour Back Benchers, who are happy to pose for the cameras in front of post office branches in their constituencies, pleading a special case for keeping those branches open.</p>

They are not voluntary&#151;they are compulsory closures. The Government and the Post Office are duplicitous in saying that they have to close those branches because business has reduced. That has happened because the way the Government have instructed the Post Office has taken business away from post offices, following changes to the payment of pensions, the post office card account, about which the Government have dithered, and the changes to car tax discs and television licences. They are bullies, because they have virtually blackmailed sub-postmasters into accepting compensation terms at the outset, otherwise they may end up getting nothing at all. Those postmasters have, under this Government, already lost retirement tax relief, which was often based on their business. Their life savings are based on those businesses, and they cannot afford to lose that compensation if their business closes. They have been sworn to secrecy and scared out of lobbying to keep their post offices open, and, as we have heard, the compensation is linked to their not providing any competing services for at least a year: no lottery tickets, no foreign currency, no accepting payment for utilities. How is that acting in the interests of the people, rather than of the post office network, which is supposed to be there for the people? As every Member has said, the consultation was a complete and utter sham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08031951000772">On the county council negotiations, I pay tribute to Essex, which has led the way, and my own West Sussex county council is currently trying to negotiate with the Post Office. I say &#147;trying&#148; because the Post Office is being very tardy in producing information that will allow the negotiations to go forward. All the while branches are closing down, however, and the equipment will be taken out of them, and it will be very hard to get them back up and running again if there is an eventual deal. The Post Office is clearly dragging its feet and not producing the necessary facts and figures, despite the Minister&#146;s warm words that he wishes to encourage such negotiations. Will the Government support a moratorium on closures while negotiations go forward? That is a crucial question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08031951000773">I also accused the Post Office of being self-serving. It is supposed to be a community service. Its services are located within shops that are the heart of our communities, but there has been a complete lack of transparency in the consultation and closure programme. We just do not know which are the unprofitable branches, how unprofitable they are, or how much money it would take to make them profitable. Sub-postmasters have offered to take cuts in their remuneration, but, again, they have been completely rebuffed. The reasons for this lack of information on closing branches and for the Post Office dragging its feet on negotiations with other providers are that it is interested only in maximising the profitability of its remaining branches and it wants to get rid of the rest of the competition. Profits before people and public service is the hallmark of the whole enterprise.</p>

However, the A27 runs nowhere near that branch&#151;but that was in the &#147;facts&#148; the Post Office used to justify the closure of that branch.

East Sussex, but it is in West Sussex&#151;and that from an organisation that specialises in addresses. That is completely bizarre. The response to this consultation was a total sham. In only a few lines, the future of our community post offices, the livelihoods of sub-postmasters who have dedicated themselves for many years, and the hopes of hundreds of thousands of pensioners who rely on them, were dashed without any come-back at all.</p>

But with the strong support of Postwatch and the engagement of the local community, and by focusing on two of the four branches that were clearly pushing at the envelope of the published criteria, we were able to achieve at least one success: we were able to stop the closure of the Whitley Wood branch in one of the most deprived parts of my constituency. While I was not happy to see three post offices close, I accepted that at least the process had some integrity.</p>

in 2008, that as part of the current programme the Wantage Road branch was scheduled for closure, along with a branch at Lower Tilehurst in Kentwood Hill. Like any good constituency MP, I sprang into action. We have all done it, and other hon. Members will do it when it happens in their constituencies. I raised the petitions, lobbied Postwatch and tested the proposals against the criteria. Once again, I thought we had a case on at least one of the branches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08031951000796">Let this be a warning to everybody engaged in this process. I wrote to the regional chair of Postwatch, having measured the distances, considered the deprivation indices, and examined the promises that had been made before about additional counters to deal with queuing as a result of the previous closures in 2004. I wrote:</p>
<a name="80319-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="08031951000931"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The criteria which the Post Office use to determine whether or not to close a local post office is whether people have another post office within one mile, except in areas of significant deprivation. In these areas post offices can remain open if the residents live less than a mile from another branch. The Dee Road estate is in part served by the Wantage Road Post Office and significant data is available from Reading Borough Council to demonstrate that this is an area of deprivation.

The replacement post office was already overcrowded, with many pensioners queuing out into the street. We had been promised additional counters in 2004, but they did not appear&#151;certainly not as regularly as we wanted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08031951000799">We challenged the fact that no account had been taken of additional housing that was being built in the local community, with another 400 new chimney pots coming on stream&#151;another 400 potential customers. I believe that we had put together a strong and powerful argument and I was confident, as I was in 2004, that we could deliver&#151;or save&#151;at least one of those post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000800">Our consultation closed on 31 January. There were reasons to be cheerful on 15 February, because the letter arrived from Postwatch. In my view, it could not have been clearer. It said: &#147;Postwatch has very serious reservations about the consequences of the closure of the Wantage Road post office. We have received numerous concerns from customers and the local MP&#148;&#151;that is me&#151;&#147;with particular reference to Postwatch&#146;s responsibility&#148;&#151;this is important&#151;&#147;for vulnerable individuals and communities. We ask Post Office Ltd to reconsider this closure proposal, affecting as it does a relatively deprived area characterised by low incomes, high unemployment and a high proportion of social and special needs housing.&#148; We had it in black and white. It was not unreasonable to assume that that would be taken to review and that we had a good chance of saving that post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08031951000801">The reviews were then announced, and it turned out that Postwatch did not mean what it said. Although it expressed serious reservations and had asked for reconsideration, it had failed to trigger the formal process. The lesson for hon. Members is that if they get Postwatch on their side&#151;and they need to&#151;they should please make sure that it means what it says. Weasel words alone will not save a branch in any of our constituencies.</p>

We do not have too many of them in west Reading, so there was no danger of their colonising the issue. The local Conservatives were noisy but spectacularly irrelevant. As I said earlier, my opposite number, the Tory candidate, launched a campaign a month before the publication of the closure programme to save three branches in Southcote, Purley and Hildens drive that were never at risk and were never going to be at risk. Yet he and his campaign failed even to lodge an objection with Postwatch or to engage in the campaign to help those branches that were earmarked for closure. This is the sort of irresponsible behaviour that has been mentioned by my hon.

 The Government&#146;s post office closure programme is a complete muddle. There is simply no logic in the choice of post offices to be axed, as an example from my constituency shows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08031951000807">Mine is a large rural constituency in the highlands and islands, but the Post Office decided to lump Argyll and Bute in with the Greater Glasgow area in its closure programme. I could not understand the logic of that at all. Originally, seven offices in my constituency were proposed for closure. That was bad enough, but it could have been worse and the customers of the other offices breathed sighs of relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08031951000808">However, their relief was premature: as part of the consultation process, the Post Office decided to spare four offices elsewhere in the Greater Glasgow area. They all happened to be in Labour-held marginal constituencies&#151;something that, if it happened by chance, was a remarkable coincidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80319-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08031951000809">Those reprieves in Labour marginals meant that an extra four post offices were proposed for closure in a further so-called consultation process. One was the office serving the village of Clynder in my constituency. We still do not know the outcome of the further consultation, but the Clynder office is a typical village post office. The hub of the local community, it is in the same building as the village&#146;s only shop. Closing it is therefore bound to have an effect on the shop&#146;s business, so there are sound economic reasons for keeping it open.</p>

I simply do not understand why that office must be closed in order to spare an urban post office in a completely different environment. If the four post offices in Greater Glasgow that were originally considered eligible to be saved deserve it, that is fine and they should be saved. However, the Clynder office&#151;which only last October was deemed worthy of staying open&#151;should not be closed simply as a means to achieve the Government&#146;s artificial target of 2,500 closures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08031951000811">The postmaster at Clynder, Douglas Nicolson, has given 40 years of loyal service to the local community. He is a source of help and advice to all his customers. Such benefits cannot be measured in profit-and-loss terms, and I hope that the Post Office will relent and save the office at Clynder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08031951000812">Although some post offices in my constituency are facing the axe, that does not mean that the others can relax. There is concern about the long-term viability of all the ones that have escaped the axe, especially those in small communities. For example, the post office in the small village of St. Catherines in my constituency suddenly shut its doors a few weeks ago. I contacted the Post Office and was assured that it is actively seeking someone to take over the business, but several other offices in the highlands and islands have been in a similar position for a long time. I am therefore very concerned that the St. Catherines office may never be reopened and that, gradually and over time, many other post offices in small communities in my constituency may also close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08031951000813">The problem is that the Government must ensure that post offices are given enough business and support to remain viable. I hope that Ministers will provide an assurance at the end of today&#146;s debate that the offices that have escaped the axe in the current closure programme will have a secure future in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000814">In that respect, the successor to the Post Office card account is vital to the future of our post offices. The Government must ensure that the Post Office retains the contract when the current one expires in two years&#146; time. Only the Post Office has the rural network needed to deliver the contract, and there must be no repeat of the TV licence fiasco. Then, the contract was taken away from the Post Office and given to PayPoint, a company that does not have a rural network that can match the Post Office&#146;s. For example, several islands in my constituency have a post office but no PayPoint outlet, with the result that TV viewers there cannot renew their licences over the counter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08031951000816">The future of the Post Office card account is a vital issue, but POCA must be given more facilities. It should be developed into a basic bank account with functions such as the ability to make cash deposits. That is the route that French and German post offices have gone down, and I hope that the Government will take this country down that route, too. A Post Office bank account with basic banking facilities would, I am sure, make the network sustainable and contribute towards meeting the Government&#146;s aims as regards financial inclusion. I hope that the Government will adopt that as the long-term solution.</p>

If the programme were suspended, it would allow the Essex proposals to be investigated, and it would give councils and local community groups the time to explore opportunities for sharing services with the post office, put together business plans and secure funding.

I know that because I had to fight, along with the Secretary of State for Health, who led a magnificent campaign, to save Morecambe post office&#151;a Crown post office&#151;and a post office in Lancaster from closure when the Conservatives were in power. Indeed, they tried to privatise Royal Mail and the rest of the Post Office, so I will take no lessons from them on what we should do to save the network.

One of the post offices in my constituency, on Kellet road in Carnforth, is a viable office; I know that because I know the sub-postmistress personally.

The truncated consultation process has caused a real problem. We have had petitions and public demonstrations. We held a public meeting in Littlehampton which someone from the Post Office attended, but when a big public meeting was held in Bognor Regis, where five post offices are to close, no one from the Post Office was able to attend. Why? Because they were busy attending public meetings in London. If that consultation period had been longer, the Post Office would have had people available to come to Bognor Regis.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a telling point. The view is shared by many people in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that the whole consultation process is a sham and that no notice will be taken by the Post Office of the views of local residents. The fact that no one from the Post Office attended that public meeting in Bognor Regis compounds that view. The Select Committee said of the process:</p>
<a name="80319-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="08031951000935"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The lack of transparency also leads to a misunderstanding of the nature of the consultation among local residents, and has engendered the belief that the public consultations are a sham.&#148;</p>

The Craigweil-on-Sea branch serves a population in which 38 per cent. are retired and the Aldwick branch serves a population in which 36 per cent. are retired. Nearly 40 per cent. of the residents of Aldwick and Craigweil are over the age of 65 and 5 per cent. are over 85.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08031951000841">It is clear that the Post Office has failed to take into account high concentrations of the elderly and very elderly. The very elderly tend to have abandoned the use of a car, owing to failing eyesight or poor general health, and they struggle to make their way to their local shops and post office on foot, by wheelchair or by scooter. Travelling to the next nearest post office will be impossible for many elderly residents. The next nearest post office to Craigweil is at Rose Green, and getting there would mean walking nearly a mile along a route parts of which have no footpath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08031951000842">Residents in the Beach area of Littlehampton will find themselves having to use the main Crown post office in Littlehampton if the Beach branch is closed. As well as being difficult to get to from there, Littlehampton&#146;s Crown post office is notorious for its lengthy and time-consuming queues; that is consistent with other Crown post offices around the country. The Select Committee said:</p>
<a name="80319-0018.htm_brev5"><a name="08031951000938"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Queuing times at Crown Offices were longer than in most franchised operations (a consideration for frailer customers)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08031951000843">If the Beach branch is to close, I hope that Post Office Ltd will give an undertaking to put extra staff in Crown post offices and provide seating and help for elderly and disabled customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08031951000844">Public transport in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is very poor. Many of the bus services that do exist are infrequent and depend on subsidies from West Sussex county council; those are often reviewed and services are often withdrawn. If the Hawthorn Road and South Bersted branches closed, a large area of residential Bognor Regis would be devoid of any post office branch. Part of that area encompasses two of the most deprived wards in west Sussex; only one third of residents in Pevensey, for example, own a car. Given poor public transport, there is great reliance on post offices remaining local. Closing those two branches would present real difficulties for many residents in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000845">Like many towns in the area, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton have grown from smaller communities that have merged over time. The Beach Town area of Littlehampton was a separate town until development joined it to the rest of Littlehampton. The small parade of shops in that area is a community in itself. If we lose the post office branch run by Bharti and Raj Shah at the back of the grocery store, and if the grocery store goes as well, we will lose the hub of a community in Littlehampton. The same will happen if we lose the post office in Craigweil, which has a parade of shops near the sea and which is cut off from other parts of Bognor Regis. If we lose the shop and the post office, which is run by Barbara and Robin Doe, the whole hub of that community will go as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80319-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08031951000846">In conclusion, the proposed closure plan for the post office network of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton involves a third of the branches&#151;almost double the national figure of 18 per cent. The area has a much higher proportion of the elderly and very elderly, who are the section of the population most dependent on the existence of a locally sited post office. Although the Post Office will have recorded the proportion of retired people living in the area, the closure programme has not taken into account the numbers of very elderly  <br>

With a nationwide loss of 18 per cent. of post offices, the Cotswolds region is losing 12 of its branches&#151;four completely and eight through outreach. That is a quarter of its post office network. Many local businesses depend on their post office. The bus service in the Cotswolds is, in many cases, almost non-existent, so this will hit the elderly and vulnerable particularly hard. Eleven of those 12 post offices&#151;I would like the Minister particularly to listen to this point&#151;have a shop attached to them. If the story first broken in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> is true and the Post Office intends to restrict the business that those shops are allowed to offer as a result of the post office closing, because it might duplicate what the post office originally offered, that would be a further devastating and possibly destabilising blow wreaked by the Government on the highly rural areas in my constituency.</p>

 My hon. Friend&#146;s description of his constituency mirrors much of the experience in mine, where local shops would also close. Moreover, the absence of alternative financial services outlets, with very few banks, means that the post office provides access to financial services for some of the most vulnerable in our community. With that gone, the whole financial inclusion agenda is in serious trouble in rural areas.</p>

I have organised eight well-attended public meetings, and we had a march in the centre of Cirencester at which 500 residents turned up to demonstrate about the fact that if a vast number of extra people have to go to the Crown post office in Cirencester, it will not be able to cope.</p>

and southern edges of my constituency, on the Worcestershire-Warwickshire boundary in the case of Weston-sub-Edge, and on the Wiltshire boundary in the case of Meysey Hampton. The problem there is that because the consultation was done for different areas in different parts of the country, and neither Worcestershire, Warwickshire nor Wiltshire has yet been reviewed, residents are having their post office closed without knowing what the future of the post office in the adjoining county is going to be. I believe that the Government and the Post Office have deliberately staggered the closure programme on that basis to avoid the national outcry that would otherwise take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08031951000854">I should like now to go to the most rural part of my constituency&#151;Temple Guiting and Guiting Power. Those two villages expected that one of their post offices would close and were completely taken aback when they both closed. One of those post offices has just two hours of outreach. I have made representations to the Post Office and to the Minister about the alterations that could be made to that outreach. Will he comment on how it is going to be funded, how long it is likely to last, and what provisions there will be to review it once it is in place and we find that it is not working as well as it might? Those two villages will be joined by residents from Longborough, who are extremely vociferous about their closure, and Blockley, where they are trying to form a co-operative village shop in order to keep their post office open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08031951000855">In the highly likely event that any of the residents affected by all five closures find themselves needing a post office out of outreach hours, they will be forced to go to Bourton-on-the-Water, Stow or Moreton-in-Marsh. I defy the Minister, in the middle of a summer afternoon with a large influx of visitors, to find a car-parking space within two miles of those post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08031951000857">In the limited time left to me, I want to talk about Cirencester, which currently has three branches: one Crown post office, and two sub-post offices. The two sub-post offices are Stratton, which serves 5,400 residents, and the Beeches, which serves 12,300 residents. In the case of Stratton, at my well-attended public meeting of 250 people&#151;I hope that the Minister will bear this in mind&#151;the sub-postmaster, John Lafford, reported two amazing facts. These are on the public record. In January alone, he had a turnover of &#163;468,000&#151;in just one month&#151;and he was offered a payment of &#163;100,000 if he took the post office closure payment, but he wants to stay open because he enjoys serving the community. What a way to go about a closure programme. The Beeches serves 12,300 residents, with another 750 new houses about to be built, but it is scheduled for closure. Surely the Government can think of a more sensible programme than closing such profitable post offices, which is really the politics of the madhouse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08031951000859">I end on this note. Much has been made in this debate about the services that have been run down in our post offices, but I want to ask the Minister what positive proposals he has to introduce new services. I think that I was one of the first Members to mention the idea of having a broadband connection in every post office. If such a connection were provided, a huge amount of information would be available to all my constituents. It is amazing that even elderly constituents are becoming more computer literate every day&#151;a surprising factor. With a little invention, the Post Office could offer a lot of other things. It could offer ATMs, which could be further refined so that they were compatible with the Post Office benefit card; benefit claimants could then draw cash from their own post office. A lot of services could be provided by the Post Office, and as other hon. Members have said, it should be much more free in the amount of services it allows sub-postmasters and mistresses to offer.</p>

It is wrong, and the wrong branches are being closed. I ask him to think again, particularly about the two branches in Cirencester.</p>

 I shall be very brief. Any member of the public reading the Opposition&#146;s motion would find it strange that anyone could vote against it, particularly those who are concerned about their own post offices and what is happening in their constituencies. The suspension of the compulsory closure of sub-post offices while all the issues are reassessed is common sense, and no one should feel that they are being disloyal to their party or the Government in voting for it.</p>

As chair of the all-party group on post offices, I have done everything in my constituency absolutely by the book. London is in the middle of its very short consultation period&#151;I am not sure whether that makes a lot of difference. A suspension would give us more time to oppose the closure of particular sub-post offices. I have gone through all the criteria for my Lambeth Walk post office on Vauxhall street.

Today, we are threatened with yet another closure in the Brampton ward of my constituency. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, we have experienced the closure of a popular and busy post office and its relocation to the upstairs of WH Smith in the centre of the town. It has just opened, and we were genuinely worried about the relocation because of the lifts, the staff, the location and mobility problems for those who are disabled or have children in pushchairs and prams.

It opens for 51 hours a week and completes between 750 and 990 transactions a week at its two service positions. It has level access, provides euros on demand and has an external ATM facility. There is unrestricted parking and a bus stop 100 yd away. Many of those who use the post office are pensioners who do not own a car and do not find mobility easy. The closure of the branch would cause genuine hardship to people in and around the area that I represent in Brampton. There are alternative branches, but they are a considerable distance away&#151;in Long lane, which is more than a mile away, and Wroughton road, which is two thirds of a mile away. They are open for less time and do not have easy access via buses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08031951000871">On Friday 22 February, we held some meetings in my local office with representatives of Post Office Ltd to discuss the proposed closure. I made strong points about the disadvantage it would cause local people. Of course we understand that the Government have been responsible for reducing the Post Office&#146;s opportunities to serve the community&#151;that has been well discussed this afternoon, so I will not repeat those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08031951000872">One of the issues raised by Melanie Corfield, who is head of external relations for the south-east, was the opportunities for new products that the Post Office wants to promote. One of those, which was in its business plan, was financial services. The Post Office extolled the new bond backed by the Bank of Ireland, which it hoped people would buy, thereby creating new development services for it. However, I made the point, strongly and forcefully, that it was difficult for people to get to post offices and therefore difficult for them to use the new services. If post offices are not in communities, there will obviously be a disincentive for people who do not have cars or easy mobility to take up those new opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08031951000873">There are serious concerns about closing branches without considering the needs of local communities. Many local businesses are also concerned about the loss of a facility that they use. I had meetings with many local shopkeepers and businesses that were great users of the services offered by the Brampton road branch. They were concerned about how their businesses would suffer if the branch closed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o486"><a name="08031951000874"><a name="80319-0019.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031951001471"><b>Greg Mulholland (Leeds, North-West) (LD):</b>

 I intend no disrespect to the hon. Gentleman, but we do not have much time and I know that everyone wants to get in. I therefore feel obliged not to take any interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08031951000876">The decisions to close local post offices are misguided and will ultimately damage the Post Office&#146;s business and its reputation. The consultation exercise, which I raised in an intervention on the Secretary of State, is flawed and a sham. Previous consultations, which were well supported by my constituents who want to keep the branch open, have been ignored and rejected by the Post Office. Logical and reasonable arguments about why a post office should remain&#151;because of business, pensioners, transport, distance or community&#151;have all received a blanket rejection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08031951000877">It is no wonder that people feel disengaged from community political activity, when they feel that their voices are not being heard. The fear remains that the Post Office and the Government, who control the service, are out of touch. Both will suffer if we do not place a moratorium on the closures and consider the alternatives. The issue is important throughout the country, no more so than in my constituency and across suburbia and Greater London. The Government should think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08031951000879">Five post offices in my constituency face closure. I disagree with every decision, as one would expect, but in every case I can find flaws in the process and many reasons why the post offices should not close. Two of the post offices proposed for closure are in urban areas; one of them is in Thatcham, an area that suffered the worst flooding in south-east England last July. The community faces not only the closure of its post office, but an enormous influx of new housing, through the redevelopment of an Army base that was vacated some years ago. It seems quite bizarre that the community in south Thatcham should face that closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08031951000880">Other branches are in rural settings, including in the village where I live. I have been using that post office since I could walk, and probably since before then. The anger and frustration at the lack of thought and understanding, and&#151;as I shall explain if I have time&#151;at the lack of humanity behind the process has been profoundly felt by the many thousands of people throughout the community who will be directly affected and by the many more who will be indirectly affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08031951000881">I had a pyrrhic victory in this process at the start of the consultation, in which we virtually got the consultation period extended. In an act that perhaps exemplifies the incompetence with which all this has been done, the Government decided that the six-week consultation period should include Christmas. Post offices are, of course, extremely busy at that time, and people have other things on their mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08031951000882">I would love to use my few minutes to rant and rail against what I perceive to be the wickedness of this decision. That might be cathartic, but it would not be particularly illuminating. To me, this is about much more than the provision of postal services or of post offices in communities. It is about the communities themselves. Those who oppose the motion tabled in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) today will be demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of what makes a community, and of the complex web of relationships and interactions that are the fabric of those communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08031951000883">Later this year, the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 will come into force. I was proud to be a sponsor of that legislation. This is precisely the kind of issue that it was intended to address, and it had universal support across the House. It seems bizarre that the Government, knowing that the Act is about to come into force, cannot delay this process so that local communities can be empowered to make these decisions. That was precisely the purpose of the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08031951000884">The closure programme fits into a pattern. I have bored the House at length on such matters in the past. In fact, my first faltering utterances in this place were about the loss of shops, churches, pubs&#151;for which the Budget sounded another death knell last week&#151;and sporting organisations. I spoke of how they had all been sucked out of smaller communities and moved into towns, and out of smaller towns into larger towns. Every community suffers as a result, as its life blood is sucked out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08031951000885">We could shrug our shoulders and say, &#147;Well, this is the way of things.&#148; That is very much what the Government have done. They have said that the internet has come in, that these post offices are not doing very well, and that that is just the way of things. Well, no. This is about vulnerable people, as has been pointed out by Members  <br>

on both sides of the House. I have only to stand in the post office queue in Newbury&#151;the queue is considerably longer following the suburban post office closure programme in 2005&#151;to see just who those people are. They are the people who cannot buy online. They are the people who pay their soaring heating bills with hard-saved cash. In the Government&#146;s eyes, these people are inconvenient, because they will not conform. They will not go on the internet. They will not leap into a car and drive to the next town when their post office closes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08031951000886">People who live in rural communities and have the temerity to need services&#151;which are, of course, now more expensive and harder to deliver&#151;are also considered inconvenient. I am sure that there are those not far from this building who would like rural communities simply to be places where people sleep, rather than places where real life takes place and where services need to be delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08031951000887">I want to address the important issue of the access criteria. This has really frustrated me. The criteria have been calculated on an as-the-crow-flies basis. They do not take into account road networks or public transport facilities. The Government&#146;s need to hit their closure targets while also meeting the access criteria means that profitable post offices will close, simply because they are in the wrong location. I could take the Minister to post offices in my constituency that are not profitable but will survive. I will not do so, because they would probably then be zoned for closure as well. The lunacy of all this is that profitable post offices in my constituency are going to close. The access criteria, which involve drawing a straight line &#147;as the crow flies&#148;, are utterly devoid of any understanding of how human beings really live and co-exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para30"><a name="08031951000888">As we have heard, the consultation has been a sham. In our case, it has been a fig leaf for a decision that had clearly already been taken. In my last few seconds, I must ask the Minister to address the one-for-one issue. Some weeks ago, I heard him say in this Chamber&#151;I have heard it again today&#151;that the figure involved was up to 2,500. In this building, I had a briefing from the people who were processing the network change programme in my constituency. They said, &#147;If you managed to save a post office in your constituency, that would be fantastic, but we would have to find another one.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80319-0019.htm_para31"><a name="08031951000889">Let me finish with a big plea for the bullying of postmasters and postmistresses in my constituency to stop. If they have put in a pay point, replacing the loss of a post office, they have done so for the vulnerable in the community. Nobody else but the most vulnerable is going to use it. They should not be threatened for doing that; the bullying must stop.</p>

friend from Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), who chairs the all-party sub-post offices group and will also be voting with the Conservatives. There is no need for anyone on this side to feel at all frightened about the prospect of voting with the Conservatives. Let me explain that it is the only option left open to us. It is the only option we have left to stop or suspend the closure programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08031963000016">Let me tell you this, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I participated in a Westminster Hall debate with my Lancashire colleagues, including my friend from Morecambe and Lunesdale. In Lancashire, we face 59 closures and many of my friends spoke about that in the debate. I spoke, too. If I did not vote for the Conservative motion now, I could not look my constituents in the eye; I simply could not, because I railed against the closure programme in that debate. It is no good my colleagues, tucked away in Westminster Hall, speaking with great passion on 4 March only to fail to support the motion before us tonight. My own constituency is losing six post offices. Since I have been its Member of Parliament, we have lost 10. We started out with 28, so the post office network in my Pendle constituency will have been more than halved, which is unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08031963000017">Now is not the time to slag off the Conservatives&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Go on!&#148;] I spend so much of my life doing that, I know, but this is not the time. Let me say this, however. The Conservatives would get more support from the Labour Benches if they were more open with us about the level of subsidy that they would put into the post office network. My friend on the Front Bench here has told us&#151;he told us in Westminster Hall on 4 March as well&#151;that only 4,000 post offices are commercially viable. We have a network of 14,000, which is going down to 11,500, so post offices will always need to be subsidised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08031963000018">I believe that post offices are a social good. They are not just about selling people stamps. The network could not be recreated; if it were smashed, it could not be put together again. There are all sorts of exciting, innovative things we could do with a revivified post office network. Let me finish on this point. I hope that my friends swallow the prejudices of decades or whatever and do the right thing, which is to support the Conservative motion.</p>

Somerset county council area, 30 will close, with another seven downgraded; in the historic county of Somerset, a further 18 will close, making a total of 55 closures across Somerset. Anyone who wants to know what villages are involved could find them in my early-day motion 1036.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08031963000024">I shall concentrate on the seven direct closures in my constituency&#151;in Bayford, Bower Hinton, Holcombe, Keinton Mandeville, Kingsdon, Sparkford and Yeovilton&#151;and two that will be replaced by a van service in Charlton Horethorne and North Cadbury. I feel that I have been fighting the same campaign for 20 or more years&#151;in the House, previously as a county councillor or before that as someone involved in local community politics. It seems to me that we are seeing a constant reduction in the post office network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08031963000025">I know that there were 3,500 closures under the Conservative Government, but I think that the main reason for that was neglect. Now it is happening by design: we are deliberately closing down large parts of the rural post office network. I hear Labour Members talk of the &#147;stability&#148; of the network. It is a strange sort of stability that closes 6,500 sub-post offices. At medical school I used to be told that there was a difference between stability and morbidity. What the Government are proposing is the stability of a corpse. Through a process of bullying and moving business away from post offices, they have created circumstances in which they can say that those post offices are not profitable and must be closed down. I thought that we had won the battle for rural post offices back in 2002. How wrong I was&#151;that was only a temporary lull before the storm that we now face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08031963000026">We know from what has happened so far that public opinion is not enough. We can collect all the signatures that we like. Four million people signed a petition against post office closures, but it did not mean a thing. We can organise local petitions&#151;every parish council in my constituency signed a petition that I presented to the House&#151;and they do not mean a thing. All our local petitions and letters do not mean a thing, because the Government have decreed that the closures will go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08031963000027">I do not think the Government understand why we fight so strongly for local post offices. There are all the social reasons which we have heard already today. We have heard about the people who do not have the comfortable option of getting into their second Volvo to drive to the next town because they do not have that second Volvo, or even the first, and could not drive it if they had it because they are elderly or infirm. Those people cannot find a substitute for the local post office. They do not want their money to be paid into a bank account, because they have never worked on the basis of a bank account. I think the yuppie Ministers have forgotten that there are people in this country who still budget on a week-by-week basis with cash in hand. That is the way those people want to stay, and they need their sub-post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08031963000028">There is, for instance, the community aspect of post offices. The post office is the centre of many village communities, and in many instances it is all that we have left. It is not just postal services that are affected, but all the other activities that are centred on the post office, which is often the last shop in the village. I have been considering the effect of the planned closures in my  <br>

constituency. As a result of the closure in Bower Hinton, people will have to walk two to three miles to Martock, down a steep hill which they will have to climb up when they return. The post office is the last shop in Bower Hinton, so that is in danger as well. When those people arrive in Martock they will find a very successful little post office, but one with permanent queues which is unable to provide any further capacity. Where is the logic in that? Where, moreover, is the environmental logic? We are supposed to have a joined-up Government who take the environment seriously. Where is the environmental logic in people having to drive for miles to reach a post office?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08031963000029">Holcombe has sheltered housing directly opposite the post office, but apparently Post Office Ltd was not aware of it. The post office has always provided a prescription service for the local surgery, and that too will go. As for Kingsdon, I went to a public meeting there at 9 o&#146;clock on Saturday morning. More than 100 people were there; practically everyone in the village had gone to make their point. They were irate, because one of the things that the Post Office had said in the letter it had sent was that there was an alternative in Yeovilton. There are two problems with that alternative. First, it is on the royal naval air station base. People could not get past the two large Marines with machine guns at the gates, but even if they could, Yeovilton is one of the other post offices that are due to close, so it is not a great alternative.</p>

Vans are great&#151;I would love to see mobile post offices dealing with many of the communities that have already lost their post offices&#151;but the problem is that there is no commitment beyond three years, so we will lose our permanent post offices in return for the promise of a mobile service that may disappear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08031963000031">We have six weeks in which to make all those points, and we have been told that we will not have a result at the end of that period because of local elections. As we are not due to have any local elections in Somerset, we understand perfectly well that this is another example of the Government trying to cover their backs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80319-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08031963000032">The key issue is whether we regard post offices purely as commercial undertakings or as a public service. I regard them as a public service. When I hear people say that a particular post office has a small number of customers, I think that for those people it is an essential service, and it does not matter that they live in the country rather than, as would be convenient, in a big city. They should have access to the services that they need. When I am told that post offices have to make a profit, I wonder whether that will soon apply to our schools, roads and our military involvement in Basra. Must they make a profit, or else be closed down? Perhaps we should look at those post offices as a genuine people&#146;s post office. What an insult to run that campaign, when the post office is anything but the people&#146;s post office. It is the Minister&#146;s plaything, and it provides a profit for Post Office Ltd.</p>

I do not think that is too much to ask, and we should keep those post offices open as a genuine people&#146;s post office and a service for the people of this country.</p>

It will be announced in July this year but, given the pattern that is evident across the country, post offices in my constituency will certainly close. I should like to draw the House&#146;s attention to circumstances in the southern part of my constituency, which largely consists of scattered villages. They may well fall within the three-mile limit of the rather silly access criteria in the programme, but as few people fly as the crow does, they are, in fact considerably further apart. I should like to use the village of Pentrefoelas as an example.

 I shall be as brief as possible in order to allow colleagues to make some brief remarks. It was encouraging to hear that hon. Members in all parts of the House appreciate the importance of the branch network of the Post Office, given its social function as well as the Post Office functions. We seem to have complete consensus on that. Rather less encouraging has been the fact that the only vision that many, but by no means all, Labour Members seem to have for the future of the post office network lies in taxpayer subsidy. The whole point of the motion is to suspend the closure programme so that we can examine the possibility of providing additional business opportunities or additional functions for post offices, in order to expand what they are doing, rather than shrink them, as has been happening over the past few years.</p>

The customers who suffered because of one of the first closures were sent to one of the post offices that is in the second round of closures. The distance to walk is much too far, in particular for elderly people. They cannot possibly walk 1 mile on a hill and then have to walk 1 mile back again. For elderly people or for young mothers with buggies and toddlers such distances are simply too far. I have spoken to a lot of elderly people who miss the social aspect of going to the post office every week.

As a result, viable post offices, such as those at Walton-on-the-Naze and Kirby Cross in my constituency&#151;I am sure that my hon.

 My hon. Friend is right. I was expecting customer representation from Postwatch, but at the meeting to which I referred its representative set out the Government and the Post Office&#146;s plans and the reason for them. I began to think I was in the wrong meeting, because there was no pretence of representing the customer. Fortunately, I had another meeting to go to; otherwise it would have got quite heated.

Postwatch told me that the post offices would be closed even if there was a 100 per cent. response. The Post Office said that the consultation was being undertaken to tease out whether or not the right ones were being closed. There is a great misunderstanding among post office users about the meaning of the consultation. The consultation is a sham, people feel cheated and I have no confidence that the petitions I am raising will have any more influence that the ones that I raised during the urban reinvention programme.</p>

The timing of this closure programme flies in the face of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which should empower local people to make decisions on their own post offices and to reflect on the services that they need. The timing is also against the National Assembly&#146;s re-enactment of a post office development fund, which will come into effect next year, after the post offices have gone.

 My hon. Friend is right. In Ceredigion, we have the largest proportion of small businesses of anywhere in Wales, and they rely on the services of the post offices, including the expanded service that hon.

He talked about what happened under the Conservatives, when 3,000 post offices were closed in 18 years. That compares with the 6,000 that have been closed in just over 10 years of this Labour Government&#151;a rate of closure that is three times as high as previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08031963000075">However, the fundamental difference is that the closures under the previous Conservative Government were voluntary, whereas the current ones are enforced. People are having their businesses taken away from them, and they have no choice and no way to stop the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08031963000076">The Secretary of State also said, rather proudly, that there was no subsidy for post offices when the Conservatives were in government, but the figures are clear. In the last few years of our time in office, the Post Office made a profit of between &#163;22 million and &#163;35 million a year. It did not start losing money until 2000, when this Government had had the chance to interfere for a bit. Since then, it has been losing &#163;50 million, &#163;100 million and nearly &#163;200 million a year. The Government do not recognise the difference between the conditions that prevailed when we were in power and those that obtain today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08031963000077">The Secretary of State also said that there are no constraints on the businesses that post offices can carry out, but he should come with me and talk to sub-postmasters. They want to offer PayPoint but have been told that they cannot. They want to work with carriers  <br>

other than Royal Mail&#151;for example, FedEx, UPS and others&#151;but they have been told that they are not allowed to. Moreover, they must face the problem that Royal Mail will go to their biggest customers and persuade them into direct deals that cut post offices out by undercutting the stamp price that those offices are allowed to charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08031963000078">The Secretary of State missed the fundamental point about the constraints being placed on future business, about which so many colleagues spoke in the debate. It is bad enough for people to have their post office taken away, but it is obscene for the Government to put in place measures that will serve to close down the whole shop as well. To tell postmasters and postmistresses that they may no longer operate the national lottery, operate PayPoint terminals or offer the facilities that they have spent years understanding is to do massive damage to the communities that they serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08031963000079">It is one thing for the Post Office to say that people may no longer buy a stamp from a shop, but to say that they will no longer be able to buy their bread and milk there is to go way beyond its powers. In addition, many of the services offered by post offices will simply be moved to the shop next door, if there is one. That means that people will not migrate naturally from the post office that has closed to the one a few miles away; instead, they will simply go to the shop next door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08031963000080">Also discussed were the talks about the one-for-one issue, and the implications of that approach. Perhaps the Secretary of State should look at those figures as well. So far, 671 closures have been announced in those areas where the consultation process has been completed. As a result of what has gone on, 26 offices have been reprieved, and 19 replaced by other post offices being added to the closure list. So seven out of nearly 700 post offices have genuinely been reprieved. Earlier today, the Prime Minister said that that proportion was about 10 per cent. of the total, although I think that it is about 1 per cent. However, if he makes it 10 per cent., maybe that explains why the economy is in such a mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80319-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08031963000081">Many hon. Members have spoken of their concerns about the consultation process. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) said that six weeks might be appropriate for a matter that was not controversial but that it was otherwise too short a period. My hon. Friends the Members for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) and for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) spoke about the factual errors that had been made, and the hon.

It is little wonder that the many people in our constituencies who have gone to public meetings on wet, dark wintry nights, who have signed petitions, who have written letters, who have gone on marches, and who have done everything that they can to preserve the facility that they care about, feel let down by the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08031963000094">The problem with the access criteria is that they are fundamentally flawed. It is simply a matter of somebody at a computer deciding, as a matter of geography, which post offices should close and which stay open. They have failed to take account of major new housing developments and, worse still, they have not paid sufficient attention to hills, public transport links or unsafe roads. It will therefore be vulnerable people, older people and people with disabilities who suffer most. They are the people who depend most on their local post offices, and who will lose out most when the changes are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08031963000095">Let us be in no doubt: this is not the Post Office&#146;s policy. This is the Government&#146;s closure programme, because they decided how many post offices should close. They decided what the funding package and access criteria should be, and they decided which rules apply to the businesses that many people may continue once their post office has closed down. The Government can, if they wish, tonight instruct the Post Office to stop the programme.</p>

We welcome change, but we have a vision for the post office network; it should be sustained by new business, freed from the restrictions that tie it down today, and increasingly become a hub for local council and government services. However, that is not what the change programme is delivering; it is dismantling an important, much-loved service. We do not object to change, but we do object to the change that the Government are proposing, the flawed access criteria, the shortened consultation process, the lack of vision for future business and the appalling restrictions on future business activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para5"><a name="08031963000098">This comes down to a question of trust. If we want people to have faith in their politicians, they must believe that politicians will not say one thing in their constituency on behalf of their communities, and vote against those words in the House of Commons. Constituents will not understand how MPs told them that they were on their side, but when they had the chance to vote against closures, they failed to do so. MPs will have failed their constituents, and they will have failed to live up to the standards that people should rightly expect of their Member of Parliament. Worse still, they will have turned their back on the elderly and others who are most in need. That betrayal of the most vulnerable people in their constituency will haunt them for the rest of their career.</p>

 We have seen from the debate today the strong feelings that post office closures can arouse not only in the House, but in local communities. I understand that, as do the Government.

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para6"><a name="08031963000100">There is the subsidy of &#163;150 million a year, without which thousands more post offices would be under threat. There is other support in the package of &#163;1.7 billion up till 2011&#151;support to cover losses over and above those that the subsidy covers, support to enable new outreach services to provide post office services in new ways, and other support that adds up to significant backing for the Post Office up to 2011.

Without the backing that the Government give to the Post Office, which was not there when the Conservatives were in power, a commercial network would consist of only about 4,000 branches. So when the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) says that it is not just a commercial service, we agree. That is why we have put so much public backing behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para15"><a name="08031963000124">People have a choice about how to pay their car tax, and 1 million a month choose to renew it online&#151;half of them outside the normal office hours of 9 to 5. More people are paying bills by direct debit and there is, of course, the issue of competition. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) made a serious speech about competition and its challenge to the Post Office. Unlike Conservative Members, he realises that that is a big challenge when it comes to winning business such as bill and television licence payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para16"><a name="08031963000127">The Opposition say that they want to make the issue go away. The issue is not just about the profitability of the post offices, but about what the Opposition would do about how benefits are paid. Are they really saying that they will turn back the clock and pay benefits and pensions by girocheque when the vast majority of people choose to pay them directly into the bank? Doing that would add a further &#163;200 million of costs a year. If they are not saying that, why do they not accept that the Post Office faces those major challenges?</p>

Friends the Members for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) and Hastings and Rye. I acknowledge that there has been dissatisfaction and disquiet about the consultation process. Representations have been made that we should extend it from six weeks to 12, but six weeks was the period used during the last period of post office closures and is the period agreed between Postwatch and Post Office Ltd in their code of practice&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but there is too much noise in the House. We have had a full debate and the Minister is entitled to make a reply that can be heard.</p>

<p><a name="st_o528"><a name="08031963000133"><a name="80319-0022.htm_spnew20"><a name="08031963001877"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para19"><a name="08031963000134">Many hon. Members talked about the consultation, which is about how, not whether, this is to be done. The Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform picked up on that in its most recent report, and it was right to do so. Post Office Ltd must be clearer that that is the question before the people, because that is what is producing some of the frustration in local communities. Hon. Members have expressed confusion about this. Let me quote the letter that was sent to all hon. Members back in July, before the process began. It said that the consultation</p>
<a name="80319-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="08031963001804"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would not concern the principle of the need for change of the network, nor its broad extent and distribution...rather consultation will be seeking representations on the most effective way in which government policy can best be implemented in the area in question&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="st_o529"><a name="08031963000135"><a name="80319-0022.htm_spnew21"><a name="08031963001878"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 Given that the Minister will not change his policy on delaying consultation, will he at least instruct the Post Office to ensure that it gives all the information to Members of Parliament so that the individual merits of every post office can be in the public domain and we can win an argument on the basis of the facts?</p>

<p><a name="st_o530"><a name="08031963000136"><a name="80319-0022.htm_spnew22"><a name="08031963001879"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 As I have said, the Post Office needs to be clearer about the consultation and about the question before people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para20"><a name="08031963000137">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone and the hon. Members for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) and for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), among others, mentioned the access criteria. Let me be clear. Those criteria represent a minimum, and Government funding is to fund the network to a much higher extent than that minimum would require. In plans so far&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o531"><a name="08031963000138"><a name="80319-0022.htm_spnew23"><a name="08031963001880"><b>Dr. McCrea</b>
<i>  rose&#151;</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o532"><a name="08031963000139"><a name="80319-0022.htm_spnew24"><a name="08031963001881"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 I am afraid that I do not have time to give way again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para21"><a name="08031963000140">To give some sense of perspective, let me say that 99 per cent. of people will either see no change in the post office that they use or be within a mile of an alternative post office. If we followed the advice of Conservative Members by abandoning the access criteria and closing only the post offices that are least used, vast areas of rural Britain would be without post office provision at all, and those are precisely the areas that hon. Members say that they are interested in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80319-0022.htm_para22"><a name="08031963000141">Some local authorities, for example in Essex&#151;not in Swindon, unfortunately, despite the efforts of the local MPs&#151;have expressed interest in taking over post offices scheduled for closure. We have said that the Post Office should sit down and discuss that seriously with those local authorities. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to the chief executive of Post Office Ltd today saying that that should happen, and if local authorities are interested they should have those discussions. The Post Office will expect to recover all costs, but that is a serious conversation that should take place.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak tonight. I am increasingly of the opinion that Adjournment debates are like buses&#151;you wait for one a long time, then two or three come along at once. The House may be aware that I secured an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall last week on the important issue of the banning of looped blind cords. Tonight, I wish to raise another important issue, and although I am certainly not complaining about the opportunity I have been given, some of my staff are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para2"><a name="08031963001287">To get down to business, tonight&#146;s debate is on an important issue. It has been in the headlines recently, but I am concerned we should not allow the sometimes divisive issue of organ donation to slip off the radar. I have been working closely with a local paper in my constituency, <i> The Alloa Advertiser</i>, since the end of January to try to promote the positive benefits of an opt-out system, and to encourage donors to sign up to the existing system to ensure that those in need of organs are given the best possible chance of life. As I said a few moments ago, there is a national focus on the issue, but as with everything, it is transient. We need to keep focused on this issue, as people&#146;s lives depend on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para3"><a name="08031963001288">Perhaps I should spend a little time outlining why we have a severe shortage of organs. We are living longer, and conditions that would have killed us some years ago are managed and controlled. That is a good thing, but it creates a twofold pressure. First, some of the conditions with which we live require transplants and, secondly, as we live longer, fewer people are dying, which in itself creates a reduction in the number of organs for transplant. In addition, road deaths are less than half what they were in the 1970s despite, as we all know, a great increase in the numbers of cars and, indeed, a population increase. It is great that our roads and our cars are safer&#151;and we must strive to make them even safer&#151;but the statistics highlight a great pressure on available organs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para4"><a name="08031963001289">I believe the current system is too restrictive, as it does not meet the increasing demands placed on it. Quite simply, the organ donor rate in the UK is unacceptably low, with most European countries having a much higher rate than us&#151;some of them twice or even three times the UK rate. We have reached a point where there is public demand for change. I believe that there is a desire for change in the House, too, which is demonstrated by early-day motion 967 in my name, which has attracted the signatures of 52 fellow Members. There are more than 7,000 people in the UK on waiting lists for organ donations, and more than 400 people die each year still waiting&#151;more than one person a day. In Clackmannanshire, which forms part of my seat, four people have died in the past five years waiting for transplants. Bodies are buried or cremated complete with organs that could have been used to save lives, not necessarily because the deceased objected to donation, but simply because they never got round to signing up to the organ donor register or informing their relatives of their wishes.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, I used to work in the health service, and it was traumatic for relatives to hear us explain the death of someone in a road traffic accident or of someone who suffered a coronary, and then to hear us ask whether we could take organs for the benefit of other individuals. That is unacceptable in this day and age.</p>

<p><a name="st_o540"><a name="08031963001291"><a name="80319-0024.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031963002993"><b>Gordon Banks:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. What he says is true and important, and I shall come on to explain how a soft opt-out system would make the initial conversation between the organ donation co-ordinators and the bereaved family more palatable. A new soft opt-out system would go a long way towards alleviating the stress my hon. Friend mentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para5"><a name="08031963001292">While many of us say we would be prepared to donate our organs, not many of us have done anything about it. Studies have shown that 90 per cent. of the population support organ donation, yet only 25 per cent. are registered as donors. In Clackmannanshire, the figures reveal that 13,497 people are on the organ donation register, but if we equate that to the 90 per cent. statistic there are still about 30,000 potential recruits. People are more likely to need a transplant than they are to become an organ donor. Given that this research shows that the majority of people would be willing to donate, presuming consent rather than presuming objection is more likely to achieve the aim of respecting the wishes of the deceased person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para6"><a name="08031963001293">I have had an interest in this area for a while, and certainly long before I entered Parliament. Colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have campaigned relentlessly on the issue, particularly Dr. Richard Simpson and Lord Foulkes. I carry an organ donor card, but I have been concerned for a while that not enough has been done to encourage people to sign up and to make people aware of the desperate need for organs in the UK. For example, my wife, who works in the NHS, would be very willing for her organs to be used, but she has not got&#151;and is unlikely ever to go about signing up for&#151;a donor card. I suspect there are many people in that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para7"><a name="08031963001294">The lack of awareness of the demand for organs must also be addressed for the sake of the thousands of people on the waiting list. I have met a couple of people in my constituency who are on the list. Sarah Murray from Sauchie is 23 years old and suffers from cystic fibrosis. She has been waiting 18 months&#151;well above the average waiting time&#151;for a double lung transplant, and she told me about the difficulties that she daily faces. Simple tasks such as housework or walking the distance between two lamp posts are difficult, if not impossible. She has lived with this disease all her life, and it has affected her schooling and means she is unable to work. She has not had the opportunities that most of the rest of us have had. She may have gone on to university. Who knows what potential might have been released? A transplant will release that potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para8"><a name="08031963001295">I spoke last week in my other Adjournment debate to which I referred earlier about wasted potential, and here I find myself raising it again. The decisions we make on issues such as organ donation will allow so many of our young people to realise their potential. Sarah has always wanted to be a nurse, but has been  <br>

held back by her condition. A transplant would give Sarah the opportunity to study nursing and pay back to the very system that saved her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para9"><a name="08031963001296">I am glad that the Government are making moves to tackle the chronic shortage of organ donors by welcoming the findings of the recent organ donation taskforce report. Let me be clear: I also support the report&#146;s findings, but I firmly believe we need to move to an opt-out system as soon as possible. The report raised some important issues, and over the past few weeks I have been questioning the Department on a wide range of matters relating to organ donation. I hope the Minister will be able to address some of them. I know that the Prime Minister has agreed in principle to adopt the report&#146;s recommendations, which if implemented could see a 50 per cent. increase in UK organ donors. However, changes may be some months away, so I believe it is important that we lay down some strong foundations now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para10"><a name="08031963001297">There should also be an increased role for GPs in discussing with patients the option of organ donation. I have been visiting my GP for over 50 years and not once has the issue been discussed. I know that this must be handled carefully, but I firmly believe that we must address the role of GPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para11"><a name="08031963001298">Funding of &#163;11 million has been made available for 2008-09, with significant additional funding identified for subsequent years. In response to a written question on 29 February the Minister informed me that discussion with stakeholders has started to agree what further action, such as research, public awareness campaigns, training and work force requirements, would be needed to enable each recommendation to be implemented. I hope that the Minister can tell the House in greater detail how the discussions are progressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para12"><a name="08031963001299">We must couple the implementation of an opt-out system with the recruitment of extra transplant co-ordinators to ensure that all suitable organs are harvested. The taskforce report has called for 100 co-ordinators to help relieve the strain on the existing co-ordinators, many of whom work shifts in excess of 24 hours without a break.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para13"><a name="08031963001300">If a change is to take place, we need to ensure that an adequate level of investment and expertise is utilised. Unless we have the people who are properly trained, and transplant co-ordinators who are available 24 hours a day, we will find ourselves in a very difficult position.</p>

 May I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the wonderful work of the late John Cox, his wife Rosemary and their daughter Christine following the death of Peter Cox? They were instrumental in persuading the then Government to set up the national register of donors. One of the reasons insufficient organs are available is that even if the deceased has expressly consented to organ donation, his or her relatives can posthumously block the donation and refuse consent. The relatives&#146; power of veto should be reconsidered in order to increase the supply of organs.</p>

system that he mentions. It has a high level of uptake and availability of organ donations, so he makes a strong argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para14"><a name="08031963001303">There is a need for investment in the short term, but the sooner the extra money is found, the better, as there will be long-term savings for the national health service and improvements in people&#146;s quality of life. I recognise that increased funding for transplants has been allocated by the Government: heart and lung funding has increased by almost &#163;8 million since 2002; liver funding has almost doubled since 1997; and pancreas transplant services&#146; funding has more than doubled since 2004 to more than &#163;8 million. That investment is very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para15"><a name="08031963001304">Last month, I visited the renal unit at Falkirk and District royal infirmary and found out that it costs the NHS on average &#163;400 per treatment. If people require three treatments per week, as my constituent Anne Duncombe does, we are talking about more than &#163;1,000 a week, possibly for many years. The cost benefit of a kidney transplant is staggering&#151;the NHS is &#163;241,000 better off over a 10-year period for every transplant patient. No one has to be an economist to see the real financial value to the NHS of a transplant, never mind the ability of the recipient to work, pay taxes and improve their quality of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para16"><a name="08031963001305">Dialysis is not just a financial burden; it can often mean 18 to 20 hours per week to people if time for treatment, travelling and so on is taken into account. The renal unit at Falkirk and District royal infirmary is treating more and more patients from throughout the Forth valley owing to the ever-increasing demand for organs. The unit has almost doubled in size since it opened in 1999. It now treats 100 dialysis patients, but only one in four of them each year receive the kidney that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para17"><a name="08031963001306">A lot of money could be allocated elsewhere if a successful opt-out system were launched. Each region should have a dedicated team ready to operate when needed to remove organs, and there should also be a national database prioritising organs that are urgently required, particularly for children. Another important point is that we must ensure that any attempts at political separation in the UK do not detract from the need to have a UK-wide solution to the organ donation issue.</p>

 Like me, my hon. Friend represents a Scottish constituency. I am sure that he is fully aware that health is devolved to the Scottish Executive. Can he tell us what their view is on his proposals?</p>

<p><a name="st_o544"><a name="08031963001308"><a name="80319-0024.htm_spnew6"><a name="08031963002997"><b>Gordon Banks:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. The transplant situation in Scotland is governed by the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006. There are noises from the Scottish Executive that they are minded to favour a soft opt-out, but we will have to wait to see whether they deliver. The situation in the rest of the UK is governed by an Act passed in 2004, and my hon. Friend will note the two-year disparity. We cannot allow such a disparity if the situation is changed in the rest of the UK and Scotland is left behind.</p>

tell my constituents that their chance of receiving an organ transplant has been drastically cut, because we can harvest them only from Scotland? I hope that no one ever has to utter such words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para19"><a name="08031963001310">Therefore I am pleased that the NHS Blood and Transplant Authority has commissioned work to develop and design an electronic system for offering donor organs throughout the United Kingdom. I understand from the Department&#146;s reply to one of my written questions that this system will be ready to go live in September this year. I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that this is an important step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para20"><a name="08031963001311">The organ donation taskforce took note of the systems being implemented by some of our European neighbours, such as Spain, where a change in the law and the necessary reform in the health service has boosted the number of organs available for transplant. The organ donation rate in Spain is 35 per cent., compared with 13 per cent. here in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para21"><a name="08031963001312">It is important here to distinguish between the number of people carrying cards and on the register, which is 25 per cent., and the number of organs used in transplant, which is 13 per cent. There could be many explanations for this disparity. We may die in the &#147;wrong way&#148;, organs from potential donors may be incompatible with those in need at that time, and many people carrying donor cards may be young people who are encouraged to sign up when they apply for their driving licence. Their organs are unlikely to be available for many years to come. So a 25 per cent. base of card-carrying donors delivers only half that number of organs for transplant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para22"><a name="08031963001313">Hard-hitting campaigns are being launched here in the UK, particularly the &#147;Live or die? You choose&#148; campaign, which is on our television screens now. I praise the work of the NHS Blood and Transplant Authority, but there is a limit to how effective such campaigns can be when our organ donation system is so fractured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para23"><a name="08031963001314">Every hon. Member will know that changes in the law can often be slow and cumbersome, but the longer we wait, the more lives we put at risk. I encourage all hon. Members to put this message across in their local media, so that we can raise the profile of this issue. Members could promote their constituency office as a place where people could come along to sign up to become organ donors; launch campaigns in the local press and highlight the plight of those waiting for organs; go out and meet those in their constituency who are waiting for a transplant; and look at the facilities and speak with staff at their local hospital. It is only by putting across the human side that we will encourage more people to come forward as organ donors. We need to raise awareness and encourage the public to sign up to help others in need by giving them the gift of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para24"><a name="08031963001315">Some hon. Members will be aware that in my Adjournment debate last week I highlighted the issue of the dangers associated with looped blind cords and the tragic death of a toddler in my constituency, Muireann McLaughlin. Muireann&#146;s parents, at a time of tremendous grief, decided to help to give the gift of life to another when two of Muireann&#146;s heart valves were donated. That ties in with recommendation 12 made by the organ  <br>

donation taskforce that there should be some way to recognise the brave decisions of parents in such situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para25"><a name="08031963001316">As with any issue, there is always an opposing view. I understand and sympathise with that view, and whether it is held on moral or religious grounds it is equally valid. There should be a database of people who do not want their organs to be used for transplant, giving people the opportunity to opt out. If someone felt strongly enough, I am certain they would ensure their name was on the database. It sounds tough and harsh, but so are the deaths of 400 people per year, many of whom are children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para26"><a name="08031963001317">It is not a case of nationalising organs, as has been suggested in the past. People waiting for organs get very angry at those who take that view. It is a case of trying to save lives using all means possible. With a soft opt-out, donation would become the default position. The introduction of a soft system of presumed consent would represent a shift in emphasis in favour of donation without major changes to practice. It would respect the wishes of potential donors and the sensitivities of their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para27"><a name="08031963001318">To sum up, I hope that I have put a case that outlines the need for a change to our system of organ donation. I urge hon. Members to sign early-day motion 967, which is in my name, and urge the Government to move to an opt-out system with the necessary structural changes in the service as quickly as possible. There are enough organs in the UK to satisfy demand, and it is simply the system that holds us back from transplanting them into those who need them. It is my hope that the Minister will address the issues I have raised, and also propose some time scales for when we can look to take the organ donation taskforce&#146;s proposals forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="80319-0024.htm_para28"><a name="08031963001319">As I mentioned earlier, the longer we wait the more lives we put at risk. As a responsible country, we cannot and should not allow this.</p>

Transplantation is one of medicine&#146;s great success stories. As my hon. Friend knows, the Government are absolutely committed to increasing the number of organs available for transplantation so that many more people can benefit from that life-saving procedure and, as he so graphically said, release the potential of the individuals who have that potential thwarted because of the limitations caused by their being unable to secure a transplant.</p>

Friend but those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine), who illustrated from his professional experience the added difficulties and strains in the health service.

patients whom they believe are never likely to receive a suitable organ because there is such a limited supply of organs for transplant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para1"><a name="08031963001323">I, too, want to pay tribute to the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)&#151;the late John Cox and his wife Rosemary&#151;who have done so much to advance the achievement of a sensible situation in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para2"><a name="08031963001324">The gap highlighted between the number of those who require transplants and the number of available organs led my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), when she was Health Minister, to set up the organ donation taskforce. The taskforce&#146;s membership was drawn from a wide range of specialties and interests, including media, diversity issues and the voluntary sector. It undertook a thorough and productive period of research to identify the barriers to organ donation and how they might be overcome. Like my hon. Friends, I carried a card for a long time and I am on the register. So few people appreciate the simplicity of the registration process and how it makes organs available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para3"><a name="08031963001325">The taskforce looked at evidence from Europe and the US, but especially from Spain. The evidence from Spain was very important because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire noted, Spain has the highest rate of organ donation in the world, at around 33 per million people. In contrast, the UK has one of the lowest donation rates in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para4"><a name="08031963001326">In addition, many aspects of the Spanish model have been successfully imported to other areas, such as northern Italy and certain parts of South America. It is therefore clear that we need to look at the formula that is used in Spain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para5"><a name="08031963001327">The taskforce has recommended that the UK adopt the sort of broad-based approach to be found in Spain. It said that there needs to be investment in infrastructure and that the UK must ensure it maximises its potential for donation rates. That includes establishing a UK-wide organ donor organisation as part of the NHS blood and transplant service, a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para6"><a name="08031963001328">The taskforce also said that we needed a dedicated and strengthened network of organ retrieval teams to work with hospitals&#146; critical care teams. It added that the number of front-line co-ordinators working with families and the hospitals that donate and receive organs should be doubled to around 100&#151;exactly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston. Moreover, it said that all parts of the NHS should embrace organ donation as usual business, not as an unusual event, and that is precisely the point that my hon. Friend made about GPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para7"><a name="08031963001329">Other recommendations from the taskforce were that donor activity in all health trusts should be monitored, and that all clinical and nursing staff likely to be involved in treating potential organ donors should receive mandatory training in donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para8"><a name="08031963001330">My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire rightly spoke about funding, and the House will know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced on 16 January that all the recommendations from the taskforce would be accepted. To enable their implementation, extra funding of   <br>

&#163;11 million has been made available for 2008-09, with more to follow in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para9"><a name="08031963001331">Organ donation is an area of medicine that necessitates a high degree of co-ordination across the UK. For example, an organ donated in Glasgow, Cardiff or Belfast may be transplanted into a patient in London, or vice versa. It is therefore essential that a UK-wide approach is maintained, and that is the strong message that we have received from the taskforce. All the Ministers in the four UK health Departments have welcomed the taskforce&#146;s recommendations, and are implementing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para10"><a name="08031963001332">My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire rightly touched on the need to oversee the delivery of the recommendations. I am therefore pleased to announce that Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of the NHS, has agreed to head the group tasked with taking forward their implementation. We have already held discussions with a number of organisations so that early progress can be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para11"><a name="08031963001333">My hon. Friend mentioned matters to do with presumed consent that are outside the taskforce&#146;s original remit. Under the current system, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West noted, families do not have a legal right of veto over a decision made by a donor when he or she was alive. Any system that we put in place must be aimed at helping people who wish to be donors to have their wish carried out, and that is something that will need to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para12"><a name="08031963001334">Clearly, the taskforce&#146;s work does not end there. The UK&#146;s chief medical officers will need to take the work forward, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear that he has asked the taskforce to consider the potential impact of introducing an opt-out system for organ donation. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said that he thinks now is the time for a public debate on the matter, and that we should move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para13"><a name="08031963001335">I have sympathy with those who want a change to the opt-out system as a step towards putting into practice the wishes of the many people who we know support the idea of donation in principle. It is important that when we develop that idea we find ways to move towards a system that helps people to donate and helps their wishes to be fulfilled, but also takes into consideration the views of others who may not wish to be covered by presumed consent. That needs to be done delicately, swiftly, and accurately if we are to meet the objectives of my hon. Friends present today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="80319-0025.htm_para14"><a name="08031963001336">I am delighted that all UK Governments have been able to commit to taking forward the recommendations. I am delighted that the taskforce, with its considerable expertise, is turning its attention to an opt-out system of presumed consent. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire, I look forward to the day, which I hope will come soon, when we have an agreed procedure that satisfies all, regardless of their views on organ donation, and that ensures that we match the Spanish rates and so help people to live fulfilled lives, rather than lives that are wasted because organs are not available. I commend the work of my hon. Friends to the House.</p>
