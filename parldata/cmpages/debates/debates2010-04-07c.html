 Would the Minister agree that it is highly ironic that at a time when the Government-with everyone's support-are seeking through their commitment to offshore wind development, for example, to encourage major inward investment in manufacturing in the highland economy from firms such as KBR at Nigg, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' approach to small and medium-sized businesses is driving the likes of Highland Airways, Gaeltec on Skye and others to the wall with the result that the savings accruing to the public purse are more than wiped out by the additional costs of unemployment and all the other benefits that will have to be paid?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that the Inland Revenue has not been helpful to Scottish businesses given that its own business payment support service has helped more than 18,000 firms in Scotland, with deferred payments of tax totalling more than £300 million. That, I think, is one of the "real help" ways in which we have assisted small businesses. The package announced in this year's Budget will give £2.5 billion to small businesses and includes a doubling of their investment allowances. We have a good track record in helping businesses and especially in helping growth in new jobs from which the highlands and islands, in particular, will benefit.</p>

 When I was a Northern Ireland Minister, I organised an 11-city tour of the United States to try to bring jobs and inward investment to Northern Ireland. Nationalists were involved in those visits, but they did not try to sell the message of trying to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom. Might I suggest to my hon.

 The highlands and islands economy has indeed been damaged by Labour's many fuel tax hikes. The increased tax on cider has been scrapped; can we have the same again for fuel in the Hebrides, please? HMRC's actions have pushed Highland Airways to the wall. As a result, people in Lewis and Harris are now having to wait until late afternoon before they get their newspapers. What will the Labour Government do to make amends for their actions?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman should look at the facts of the case. Sadly, Highland Airways had substantial trading difficulties and many more debts beyond that owing to HMRC. Unfortunately, a takeover was not possible at the last moment and the company went into liquidation, but I understand that the services to the Western Isles are being maintained by Loganair and other services are also being taken account of. We are working hard to help the employees of Highland Airways find new work under the PACE-partnership action for continuing employment-scheme. That is the best and most practical way in which we can help companies and businesses suffering from the recession.</p>

 The Minister's answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) shows just how out of touch she and her ministerial colleagues have become. In the last two years, a quarter of corporate insolvencies in Scotland have been enforced by HMRC. Literally thousands of Scots have lost their jobs because the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been unable to translate his good intentions on managing HMRC into hard, effective action. Does not that embarrass the Minister even slightly?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman should remember that output in the highlands and islands has risen by 75 per cent. since the Labour Government were elected in 1997, and there are 220,000 more jobs in Scotland since we were elected in 1997. Through our real help to businesses, including the business support scheme, which I again point out has benefited more than 18,000 small businesses in Scotland, we have helped to keep people on the road and to get Scotland into recovery.</p>

 It is interesting to note that the unemployment rates in the hon. Gentleman's constituency are among the lowest in the United Kingdom. That is because of Labour policies, which are creating jobs and supporting people through the recession. The future jobs fund has benefited more than 10,500 people in Scotland by helping them and keeping them close to the job market. It is because of the UK's policies, taking the tough decisions that the Liberal Democrats would care to ignore, that we have got through this recession much quicker than they would have.</p>

 The hon. Lady might be aware that there was recently a case in the Supreme Court regarding the competency of the legislation of the Scottish Parliament. I think that would provide valuable guidance. At the end of the day, when we have difficulties in terms of our relationship with the Scottish Government, we have very detailed procedures with joint ministerial committees in which we can work together to find solutions to problems rather than necessarily considering court action. The fact that the Advocate-General has not needed to take one single case to the Supreme Court since devolution is a symbol of its success.</p>

 The Scottish Parliament is one of the great democratic innovations and constitutional changes of recent decades, but the Government and the Calman commission believe that there is an in-built weakness in its architecture, in that it is responsible for spending money but not for raising enough of it.

 My hon. Friend, as always, is short, succinct and to the point. He is absolutely accurate. We are determined not to repeat the errors of the 1980s and 1990s recession. That is why we are helping young people in particular to get back into work. That is why we are growing jobs with our green investment bank.

In the past year, Labour has wiped £4.8 billion off the value of the Scottish economy. Since 1997, Scotland's share of the national debt has more than doubled, and almost 150,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. Those are facts; there is little that the Minister and the Secretary of State can do about them now, but will she take this last opportunity at the Dispatch Box to apologise to the people of Scotland?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman said that there was no answer to the last question, but it is he who has never given an answer on any single policy. As far as pension funds are concerned, we debated the matter in this House two years ago, and the shadow Chancellor put the case that the dividend tax credit had affected the ability of pension funds to have money. I showed at that time that during the period before the stock market crash, what had actually happened was that the resources of the pension funds had doubled.

What we have done is give 2 million pensioners a pension tax credit, and have given them dignity in retirement-again, that was opposed by the Conservative Government. What we now have is a national concessionary fare scheme that gives pensioners the chance to travel the country; that would be at risk under a Conservative Government.</p>

The Bill presents a series of policy solutions to certain complex and interconnected challenges that are currently before us. The complete resolution of all the issues outlined in the Bill will require interdepartmental co-operation in Whitehall and intergovernmental co-operation internationally. Fundamentally, however, the genesis of the solutions to these problems lies constitutionally and legally in Parliament, but technically and physically at Sellafield, in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10040729000201">The Bill covers seven areas: the cost of nuclear decommissioning to the taxpayer; the potential of publicly owned nuclear facilities and materials to generate significant commercial revenue; the continuation of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing; the establishment of a new mixed oxide fuel manufacturing facility at Sellafield; the significant effect of that on the final radioactive waste inventory for the national deep geological depository; the management and governance of non-British radioactive materials in Britain; and, perhaps most importantly, the significant help that the proposals would give to our nuclear non-proliferation objectives.</p>

NDA recently announced its business plan for the new financial year. It has a budget of £2.8 billion, £1.5 billion of which will be spent at Sellafield. This is all public money, and the rise in spending since the creation of the NDA has been both dramatic and profound. By way of illustration, when I left Sellafield in 2005, its annual budget was just below £900 million. The fact that we need to spend £1.5 billion of public money at Sellafield in this financial year is beyond doubt and, in my view, non-negotiable. However, the principal question for any time-but even more so as we build economic recovery and emerge from recession-is whether all that money should come directly from the public purse. Is there not another or an additional way in which the money can be found? The answer is yes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10040729000204">The potential of publicly owned nuclear facilities and materials to generate significant commercial revenue at Sellafield is enormous. The thermal oxide reprocessing plant, or THORP, at Sellafield is the single largest yen earner in the British economy. The plant is of vital strategic importance not only to the UK nuclear industry but to the UK as a whole, as it provides services that few facilities in the world can offer. Current reprocessing contracts at THORP-depending on operational performance-are scheduled to end in approximately 2020. THORP reprocesses spent nuclear fuel, separating out the reusable uranium and plutonium as oxides which are then capable of being made into mixed oxide-MOX-fuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10040729000205">As the nuclear industry expands across the globe-no one can now doubt the reality or speed of that expansion-the marketplace for the services that THORP can provide continues to grow. This is not a hypothetical marketplace; it exists now, and potential customers are showing genuine interest in pursuing the route that I am outlining. It is incumbent on us as a nation to extract every single penny of value from the facilities at Sellafield, such as THORP and the Sellafield MOX plant, which have been so heavily invested in by the British taxpayer. These facilities are enormous assets, and they can and should be used as income generators, and the derived income could and should be used to limit the decommissioning costs to the public purse. This is not just sensible; it is just, fair and in the public interest. There is therefore a copper-bottomed case for continuing reprocessing at THORP beyond 2020, and it is now in our interests aggressively to seek and pursue the commercial opportunities that exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10040729000206">In addition, there exist at Sellafield tens of thousands of tonnes of uranium dioxide and approximately 100 tonnes of plutonium oxide. Consultations are under way on how to classify these materials. Put simply, there is a stark choice to be made: the materials are either wastes or assets. If they are classified as wastes, it will cost billions of pounds of public money to treat, store and dispose of them. If, however, they are classified as assets-which they undeniably are-their value as component materials to service the growing international demand for MOX fuel will be enormous, and they will be worth tens of billions of pounds to the British taxpayer and to the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para10"><a name="10040729000207">There is real interest from certain parties in developing a new MOX fuel manufacturing plant at Sellafield, and this should be pursued in the national interest. Using plutonium and uranium oxides in that way would certainly change the nature of the radioactive waste inventory  <br>

that will eventually be placed into a deep geological facility somewhere in this country-potentially in my constituency. That decision would be entirely in the hands of local people, not politicians, but the status of the nuclear fuel cycle and the final inventory will inevitably have an effect on the process and on public attitudes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para11"><a name="10040729000208">So there is clearly an issue of definition with regard to British and non-British radioactive wastes. The definition is a simple one, and the legally binding substitution arrangements that Britain has with its overseas customers work well. This is a prescriptive and demanding process, and it should be so. However, such is the nature of the constitutional change experienced by this country that new draft arrangements should now be established for the management, storage and governance of the radioactive materials currently stored at Sellafield, in case the definition of Britain changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para12"><a name="10040729000209">Clearly, as a British facility, Sellafield currently stores and treats materials that are generated within Scotland as part of the United Kingdom-and it has done so for many years. The arrangement works well. However, should the Scottish people opt to leave the United Kingdom-in my view, that is their inalienable right-these materials will cease to be classified as British. Such a move would mean that all Scottish radioactive waste stored and treated in Britain would have to be reclassified. Such a move would necessarily require new environmental, economic and policy arrangements. Potentially, all Scottish materials could have to be returned to Scotland at the cost of billions of pounds to the Scottish taxpayer. Such a move would probably require the creation of an independent Scottish Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, an independent Scottish regulator and an independent Scottish deep geological repository, and more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para13"><a name="10040729000210">Alternatively, Britain could enter into entirely new arrangements for Scotland and establish a commercial  <br>

arrangement whereby Scotland paid Britain for its waste to be treated and stored-again, at the cost of billions of pounds to the Scottish taxpayer, but again, the revenue could be used to accelerate decommissioning in Britain or to offset the costs to the British taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10040729000211">There are many more scenarios, and I hope that officials from the Scottish Government and Whitehall can meet soon to discuss potential eventualities and to develop a mutual way forward. These issues must be addressed in a calm, rational and consensual manner. To this end, I have written to the Scottish First Minister in the hope that we can begin this dialogue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="100407-0004.htm_para15"><a name="10040729000212">Finally, the strengthening of the industrial base, which facilitates the nuclear fuel cycle in this country, provides us with the single best chance we have of not only meeting our own nuclear non-proliferation objectives, but helping others, particularly the United States, to meet theirs as well. The same skilled work force, academic base, industrial supply chain and industrial practices that will and should help us to exploit our nuclear fuel cycle technologies are the same as those that will help us to put nuclear weapons materials beyond use. We owe it to ourselves and to existing and future generations to do this, and we owe it to the taxpayers of this country to maximise every drop of value from the nuclear investments they have made. My constituents deserve nothing less.</p>

This motion will enable the House to conclude the passage of legislation before the general election. It allows the House a truncated process for concluding the consideration of Government Bills that have completed all their stages in one House and have had at least a Second Reading in the Second House. It also provides for the Finance Bill and Appropriation Bill to be taken through all their stages, which is essential to the continuation of the tax system and of public expenditure during the election period. The only Government Bills that will be taken through this truncated process are those that have already received a substantial amount of scrutiny in both Houses, or those essential to the maintenance of the public finances.</p>

That is my position. I support this reform, I expect it to be seen through in the next Parliament-the work has been done in this Parliament-and hon.

 I am not, either inadvertently or in a calculated way, trying to mislead the House, nor did I misspeak. What I have said is that following the will of the House being expressed in the resolution, I would ensure that Standing Orders giving effect to that will would be on the Order Paper, so that the will of the House could come into effect. That is what I have done. Hon. Members who lost the vote have put up an objection in order to stop this going through now. The hon. Gentleman will recognise that we all agreed that, irrespective of whether the Standing Orders are dealt with now or after the House returns, the new House Committee would not be operational until the new Parliament. We should be ensuring that it is operational when the House gets back after the general election. My priority is to get these two private Members' Bills and these 13 Bills through to Royal Assent; I want to get the primary legislation on to the statute book. The Standing Orders to allow the House to manage its own business can be dealt with when the House gets back. I really believe that when the new Members arrive in the next Parliament, they will find that we have paved the way for the House to organise its own business, instead of having the Leader of the House pick on behalf of the House the subjects of topical debates and the non-Government business. That is progress that the House has made. Opinion has moved on and that will be the settled will of the House when the House gets back.</p>

 My hon. Friend is one of the Members who have done so much to move the view of the House forward and to work out the detailed arrangements so that we can carry out our business better. That is the will of the House; it has been resolved and, as I say, the Standing Orders have been drafted. However, I do not think that he should minimise the importance of giving priority to important Bills, such as the Digital Economy Bill and these two private Members' Bills, and leaving the Standing Order changes, which have all been drafted so are all ready to go when the House returns, until later. Hon. Members are creating the impression that somehow the plug has been pulled on reform, but that is not the case because what has happened is that the Wright Committee has made a great many proposals and the House has agreed them. That is a major step forward. Just one set of Standing Orders remains, which can safely be left until the House gets back.</p>

 I understand that this is not a difficulty of my right hon. and learned Friend's making and that she is not responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves. However, we are in a very silly position because the House has resolved that it wants to do this in this Parliament-that is what the House has agreed-and it simply requires a small action on her part to enable it to happen. The objectors are not going to press their objections; one of them has already told me that his objection has been withdrawn. This can be done readily and easily.

 If the objections are being withdrawn, as my hon. Friend has said, I would very much welcome that. Any amendment would have to be withdrawn, but then these provisions could go through on the nod. There is no doubt about that. Most of the Standing Orders that we drafted, which simply gave expression to the will of the House and put it into practice, went through on the nod.

As I said yesterday, the Conservatives have taken, and will continue to take over the next few days, a constructive approach to the Bills before the House. I must say that there would have been much less to wash up had we spent less time earlier in the Session on the so-called declaratory Bills-the motherhood and apple pie Bills, which were simply press releases put into legislation.

I noticed that the Leader of the House was pointing to the shadow Leader of the House, saying that this was all the fault of the wicked Tories.

with the Conservatives to get rid of. There are precedents for this because in 1997, when the Conservatives were last in charge, there was a business motion in the House of Lords in the wash-up period-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> As the shadow Leader of the House says, the Conservative party at that point had a majority in the Lords. The question for the Government is why they have not tabled such a business motion and challenged the other parties in the Lords-the Liberal Democrats and the Cross Benchers-to support them on that motion. If they did that, I am sure they would get widespread support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para12"><a name="10040729000281">What I suspect is going on is a combination of two things. On the one hand, the Government are split over whether they want these reforms at all. This has always been the case with electoral reform and the Labour party. I remember as an elector receiving a letter from a Labour candidate in 1997 promising electoral reform then. Strangely, 13 years later it has not happened. This is the normal pattern, and there are reactionary forces in the Labour party that are opposed to all political reform. I am sure that is one factor. The other factor is the attempt to raise an election issue by pretending that the Labour party is in favour of reform and the Conservatives are not, when the reality is that with the right advice and the right negotiations across parties those reforms could be put through now. That strikes me as an entirely fake manoeuvre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para13"><a name="10040729000282">Those two issues-the completion of the reform of the House that was proposed by the Wright Committee, and the Government's pusillanimous treatment of political reform-mean that although the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire was able to say that he would follow a constructive approach, both in this House and in the other place, I presume, through the wash-up, I cannot make the same commitment because my party has been excluded from the negotiations. So I am not in a position either in this House or, more importantly, in the other place to say that we will co-operate with the Government in getting their business through. Indeed, we will start that approach this afternoon by dividing the House on this motion.</p>

There is a way of describing that in relation to the mechanics of this House-it is called "the usual channels" or the Whips. Of course there has to be a Whip system, otherwise there would be chaos. People join political parties, and when they vote for those parties, using their freedom of choice at the ballot box, they have the right to expect that there will be a proper and proportionate degree of support for the causes and political objectives that they supported in the general election.

an unconditional requirement to do whatever the Whips, and therefore the Government, want. We talk about the Whips as though this is all because of them, but it is not-it is because of the orders that are given by the Government. This is about the patronage that the Government exert and the determination and the political will of having what they want. The Prime Minister says, "I will insist upon this; I will do what I want," and he issues the directions down through the system. That is how the Whips operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para15"><a name="10040729000285">Sometimes, criticising the manner in which the Whip system operates-I am one who does that-does not sufficiently explain the mechanics of the use of power that is exercised, but not on behalf of the people: once a person has been elected as the Prime Minister, the question is whether he is bound by manifesto commitments. The short answer, in relation to the European constitution, for example, is quite clearly no. Obviously, when it comes to having a referendum on the European issue, the answer is also no. The real issue before us, then, is this: we have to rebalance and recalibrate the manner in which the Whip system operates in practice, and the mechanism for that is the Standing Orders. It is impossible to imagine that somehow or other there will, by the waving of a magic wand, be a change in the way the Government and legislation operate in practice, so the Standing Orders themselves will have to be addressed. As I have said a number of times in the past few months, it is essential to return power to the House of Commons and take it away from the Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para16"><a name="10040729000286">I have not the faintest idea whether you agree with this, Mr. Speaker, and it is not for me to suggest that you should agree to it, or whether you have any right to agree to it, as we are talking about the House of Commons and not about the Speaker. I believe that the Speaker's role, in historical terms, is, as was said on a famous occasion, to be a servant of the House. The Speaker might therefore want to give guidance and might have his own views, but when it comes to the application of the rules, the Executive in the 1880s were given the power to determine Standing Orders. I believe that many others would agree with me if they were aware of what was going on, and would want the running of the Standing Orders to be vested in the impartial role of the Speaker himself. That would be one way of ensuring that we did not have an omnipotent Government who were driven by political will, irrespective of the freedom of choice that was exercised at the ballot box, and through the party Whip system.</p>

 Yes, well, it comes to much the same thing. Let us not split hairs. The important question is about the proposals of the Wright Committee, Parliament First and others who have fought this battle for radical reform. We know that Select Committee Chairmen are going to be chosen by secret ballot and that, through the party groups, members of relevant Select Committees will be chosen. I think that all the Select Committees should be included, but that is a separate issue, although I note that the European Scrutiny Committee and the Public Accounts Committee do not seem to be included. Irrespective of all that, the real issue about the business committee being proposed is that the Government are not prepared to put their money where their mouth was. They said that they were going to do it, and the House agreed to do it, but they have used their control over the House-I go back to my earlier comments about their control by political will over this House through the Whips and their control of the Standing Orders-and they are bypassing decisions that have, to all intents and purposes, already been taken by the House, on behalf of the people of this country, to return the running of the business of the House back to where it belongs.

I took part in all those debates, as did other Members who are present today. However, her actions seem to be to do with the political will of the Government and No. 10-and, no doubt, on instructions. I have an idea that she might be more on our side than she is prepared to admit. I believe she has been told by the Whips and No. 10 to do what she is doing, which is betraying this House and the people of this country. The bottom line is that she is taking away the House's right to have a Back-Bench business committee that would enable real power to be taken back from the Executive and given to Parliament on behalf of the people who vote in general elections.</p>

They need people like us to represent their interests in the constituencies, and that is why I take the gravest exception to what I am observing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para20"><a name="10040729000294">I do not think I am going to hear anything to counter my fears. I am convinced that the talk about referendums on parliamentary reform, proportional representation and alternative votes is just another smokescreen that is being used to take away the British people's right to make their own decisions. The proposed changes to the electoral system would cause votes to be reshuffled by a mechanism that would dilute freedom of choice at the ballot box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para21"><a name="10040729000295">Lloyd George was on to this. I will not repeat what I have said in previous debates, but I have had some banter on this topic with the hon. Member for Cambridge. I like him very much: he is a distinguished lawyer who knows his onions, but I think the Liberal Democrat party has slightly forgotten its origins in the Speaker's Conference of 1911 and the 1931 election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para22"><a name="10040729000296">I set out all these matters in more detail the other day, and I shall not repeat them now, but Lloyd George was completely in favour of proportional representation when it suited him and completely against it when it did not. This is all about the practicality of power, as I have described already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para23"><a name="10040729000297">The phrase "constitutional law" is almost irrelevant when one looks at what goes on in this House, because we are really talking about the use of power. A Government can exercise power when they have gained control over the system, and it is the way they do that that is dressed up as the constitutional process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para24"><a name="10040729000298">The bottom line is that the business motion is being used to programme Bills so that we cannot discuss them. An example of that is the Government's disgraceful behaviour with regard to the Digital Economy Bill. There may not be anything intrinsically wrong with many of its objectives, but it is wrong-in principle and in fact-for us to use truncated legislative procedures. They do not give the people of this country the sort of legislation they deserve because nothing is discussed properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="100407-0006.htm_para25"><a name="10040729000299">Of course, the use of such procedures also takes away from Members of Parliamentary their incentive to be in the House at all. They know perfectly well that the vote will go according to decisions taken by No. 10, the Leader of the House, the Whips and the Executive. All the proposals on alternative voting and the attempt to introduce a greater degree of fairness-</p>

 Order. If I were a student at a tutorial being conducted by the hon. Gentleman, I would no doubt find it very satisfying, but I am seeking to chair an orderly debate. He must resist the temptation to dilate on matters that are well wide of the motion.

wrong with this House-the way that it has been betrayed by those who use their political will to prevent people from changing the system or expressing their views. The same will happen again if this motion goes in the direction that it appears to be going. It is an attack on freedom of speech in this House-that is the level of the betrayal.</p>

 Following on from what the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) just said, the treatment of the Digital Economy Bill is symptomatic of what has happened to this House. It is nothing short of outrageous that, the day after its Second Reading, we will have just two hours in which to attempt to debate the remaining stages of such an important and controversial Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para0"><a name="10040729000302">It is simply not good enough for the Government to say that the Bill has been scrutinised by a bunch of unelected people at the other end of this building. That was what we were told yesterday, when Ministers said that everything was okay because there had been hours of scrutiny in the House of Lords. The last time I looked, it was this House that was elected. We are the ones who are accountable to constituents-despite the vagaries of an electoral system that means that the general election is already over in about 400 seats-yet we will have just two hours for debate. Many amendments will not be reached and many points will not be made, but the Government have the cheek to say that we should tell constituents during the election that we are doing a good job of scrutiny. It is a complete farce, as there are significant concerns-which I share-about measures in the Digital Economy Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para1"><a name="10040729000303">There has clearly been a carve-up between the Conservative and Labour parties. They are entitled to come to an arrangement like that in the elected House, but they are surely not entitled to prevent those of us who disagree with them from reaching our amendments, making our points against the contents of the Bill, and dividing the House on our arguments. The Government are determined to ram through the Bill on the penultimate day of this Parliament, in the space of two hours. It is a process that should take several weeks in Committee and at least one whole day-it should be more-on Report, when people are able to lobby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para2"><a name="10040729000304">How can we look our constituents in the eye and say that this is an accountable House when they do not even have time to lobby in favour of amendments? They are not able to do that lobbying because the amendments cannot be tabled until the Bill has been given a Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para3"><a name="10040729000305">There is no doubt that this so-called Leader of the House will go down in history as the destroyer of scrutiny. Under her stewardship, far more Opposition and Back-Bench amendments and new clauses-and indeed Government amendments and new clauses-have not been reached than has been the case with any other Leader of the House in recent history. I suspect that the same would be true for the more distant past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para4"><a name="10040729000306">Hardly any major Bill has received adequate scrutiny. The knives have been put in place after the business that needs to be reached, rather than before. The nature of the carve-up by Labour and the Conservatives to undermine scrutiny of the Digital Economy Bill is just a typical example of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para5"><a name="10040729000307">That is why the House decided to do something about the Government's approach. On certain points in the Wright Committee report, and on behalf of the Committee itself, hon. Members disagreed with the both Government and Conservative Front Benches and instead voted for two critical measures to improve scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para6"><a name="10040729000308">The Government keep saying, "Oh, you've got your Select Committee changes." I welcome those changes, but they are not about scrutiny on the Floor of the House. The two measures that have been approved by hon. Members are, first, that a House business committee be set up in the next Parliament to enable us, as a House, to determine how much scrutiny legislation is given. That would take away from the Government the ability to ram through legislation in the way that is happening today and has happened for the past 10 years. The second measure was to set up a Back-Bench business committee. The vote in favour of the detail of that proposal went 2:1 against both of the major party Front Benches. As other Members have said, the Government are clearly defying the will of the House by not introducing those amendments. It is a tragedy that we do not have a chance to deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="100407-0007.htm_para7"><a name="10040729000309">With the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) and others, I was involved in tabling an amendment to give the House the opportunity to divide on whether time should be provided tomorrow, but the amendment was not selected. I am not able to question the selection, but I think I can say that if there had been any way for the voice of Back Benchers to be heard on these matters, the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman, who has just entered the Chamber and is not at all out of breath, would have been selected. I think that in his selection the Speaker has been bound, on a Government day, to let the Government have their business. This is toxic to democracy in the House.</p>

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman uses the word toxic. I could not agree more-the words toxic and betrayal go together. When the hon. Gentleman says "bound" to make the decision, does he really mean "bound" or that there was some convention or Standing Order or some other thing that led to a decision that some people rather deplore?</p>

 Order. May I just say, before the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) develops his argument, I know that he will not want to be diverted from the path of virtue. The hon. Gentleman is aware that by convention the Speaker does not give reasons for the selection or non-selection of amendments. Of my commitment to this House, and the primacy of the role of Back Benchers, the hon. Gentleman need be-and I am sure is-in no doubt. We cannot get into consideration of why things were or were not selected. Those judgments have to be made, and a miscellany of factors is involved, of which the hon. Gentleman will be aware. I think we should leave it at that.</p>

 I agree, Mr. Speaker. I was not about to be led. I was not going to try to explore reasons; I just noted that the amendment was not, apparently, selected. I do not want to be drawn from the path of virtue-at least not on this matter.</p>

 I am sure the hon. Gentleman is right on that point-within the House. The problem is that this is a direct assault on the people of this country, and the voters, as we go into a general election. We are depriving them. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is incumbent on the media-including television and the BBC-to get the matter out into the arena of public opinion so that people know just how they have been betrayed?</p>

 Yes, and that was going to be my final point. I do not think the media at large understand how critical the issue of parliamentary reform is. Yes, scrutiny by Select Committees is vital, but until Back Benchers can have access to the Order Paper, the Government will run this place for their own narrow benefit. Yes, they should have their time; yes, of course they should be able to get their business before the House in a timely way, but that does not mean that they should run the House. That is what the Wright Committee said. Our last report, which set out the Standing Orders that the Government should have brought forward in this business motion, was not opposed by any member of the Committee. There was consensus. The people outside that consensus now are the Ministers. Had I been able to catch the Speaker's eye in Prime Minister's questions, I would have asked why a Prime Minister, who in 2007 said that he wanted to see parliamentary reform, and who set up the Wright Committee-eventually-</p>

The Government should be ashamed of themselves, and Conservative Front Benchers need to look closely at whether they could have done more in the negotiations to insist that the Standing Orders would be considered. I pay tribute to the work that the shadow Leader of the House has done on the issue, however, so this is nothing personal.</p>

 Of course I accept what the hon. Gentleman says at face value, but I regret that his position in the negotiations was not strong enough-perhaps this was not a big enough priority. Of course, it might be that the Government's top priority was not delivering the Standing Orders under the business motion and that they were saying, "No matter what, we're not doing that." I fear that the business motion will mean that we do not get this reform, and that will be a tragedy for those who have worked hard for it and for the House. It will also be a tragedy for the Prime Minister, who will look foolish, given what he said. More than anything else, however, it is a tragedy for the scrutiny that the House should deliver for the people.</p>

 Until a few minutes ago, I had not intended to say anything about the motion. I was certainly taking a more benign and generous view of the situation than the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). I accepted the statement by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House that she wanted the Standing Order to be enacted but that, unfortunately, that would be difficult because a few Members had tabled amendments. However, we heard an undertaking that whoever was in government in the next Parliament, the provisions would be brought forward. Although I was unhappy, I was content to leave it there.</p>

One of them told me that he would therefore withdraw his amendment. When I returned to my office a few minutes ago, however-I had not intended to return to the Chamber-I found a note that had been relayed to me by the office of my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), who is one of the amenders and, of course, a former Chief Whip. The note says:</p>

It is outrageous that the express will of the House is being treated with contempt-I do not say by the Whips Office, but I do say by someone in the Whips Office. I had already been told that the amendments came from a single source, but we now know that to be the case. The situation not only treats the House with contempt, but treats my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House with contempt, because I know that she genuinely wants the provision to be enacted. However, by some device the House is being prevented from doing that, and if there is one thing at the heart of our proposals, it is a way of enabling the House to have more freedom of action on its own behalf, so on that fundamental ground, the position is outrageous.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

Going further back, I recall that the Government and Opposition Front Benchers voted down an amendment tabled by my hon.

Now, we are faced with the Government saying that the Bill is so important that it has to be passed with indecent haste.

 Under the existing law, prosecutions for bribery cannot be commenced without the consent of the Attorney-General. As drafted, the Bill would give that power to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the director of the Serious Fraud Office or the director of Revenue and Customs prosecutions in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para5"><a name="10040729001047">The constitutional position of the Attorney-General, as the individual making prosecution decisions, is enshrined in more than 100 years of parliamentary convention. Our concern remains that if we are to realign the role of the Attorney-General, it should be following a full discussion in the widest context. The Government had a vehicle to allow a full debate on that and many other matters in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, but they did not make use of it. We remain concerned that this Bill's tweaking of the Attorney-General's role is simply putting off the necessary wider debate on it.</p>

 Perhaps this provides the hon. Gentleman with an opportunity to clear up a puzzle that has been on my mind throughout our debates. What is his party's position on the wider debate about the Attorney-General's role?</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="10040729001049"><a name="100407-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="10040729002180"><b>Mr. Djanogly:</b>
 We touched on that in Committee, but from looking at the amendments, I do not believe that it is an appropriate debate to have now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para6"><a name="10040729001050">We also had concerns, as reflected in amendments 1 and 2, that in delegating powers to the directors of the prosecuting agencies, there was a danger that we would lose the opportunity for parliamentary accountability. We voiced those concerns in Committee and emphasised the lack of accountability that could arise if the directors were the decision-makers rather than the Attorney-General. Those concerns were compounded by the fact the directors themselves could delegate such powers to subordinates in their organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para7"><a name="10040729001051">That latter concern will be partly resolved by Government amendment 7, which we intend to accept. It is intended to ensure that the prosecutorial power in the hands of the directors of the SFO, HMRC and the DPP cannot easily be delegated to others within those organisations. Given that the volume of cases that reach prosecution each year is, I am told, in the region of only 20, and that  <br>

the Government predict a rise in that number of only some 1.3 cases a year, we do not believe that the delegation of that important power would be appropriate, except in the most limited circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para8"><a name="10040729001052">However, even with the Government amendment, we could confuse the lines of authority unless care is taken. By that, I mean that we will now have three people fulfilling a role that has previously been occupied by only one-the Attorney-General. With that increase in numbers comes the potential for conflicting prosecution policies to develop. Business and prosecutors can ill afford that if the vital need for certainty and precedent is to be upheld. We have argued that we must drive for consistency and clarity in the Bill so that the parameters of offences are clearly demarcated. Such clarity will help to ensure compliance. Little that we heard in Committee, or from various other sources, suggests that we have yet given adequate thought to the matter or put in place adequate procedures to ensure that overlap does not occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para9"><a name="10040729001053">Of course, the matter would have been even more problematic if the directors were able to delegate down the chain of their own organisations, essentially multiplying the number of prosecutorial policies that could be followed. The Government have therefore gone some way to removing our fears through their amendment. We heard from the Minister in Committee that protocols now exist between the directors and the Attorney-General that govern the accountability of their decision making, and we will have to see how those protocols work. Although the Government amendment strengthens the position by preventing the decision-making powers from being passed down the chain, diluting accountability further, we feel that it may not go far enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para10"><a name="10040729001054">I end by confirming that ensuring that we have a clear and workable uniform prosecution policy across the three organisations will be a priority for a Conservative Government.</p>

 It is a shame that the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) was not able to answer my question about the overall position of the Attorney-General, because it is important to have that clear. It is why I oppose amendment 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="100407-0009.htm_para11"><a name="10040729001056">My view-I wanted to express it during the debates on the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill but the relevant amendments were not reached-is that the Attorney-General should not have a direct role in prosecution decisions about whether individual people are prosecuted across the board, not just in the area in question but in all areas. That originally appeared to be the Government's position, but for reasons that remain obscure because we did not have a proper debate, the Government moved away from that position and moved instead simply to having a non-legally enforceable protocol between the Attorney-General and the three directors whom the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100407/debtext/100407-0010.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para0"><a name="10040729001057">One question that remains is how that protocol will apply, because assuming that Government amendment 7 is agreed to, the Attorney-General will still have a superintendence power over the director of the SFO. To make it absolutely clear, in the case of the SFO, that power applies not just to decisions on whether to prosecute but to decisions on whether to investigate. It is much broader than the power over the other directors. It was in that regard that all the trouble broke out about the BAE Systems case. The use of that power was threatened-  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Apr 2010">

<notus-date day="7" month="4" year="2010" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>7 Apr 2010 : Column 1007</b><br>
although in the end it was technically never used-to induce the director of the SFO to call off the investigation of the BAES company's activities in Saudi Arabia with regard to the al-Yamamah case. That problem remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para1"><a name="10040729001058">Amendment 1, tabled by the hon. Member for Huntingdon, would make the situation worse. It would replace superintendence with a direct decision-making power over investigations. I say to him-he knows this, as we discussed it in Committee-that that position has been fundamentally questioned internationally by the OECD and by respected international non-governmental organisations such as Transparency International. Confidence in the independence of a prosecution system is absolutely crucial to the main task of the Bill, which is to restore this country's reputation as one that fights corruption. That reputation has been tarnished by the events concerning the dealings of BAES in Saudi Arabia. If we go down his route, we will not succeed in restoring this country's reputation; we will continue with the present situation, in which we are slipping down the league, in terms of our international standing in the fight against corruption. However, it sounded like he was going to withdraw his amendment in favour of the Government amendment, which I hope is the case, because his amendment would be very damaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para2"><a name="10040729001059">I turn briefly to the Government amendment. To paraphrase Douglas Adams, this amendment is mostly harmless. As the hon. Gentleman explained, it states that in cases where the director's discretion is engaged, the decision should be taken personally, as far as is practically possible, rather than delegated. As he said, at the moment, the number of cases concerned is quite small, so, in present circumstances, no great practical difficulty would be imposed on a director by the Government amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para3"><a name="10040729001060">I have one concern, however, about what will happen if there is an increase in the amount of work being done in this area. We all hope that an increase in work is not necessary because the Bill, when passed, will deter those who seek to make or receive bribes from doing so. However, it seems that there is a risk. One of the purposes of the Bill is to clarify the law, and it does that, which is why it is a good Bill and I support it. When passed, however, it might have one of two effects: it might make clearer to potential offenders what they should not do and result, therefore, in their not doing it, or-this is quite possible, and is part of the intention-it might make it easier for prosecutors to get a case together and bring it against offenders. If that is the route we take, we will end up with more cases, and I have a slight doubt about whether it is plausible in the longer term to use a director's personal discretion if there are 10 times more cases than now. However, with that caveat, I am happy not to oppose the Government amendment and very much urge the hon. Member for Huntingdon to withdraw amendment 1. If he does not, I shall oppose it.</p>

 We had a good opportunity in Committee to debate the important issues relating to consent to prosecution. The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para5"><a name="10040729001063">Under existing prevention of corruption Acts, consent to prosecution is given by the Attorney-General, but those Acts were passed a century or more ago when there was no Director of Public Prosecutions or Serious Fraud Office. We are repealing those outdated Acts and starting with a clean sheet. In doing so, it is right and proper that we consider objectively whether consent to prosecution should be given by the Attorney-General or by the director of the relevant prosecuting authority. We have a choice that our predecessors did not have in 1889 and 1906.</p>

I agree that some will be very serious, but others will be less so. On any objective examination of the issue, the offences in this Bill are not ones that require the Attorney-General's consent. To the extent that any given case engages issues of national security, the Attorney-General's superintending powers are such as to enable her to intervene. The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) is correct to highlight that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para7"><a name="10040729001065">I accept, however, that the question of whether to consent to a prosecution for one of the offences in the Bill can give rise to more difficult and sensitive considerations than is normally the case. For this reason, I see an argument for special arrangements to apply in this instance. Government amendment 7 would therefore require that the function of consenting to a prosecution must be exercised personally by the director of the relevant prosecuting authority, and a director would not be able to delegate the function to other prosecutors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para8"><a name="10040729001066">That said, of course we need to make some provision for the function to be exercised where the director is unavailable-for example, if the director was incapacitated or out of the country for a considerable number of days. The amendment therefore enables the DPP, the director of the Serious Fraud Office and the director of Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office to nominate another person to act when the director is unavailable. In the case of the DPP for Northern Ireland, the amendment preserves the position whereby the deputy director has all the powers of the DPP, but neither the director nor deputy director will be able to delegate the consent function under the Bill to another person.</p>

I say to the Liberal Democrats that, just because the OECD and other states do not have an Attorney-General, or do not like the idea of having one, does not, to my mind, make the role of the Attorney-General redundant.

 Bribery is a crime that undercuts competitiveness, derails honest companies and distorts the marketplace. Those who bribe and those who are bribed, whether in commercial organisations or governmental institutions, are thereby diminished by their actions, such that their legitimacy is called into question and the confidence of consumers and the public is weakened. Bribery also undermines the societies in which bribes are made.</p>

However, it is clear that in recent years, under this Labour Government's watch, the UK has fallen behind the standards of combating bribery that we have seen in other western countries, and our reputation has not been improved as a result. Conservatives therefore fully back the Bill and, in particular, are pleased that its implementation will finally make the UK compliant with the 1997 OECD anti-bribery convention.

Law Commission reviewed the UK's corruption laws and formulated a draft Bill that was designed to replace all or parts of the existing relevant legal provisions on corruption and, at the same time, incorporate the common law offence of bribery. What followed was an almost pantomime-like to-ing and fro-ing by the Government when, until recently and in the dying days of this Parliament, we were presented with this Bill. The unacceptable rush that we faced to push the Bill through, in only a few weeks, is hardly an example of thoughtful or effective government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para18"><a name="10040729001079">The Bill before us today is largely based on a set of proposals developed by the Law Commission, in its 2008 report entitled "Reforming Bribery", which has subsequently been reviewed in this House and the other place. The debate in the other place focused mainly on the legal aspects of the Bill, while we attempted in Committee to stress test the practical application of certain provisions in the Bill. The sum total is a Bill that we generally think is considered and well thought out. It is a Bill that I hope will provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of criminal law-one that makes it abundantly clear that bribery has no place in this country and that it will not be tolerated in our commercial or other dealings with the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para19"><a name="10040729001080">However, as rushed as the Bill has been, it is vital that it should be implemented only after full consultation with business and the preparation of appropriate guidance. We were pleased to receive the Minister's assurances on that point in Committee. Although we have decided not to move further amendments, providing for a business advisory service, this is certainly an area that we will wish to explore further in government, even if on a non-statutory basis.</p>

groundswell of international opinion that states that such behaviour will not be permitted; yet Conservatives believe that this should be seen only as the beginning, and not as the end of the process. The Bill is but one weapon in an arsenal to arm the UK in the fight against corruption. It will provide a framework of offences, but it will not, in itself, action anti-corruption measures. The Bill will not, in itself, issue prosecutions, create a healthy modern corporate culture or ensure that British companies are not undermined internationally by corrupt foreign competitors. In recent weeks the SFO has publicly announced cases in which it is investigating alleged acts of corruption. It must be hoped that the Bill will give the SFO and other prosecutors in future the necessary clarity to increase those investigations.</p>

There is a large corporate responsibility role for business in playing its part too, and the next Conservative Government look forward to working with business on implementing this important agenda for Britain.</p>

 I, too, very much welcome the Bill. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) is right to say that it has taken a long time to reach this stage, although he is not right to say that the Bill has been particularly rushed, given the vast amount of discussion about previous versions of the reform, both in the Joint Committee of both Houses and in the other place. Although some Bills in the wash-up have been ill-served by the process, I am not particularly concerned about the amount of scrutiny that this Bill has had. We have come out with a good Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="100407-0010.htm_para23"><a name="10040729001088">The hon. Gentleman is also right that the most important purpose of the Bill is to restore this country's reputation, which was affected badly by some recent bribery cases. It remains to be seen whether the Government-whichever Government we have after the election-will still be fully committed to the fight against bribery. Using the tools that the Bill provides, it will be easier for prosecutors to build their cases, but they will be able to do so only if the Government-whoever they are-provide them with the resources that they need. However, it remains the case that the Government currently do not fund the SFO directly for its corruption work. Rather, the SFO is using resources from other parts of its funding to take that work forward. That must change. Equally, it is not right for the SFO to have to ask the Government for case-by-case funding-that is a constitutional matter that needs to be changed-although the underlying fact is that there will be an improvement for the SFO under the terms of the Bill.</p>

Bill makes it entirely clear that the old law relating to principal and agent has gone, whatever doubts there might have been about it, and that new, clear definitions of bribery have now been included in the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="100407-0011.htm_para1"><a name="10040729001090">That is the first good thing that the Bill does. The second is to introduce an offence of bribing a foreign official, which this country-unlike many others around the world-has hitherto lacked. The provision is drafted in such a way as to make it clear that it is the standards of this country that count. Under the terms of the Bill, it will not be possible to say that we can bribe people because it is okay to do so in another culture. That will not be allowed. The standards that will apply are not vague cultural standards; they will be the written law of another state. There was some debate in Committee about whether businesses would be able to follow this part of the Bill, but I am sure that they will be able to do so. It will be their responsibility to ensure that they are complying with the law of the other state, with whose public officials they are dealing.</p>

I understand their worries, but, in the interests of the reputation of this country and of British business, it would not be right-or even profitable-to question this country's position on the fight against bribery. In the relationship between the next Government, whoever they are, and business, I hope that the people in power will make it absolutely clear to business that its position will not be tolerated if it is likely to undermine the provisions of the Bill, which I am glad to support.</p>

This is not just a problem for the third world; it is found in the European Union and all other parts of the world. I am worried about what might happen if we do not have a sufficient degree of sanction in relation to the aid that we give, in terms of any restrictions that might be imposed after a warning has been given. If a Government have been given an opportunity to correct their behaviour and they simply do not do so, we might be left with a problem.</p>

These problems will, however, have a serious impact, because so much of this goes on in those countries where the aid money does not reach the people who really need it. At that level, it is essential that the provisions in the Bill relate to what goes on in the countries concerned. If we cannot stop the corruption happening there by using our powers under the International Development Act 2002-which could be amended-I do not think that we will be able to solve the problem.</p>

 There are only three clauses to this small Bill, and clause 1 contains the key provisions. Subsection (3) amends section 47 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to enable the Northern Ireland Assembly to delegate the determination of salaries and allowances to an outside body. That is expressly forbidden by the current legislation. The Speaker of the Assembly has confirmed that, after Royal Assent, legislation will be introduced in the Assembly and a new system put in place for setting allowances and salaries after the next Assembly elections in May 2011.</p>

 We welcome the Bill. We have had various discussions on clause 1, which, as the Minister says, contains most of the meat of the Bill. We welcome the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly is to gain the competence to set up a body for the independent setting of salaries and allowances. This will bring it more into line with what happens in Scotland and Wales.</p>

Does he accept that it would not be inconsistent-in principle, at any rate, and I am not speaking for anybody else-to say that if people are doing two jobs, which is always more onerous, and doing them efficiently, there is something odd about not giving them the status of being paid for both jobs, even if it is something less than they might have expected?</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend's point. As I say, the money side is probably not the issue that concerns us most of all. Over the last few years, the Minister and I have worked together on many Committees, not only on primary legislation but on Statutory Instrument Committees upstairs, and sometimes they have clashed with meetings of the Assembly. I think that 15 of the 17 Northern Ireland Members of Parliament also sit in the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has meant that they have not always been able to be present in Committee. I found that particularly difficult. The people with experience of and real expertise about life in Northern Ireland are the people who live there, but if they are in the Assembly and cannot physically get to Westminster, it creates a difficulty, about which we are concerned.</p>

 On what the hon.

It is all part of a continuous process and integrated involvement, so it is not double-jobbing: it is one job, which is to represent people in each of those places. Does he agree that that is not double-jobbing, but doing the job properly?</p>

 I fear that the hon. Gentleman has perhaps never quite come to terms with the full implications of the devolutionary settlement. It is double-jobbing because there are two jobs. There is overlap between statutory functions, and speaking as a Scottish Member here since 2001, I am intimately acquainted with those areas. Energy policy provides a good example of where there is a substantial overlap. The way to address those areas is through meaningful and effective co-operation between MPs, MEPs, MLAs, MSPs and so forth. We should not and cannot address the overlap by having people in more than one place at the same time. When important business is to be considered here, but equally important, albeit different, business is to be considered in Belfast, Cardiff or Edinburgh, that overlap simply cannot be addressed, irrespective of the amount of good will or effective joint working. In setting up a devolved Assembly, as this House has done, we have to accept that, although the work previously done by one person is now being done by two, it is no longer one job, but two jobs.</p>

At risk of breaking the consensus that has been the hallmark of these proceedings, I merely observe in passing that I wish that his analysis was shared by his colleagues in the Scottish Parliament, two of whom, for reasons unknown to me, appear to be determined to continue double-jobbing if they are successful in being re-elected to this House.

 I want to touch on the two points referred to by the Minister. Setting up a body to determine Assembly Members' pay and expenses would not have required the Sewel convention, because the Assembly has been crying out for permission to have a body carry out that work. It will have the support of all the parties in the Assembly as it moves forward. Indeed, they are waiting for this legislation to enable them to proceed with their own legislation. I believe that this will be widely supported not just in the Assembly, but in Northern Ireland as a whole.</p>

There is a lot of double-speak on this issue when it is suggested that if we have a job outside the House of Commons, whether it be at the Bar, a directorship or whatever, it amounts to great experience. I recall the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) speaking to the Ulster Unionist conference and railing against double-jobbing. I decided to go on the internet to check what double-jobbing he might have been involved in. My computer printer ran out of paper before I could get to the end of the list, yet he was lecturing the people of Northern Ireland on why they should end double-jobbing.

ensure that the Assembly had the very best chance of succeeding. They wanted such experience to train-I do not use the term pejoratively-Members coming in to that level of elected service for the first time. It necessarily arose because people wanted to use such experience to ensure that the Assembly's life would not be a short one and that its business could be carried out in the best of fashions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="100407-0011.htm_para21"><a name="10040729001119">Secondly, some who might have had the Assembly as their first option-there were a number of them-had some doubt about the length of the Assembly's life. It was a bold move to set up the Assembly under those circumstances, when there was no certainty as to whether it would continue. Many Members thus wanted to hold on to their two positions until there was greater certainty. Those were the two reasons for the introduction of dual mandates, which was done with the best of motives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="100407-0011.htm_para22"><a name="10040729001120">As is made clear in the Library's research paper on the Bill, we intended to phase out dual mandates by the end of the next Parliament, but to do so gradually and progressively. The first step would be to remove Members of Parliament with chairmanships and ministerial roles-with only two exceptions-so that they would be able to attend Committees and participate in other House of Commons work, as the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) suggested that they should. We always intended-before this became a public issue-to reduce the number of candidates standing for both positions as soon as the Westminster and Assembly elections came around. We have done that, and we wait for other parties to follow our lead. I believe in a system of "one man"-or woman-"one job", so that people can concentrate on every aspect of the work to be done either in this place or in the Assembly.</p>

We know what the leader of the Scottish National party is saying about independence, and we know that elements of the Welsh Assembly may feel the same. What the right hon. Gentleman said crystallised the process that is evolving. If the dual mandate is removed, which would lead to what he correctly described as "one person for one job", we must start thinking about the concept of one Assembly for one nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="100407-0011.htm_para26"><a name="10040729001127">That is at the heart of this question. Although there are functions that are reserved, in Scotland and, in this instance, in Northern Ireland, it is becoming difficult to avoid a movement towards complete devolution, which many people would find disagreeable and others would encourage. Movement in that direction is pretty momentous, particularly in the context of Northern Ireland. I have no real knowledge of what the people of Ireland-and those of Northern Ireland in particular-think about it. However, there was a time when we heard the expression "full-hearted consent". Then came the Anglo-Irish agreement, followed by other movements towards greater devolution. A momentous and historic decision has just been made on the devolution of criminal justice, security and the police.</p>

That is a matter of consensus and has the agreement of all the Assembly parties. It is not contentious at that level, but it is not unimportant. When the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was passed, it was felt appropriate to give the Assembly control over its own pay and pensions. The Assembly's having control over its own affairs was deemed to be a significant statement of its status, but public attitudes and perceptions of those things have moved on. People now want the Assembly's pay to be settled by truly independent means, and this Bill takes us forward in that.</p>

The Assembly is currently explicitly prevented from doing so under section 47(7) of the 1998 Act, which states that it "may not delegate" such functions. The Bill removes that restriction, thereby enabling the Assembly to confer the functions of setting salaries and allowances for its Members on an independent body. It is expected that the new system will be in place following the Assembly elections in May 2011. The Bill also ensures that if a Member of the Assembly receives a salary as an MP or an MEP, they will not receive any salary as a Member of the Assembly. That is seen by some as a step along the road to ending dual mandates in Northern Ireland, and indeed we took a further step last week when the law in relation to the standing down of district councillors was changed; they will now be replaced by way of a nomination of the party, rather than by way of co-option or by-election.</p>

It is well known that the early involvement of people who had experience of business in this place was an important stabilising factor but, as I said in the clause stand part debate, we now have sufficient security, stability and confidence to move on from that.

There is the ability to distort electoral performance. Clearly, a higher profile Member of Parliament will gain more votes for a party in the Assembly election. If we therefore allow them to stand for both Westminster and the Assembly-particularly those who do not actually come to Westminster-we distort electoral outcomes.</p>

 Yes. The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. I have seen that operating in all three jurisdictions that have devolved Assemblies. Inevitably, as power is handed down-that is, of course, the process of devolution, as power is handed down from Westminster to other Assemblies and Parliaments-there will be developments that will keep going. We should be open-minded enough to learn from experience. That sort of use-let us not go so far as to call it a misuse or an abuse-of the facilities of one Assembly or Parliament to get one's foot in the door to become a Member of another is something that we will probably need to address and that Members of the devolved Assemblies and Parliaments will want to be addressed. If we, here, are part of a process that is about building stability and growing maturity, it should be in the interests of those Assemblies and Parliaments to get themselves to a point at which being a Member of that Assembly or Parliament is sufficiently significant to satisfy people and is not seen as a stepping stone towards this place or any other.</p>

 I am slightly troubled by this line of argument, because the budgets for the respective Parliaments are paid for by the taxpayers of the United Kingdom. It seems somewhat incongruous to focus on what the hon. Gentleman describes as double-jobbing, but what others might regard as an important dual mandate, given that the money is not being provided by the people for whom he would want exclusively to legislate, but only insofar as devolved functions are concerned. There is a serious constitutional issue here that he is completely avoiding.</p>

The Speaker and the senior officials of the Assembly have worked on the need to provide independent determination in relation to Assembly salaries and pensions. They have engaged cross-party discussions to that end, which is why the Bill has the consensus across the parties in Northern Ireland that it has. I am sure that that was a very welcome point of persuasion for the Minister in taking this Bill forward.

However, that issue needs to be dealt with. I have made my own decision. This Chamber is not where I want to be, as an Irish nationalist and someone who was personally and deeply involved in the negotiation, establishment and implementation of the Good Friday agreement. I really want to pursue my involvement in democratic politics elsewhere, but I have decided that for the next term, because of issues affecting my constituents and because of wider concerns, this is where I need to be, and that is the offer that the electorate will have to make a decision on.

Union. It would be remiss of me not to mention that subject, because it raises the question of the relationship between taxation, responsibility and democracy. If the moneys are provided through research, grant in aid, assisted area status and redevelopment grants, a question arises about what the United Kingdom is being expected to do. Members of this Parliament, who represent the taxpayers of the constituencies to which we are about to return, are in effect paying a lot of moneys for important functions that are being devolved in a modern world.</p>

There is more and more movement towards greater and greater degrees of responsibility. It is called devolution, but the relationship between responsibility and taxation is important, so there is a constitutional issue at its heart. It is well known that I am great supporter of those in Northern Ireland, and I am conscious of the fact that our taxpayers have to bear the costs of whatever emerges from the EU and is then paid back to us. In that context, the Bill is important because it is obviously something of which Members of the Northern Ireland legislature approve, so I am concerned that we have a coherent structure. Nothing is perfect and nothing can be resolved simply by writing down words-it is a question of the manner in which people come to believe that they can exercise authority through the rule of law in the appropriate manner. I do not want to make too much of a meal of this: I simply believe that we are moving inexorably towards a greater degree not merely of devolution but of political responsibility.</p>

The harmful effects of the drugs include over-stimulation of the cardiovascular system, which creates a risk of heart and circulatory problems, and over-stimulation of the nervous system, with the consequent risks of fits, agitated and paranoid states, and hallucinations.  <br>

 I shall come to that in a moment, but let me first finish my point. When talking about criminalisation and the importance of the order, I want it to be clear that after 16 April mephedrone will be an illegal drug; those in possession of it will be breaking the law; if caught, they will face being prosecuted and acquiring a criminal record. Those trafficking these drugs will face a substantial term of imprisonment-for a maximum of 14 years-and, when they have profited from what will be an illegal trade, we will seek to seize their property and other assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. We are working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers and other agencies to develop a comprehensive approach to tackle the sale of these drugs. The Serious Organised Crime Agency and the United Kingdom Border Agency will take effective enforcement action against the criminal gangs that traffic the drugs across our borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para11"><a name="10040743000024">As well as bringing the order before Parliament the day after we received advice that the drugs are harmful and dangerous, the Government took a series of other immediate actions. First, to limit the supply of mephedrone, specified other cathinone derivatives and all products containing those drugs, we banned their importation and instructed UKBA officials to seize and destroy shipments of mephedrone at the border, unless the shipment was licensed by the Home Office. UKBA has already seized a number of suspected mephedrone importations as a direct result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para12"><a name="10040743000025">Secondly, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary wrote to local authorities urging them to consider what action they could take under consumer protection legislation when mephedrone is inaccurately advertised as being for use as plant food or bath salts. Police forces and other agencies are contacting head shops and other premises thought to be supplying the drugs to warn them of the ban and to make clear their enforcement powers if suppliers fail to comply with the ban, once it comes into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para13"><a name="10040743000026">Legislative control is, of course, only part of the solution. Education is of paramount importance so, thirdly, in respect of our health messages, our drugs information service Frank provides information on cathinones, including mephedrone, with clear information about the risks those substances pose. Frank has already updated leaflets providing advice on mephedrone for young people and parents, which will be available from various sources, including the National Union of Students. Our Crazy Chemist information campaign run in late 2009 included warnings about mephedrone and targeted young people on websites and when they search to purchase legal highs. My hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners has written to all head teachers, providing guidance on dealing with mephedrone in schools. Mephedrone and legal highs will also be included in the new drugs guidance for schools.</p>

 I will perhaps return to the hon. Gentleman's second point in my closing remarks, if I may. On the point about the enforcement approach taken with young people, one of the important things that we do, in using the law in this way, is send out a very clear message to young people that mephedrone is illegal and does them harm, and is something with which they should not get involved. Those found in possession of an amount for personal use need to be dealt with in a proportionate and appropriate manner. It is, of course, at the local level that the police will make judgments on operational matters, but there is a statutory process for young people under 18, which is set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. That offers formal escalation, with referral at any stage to a youth offending team for a substance misuse assessment and appropriate intervention, through treatment or other support. We are not reinventing the wheel; we know how to deal with the issue with regard to other substances. Of course we have learned lessons from that and will apply them in this case.</p>

 As the Minister will be aware, when cannabis was reclassified as a class B drug, a separate regime was put in place: a fixed penalty ticket can be issued for possession of that drug, even though it is a class B drug. It is the only one in the class B category that has that provision attached to it. Is he suggesting that that will also apply to mephedrone?</p>

<p><a name="st_o252"><a name="10040743000034"><a name="100407-0013.htm_spnew14"><a name="10040743000309"><b>Mr. Campbell:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue, because that is not what I am suggesting at all; that is not our intention. The difference with cannabis is that most experienced police officers can recognise cannabis, as compared with other drugs.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Apr 2010">

<notus-date day="7" month="4" year="2010" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>7 Apr 2010 : Column 1031</b><br>
They may therefore be able to make a judgment about what an appropriate response is. It might be that a penalty notice is an appropriate response. That is why we explained what we expected to happen when cannabis was reclassified. The difficulty with mephedrone is that it is very difficult to distinguish it from a range of other drugs, so it would not be appropriate in this case to take the route that we went down with cannabis. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to put that on record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para18"><a name="10040743000035">We will continue to make it clear, particularly to young people, that so-called legal highs cause serious, and sometimes considerable, harm to those who use them, as well as great distress to people's families and friends, and to communities. Our aim is to ensure that everyone, and young people in particular, are well aware of the risks associated with using such drugs. That is why we are absolutely determined to crack down on so-called legal highs. We need to be vigilant and responsive. In particular, we need to tackle those who have no motive but greed, and who have no regard to the harm that they cause. We must ensure that our children know the harms of drugs, and know that even if someone describes them as legal highs, they are not safe. We ask Parliament to approve the order, which we believe will protect the public, and particularly young people, from those dangerous drugs. I commend the order to the House.</p>

 We support the order. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has given clear advice that mephedrone is a harmful, psychoactive substance and should be classified as a class B drug within the scope of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It is right that the order should seek to capture the cathinone group, of which mephedrone is one analogue, so that those who manufacture and seek to market those synthetic substances do not simply modify the drug slightly to create a new substance that would fall outside the scope of the controls. Methylone and various other drugs would have been the next problematic substances, as the Minister has said, and it is right that those drugs, as well as mephedrone and the other cathinone analogues, are addressed by virtue of the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para19"><a name="10040743000037">However, the issue is the time that it has taken to get to this point and the process that has been followed. It is frankly absurd that the ACMD should have written to the Home Secretary before Christmas, warning of its concerns as to the prevalence and potential harms of these compounds. It would seem that the Home Office knew of this problem months before. Why did not the Government act sooner? Why does it sadly seem to have taken the reporting of the deaths of several young people to finally prompt the Government into action? It should have been possible to develop policy in a measured way, rather than reaching the sudden realisation that there was an issue because of media coverage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para20"><a name="10040743000038">It has been apparent for some time that there has been an emerging problem with this group of so-called legal highs. It is desperately sad that as many as 25 deaths have been linked to mephedrone in some way, and our thoughts go to the families who have lost loved ones. The question that needs to be considered is whether any of these tragic cases could have been avoided if the Government had acted sooner and a more robust  <br>

mechanism had been in place for addressing newly emerging psychoactive substances, and if that had been in place, what its effect might be. We should certainly not forget that the Government were also slow to act in responding to GBL. It took the Home Office 18 months to implement the recommendation of the ACMD that the drug should be classified. We need to learn the lessons from these experiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para21"><a name="10040743000039">What has been disturbing about mephedrone has been the way in which it has been sold. Rather than being offered by a drug dealer down a dark alley, it has been spuriously marketed on the internet as plant food or fertiliser. As the ACMD has made abundantly clear, this is a drug akin to an amphetamine, and more likely to poison than promote the growth of our petunias. This has been a con, a deception, a spurious device to subvert the medicines control legislation, to suggest that this substance was not for human consumption and therefore not being sold as a drug. It is a despicable deceit, simply aimed at entrapping the unwary. It has also exposed the inadequacies of the system for responding to new and emerging drugs in the internet age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="100407-0013.htm_para22"><a name="10040743000040">Even though we may pass the order, we need a speedier mechanism for addressing public safety issues linked to new drugs intended for human consumption, however they may be falsely marketed. We have called for the introduction of a new temporary classification for a period of up to 12 months for newly emerging problematic substances. During this period, controls on sale, importation and supply could be imposed where public health concerns have been identified. This would also allow a period of expert input and analysis, to be provided in a considered and careful manner, as to whether a formal classification should be applied to the drug. It would also allow for specific public health alerts to be issued in a managed and focused way, without stoking up demand for the new substance, as I fear that the coverage in recent weeks has done in relation to mephedrone.</p>

 There is agreement, at least between the two Front Benchers who have addressed the House so far, that the Government have done the right thing in the current circumstances. I will not be sure what the Liberal Democrats' position is until we hear from the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), but there is agreement about the decision that has been taken. I join the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) and the Minister in accepting that it was the right course of action for the Government to take. They acted speedily in respect of the recommendation from the ACMD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para14"><a name="10040743000073">The decision was speedy in that the report went to the Home Secretary on Monday, and on the same day he decided that the drug would be reclassified. It took the Government only a few hours to make that decision. However, I am concerned about the time it took for the advisory council to get to the position to make that recommendation to the Government. Well done to Ministers and, in the last instance, to the Home Secretary for making the decision quickly, but I am worried about the time it took for the recommendation to come before the Home Secretary. The concerns raised by the Minister, the hon. Member for Hornchurch and others in the House were first brought before Ministers a year ago. Those concerns-about how dangerous the drug was-were raised with the previous Home Secretary. So I praise the Government on their decision, but lament the fact that it took 12 months to get to the position to make it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para15"><a name="10040743000074">We have to look at how these decisions are made, and the purpose of the ACMD is central to that. The hon. Member for Hornchurch, in an election period, obviously makes hay with the fact that members of the council have been resigning over the past few months. I would be astonished if he did not use that fact for party political advantage in the current climate. Indeed, it is embarrassing that only last week another member resigned. So it is an appropriate time to look at the entire structure of how these decisions are made. As I said to the Minister in my brief intervention, in the end it has to be up to Ministers to come before the House, and to make and defend such decisions, and they must rely on expert advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para16"><a name="10040743000075">My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) is, of course, much more experienced than probably anyone else in the Chamber today in these scientific matters-I do not want to disparage anybody else-because he is a bona fide scientist. He is a doctor, so he must be. If we can divorce ourselves from the fact that we are experts in certain fields, we have to rely on the expert advice of people who have impressive titles, such as professors and doctors, to give us the advice and expertise that we do not possess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para17"><a name="10040743000076">We should look at the structure of the advisory council. We must not get to a position where such an important body, which makes representations to the Government on a very important area of policy, should have acting chairpersons, committee members resigning and members who do not understand that, at the end of the day, decisions have to be made by Ministers. It would not be right if such decisions were all made by experts. There is absolutely no point in a Government having a drugs policy as part of their portfolio if Ministers are not prepared to act. I hope that we can use the current episode to look at structures. Of course,  <br>

it is difficult to do that in the middle of a general election campaign, but whichever party is in power-obviously, I hope it will be Labour-the Government need to look at those structures and ensure that the system is improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para18"><a name="10040743000077">My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) is in his place, and the Government will have noted the last report of the Home Affairs Select Committee on cocaine and the increase in the amount of it entering the United Kingdom. We suggested that it is vital that there be better co-ordination of Government drugs policy. The hon. Member for Hornchurch rightly raised the point that even if mephedrone is reclassified, in various parts of the world-I do not know if it is just in China-people are sitting down, as we speak, to try to concoct the next drug for the market. We are, in a sense, powerless to deal with the fact that, whatever we do in this place and regardless of decisions made by Ministers, at the end of the day, in order to circumvent the reclassification of this drug, somebody somewhere on this planet will be devising the next drug to be made available to young people and others. The hon. Gentleman is also right to mention the importance of the internet, and although I am not sure whether people in China will be able to buy such drugs on the internet, given what has happened with China and Google, the fact is that people in this country might be able to do so. That is something that we have to look at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para19"><a name="10040743000078">That brings me to my penultimate point, which is about the European Union and its failure properly to grasp this as an important policy issue. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North came with us when the Committee visited Lisbon as part of our inquiry into the cocaine trade, but we came across the European research and drugs agency. We were treated extremely well when we went in, as I am sure parliamentarians from across the European Union are. There were half a dozen experts-or perhaps even up to a dozen-sitting before us telling us what the agency was doing on drugs policy. However, what concerns me is that although we have all those experts sitting around in Lisbon talking about policy issues, we still have an unco-ordinated policy in the EU. Mephedrone is banned in Sweden and Denmark, which are in the EU, and in Norway and Israel, which are outside it, but in France and the United Kingdom-until this order goes through, of course-there is no ban, and anyone who goes to Spain can buy it there, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para20"><a name="10040743000079">The European Union prides itself on co-ordinating policy on serious and organised crime, counter-terrorism and so on, and here we have a policy that is crying out to be co-ordinated at a European level, yet there is no co-ordination. That is why it is important that Ministers, shadow Ministers and alternative shadow Ministers should look at the European Union's drugs agency and ensure that it does the work that was intended when the Government supported its creation, by providing research, information and expertise, so that the work can be done on a Europe-wide basis-the very issues that the hon. Member for Huntingdon referred to. The fact is that there are people in different parts of the world trying to second-guess the decisions that we are making and trying to create the next internet drug. Those in the European agency are the kinds of people who have the resources to ensure that we remain one step ahead of  <br>

the people who wish to create the next-steps drugs. If we work in a co-ordinated way, that will make the policy easier to implement and absorb.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para21"><a name="10040743000080">Finally, to return to my earlier point, I said right at the beginning that we should welcome what the Government had done, but lamented the fact that it had taken so long. There is no excuse when concerns are raised with Ministers and when Ministers say to the advisory council, as they did last November, "This is a serious issue. Please get on with making a decision as soon as possible." Let us look at the referral time. The Home Secretary asked the advisory council to look at the issue in November. Resignations aside, it is now April. We have had five months since the original referral. The process has taken far too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para22"><a name="10040743000081">Leaving the structures aside, we need a measure that will allow an interim decision to be taken, at least in the short term, because since the matter was first referred to my right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith), after the concerns raised by parliamentarians and our Committee-we have written to Ministers about the issue on a number of occasions, most recently a couple of weeks ago-some 25 young people have died. They include Louis Wainwright and others, and teenagers and young people go to nightclubs, where they have been able to buy mephedrone, every Friday and Saturday night.</p>

<p><a name="st_o270"><a name="10040743000082"><a name="100407-0014.htm_spnew14"><a name="10040743000327"><b>Mr. David Winnick (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b>
 Has my right hon. Friend not touched on the nub of the problem? How do we persuade people, and particularly young people, not to take such drugs? Are we satisfied that criminalising drugs will resolve the difficulties? Doing so may well resolve them, and no one has suggested that we decriminalise all drugs-or, indeed, any of them-at this moment. However, the real challenge, in saving lives and saving people from serious injuries, is surely to persuade them not to take drugs in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="st_o271"><a name="10040743000083"><a name="100407-0014.htm_spnew15"><a name="10040743000328"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is what the Select Committee report said. The need for persuasion and awareness is very important. The Minister has the Frank campaign to assist the Government, but we need more than that. We could simply say, "Take this drug and you will die", as 25 teenagers and young people have done since this matter was referred to my right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch. Those 25 young lives could have been saved if the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs had produced its report more quickly following the Minister's referral of the matter to the advisory council. They were not saved, however, because we have acted so slowly.</p>

 Over the past few weeks, many people have been saying that mephedrone is killing young people, yet the evidence shows that the young people who are using it-I would not advise them to use it at all, frankly-are often using other drugs as well. Until the coroners' reports have been published, we cannot say whether mephedrone killed Fred Bloggs or not. We have to wait for those reports. The problem is that young people are often using another drug-usually alcohol-as well as mephedrone, and sometimes another drug in addition to those two. So the real problem is poly-drug use. May I urge my right hon. Friend, in his capacity as Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, to look at the poly-drug use problem when Parliament returns?</p>

 I cannot give my hon. Friend an assurance on that, as it will depend on various factors. He is right, however, to identify that problem with mephedrone. Professor Iversen appeared before the Committee and said that mephedrone was an amphetamine by any other name, and that it could have harmful effects. My hon. Friend might be right about the individual cases, but my point is that 25 deaths were in some way related to the use of that drug-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), for whom I have huge respect, is huffing and puffing-in a perfectly legal way-from his position on the Front Bench. The fact is, however, that I do not share his philosophy that people should just have any drug that they want. I am sure that he will have the opportunity to put forward his view in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="100407-0014.htm_para23"><a name="10040743000086">I shall return to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East, for whom I also have huge respect. He is very knowledgeable about these matters, and he is right. I will not jump on to the bandwagon about alcohol use, but, as a teetotaller, I believe that alcohol-related crime and deaths probably far outnumber those related to drug use. My hon. Friend is right; we need to look at this matter. I do not think that we should wait for the coroners' reports before doing what the Government are seeking to do today, however. We should act quickly and, if necessary, have an interim recommendation to the Home Secretary from the advisory council, so that he can act accordingly. This is the only lesson that we have to learn from the delays of the past 12 months. If we learn it, we will really be able to save lives in the future.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the speech of the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)-made without notes, I see-even though he was wrong. The fact that he was wrong was also confirmed by the tremendous speech made by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon). Despite my warning to the right hon. Member for Leicester, East not to be dazzled by titles such as "Doctor" or "Professor", I acknowledge that the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East is indeed an expert in this area. He must be mortified by the way in which drug policy has been handled in this country over the decades-and, increasingly, now-by politicians and by the media. I say that not because he is some kind of drug-crazed libertarian; I know that he is not. I spend time with him on the Science and Technology Select Committee, and I know that he is concerned about ensuring that we have the right evidence-based policies and that the harms are minimised. That means not always jumping to the beat of the tabloid press. He was right to point out that the report produced by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which everyone is praising, makes it clear that we cannot say that the 25 deaths linked to the use of mephedrone were caused by mephedrone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para0"><a name="10040743000090">The position of the Liberal Democrats is that we should, by and large, follow the properly formulated advice of the ACMD, as it is an expert body. We have said that on previous occasions. We do not know that   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Apr 2010">

<notus-date day="7" month="4" year="2010" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>7 Apr 2010 : Column 1040</b><br>
that advice was not properly formulated, and, working on the basis that it is indeed sound, we support the statutory instrument that the Government have proposed, as well as the ban on mephedrone, and its classification as a class B drug. That does not mean, however, that we should suspend all inquiry into some of the issues and possible consequences of the decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para1"><a name="10040743000091">Allegations have been made that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which gave this advice, was not properly constituted, that the advice was not correctly considered-these are concerns coming from within the ACMD-and that although it did its best, it had to make recommendations based on inadequate data. I think that those concerns are framed by the contributions made not only by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, but by the Conservative spokesman, to the effect that the ACMD was hampered in its work and there was delay, because it was short of its chairman for quite some time and suffered a number of resignations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para2"><a name="10040743000092">When the ACMD makes a recommendation, the Government are, of course, entitled to accept or reject it. If the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee read the excellent report by the Science and Technology Select Committee on how to use scientific advice, he would see that that unanimous report-there was considerable input to it from the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East-made absolutely clear the Committee's view, which is also the Liberal Democrats' view, that politicians who are accountable should make these decisions, and that the role of advisers is to give advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para3"><a name="10040743000093">The key thing is that politicians must consider that advice, and when they reject it they should be very clear about why they reject it, so that they cannot pretend that they are taking the advice and basing their policy on evidence when they are not doing so. It is perfectly legitimate for politicians to base their policy on things other than the evidence, such as manifesto commitments, ideology-if hon. Members remember that term-economics or other matters. They can even base it on their desire to kowtow to the tabloid media. They will then be accountable for all those things; what they should not do is claim that they are taking an evidence-based approach when they are not.</p>

 I agree to this extent: the hon. Gentleman is coming round to the view that scientific advice is, in the end, only advice, and that what the Government have done represents the right approach. People can advise, but at the end of the day Ministers have to make the decision.</p>

 I have not come round to that; it was my position five years ago. If the right hon. Gentleman looked at the record, he would find that that is what I have been saying. The point is, however, that what we cannot do-I hope the right hon. Gentleman will agree-is so to bully our advisers, or threaten them with the sack if they give the "wrong" advice, that they provide the advice that they think Ministers want to hear. It ill behoves the Conservative spokesman, particularly in view of the BSE fiasco, not to bear in mind the very clear conclusions in the Phillips report of 2000, which said that scientific advisers should not have to go back and do it all again because the Minister is not happy with the content of the advice. We must have clear published advice, and the Government must consider it properly. I shall return to this issue again in a few moments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para4"><a name="10040743000096">What the ACMD usually does is consider the harms that drugs cause, and then consider the harms of illegality. It is important to be aware that there are risks and benefits both ways. There is no doubt that mephedrone is harmful. Although I am only a medical doctor, my advice to people is very clear-that they should not take this drug. I am possibly one of the few Members who can say that they have never taken an illegal drug, which may say something about my university time, as I was never offered it. I am also very clear and passionate about alcohol abuse and, indeed, nicotine abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para5"><a name="10040743000097">It is nevertheless important to recognise that banning a drug has potential harms, and these are aspects that we would expect advisers to consider. First, the purity will be impacted by the substances with which the drug is cut by people illegally peddling it for profit. Secondly, criminal gangs can take over. Indeed, in paragraph 6.6 of its report, the ACMD points out that in Guernsey, where mephedrone was banned, criminal gangs have taken over and violence is now associated with accessing the drug, which was not the case previously. Although the ACMD listed that under "Societal Harms", it is actually a harm of criminalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para6"><a name="10040743000098">Thirdly, users-if they are not prevented from using the drug-will be driven into the hands of those who want to sell them even more addictive and more harmful substances. Alternatively, they will turn to another substance which is still legal and may be more harmful. Furthermore, a ban may cause the price to rise, and acquisitive crime is more likely to be committed by people who are addicted to the substance. That is a logical consequence. I accept that drugs ruin lives, but criminal records ruin lives as well. Criminalising people, whether they are under 18 or young adults, has a consequence for those people which we cannot discount.</p>

I still support what the Government are doing, but at least I have considered those issues, and I question whether the ACMD had a chance to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para14"><a name="10040743000106">I realise that there is not much time for the Minister to respond, but I want to say a bit more about the ACMD. As the hon. Member for Hornchurch pointed out, the problem lies not with the ACMD but with the Home Secretary. However, I should like to know whether the hon. Gentleman, who seeks to be a Minister, thinks that Professor Nutt should have been sacked for the lecture that he gave at King's college, as professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial college, and, if so what he should have been sacked for. I tried to ask the hon. Gentleman that, but he would not allow me to intervene, which is not a good sign. Someone who wishes to become a Minister dealing with these matters should be expected to be able to answer questions of that kind, whether they come from parents, enforcement agencies or experts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para15"><a name="10040743000107">I invite the hon. Gentleman to tell us now that he agrees with the Home Secretary-and the shadow Home Secretary, who needs as much help as possible at the moment-that Professor Nutt should have been sacked, and should have been sacked earlier. If he does end up as the Minister, he will find that, on that basis, people will be unwilling to give him the advice that he seeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para16"><a name="10040743000108">I have written to Lord Drayson asking whether the Government's own principles for the treatment of scientific advice were not breached five times last week by the Government, who acted not just without considering the report-which they were bound to consider under the Government principles issued on Budget day-but before it had even been published. In fact, according to Eric Carlin, who resigned last week, when the chair of the ACMD left to brief the Home Secretary for a press conference the ACMD had not even finished the report. The Government responded to the press not only on a report that had not been considered, that had not been published and would not be published for three days, but on a report that had not yet been completed. That makes a travesty of the advisory process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para17"><a name="10040743000109">If, as a result of that, this statutory instrument, if-or rather, I suspect, when-it is passed by both Houses, is challenged in the courts as being ultra vires and the Government lose the case, something which, as has been said, should have been done much earlier, will be delayed by months. The Government will find that people are unwilling to give advice if they break their own rules and pre-empt the work of the experts. The Government do not have to take that advice, but they promised to consider it properly and I do not believe that in this circumstance, they did so. Although the Liberal Democrats are happy to support the order, it is with sadness that we do so at a time when the advisory system on which we rely for proper policy is in crisis. It is not just the Government who suffer if they do not get good advice; we all suffer, because we end up with bad policy.</p>

 In the short time available to me, I wish to comment, in reverse order, on the main points that have been raised. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) made a number of serious allegations. The first was that the ACMD was not properly constituted when it came to this decision; we reject that view. He said that evidence was not properly considered; we reject that view. He said that this decision was based not on evidence but on tabloid headlines; we reject that view. He said that advisers were bullied and threatened by Ministers into making this decision; we reject that view, too. The hon. Gentleman needs to examine the evidence that the chair of the ACMD gave to the Select Committee on Home Affairs on 23 March-I believe that was the date-because he would then see that the relationship is very different from the one that he describes. If the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about the process that we have gone through, and so concerned that the principles on which he relies for good decision making have somehow not been matched on this occasion, he should stick to his principles and to the logic of his arguments and oppose this order, instead of trying to dance on the head of the pin with the logic of his argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para18"><a name="10040743000111">One of the allegations made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) was that the Government have "downplayed" drugs seizures during our time in office; that is not true. He talked about the work of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the UK Border Agency, and I have outlined their response to the issue before us. There is a fundamental misunderstanding in the question that he asks, because SOCA does have a role to play. However, it often has a role to play downstream; it is no good simply strengthening borders-we are, however, doing that-because we have to address the issue of drugs further downstream.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para19"><a name="10040743000112">My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) raised the issue of poly-use and of drug and alcohol use. I welcome his contribution, because what he says is right. Whoever carries out this role after the general election, and whichever party is in government, they and this House will have to return to this issue, because it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para20"><a name="10040743000113">My right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) again raised the issue of policy at a European level. There is disagreement among European countries about the best way to develop drugs policy, but there is a growing acceptance of the need for a harm-reduction approach. I also very much welcome the evolving approach of the new Administration in the United States.</p>

 These are simple probing amendments. This Bill is clearly important, and it will have to be considered by the other place before it becomes law. In one sense clause 9 is clear, because it says:</p>
<a name="100407-0015.htm_brev5"><a name="10040743000270"><ul><p class="tabletext">"This Act expires at the end of the period of one year beginning with commencement".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para25"><a name="10040743000121">At first sight, that would appear a perfectly sensible provision, because one presumes it would give time for the House and the Government to consider whether a more permanent Government Act should be placed on the statute book. I think that sunset clauses, as they are described, might often perform a perfectly useful purpose, especially when we are dealing in areas such as this, which have not been tested sufficiently by the Government and by courts in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para26"><a name="10040743000122">Subsection (1) is quite clear. My amendment is purely a probing amendment, which will give the Minister an opportunity to explain what is going on. It states that we should leave out subsection (3). Subsection (1) states:</p>
<a name="100407-0015.htm_brev6"><a name="10040743000271"><ul><p class="tabletext">"This Act expires at the end of the period of one year beginning with commencement",</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para27"><a name="10040743000123">which is fair enough. However, subsection (3) states that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para28"><a name="10040743000124">That is what I am slightly worried about. If this Act is to have permanent effect-after all, we are talking in terms of the wash-up of Parliament, and this is a private Member's Bill involving the Government in difficult areas-I would prefer to have more protection for Parliament. Why can the Government just decide that the Act should have permanent effect? If this Act is to have permanent effect under subsection (3), why does subsection (1) state that</p>
<a name="100407-0015.htm_brev8"><a name="10040743000273"><ul><p class="tabletext">"This Act expires at the end of the period of one year"?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="100407-0015.htm_para29"><a name="10040743000125">This is purely an opportunity for the Minister to explain his thinking. Presumably, he can come to the Dispatch Box and give all sorts of reassurances to Parliament. He can say that there will be a proper debate and proper evaluation. I have been doing interviews today in the context of my role as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee about there always being proper evaluation of value for money. I am sure that the Minister can reassure us on this point.</p>

 No, I will not. The hon. Gentleman's colleagues on the Front Bench, who have behaved entirely properly throughout this process, have described the measure as a sunset clause, and so it is. It was their measure, and they also got in the measure for making the Bill permanent. If the clause were taken out, the effect would be that the Bill would continue for more than one year. There has to be an annual vote on it, because there is no provision for anything else. I asked in the Library and, in the short time available, the only Acts that we could think of that are so demanding of parliamentary time and attention that they have to be renewed annually are terrorism legislation and the Finance Acts. I am sure that the hon. Member for Gainsborough, who is the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and is therefore very concerned about efficiency and proper functioning, would think that, important though the Bill is, it is not on the same level as terrorism legislation or the Finance Acts, but that would be one effect of his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="10040743000136"><a name="100407-0016.htm_spnew3"><a name="10040743000345"><b>Mr. David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 If we were to pass the Bill into statute and then, a year later, effectively let it wither on the vine, what message would we be sending to the developing countries that are looking for our support in this area? Surely that is the point.</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="10040743000137"><a name="100407-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="10040743000346"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 My hon. Friend is exactly right. The other side of the argument is that it was important to ensure that we had cross-party consensus, given that the legislation was complex and that we were coming to the end of the Parliament. It was also thought important to ensure that there was a proper way forward and that there was provision for a new Parliament to take a further look at the matter. My hon. Friend is right and I am sure that these issues will be debated again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para2"><a name="10040743000138">Amendment 2 would remove subsection (3), which means that the Bill would require annual renewal. It would be damaging and unsatisfactory for heavily indebted poor countries to have unresolved commercial debt claims hanging over them, particularly when there remains a possibility of those being aggressively enforced for their full value in spite of the debt relief provided by others. HIPC Governments have made clear the real economic costs resulting from the deterrent to trade and investment that such unresolved claims could create. If the Act remained temporary, with the possibility of expiring within a year, a commercial creditor who might consider seeking full repayment would have a disincentive to settle their claim, because if they held on to it and the Act expired, they would be able to pursue 100 per cent. repayment. The Bill, as introduced, did not create that incentive for creditors to hold on to their debts in the hope that the Act would expire, as it would have taken permanent effect immediately.</p>

 I shall come to that. First, I am going to go through the hon. Gentleman's comments on his amendments, because there were some contradictions in relation to amendment 3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para3"><a name="10040743000141">Originally, the Bill did not create an incentive for creditors to hold on to their debts in the hope that the Act would expire, as it would have taken permanent  <br>

effect immediately. That risk was one reason for the caution about including the sunset clause. However, the problem would be considerably worse if the Bill provided no option, short of new primary legislation, for the Act to take permanent effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para4"><a name="10040743000142">If Parliament is satisfied at some future point that the Act has caused, and is causing, no significant damage to the operation of financial markets, then it should be able to approve, by affirmative resolution, its taking permanent effect. That is a proper way to provide for the orderly management of these very difficult debts in heavily indebted poor countries. There has been extensive discussion of this Bill, but part of the purpose throughout has been to make sure that we use the existing procedures of the HIPC programme to provide stability and security to the countries involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para5"><a name="10040743000143">I turn now to amendment 3. The hon. Member for Gainsborough has said that he cannot understand clause 9(6), but it makes arrangements for handling the debt if the Bill is not confirmed. The result of that would be two classes of creditors: the first would be made up people who had taken action after the Bill fell and who would therefore be able to sue for the full amount, and the second would consist of people who took action for the one year that the legislation was in force. The second group would find that the value of their claims would be knocked back, because the legislation would allow them to pursue only that certain percentage of their debts that was approved by the HIPC procedure. The purpose of clause 9(6) is therefore to restore equity between the different classes of creditors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para6"><a name="10040743000144">As I have said, although the Bill looks quite complex, the principles behind it are simple. One of those principles is that there should be equity between different classes of creditors. If the amendment were accepted, a mechanism for restoring that equity would disappear, with the result that creditors would have no incentive to pursue their debts in the interim period when the legislation is in force. They will think, "Perhaps it won't be renewed, so we'd better not go to the courts now and just hang on instead." That would mean that the HIPC countries would still have their debts hanging over them, and also that creditors would receive less justice in the end. That would be the impact of amendment 3, and I do not think that that is what the hon. Gentleman intends. If the legislation were to fall for some reason in the next Parliament, I think that he would probably prefer to see justice restored for those creditors who had taken action while it was in force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para7"><a name="10040743000145">Amendment 2 would give the Act that this Bill will become equal status, in terms of parliamentary time, attention and renewal, with much more substantial pieces of legislation. It would have to keep being renewed every year, and there would be no provision to make it permanent. However, I think that the Opposition's intention was to ensure that a new Parliament could scrutinise the legislation and decide whether it was what was needed. If it was, and if it was working properly, that new Parliament could make it permanent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para8"><a name="10040743000146">The impact of amendment 6 would also not be what the hon.

<p><a name="st_o293"><a name="10040743000148"><a name="100407-0016.htm_spnew8"><a name="10040743000350"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. One problem has been the cost of lawsuits, which is in part why the Government and other donors have set up a fund to enable developing countries to deal with some of the lawsuits that have arisen as a result of the vulture funds. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will want to say more about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para9"><a name="10040743000149">Furthermore, there is a real perception that there is no system-that it is all down to the courts and that there is no mechanism-whereas in fact although the measure is a Treasury Bill, it draws on existing international development procedures for the management of developing country debt. In previous discussions, we described the amount of public sector debt and noted that much of it has been written off. A total of about £4.5 billion was private sector debt. A lot of the debt has already been managed. The legislation would deal with the completely unreasonable creditors-the vulture funds, which involve people who operate outside the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para10"><a name="10040743000150">There are already internationally recognised mechanisms to determine the value of debt. If the hon. Gentleman had been in the Chamber on Second Reading, he would have heard the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) claim from the Front Bench credit for his party for taking the lead on the management of developing country debt. On the Government Benches, we tried not to heckle or intervene when the hon. Gentleman took the credit, but there is no dispute about the fact that there are proper mechanisms. The only issue is to make sure that they apply to vulture funds, whose activities rightly outrage so many people not only in the UK but across the world.</p>

The amendment was included at the behest of Conservative Front Benchers. It was a sunset clause for a year to give a new Parliament an opportunity to look again at the legislation, to make sure that we were not in Dangerous Dogs Act territory, where legislation was passed without scrutiny. There will be a chance to look at the detail and the working of the measure, so that it can pass into legislation.</p>

the measure right. It is important that its provisions are carefully calibrated, because if we prevent creditors from enforcing debts against developing countries, there is a risk that they will not lend to developing countries in future. The law of unintended consequences could apply and we could make things worse for developing countries. Nobody wants to do that, which is why the Bill is carefully calibrated to apply only to heavily indebted poor countries. It relates only to past debt and not to future contracts. Future lending agreements can be enforced unaffected by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para14"><a name="10040743000155">Concern was frequently expressed by industry bodies during the Treasury consultation that the Bill might send the message that creditors in the UK could not enforce debts against developing countries and that that could be applied more broadly. As part of the consultation, it was pointed out that those possible spill-over costs would be difficult to assess. For example, would a risk premium be applied to developing countries that would make it harder for them to obtain credit?</p>

Member for Northampton, North accepted in Committee, was clause 9, which is essentially a sunset clause. The thinking behind the clause is that we should accept the Bill. However, although it has been given sufficient time to proceed in this House, it will not get the full scrutiny in the other place that such a Bill might otherwise receive. Even if it did receive such scrutiny, however, some things would not become clear until it came into force, so we proposed a mechanism that would make it possible in the 12 months following enactment to assess the Act's effect on the risk premium paid by developing countries and the number of debts-again, there is uncertainty and disagreement on this point-that could not be enforced at their full amount.</p>

 My question is really only about the accuracy of language. When we use the expression "sunset clause", we usually mean that as a result of various procedures, and after a period of time, a provision will cease to have effect. However, there is some confusion, as exactly the opposite seems to be provided for by clause 9 because it can give the Bill permanent effect, rather than causing it to cease. To make things clearer, may we use an expression other than "sunset clause"-perhaps by referring to a "sunlight clause"?</p>

 I would always take guidance on terminology from my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), but clause 9 does contain a sunset provision because subsection (1) provides that the legislation shall expire after 12 months. However, the clause includes additional provisions that allow the Treasury, by order, to renew the Act for a further 12 months or to give it permanent effect. The advantage of including both approaches-this deals specifically with amendment 2-is that it gives the Treasury the flexibility to assess the effect of the Bill. It  <br>

is quite possible that a Select Committee will want to investigate the effect of the legislation in the early months of the next Parliament. We could then be in a position to make an informed judgment about the Act. We might be unsure about some concerns, in which case we could give the Act another 12 months and look again, but if the concerns can be dismissed after we have seen the way in which the Act has worked for 12 months, we can accept that it should have permanent effect.</p>

 I am pleased that I tabled amendment 2 because we have had a debate about the law of unintended consequences. That is a serious point because the Bill could militate against developing countries. My hon. Friend might be fortunate enough to become the Treasury Minister with responsibility for the legislation, but does he think that 12 months is sufficient time in which to assess this complex area? What sort of plans does he have? I assume that he will not give a commitment either way now, but he might say later that we should have a further year of consideration.</p>

 That is possible under the clause as it stands: it gives Ministers in the next Government, whoever they are, an opportunity to assess what is happening to the risk premium, the levels of debt affected, and the implications of the legislation. If it turns out that 12 months is insufficient, there is the possibility of extension for a further 12 months. I think that the provision adds to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="100407-0016.htm_para16"><a name="10040743000162">Let me say why I think this debate is helpful. Parliament is dealing with the matter sensibly, recognising the potential dangers and treading carefully. That is a good message to send out. The concern about the risk premium centres not on the Bill itself, but on the possibility that it will become a precedent for a future Bill that prevents the enforcement of future debts. No doubt some in this House would argue that that would be a great thing to do, but it would pose significant dangers for developing countries. The element of caution provided by the sunset clause is sensible, and subsection (3) is an important part of that.</p>

Member for Northampton, North spoke about subsection (6) and how it would be wrong to allow a situation to arise in which those debts enforced during the period in which the measure is in force were treated differently from those that were pursued subsequently. That would have an impact on which debts were enforced and, in some respects, damage the credibility of the legislation. Subsection (6) is therefore helpful.</p>

As a result of the actions that we have taken, there have been major benefits to various countries. Under the HIPC initiative, Tanzania has been helped to increase the number of its children in primary schools by more than 50 per cent., built almost 2,500 new primary schools, and recruited 28,000 extra teachers.

It is unfortunate that there was some controversy, which the Government were guilty of whipping up, when the Bill did not reach Report stage or Third Reading. As the Government are well aware, we did not object to the Bill progressing. We did not collude in its being objected to, although it would be fair to say that it is usual that private Members' Bills that have not been debated on Report or Third Reading do not progress. Our argument has always been that it is a question of the Government giving time for this Bill. We are delighted that, after some initial reluctance, the Government have brought the Bill back.

for developing countries. However, the point that I made at earlier stages is that, to some extent, the Bill provides an insolvency procedure for developing countries that find themselves in great difficulty, because they will be able to reduce their debts equitably and share them out among creditors, whereas without such a mechanism no creditor would receive anything, or such payments would be made inequitably.

 Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I can speed things up by putting on the record the genuine cross-party support that there is for the Bill. The Liberal Democrats are certainly delighted to see it go forward at such a pace. Many of us who have attended Inter-Parliamentary Union and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences throughout the world have visited countries, spoken to some of the political leaders of debt-ridden countries and shared their frustration not only at the difficulties that they have had in dealing with debt, but the legal difficulties that they have faced due to the private acquisitions that have been attempted against them. So, those countries will welcome what has happened today in Parliament.</p>

Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), who has spoken so eloquently to it. However, the House should also congratulate those campaigning organisations outside Westminster, such as Jubilee 2000 and many others, which have kept on and on at Governments of all parties. Those groups should share our congratulations on the work that has been done.</p>

Friends, but because of the great pressure outside the House from people who care. I pay tribute to many of my constituents who have rightly put pressure on me and other Members to get the Bill this far. In particular, I thank the congregation of Holy Innocents' church, Fallowfield, for its work on development and aid, and Mr. Stephen Pennells, who is its spokesman, although by no means, as he will acknowledge, the only activist on these matters. The House is passing a Bill this afternoon that will benefit a very large number of people who may not even learn that it exists. It is a worthy little coda at the end of this Parliament, and I thank everybody involved for their work.</p>

 Having served for the past 10 years on the Select Committee on International Development, it is a proud moment for me to say a few words in support of the Bill, which has all-party support. I know that we are at the end of the Parliament and there is a rush to get things through, and I listened carefully to the probing amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), but for us to have got to this stage on a Bill that will do a little more on effective debt relief for the poorest in the world is an impressionistic moment. It sends a signal that I hope will mean our country provides some international leadership, even in the heat of an election that may focus particularly on local concerns.</p>

Tackling debt and the undermining of the highly indebted poor countries initiative by predator-creditor litigations is crucial. The HIPC initiative has had some great successes-my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary mentioned Mozambique, and the abolition of primary school fees in Uganda has doubled the number of enrolments and decreased inequality. In Bolivia, the cancellation of debts has improved health care massively. Tackling debt is crucial, and getting a grip on the so-called vulture funds that undermine the ability to manage it is a good move and should send a clear international signal. The Bill will prevent creditors from recovering an amount in excess of what is consistent with the HIPC initiative.</p>

the south, and the debt question is central to that mutuality. It is an issue north and south, as we all now know. If I dare be so bold as to suggest it, the parallel between the activities of hedge funds and vulture funds and the sub-prime, loan-shark doorstep lenders in poorer parts of my constituency suggests that a debt relief Bill is needed here in Britain, which could include the capping of interest rates. I simply wish to put that marker down, because those who make excessive profits from low-income borrowers, including the countries and people who are least able to pay, end up buying and selling debts, recycling them, overcharging massively and making the situation even more intolerable.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="100407-0018.htm_para0"><a name="10040743000227">We have come through a very difficult time in the world economy. It has required difficult choices and Governments around the world intervening in unprecedented ways to rescue the financial system, and initiatives to support the economy, businesses and families. But we made the right calls, as the latest survey from the British Chambers of Commerce and the sharp upwards revision of the OECD's UK growth forecast have underlined this morning. The damage to families and businesses has been much less than if we had let the recession run its course, and much less than the actual damage when that approach was applied in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="100407-0018.htm_para1"><a name="10040743000228">We are committed to all the tax measures that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out in the Budget, but we have published a much shorter Finance Bill than usual and it is focused on the key Budget measures. Some two thirds of the measures in the Bill have been aired for comment and consultation already. We are proceeding today on the basis of consent, and to be helpful to Opposition Members, I will not be moving the landline duty in clause 23 and schedule 2; clause 58 requiring financial securities from employers at serious risk of pay-as-you-earn or national insurance contributions not being paid; or clause 65 and schedule 21 on furnished holiday lettings. Those will all be in the second Finance Bill at the start of the new Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="100407-0018.htm_para2"><a name="10040743000229">I have also tabled amendments to clause 9 that will limit the increase in cider duty to 2 per cent. above inflation, with effect from 30 June this year. That change will come at a cost to the Exchequer, and leave cider taxation out of step with other drinks. So again we will legislate after the election to confirm the existing new rate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o320"><a name="10040743000230"><a name="100407-0018.htm_spnew0"><a name="10040743000378"><b>Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con):</b>

 I can give the right hon. Gentleman some of those figures, and we can perhaps return to individual figures when we consider the amendments that I have tabled. The total gain to the Exchequer from the higher rate of cider duty in a full year would be £15 million. The landline duty will start in the course of this financial year, but in a full year it is estimated to raise, from memory, £175 million, to be used in ways that he will know about. I am not sure whether there is a score against clause 58, but there is a score against clause 65 and schedule 21, which deal with furnished holiday lettings. Again from memory, if the provision was left unamended, the impact for the Exchequer in a full year would be in the order of £30 million.</p>

fact, he said "will be"-a certain amount, but does he not accept that he is making an enormous assumption? Not only is his Finance (No. 2) Bill, which would carry those proposals forward, not a Bill, but we are discussing the Finance Bill that is now before the House. He is stretching the bounds of imagination a bit, in assuming that the second Bill will come into effect in the way that he was suggesting.</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="10040743000233"><a name="100407-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="10040743000381"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 I do not think that I am, although I may have slightly misled the hon. Gentleman: the figures that I have just quoted are given on the assumption that the Bill-with the amendments that I have outlined-is enacted and nothing further happens. I have said that if we are re-elected, we will change that, and then the numbers that I have just given will not apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="100407-0018.htm_para3"><a name="10040743000234">To secure recovery, the Bill builds on the success of the measures that we have introduced so far. Our stamp duty holiday on all transactions under £175,000 gave support for the housing market when it needed it most, helping 260,000 home buyers. However, many first-time buyers still struggle, so clause 6 increases the stamp duty threshold for first-time buyers from £125,000 to £250,000. Nine out of 10 first-time buyers will now pay no stamp duty at all. To fund that change, clause 7 announces an increase in stamp duty to 5 per cent. for residential property over £l million. Some 850,000 companies will benefit from the deferral of the rise in small companies rate. Clause 3 maintains corporation tax for small companies at 21 per cent. for 2010-11. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget, we are staging the fuel duty rise over the coming year. Under clause 12, it is up by a penny this month, which is less than inflation. Clause 13 provides for a further 1p rise in October, with the remainder in January.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="100407-0018.htm_para4"><a name="10040743000235">The Bill helps to underpin strong and sustainable growth. Clause 5 doubles the annual investment allowance to £100,000 for expenditure incurred from this month. Some 99 per cent. of businesses will now be able to deduct all qualifying purchases of plant and machinery from their taxable profits, so we are encouraging investment and helping to support profits. Clause 4 doubles the limit for entrepreneur's relief for capital gains tax, extending the 10 per cent. rate from £l million to the first £2 million of gains over a lifetime. Among other benefits, serial entrepreneurs and business angels will retain more of their gains in order to fund new investments and support further growth. Those are important measures, providing support for small and growing businesses. To help pay for them, the 50 per cent. levy on the excessive bonuses of bankers provided for in clause 22, which was announced in the pre-Budget report and quite widely supported in the House, has raised £2 billion-more than twice what was forecast. Clause 2 maintains corporation tax at 28 per cent.-the lowest rate in the G7-maintaining the UK's position as one of the best places to do business in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="100407-0018.htm_para5"><a name="10040743000236">The Bill provides the key tax measures to halve the deficit over four years. Clause 1 provides for the new 50 per cent. additional rate. Clauses 24, 49, 50 and 71 provide for the restriction of tax relief on pensions for those earning over £130,000 a year, as well as for further anti-forestalling. In drawing up the clauses on pensions, we have balanced certainty-and giving people time to prepare for the changes-with the need for  <br>

additional consultation. Further work is still needed on what is done for individuals in special circumstances, on contributions for members of defined benefits schemes, and on obligations on scheme administrators. Whenever we can, we will publish draft regulations and primary legislation early to give people a chance to comment. In particular, we will discuss further with pension providers how schemes would pay the recovery charge on behalf of the individual, so that the details can be in place in good time for 2012-13.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important matter. We have indeed reflected carefully on that point, as we do each year.

The package protects around £18 billion worth of yield and will raise a further £1.5 billion in total between now and 2013-over three financial years. The disclosure regime we introduced in 2004 has transformed the battle against avoidance and has protected over £12 billion of revenue since it was introduced six years ago. We have been consulting since the pre-Budget report, in which we set out proposals for strengthening the disclosure arrangements, and clause 57 is the result of that consultation and discussion. It does indeed strengthen and enhance the disclosure regime further still.</p>

 In the context of his consideration of Finance Bills over the last year or so, will the Minister explain whether he believes that the legislation is now getting so complicated that it is becoming a burden on the British people? Has he given any serious consideration to the idea of having a flat tax, for example, in order to remove that burden?

Far from unlocking investment, the telephone tax would clearly hamper it, and we got it dropped.

Pending that explanation on these provisions, we have taken matters into our hands and forced the Government to drop them. The problem was that a criminal offence was being created in connection with a requirement that had not been properly explained or scrutinised. The CIOT put it best when it said:</p>

There is concern that some of the measures that remain in the Bill have not been properly thought through and consulted on. We might not have much time in the Committee of the whole House to go through the Bill clause by clause, but I want to touch on a few of those measures now. I have chosen as examples measures that, although they are probably well-intentioned, might need to be revisited because of the lack of proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

In addition to the pages in the Bill, there are 74 pages of detailed technical notes.

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="100407-0019.htm_para19"><a name="10040747000031">As I said in an intervention on the Financial Secretary, within two months the one-off costs of implementation have tripled. I hope that when the Exchequer Secretary winds up she will give a fuller explanation of why those costs have tripled over such a short period. Given the number of areas that the Financial Secretary has outlined in which greater clarification is needed about how the rules will work in practice, I wonder whether those costs will continue to rise. We need to make sure that the Government's chosen measure of restricting the value of tax relief is the most straightforward and least expensive option available. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has said that the measures were drafted in such a way as to put a heavy and expensive administrative burden on employers, employees and pensions provisions.</p>

 I would go a little further. It is not just a matter of those forms of debt, but debt in the wider economy-family indebtedness right through the economy. When we look at the figures as a whole, they show Britain not as a relatively low-debt economy, which the raw Government data still do, but as one of the most indebted nations in the world. Such issues are fundamental to what has happened to the British economy and to our response. They will be pivotal to the success or otherwise of whoever is in government in a few weeks' time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para0"><a name="10040747000056">In addressing the issues, we need to consider two big questions. The first relates to timing. I am not a simple Keynesian but I believe nevertheless that around the world-it is not just a British issue-we are coping relatively well with a massive shock to the banking systems and the wider economies of the world. The reason why our unemployment has not risen as projected and why growth is resuming, albeit at low levels, is that there has been willingness to invest massively to counter the withdrawal of credit by the private sector by maintaining and bringing forward significant Government spending. That means that the timing of the withdrawal of that spending, and the degree to which we can expect the private sector to pick up the necessary investment that will keep the economy moving forward and growing, is absolutely fundamental to whoever is in government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para1"><a name="10040747000057">The knockabout in the papers, which will involve all sides, portrays a Conservative party looking for earlier cuts, while Labour and the Liberal Democrats say that the timing is not yet right, which I believe is fundamentally correct. Anybody tempted to say, when they are being canvassed on the doorstep, "I am not interested. You're all just the same. It makes no difference how I vote," should be under no illusion: what we have seen in the past 12 months, and the response to it, and what we shall see in the next 12 months and the response to that, will be absolutely critical to what happens next in the wider economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para2"><a name="10040747000058">We may disagree about the timing.

 I will in a moment, but I want to make the point that the decisions we are debating-about which taxes to raise and about how many taxes there are-fundamentally underpin both the question about the timing of the withdrawal of Government spend, and my next question, which is the balance between how much is raised through tax and how much is delivered through cutting back spending. There is a third issue, which is the fairness of distribution.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right about timing and the balance of the way in which we tackle the deficit, but on the last day of the Budget debate, his colleague, the hon.

 The evidence from the economy is that we are just about there. If we spend too much, we build up debt or tax problems for the future, but if we spend too little, the economy falls down.

 We have set out a series of tax changes that should be in the Bill. They are largely designed to move the burden that we are asking people to weather away from those on lower incomes. To pay for that, we would ask the more privileged on higher incomes to sacrifice some of their allowances, which I have never thought fair in any case. For example, we would deal with the distortion created by the tax reliefs on pensions that give more support to those on the highest incomes than people on the lowest, especially because we know that those on the lowest incomes are the people who struggle the most to have sufficient pensions.</p>

Clearly, whoever is next in government will make real decisions that will affect families all over the country. Twenty-three years ago, I came into Parliament on Budget day, after the by-election that followed the tragic death of my predecessor, David Penhaligon, who was the finance spokesman for the Liberal party, as it then was. I had been working with him on economic policy and I happened to be from Truro, so I was asked to stand in that by-election. I am leaving the House at the general election, because I do not believe it is a great place for the dad of a two-year-old and a three-year-old to be when they are at school in Cornwall and I am here. I think it is time for a change anyway, after having been here for 23 years. It may be a relief to all that I am leaving. It has been a privilege to represent the seat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para6"><a name="10040747000076">My first speech was made during the debate on that Budget and my first Committee work was on that Finance Bill. I saw that through, then a general election was called and I had to do it all again, so I became familiar with Finance Bills more quickly than anybody really deserves, particularly at the age of 24. Nobody should be under any illusion that what we had then in government was a fundamentally different approach to the tax system and spending from what we have today. Nobody should be under any illusion that what we had in response to recession in the 1980s and again in the 1990s was fundamentally different from what we have seen recently-more Keynesian, positive investment to keep down unemployment and no talk of unemployment being a price worth paying. However, in my view, the balance has not been got right on fairness-we see inequality increasing, not narrowing, in this country. The balance has not been got right in terms of setting out the real detail of what needs to be done to tackle the problems.</p>

I hope that the result of the leaders' debates and the challenges put down by the press and the public during the campaign will force out of everyone more detail than I dare say the manifestos will supply. That is one of the great advantages of democracy: the unexpected question from a member of the public often finds the detail that Parliament rarely does.</p>

because my three-year-old has been going through cancer treatment and I have seen the real impact of the investment in the NHS at Great Ormond Street hospital, I hope that it is true-all the leaders say so-that all three parties are genuinely committed to investment in a national health service that is free for all at the levels and in the ways that people need when they need its help. To those who think that there is a lot of money sloshing around, I say that some of the facilities and staff at Great Ormond Street are undoubtedly among the best in the world, but anyone who thinks that it is overfunded needs to spend a little time there.</p>

So why on earth did the Government not hold the Budget at the beginning rather than the end of March? Why on earth, having held a late Budget, did the Government not get on with a more rapid preparation of the Finance Bill?

day of serious parliamentary business, and to being told that there will be just a few hours in which to debate all its stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para14"><a name="10040747000085">My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and his Front-Bench colleagues wisely said to the Government that they must strike out three of the nasty little tax increases and new taxes that they wanted to place in the Bill, and I am delighted that the Government have agreed to do that; that is an improvement to the version of the Bill that we have in our hands for this debate. So recent was the agreement that we do not even have the right document to debate; the one that I have still does not have the necessary changes or amendments to the Government's line. The Government must have known that the Opposition would not let through the new taxes or tax changes, which would have had adverse effects on important groups in our country, yet we are still given a text that implies that those measures will be introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para15"><a name="10040747000086">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham, I welcome lowered bingo duty, the exemption from stamp duty and the other few crumbs in the Bill that recognise that Britain is now a grossly overtaxed country, and that high taxes are now an impediment to enterprise, growth and success-things that all Members here surely want. However, we had to listen to the Minister wandering off the subject and saying, in his opening remarks, that the Government got every economic call right, and I find that very difficult to accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para16"><a name="10040747000087">This is the Government who said that they had abolished boom and bust, but they put the economy through the biggest boom and bust that any of us have ever seen in our lifetimes-a boom and bust far bigger than anything inflicted on this country since the great recession of the 1930s. This is the Government whose calls included building a debt mountain in the public and private sectors with easy money and low interest rates up to 2007, and who then decided to trigger an avalanche of debt collapse and collapsing asset prices by withdrawing all the money and restricting the banks too late in the cycle. That threatened the banks themselves and brought the system almost to its knees. This was the boom-and-bust Government to beat all boom-and-bust Governments. This is the Government who did unparalleled damage to our economy, yet the Minister dares to come here this evening to make party political points about how they got everything right. He should be concentrating on this mean and miserable Finance Bill, which he wishes to rush through without proper scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para17"><a name="10040747000088">Why do we need proper scrutiny of a Finance Bill? We need it because many people's livelihoods and working futures depend on the tax legislation that this and other Governments put through Parliament. Every one of the clauses could create joblessness, difficulty for a business, or problems for someone trying to wrestle with the complexities of an economy scarcely out of recession and performing very lamely and badly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="100407-0020.htm_para18"><a name="10040747000089">The Bill ranges extremely widely. We are asked to agree to items on income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty land lax, inheritance tax, alcohol and tobacco duties, vehicle excise duties, fuel duties, environmental taxes, gambling, new taxes, losses and capital allowances, charities, the remittance basis relating to taxation, and international tax matters-and I am not even halfway through the list that we are invited to consider.</p>

 Just to take one example, which I hope to come on to in a moment, does my right hon. Friend, or could anybody, including the Ministers, have the foggiest idea what the "appropriate pension increase" is when it is defined as (ACP x CAPARF) - (UOP x OAPARF)?</p>

 Indeed, that has defeated me, and my hon.

The inability to give it such attention will doubtless mean that the Government and their successor will come to regret the legislation, and will doubtless mean that some future House of Commons has to reopen these issues and put them right.</p>

 I entirely agree. I favour lower taxes because they are fair and raise more revenue, and I think they raise more revenue for that very reason. Lower and simpler taxes impose less of a burden on people, who are then more willing to work harder and do not have to spend so much of their working time dealing with complicated tax issues to avoid falling foul of growingly complex and difficult to understand legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para0"><a name="10040747000098">We are now in the position where many people subject to a specialist tax in their area cannot understand the formula or the rationale and need to take on expensive tax advice to comply with the legislation. This can apply to quite small businesses that do not have that kind of resource and are not used to employing expensive accountants or lawyers but are forced into doing so by the enormous complexity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para1"><a name="10040747000099">So it is with a very heavy heart that I see that the Government's dying wish is to go out as they came in and be remembered as the Government who did more than any other we have known to add to the volume of tax legislation and the complexity and imperfect working of the tax system. Many Governments have queued up to win that prize, but this Government have beaten the rest of them hands down with their doubling of the length and complexity of the tax provisions in this country. To slide out 167 pages, 71 clauses and attached schedules this late in the Parliament, and then to offer us no time in which to probe or examine them, is typical of them but a complete disgrace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para2"><a name="10040747000100">The time available this evening does not permit me to go through the Bill even generally, clause by clause, much as I would like to and my colleagues would be grateful if I did not. However, that illustrates what is wrong with the situation: a 71-clause Bill, tackling every major tax and quite a few minor taxes in the country, with a view to changing them in some way and often to increase the amount of money that they raise, will not be properly scrutinised because of the way the Government have decided to behave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para3"><a name="10040747000101">The Government claim to have made all the calls correctly but they need a Finance Bill to raise more money. This, of course, is not that Finance Bill, because it is the pre-election Finance Bill, and we have already heard from the Minister that it does not include one of their main tax-raising proposals, which, if they win the election, will be the national insurance tax increase. So we know that the Government would have to come back to the House with more tax-raising legislation, but we know also that, even with their limited ambitions for deficit reduction in the next year or two, there is still a big black hole in their total figures. We know that the Budget, when delivered, did not have a proper statement of spending plans and cuts. There was a global figure for many cuts, but we do not know where they will fall or how they will be handled. And we know that there was a global figure for tax increases. The Government will say that this Bill does some of the work on that, but it in no way covers all the increased tax revenue that they have forecast, because they wish a bigger share of the deficit reduction to be achieved by tax increases than the Conservative Opposition do.</p>

 My right hon. Friend has just mentioned the imminent increase in national insurance, although it is not part of the Finance Bill. Surely, however, that must be part of our debate, because it will affect employment in manufacturing and commerce. At Prime Minister's questions today, the Prime Minister made great play saying that the increase was necessary to provide for education and the health service, but what is more important: increasing our manufacturing capacity and output, and thereby increasing our tax revenues; or harming manufacturing industry merely to sustain what are, I accept, important-education and the health service?</p>

 Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not think my hon. Friend was in the Chamber for your very wise advice to others in this debate-that we must stick to the contents of the Finance Bill, or to the things we would like to see in it, because some of us would have liked to move amendments to improve it, but we will not be able to do so owing to the restricted time. I fear that, because national insurance will be legislated for differently, it does not strictly fall within that remit. However, I think my hon. Friend stayed in order, because he wisely said that the national insurance increase could have such a damaging impact on the general state of the economy-it will definitely restrict growth and it is a tax on jobs, as even Ministers admit-that it could damage the revenues for which the Bill makes provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para4"><a name="10040747000104">At the beginning of the debate, I tried to tease out of the Minister by way of an intervention what he thought the revenue loss would be on his figures if we struck out or modified the four clauses to which Opposition Front Benchers object. He said that in a full year he thought it would cost £220 million. However, other measures in the Bill and more generally could lose the Government rather more revenue than that, because they have made such an assault on enterprise, business, growth and development that they might find that higher tax rates, far from yielding the increased revenue that their models predict, yield rather less or, in some cases, even lead to a drop. We may well find that there are timing differences on tax payments and that there is a change in the place of residence to which businesses and rich individuals might relocate. The Government might find that they have gone over the top with the rates and will have a problem filling part of their budget black hole through the tax revenue that they will collect if they stay in office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para5"><a name="10040747000105">On all those grounds, this is a very bad Bill. It is not a Bill for recovery, because it does not offer the tax incentives for growth that one would expect to see. It confirms the pattern of taxing more and subsidising more that has characterised the more recent years of this Government's lack of progress. It greatly increases the complexity and detail of the tax code in a way that is wholly inimical to the wish of honest people to get on with earning a good living and running a good business, as my hon. Friends and I have sought to set out. Above all, it misses the main points because it does not tackle the spending side of the equation, which is being kept secret until after the election, or bring in some of the biggest tax rises that the Government are planning, which have to be introduced in another way.</p>

and the other flat on the brake because they are trying to restrict the banks as much as possible. That is, of course, the way to go absolutely nowhere. It surprises me that they can present a Finance Bill such as this and say that it is part of a package of recovery, when we have experienced the longest recession of any of the major economies and had about the feeblest signs up upturn. The Government say that that means we have done very well, but it clearly means that we have done very badly. It is quite obvious why-they chose the wrong point of the cycle at which to clobber and restrict the banks. They should have restricted, managed and regulated them properly on the way up and not brought them juddering to a halt as they did in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para7"><a name="10040747000107">The Government are still doing that to the banks, as I have been trying to illustrate to Members on the Treasury Bench, by taking £700 billion out of the balance sheet of our leading bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, which they happen to own. No Treasury Minister has ever explained why they are doing that. This Bill contains provisions for another tax on banks-I understand how popular that is-but does not make provisions for expanding banks. Surely what we need, if we are to have a positive and strong recovery, is banks that can expand their lending to British business and individuals sensibly, so that there is an increase in private sector demand as well as the limited increases in public sector spending that the Government think represent the way to a recovery.</p>

The Government are creating a lop-sided economy with fast-expanding public spending and fast-contracting private sector debt and activity in many areas. That is the way to national bankruptcy. This Finance Bill will not raise anything like enough revenue to pay for the huge amount of spending that they are proposing. Their model of running the economy will not lead to a rapid recovery of the kind that we desperately need, and it will not create the jobs that we need to get people off benefit. That is the type of public spending cut that I would like to see-really big cuts in the social security programme because people have gone back to work or got a job for the first time and do not need benefit any more. Surely that is a cut that we can all agree on, but the Bill will not deliver it because it does not provide the friendly tax environment for business and enterprise that must be required if we are to get a decent recovery.</p>

Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) made an excellent response to the Budget and reminded the House that, under this Government's lack of tender care, the UK has gone from being the fourth best tax regime for business in the free world to being the 84th best, which is a dreadful reduction in our tax competitiveness as a result of the measures in this and other recent Finance Bills. That is why our economy is not going anywhere-because of an anti-enterprise Finance Bill and because the Government will not sort the banks out properly. Until Ministers can explain to the House why they have pursued a boom and bust policy towards the banks, we will not have a proper explanation of the mess we are in, and until they come forward with a Finance Bill that is pro-enterprise, we are not going anywhere fast.</p>

It has been mentioned already that the national insurance changes, which will limit businesses' ability to recruit and take spending power away from local economies, are not in the Bill, but many other things are. It includes provisions for three fuel duty rises-that is in addition to the three that we have had in the past 12 months or so. A 17 per cent. rise in fuel duty-that makes it six rises over just two years-is massively over inflation and hugely damaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para12"><a name="10040754000004">The Bill also includes higher duty on Scotch, which will do precisely nothing to tackle the issue of problem drinking and antisocial behaviour that follows, but will, of course, have a huge impact on the manufacturers and distillers. The Bill also freezes tax allowances, representing a real-terms cut in take-home pay for real people and taking more spending power out of local economies. It takes no recognition of the fact that for many people the real inflation rate is about 50 per cent. higher than the published rate used by the Government. With tax allowance thresholds frozen, that is a double whammy when it comes to spending power and inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para13"><a name="10040754000005">The Bill is linked to the Government's fiscal responsibility plan, which, at its heart, is simply for deep and savage cuts-cuts deeper and tougher than even under Baroness Thatcher. It is worth reminding ourselves that the Bill is the starter to many of the cuts to come, which will include real-terms cuts to budgets this year, but without a comprehensive spending review to tell us where they will come from, and £57 billion out of the economy in 2013-14. For the avoidance of doubt-people should remember this-that is nearly £20 billion in tax rises and nearly £40 billion in service cuts, which represents nearly 3 per cent. of gross domestic product, assuming that the Government's forecast of 3.25 per cent. growth in four of the next five years is remotely achievable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="100407-0021.htm_para14"><a name="10040754000006">I do not believe that this is a Finance Bill for growth, and I am not at all convinced that the Government's plan for fiscal consolidation has any credibility. As the right hon. Member for Wokingham said, there is no time to go through the Bill in any considerable detail, but it is worth highlighting one or two of the clauses. The changes in clause 1 to rates and thresholds will mean a real-terms tax rise and a real-terms cut in  <br>

take-home pay. Clause 3 and the changes on small profits rates and fractions will have an impact on small businesses. I happen to welcome clause 6 on the relief for first-time buyers and the increase of the threshold to £250,000 for first-time buyers. However, a first-time buyer still needs to get a mortgage, and even if they can only get 80 per cent., they will still need to find £50,000 in cash to buy a £250,000 home. There cannot be very many people in the Minister's part of east London who have a spare £50,000 in their pockets for a deposit for a house. I suspect that even those on the Tory Front Bench might struggle to find that kind of loose change, so although I welcome the move, it is slightly surreal.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has just talked about the amount that individual first-time buyers might need to put down to obtain a mortgage from a bank or building society. However, I hope he will accept that part of the problem in this country was that we were giving people too much money to buy houses with. In some cases Northern Rock was giving people 125 per cent. of the capital value. That surely led to some of the problems. Is there a figure that the hon. Gentleman believes it would be right for people to put down as a meaningful deposit on a mortgage?</p>

 I would not want to set the business model for any bank or building society. If there was a particularly wealthy individual to whom it was quite safe to lend 100 per cent., it would be quite safe to do so. For others, the old rule of three or three-and-a-half times one salary, or two or two-and-a-half times a joint salary seems to make perfect sense. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: we cannot go back to lending at five times joint salary based on future pension provision; that was an act of absolute madness. But as his right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham said in a debate a few weeks ago, if we need to invoke counter-cyclical measures from time to time when we begin to grow out of the recession, then perhaps we need to look again at some of the rules and restrictions.</p>

With record prices at the pump and the barrel price having gone up by, I think, $30 in a year, that could be catastrophic for the haulage sector, for families and for those who need to drive to work, and the measure is, of course, inflationary in its own right.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. As we have seen those rises in the barrel price-something like $2 in the past month, $10 in the past six months and $30 in the past year-we have seen a corresponding rise in the price at the pump. This issue is within the Government's control: they get the duty, but they also get a VAT windfall when the price at the pump goes up. In addition, as the barrel price rises, they get more North sea corporation tax, from the normal corporation tax and the ring-fenced regime. There are therefore windfalls for the Government from VAT, their own duty rises and North sea corporation tax, which is why the fuel duty regulator-or the Conservatives' version  <br>

of a fair fuel stabiliser, or whatever some of the sensible Members on the Labour Benches called the measure-is exactly the right thing to introduce. Should the Conservatives win the next election, I hope they can be held to their promise to introduce their version of the fuel duty regulator quickly, to smooth out spikes in prices at the pump.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but can he confirm that while tax is now two thirds of the pump price-the Government's imposition is a big reason why the price has gone up so much-the huge devaluation of the pound also means that the sterling price of oil has gone up far more than the dollar price?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is right about the impact of currency fluctuations. He is right that duty and tax amount to approximately two thirds of the price of a litre, but the real killer is in wholesale diesel. Before tax, our diesel is among the cheapest in Europe; after tax, it is possibly the most expensive. From my point of view, as a Scot in an oil-rich nation, I find that quite abhorrent, especially when people are struggling to make ends meet and when we are seeing six rises-a 17 per cent. hike-in fuel duty over two years.</p>

If there is £2 billion in the Treasury coffers, there is £2 billion less to lend to real people in the real world. As for scrutiny of these proposals, schedule 1 is 21 pages long, and we could easily have a two-day debate on that schedule alone to ensure that there were no loopholes in it.

That was hyperbole-delivered in the style of practised statistics oratory-but given the real-terms cuts now proposed, and the £57 billion that will come out of the economy in a single year a couple of years hence, why are those on the Treasury Bench not listening to him? Why do they think that the cuts proposed in the Bill and in their other measures will lead to anything other than a return to recession?</p>

There have been proposals that have gone through rather rapidly in the wash-up stages, but I have never before witnessed what we have seen today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para0"><a name="10040754000017">The most important thing is to tell the British people the truth about the economy in the context of the public expenditure commitments, the cuts that will be required and the taxation that will be needed, which will supposedly be derived from the provisions in the Bill and other legislative measures, the effect of which the Government claim will balance off the deficit and reduce the debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para1"><a name="10040754000018">My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) pointed out that the most important thing is to regenerate the economy, and that in order to do so we must take an enterprise approach to manufacturing as well as to the service industries and to small businesses, to give them a chance to get up off their knees and to get the economy going again. I cannot see anything in the Bill-apart from one or two measures that our Front Benchers have identified-that would assist the small business community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para2"><a name="10040754000019">The national insurance issue is not even in the Bill, yet we know that it will cause immense damage to small and medium-sized businesses and to the people of this country at large, as hundreds of commentators have already said. I understand why it is not in the Bill, but its omission will have an impact on the Bill because there will be a greater requirement to raise more revenue as a result of what the Bill does contain. The real problem is that not a single penny-not one farthing-of public expenditure to pay for public services comes from anything other than private enterprise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para3"><a name="10040754000020">We all understand that public services are important and essential in their own way-no one on the Opposition side is advocating the abolition of public services; we are just asking for a proper and efficient public service sector-and the pensions that go with the sector are also important. As the CBI has commented over the last few days, public sector pensions are out of control.</p>

Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) and myself call ourselves-or at least I call us-the Three Musketeers, as we have hammered away on the subject of the net debt for the best part of nearly two years. The reality is that the true debt this country carries has a huge significance for the amount of money that needs to be raised by taxation to fill the gap-and the amount of tax raised is woefully inadequate. According to the Office for National Statistics, it is in the order of £3 trillion. I received a letter from Sir Michael Stoner the other day, confirming my figures, as I had raised with him certain matters relating to this issue, and the House of Commons Library also confirmed them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para5"><a name="10040754000022">The figures vary between about £2.65 trillion and £3.21 trillion, but that is the minimum, as it gets worse if we add in the hidden costs of public sector pensions, Network Rail, private finance initiatives and nuclear decommissioning, on which an announcement has recently been made-and it is pretty horrendous. These amounts can be aggregated with the amount of debt to which the Government admit. Then there is the business of whether we include or exclude the financial sector interventions. If we include them, the situation becomes dramatically worse.</p>

 I entirely understand and accept the point you make, Madam Deputy Speaker. I also have to say that I am talking very realistically and in a practical way about the fact that the Finance Bill simply does not fill the gap created by the massive debt that has been accumulated. If the truth is not being told about the true level of the debt, it affects the Finance Bill and every provision in it. I regard this Second Reading as a kind of massive omnibus stand part discussion. This is the only opportunity to debate the issue, if I may say so, given that every single clause coming to its Committee stage will not be subjected to the clause stand part debates that normally take place with a Finance Bill. In addition, no amendments have been tabled-or, at least, none has been selected-from anyone other than the Government. The Committee stage will not take long, for the simple reason that there is no real opportunity to look at the context in which this massive deficit and massive gap in public expenditure can be filled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para6"><a name="10040754000027">There is another real problem here. If we look for a second at the level of unemployment that needs to be paid for, we see that the figures we have been given are themselves unrealistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para7"><a name="10040754000028">I believe that, according to the economic indicators in a House of Commons research paper, the International Labour Organisation has said that 2.6 million people are unemployed, but there are about 1,600,000 job claimants. Given the effective unemployment level that results if those figures are added together, and given all the revenue that must be raised, the Bill will have to fund the payment of 4.1 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="100407-0022.htm_para8"><a name="10040754000029">As I said earlier, not one penny of public expenditure will come from any source other than private enterprise unless we simply go to the printing presses and print the money off. Not a single penny to pay for the public services that people need-and we advocate that, but on a rational basis-will come from any other source. If a Government do not get growth and enterprise right, which means putting the cart and the horse in the right order, they will not be able to provide for public expenditure. That is the one thing that this Government-in fact, all Labour Governments-totally fail to understand.</p>

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who is leaving the House at the election, for continually and rightly emphasising that point.

The effect of over-regulation on those who are afflicted by it is in itself a disincentive that lessens our ability to run an efficient economy. People can spend all their time dealing with this. That applies to farmers dealing with the over-regulation of their affairs and with their tax problems, and to other small businesses. How are pensioners supposed to cope with this kind of thing, even if they are relatively well off? It is absurd to have legislation of this complexity.</p>

 My hon. Friend rather quickly passed over the problems of rural communities and farming. I believe that he was referring, to an extent, to the increase in hydrocarbon taxes. Is he aware that in many rural communities there is little or no public transport and so people, in many cases those on low wages, including pensioners, cannot lead a reasonable standard of life if they do not use a car? Is he also aware that the cost of such usage is being dramatically increased through taxation year on year? Does he agree that this is a very serious matter?</p>

I had to wait the best part of a month to get the answer, but the fact is that the FSA report said that it was inevitable that a significant proportion of the money that would be required to finance the repayment of loans was going to have to come from the taxpayer. The figures are horrendous.

It arises out of the monumental and wanton increase in debt that itself does not even touch on the amount of net debt, which gets up to as much as £3.1 trillion if the Office for National Statistics is to be believed-I repeat that "if".

Government in the past few days, which I must say I applaud, However, I discovered something from the ONS the other day that deeply concerns me and I refer, just this once, to a subject with which some people might associate me: the ONS statistical base is agreed by EUROSTAT and that is a warning to us all. It was EUROSTAT's statistical assumptions that led to the ability of certain accountants, lawyers and bankers to advise the Greeks to enter into arrangements that have led to the crisis there. In other words, the EUROSTAT arrangements look as though they did not enable true figures to be provided, which enabled the Greeks to get away with it. That is where this Government are heading.</p>

 Thank you for calling me to speak in this debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am surrounded by four excellent gentlemen: my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), two knights of the shires-my hon. Friends the Members for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) and for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)-and my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).

I am not taken to acts of naked partisanship in the run-up to a general election, and I shall resist that temptation for at least the next 30 seconds. I have read the Finance Bill from cover to cover and it is very grim reading. It is a very concerning document. Its 167 pages are a metaphor for this Government's failing over the past 13 years. This is what we are left with: impenetrable clauses talking about figures and numbers that nobody could possibly understand unless they were working in a bank inventing impossible figures and numbers that would eventually bankrupt this country. It is not a document for growth: it is a document for further contraction in our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="100407-0023.htm_para1"><a name="10040754000064">We, in this place, have every right to be hugely concerned about this document, but the issue is not whether we are concerned: it is whether our constituents are concerned, and they should be. In this document, we have yet more hidden taxes-hidden taxes on middle-class families, hidden taxes on working-class families, frozen allowances and higher duties. Those will all damage people's quality of life. This is going to be a very short speech, as we prepare for the general election. The only people who are doing well out of this document are the people who publish "Tolley's Tax Guide", which has trebled in size over the past 13 years. If we have much more of this, it will treble again in just the weeks ahead.</p>

 Earlier in the debate, when my hon. Friend was not here, I ventured to suggest that we should consider a flat-rate tax. This legislation is so complicated and absurd that we have to find a way of reducing it. The rest of it is over-complicated for the people out there in our constituencies, and it is simply a milch cow for the accountancy and legal professions.</p>

 I agree. It is absolutely impossible, even for well-educated people who think they might have an understanding of these things, to penetrate the complexity of this document. As we speak, accountants and advisers around the country are popping champagne corks because they are the only ones who will benefit from this document.</p>

I shall conclude by saying that we have had the boom and that this document represents the bust.

Is my hon. Friend worried that the Budget does very little to reduce the Budget deficit? Unless we reduce our indebtedness in this country, the money markets are going to lose confidence in our ability to take sensible steps to do that. If they lose that confidence, we will lose our triple A credit status, which will immediately lead to increased taxation, increased interest rates and, I believe, increased unemployment. Is my hon.

Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) said, I came into this House championing manufacturing industry. I go out doing the same because, as I have said before, it is the only source of sustainable non-inflationary economic growth.

We argue that it is necessary to publish draft legislation at the time of the pre-Budget report-in advance of the publication of the Finance Bill-to allow for proper scrutiny, including pre-legislative scrutiny by a parliamentary Committee.

Many aspects of the Bill have not received the necessary pre-legislative scrutiny, and the Bill is clearly not getting the legislative scrutiny that one would expect, so there is a fair chance that it will contain errors that would have been picked up under the normal process. I do not believe for a moment that the normal process is sufficient in itself, but I hope that the hon.

 I am sorry that I could not be here earlier, but I want to raise an issue about one of the Bill's provisions, given that it seems that there will not be a Committee stage. My point relates to clause 59, which is about the opening of postal packages. The Minister might have a chance to get a note on the subject. Why is the safeguard of allowing the addressee to be present, or indeed to be notified, being removed by an amendment to section 106 of the Postal Services Act 2000, which deals with contraband? Article 8 of the European convention on human rights is engaged by the opening of private mail. I would be grateful if she clarified the justification for removing that important safeguard, as that is not in the explanatory notes.</p>

 It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman was not here for, and unable to contribute to, the Second Reading debate. I will try to get the exact answer to his question, but the customs powers relate to the examination of goods imported in postal packets. Customs does not have powers to open or read correspondence. We are trying to tackle organised tobacco smuggling through the post-a point that was made in an intervention on the Financial Secretary when we were talking about tobacco rates and the incidence of smuggling.</p>

 That is very helpful, but I remind the Minister that under section 106 of the 2000 Act-I raise the point because it has been covered in the media-the threshold is that a postal operator may detain any postal packet that they suspect contains relevant goods and forward it to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. HMRC can then open whatever it receives. As it is, there is no reasonableness test. The only safeguard is that the person to whom the packet is addressed ought to be there, or at least needs to be notified. That is being stripped away by clause 59 of the Bill. The threshold is not HMRC suspecting anything; it is a postal operator suspecting. There is a low threshold, and the Bill removes one of the safeguards, or perhaps the only safeguard.</p>

 I can only repeat that we take tobacco smuggling very seriously, which is why an amendment is being made to clause 59. It is something that we wish to tackle.

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="100407-0024.htm_para6"><a name="10040760000036">I was talking about businesses, and the Finance Bill includes a number of measures to ensure that businesses continue to invest and grow, doubling both the support provided through the annual investment allowance and the lifetime limit on entrepreneurs' relief. The planned increase in corporation tax for small companies is being deferred further to support businesses through challenging times, and, as I have said, we also hope to support the low-carbon economy. We are halving company car tax for ultra-low-carbon cars, bringing in a zero rate for cars with no emissions and thereby helping to make the UK one of the best places in the world to build low-carbon vehicles.</p>

We have been clear that, as the economy recovers, the Government will halve the level of borrowing, and we believe it right that those with the broadest shoulders take the greatest burden, so the top 1 per cent. of taxpayers alone will pay the additional 50 per cent. rate of income tax. Most people do not pay inheritance tax, and, even with the freeze in the allowance, only 4 per cent. of estates are expected to pay in 2014-15.

a tax windfall when oil prices are high.

 Certainly the letters that I have had from the beer industry, including small brewers, express the opinion that it is very unfair. Even with the 10 per cent. increase that we planned to introduce, the rate of duty on cider would still have been half that on beer. We were trying not to close the gap totally, but to bring the two closer together. The two largest companies produce more than 80 per cent. of cider, and under our proposed regulations the majority of cider makers-almost 400 of the smallest producers-would have been subject to special conditions and not affected. None the less, we have gone through a process of negotiation and consensus, and the measure will not be in the Bill, although when we are returned to Government we will bring it back.</p>

 Given the time, I shall be brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="100407-0024.htm_para20"><a name="10040760000055">Clause 2 relates to the main rate of corporation tax. I was rereading the Prime Minister's 1997 Budget speech when he highlighted the importance of the corporation tax rate, announced a reduction in that rate and highlighted the international comparisons. It might help the House to compare where we were in 1997 with where we are now. In 1997, our corporation tax rate was lower than the OECD average, but now it is higher; in 1997, our corporation tax rate was the 11th lowest, but now it is the 23rd lowest; we used to have the third lowest in the EU15, but now it is the sixth highest; and while the rest of the world has been cutting its corporation tax rates substantially, the UK has been caught up with and, in many cases, overtaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o542"><a name="100407-0024.htm_para21"><a name="10040760000056">Clause 2 does nothing about that situation. We have made it clear that we intend to lower the corporation tax rate by broadening the base and reforming complex allowances. That has the advantage of sending out a signal to the rest of the world and international investors that the UK is open for business, and by lowering the rate we will also be in a position to remove some of the complexities and anti-avoidance measures that may be taken as a consequence of the UK having a rate that is not as attractive as that of our competitors. The Government tend to quote comparisons with the G7, but beyond that many countries now have a lower corporation tax rate than the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o543"><a name="100407-0024.htm_para22"><a name="10040760000057">The Exchequer Secretary said that some argue against those matters, and last week the Chief Secretary quoted General Electric's international tax counsel, Will Morris, on this.

We have become increasingly uncompetitive in this area, so we intend to reduce the mainstream corporation tax rate from 28 to 25 per cent. and the small profits rate from 22 to 20 per cent. We believe that that will be a step in the right direction; indeed, we have ambitions to reduce the rate further, and have engaged some of the country's leading tax experts.

best corporate tax environment in the G20. We should look beyond the G7; we should look at standards in the G20 as a whole, to enable us to bring our corporation tax rate down further. This Finance Bill could have been an opportunity to start some of those reforms and move towards a lower corporation tax rate, but it is an opportunity that has been spurned. However, we hope to have an opportunity in the months ahead to ensure that the UK once again has one of the most competitive corporation tax rates in the developed world.</p>

That person might not have owned a home previously, but the provision applies if, as proposed new section 57AA(1)(d) of the Finance Act 2003 says,</p>
<a name="100407-0025.htm_brev1"><a name="10040760000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the purchaser, or (if more than one) each of the purchasers, is a first-time buyer who intends to occupy the residential property as the purchaser's only or main residence".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o552"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para8"><a name="10040760000072">The second point that has been raised with me relates to proposed new section 57AA(2)(a) of the 2003 Act, which says that "first-time buyer" means a person who</p>
<a name="100407-0025.htm_brev2"><a name="10040760000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">"has not previously been a purchaser in relation to a relevant acquisition of a major interest in land".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o553"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para9"><a name="10040760000073">My understanding is that someone over 18 living at home would, even if they were not the purchaser, be deemed for legal reasons to have a major interest in land, and that their consent might be required if the home were being remortgaged. How is that situation dealt with in proposed new subsection (2)(a)?</p>

<p><a name="st_o452"><a name="10040760000074"><a name="100407-0025.htm_spnew5"><a name="10040760000175"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 In answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question, the issue would be whether the person who had previously owned the property owned a stake in the property being acquired as a result of the arrangement that the hon. Gentleman has described. If the answer was no, and those whose names were on the deeds were first-time buyers, they would be eligible. If someone else who was not eligible had a share in the equity of the property, the concession would not apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o554"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para10"><a name="10040760000075">I did not entirely understand the hon. Gentleman's second question. I am not quite sure what he was asking about the relief. He appeared to be describing a situation in which an additional person in the property had not previously owned a property, and I do not think that the relief would be affected by that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o453"><a name="10040760000076"><a name="100407-0025.htm_spnew6"><a name="10040760000176"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 The Minister has clarified my first point about the situation in which a gift has been made to help someone to purchase a property: the relief could still be granted for that purchase when a gift had been made by, say, a relative to enable someone to purchase a house. My second point related to whether someone who was over 18 and, say, living in their parents' home would be deemed to have a major interest in that property. Would the provision in proposed new subsection (2)(a) prevent them from taking advantage of the relief when they subsequently bought a home of their own?</p>

<p><a name="st_o454"><a name="10040760000077"><a name="100407-0025.htm_spnew7"><a name="10040760000177"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 I think I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that. If someone who had been living in their parents' home and who had not previously owned a property or contributed to buying one subsequently left their parents' home and bought a property for the first time, they would be eligible for this relief.</p>

 You will recall, Sir Alan, that at this stage of the Finance Bill last year, I spoke for one hour and 17 minutes on an amendment dealing with alcohol taxation.

<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para16"><a name="10040760000092">We are delighted to see the Government forced to climb down on their massive across-the-board tax raid on cider drinkers, but it is clear that, without Conservative intervention, this would never have happened. It is equally clear that only the election of a Conservative Government will ensure that the tax on cider comes back down again. The Financial Secretary has already been quoted in the press as saying:</p>

 May I put on record the fact that it was the Liberal Democrats who established the cider caucus in this Parliament and that it is the Liberal Democrats who have been campaigning to ensure that tax on cider is not increased? The hon. Gentleman should not take this as only a Conservative victory; he should take it as a Conservative and Liberal Democrat victory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o566"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para22"><a name="10040760000102">Finally, let me say something about the Liberal Democrats' position. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), their spokesman on Treasury matters, is not present to witness the Government's climbdown on cider duties. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) is not here either, but it was the hon. Member for Taunton who mentioned, during the debate on last year's Finance Bill, that he had tabled an amendment that would have frozen duty on spirits but left duties on cider unchanged. Attempting to justify the move, he said:</p>
<a name="100407-0025.htm_brev6"><a name="10040760000138"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Cider is not as widely drunk in my constituency as it once was".-[<i> Official Report</i>, 12 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 778.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o567"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para23"><a name="10040760000103">That suggests to me that he is no great defender of the cider industry, although he is the Member of Parliament for Taunton. He subsequently tabled a further amendment to the Finance Bill which would have reduced taxes on beer but not, ultimately, those on cider. As we saw last year, the Liberal Democrats cannot claim to be friends of the cider industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o568"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para24"><a name="10040760000104">The Opposition disagree with the whole basis of the Government's approach. Rather than imposing a blanket increase on all types and strengths of cider, we would direct tax increases at the problem, which is caused by high-strength, mass-produced cider. We believe in taxing those 3-litre supermarket bottles of problem cider rather than taxing ordinary, responsible drinkers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o569"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para25"><a name="10040760000105">Our approach is not specific to cider, however. We would apply the same approach to all alcohol duties. For example, we would also target super-strength beer. We believe in targeting problem drinks, not all drinkers. Meanwhile, the Government continue to make alcohol duties a blunter instrument than is necessary. Responsible drinkers are being punished, pubs continue to struggle, and the minority who cause trouble go unchecked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o570"><a name="100407-0025.htm_para26"><a name="10040760000106">Today we have won a significant victory for common sense on cider, but it is a forced victory. The Government's message to cider drinkers could not be clearer. They have given way temporarily, but are pledged to reverse this amendment if Labour is returned to power. Their message is simply this: if you want a 10 per cent. increase in cider tax, vote Labour. If you want your tax reduced-</p>

 Sir Alan, you have always been a very patient man. I want to apologise to you in advance for the number of amendments that I suspect I will be moving alone. I know that you will patiently bear with me, but we have had to submit amendments and to consider our thoughts at light speed. Those people looking in will find the process as baffling as I am sure some of us in the Chamber do.</p>

Amendment 36 amends clause 4(1). This is about trying to identify liability. The wording in the Bill, as it stands, has an assumption of liability when it comes to people receiving notifications. Of course, a wi-fi network might have been used in a household. A parent might be paying for the broadband connection, whereas their children are illegally downloading. The assumption in the current wording is that that parent has authorised the child's infringement of copyright. My amendment would replace that wording with a neutral meaning to provide reassurance to parents up and down the country, students in houses in multiple occupation and anyone who shares a network, as the legislation would not assume guilt when a notification was sent out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o615"><a name="100407-0026.htm_para29"><a name="10040767000039">Amendment 37 deals with definitions. The lineage of the Bill is that it came out of a consultation that lasted for six months and looked into how we deal with illicit P2P-person-to-person-file sharing. In the amendment, I try to give a narrow definition of P2P file sharing, as opposed to opening up a rather general definition of copyright infringement. If the amendment were accepted, it would probably save embarrassment to many people on both sides of the House because, under the clause as it stands, anyone who downloaded the image of Gene Hunt that has been used by both political parties would be caught by the measure. I will not embarrass one of my very good friends in the Whips Office who every day sends me clipped pieces of news reports from national newspapers, but that practice could be seen as copyright infringement under the clause unless the amendment is accepted.</p>

 I shall not name him because, as the hon. Gentleman knows, naming Whips is not a good thing to do, particularly when one is moving an amendment that is hostile to the Government.

 Yes; I was rather taken aback yesterday to hear someone-I think it was the Conservative Front Bencher-say, "Let's just get this Bill through and if there's anything wrong with it, we can put it right." Ten years into being here, I know that if we do things in a hurry and get them wrong, the law of unintended consequences always kicks in. It would be far better to remove clauses 11 to 18 and have a period of reflection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o616"><a name="100407-0026.htm_para30"><a name="10040767000048">Amendment 34 would place a responsibility on rights holders to inform people whether the infringement that the rights holders have identified was, in their view, done for financial gain or simply because those people decided to infringe. The thinking behind the amendment is that, because the lobby groups that we have talked to have given us a host of what I consider to be rather bogus financial and economic predictions about the effects of illicit file sharing, rights holders and internet service providers should be required to determine whether this so-called online privacy is being done for personal financial gain, or simply because people want to share things that interest them. That would allow us to build up a body of evidence showing the true effects of illicit downloading in the future. I believe that this is a reasonable amendment, and I hope that the Government will consider accepting it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o617"><a name="100407-0026.htm_para31"><a name="10040767000049">Amendments 32, 34, 30, 31, 27, 24 and 40 are consequential, and deal with definition. We want to get the Bill refocused on P2P file sharing alone.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He is making a point about the financial aspect of file sharing, but does he agree that many of the people being criticised in the Bill are children, and that they will not pay for downloads or access to sites because they do not have the money?</p>

<p><a name="st_o491"><a name="10040767000051"><a name="100407-0026.htm_spnew18"><a name="10040767000192"><b>Mr. Watson:</b>
 Yes, and the same is true more broadly for people who want to share knowledge, data, culture, art and music with each other. They are not motivated by financial gain. Much of the criticism that the Bill has attracted is based on the fact that it concentrates on the economic impact of file sharing, whereas its social and cultural impact has not really been discussed or teased out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o618"><a name="100407-0026.htm_para32"><a name="10040767000052">Amendment 41 provides a definition of P2P file sharing. The Government have had trouble in that regard, and this amendment is my stab at the problem. It may be a rather folksy and, I guess, amateur attempt but, given that the great people at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills have been unable to come up with a definition, I thought that I would try.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o619"><a name="100407-0026.htm_para33"><a name="10040767000053">I turn now to new clause 3. We have been told that the whole thrust of the Bill is to reduce illegal infringement and illicit file sharing by 70 per cent. The use of such a target strikes me as slightly naive and gauche, when we should really be adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. We could reduce copyright infringement and illicit file sharing by 70 per cent., but there is no certainty that that would raise a single penny for the creators and rights holders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o620"><a name="100407-0026.htm_para34"><a name="10040767000054">Accordingly, new clause 3 seeks to remove people from the illegal black or grey markets by placing an obligation on the Government to promote legal downloading. I hope that the greater optimism of that approach will take the place of the pessimism that pervades the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o492"><a name="10040767000055"><a name="100407-0027.htm_spnew0"><a name="10040767000193"><b>Mr. David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I am delighted to support the amendments tabled in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) and for Selby (Mr. Grogan). My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East has put his finger on the problems with the Bill, which are twofold. First, the Bill needs proper scrutiny in this House. That was the basis of yesterday's Second Reading. I did not speak because I hoped that the Government would listen to wiser, brighter and more technically advanced voices than mine, and realise that we need to be careful about what we introduce at such a time. I hoped they would also realise that what seemed merely a technical Bill has become emotive and-dare I say it-quite dangerous. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East has just proved how difficult it will be to word the measure. He showed why we need proper scrutiny in Committee in the normal way, but that is not happening at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o621"><a name="100407-0027.htm_para0"><a name="10040767000056">My hon. Friend's second point was that the Bill started with quite a narrow focus, but now seems all-encompassing. As he rightly said, the real worry is that we shall pick up the very people we do not want. We are looking for the pirates, the cowboys, the commercial operators and we shall end by picking up children.</p>

<p><a name="st_o493"><a name="10040767000057"><a name="100407-0027.htm_spnew1"><a name="10040767000194"><b>Mr. Mark Todd (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b>
 My hon. Friend referred to proper scrutiny. The word he left out was "democratic"-the phrase should be "proper democratic scrutiny". The Bill has been scrutinised in the other place, but it is exactly the kind of measure that deserves the scrutiny of those who represent electors and who have much greater contact with citizens when dealing with matters of this kind. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

 I completely agree. Perhaps my position is unusual, but the Bill is getting me more of a postbag, and certainly more electronic contact, than any other issue at present. A few of us are standing for re-election and could do with getting on with that rather than trying to understand the Digital Economy Bill and trying to explain to people why what they think should be happening-proper scrutiny-is not happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o622"><a name="100407-0027.htm_para1"><a name="10040767000059">I take the wise words of my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East: we need to tighten up the provisions. Like him, I should like to see clauses 11 to 18 go, but we are making a fist of at least refocusing the Bill, to make it narrower. What happened in the other place was almost the reverse of what normally occurs, which is tightening up things that have not been done satisfactorily in this place. Now we have the obverse; the other place seems to have gone on a fishing trip to extend the Bill-I say no more-and we have to try to make good the damage in the most limited time and in the most limited ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o623"><a name="100407-0027.htm_para2"><a name="10040767000060">I can assure the Committee that our constituents-the people who have e-mailed and written to us-will be watching. They will not be at all pleased, just as they were not pleased yesterday when there was no vote on the Second Reading of this controversial Bill-its first hearing in this House. They will not be happy unless we give the Bill some scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o624"><a name="100407-0027.htm_para3"><a name="10040767000061">I finish on that point. I do not want to say more on this amendment, as I want to speak on the second group. However, as a number of Labour Members have chosen to stay here and make representations, I think it is fairly clear that we feel very unhappy.</p>

I am attracted by amendment 34, just as I am attracted by amendment 36, which would restore the United Kingdom view of the internet. Up until now, it has been assumed that a subscriber to an internet access service is responsible only for the actions that they take, but the Government's provision has the problem that it goes down the lines of the French model-it was actually rejected in the French courts-that a person is liable for any activity that takes place on an internet access service to which they subscribe.</p>

Under the Bill, all that will happen is that we will endlessly change our ISPs and e-mail addresses. That is not a solution to the fundamental problem that I think that hon. Members want to solve. The critical point is that the intellectual copyright of musicians and artists must be protected online as well as offline. I support what my hon.

 It strikes me that a lot of the difficulties that we are experiencing and hearing about are not dissimilar to those encountered in previous attempts to resist the growth of modern technology. Even in the 16th century, there was an attempt to track down people who set up secret presses; it made no difference. Although the attempt to prevent what is regarded as an illegal use of technology is understandable to achieve certain objectives, it seems to me that, underneath that, there is an attempt to stem a tsunami. The number of people who have connected with their MP, with the public at large, on radio and on television represent a significant core-perhaps even a significantly vast range-of people who simply are not prepared to accept the restrictions that the Bill suggests should be imposed on them.</p>

We hear a lot of talk about freedom of information. I know that some will say that information can be freely available only if it is regarded as legal information, but over the past few months we have had some experience of illegal information being made available, with interesting consequences. I would not advocate that, but I will say that there is an element of, not only uncertainty, but impossibility in seeking to restrain something without proper consultation, without a properly considered Bill and without the sort of analysis that the subject requires. I have listened carefully to Labour Members; not one has yet suggested that they think that the legislative proposals set out in the Bill are understandable and capable of being explained to the people who would be affected by them. That is the practical question, which, among other reasons, will lead me to vote against Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o634"><a name="100407-0027.htm_para13"><a name="10040767000078">I think that this is a bad Bill in the sense that is being rushed through. It is unthinkable that a Bill of such importance is being rushed through simply because the Prime Minister-I say this with respect to Labour Members-has set out in his five pledges something that approaches the content of the Bill. In addition, we are told that paper amendments are coming down from House of Lords as we speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o635"><a name="100407-0027.htm_para14"><a name="10040767000079">The bottom line is that we are dealing with a situation that calls out for proper scrutiny. I have just attended the proceedings on the Finance Bill; not one single Government Member was present during the whole course of those proceedings. Perhaps one popped in for 20 minutes, but that was that. However, I have just come from the Dining Rooms and there are about 100 people sitting there, all talking to one another, and I suspect that they are there for a purpose. I suggest that the Government take that on board and realise that they are really up against it. The Bill should not be rushed through. It is not the Dangerous Dogs Bill; it is a very different type of Bill.</p>

does my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and many others in all parts of the House. The Wright Committee proposals have just been kicked not just into touch but into the gutter. The reality is that proposals such as those in the Bill would never get past a House Committee, or a Back-Bench business committee. An example is being set; what the Government have disgracefully done this afternoon with regard to the Wright Committee proposals could be balanced by a significant revolt against the way in which the House is being treated with regard to the Bill.</p>

 I will not spend time on the lecture delivered by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), but I agree with him. He has turned cash-and-carry filibusters into a central part of the British constitution, and in this instance, he is absolutely right. I made my main position on the Bill absolutely clear yesterday, and I will not repeat what I said then. I shall be very brief. The central point is that we should not be discussing a series of amendments of this kind, although they are good and welcome amendments, at this late stage in the Bill's progress. The issues should have been discussed in proper scrutiny by the House of Commons, with representations from outside. Pre-legislative scrutiny would have been very helpful, too.</p>

I have had lots of representations-mainly by e-mail, it has to be said, which is a nuisance; I find it difficult to deal with. I have also had representations from young members of the Labour party-we have quite a number in Grimsby-who are all concerned, or frightened, that their harmless peer-to-peer file-sharing activities will be clamped down on. They fear that that will cause trouble for their family's internet connection and will lead to it being cut off. That is exactly the problem. We are not talking about big commercial operators who are defrauding the system; those should indeed be dealt with. The measures will have extensive repercussions for ordinary people with teenagers in the house, or young people around, who share files among themselves, thereby endangering the whole family.</p>

 To answer my hon. Friend's transcendent genius, there is a case to be made for protecting intellectual property, and the Bill tries to make it.

There is a real problem, and, to be fair, a lot of the market for music is among younger people, so although the industry overestimates the amount of money that it would gain from having a very much more restrictive approach on download, a lot of the music business is involved in selling to teenagers and perhaps even younger children at times. There is an issue here; there is no question about it. Musicians need a way of getting their return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o639"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para1"><a name="10040767000103">The first problem is trying to deal with a very complex issue in the wash-up. It is a completely absurd thing to do. I accept that the industry has had to wait four years for this, but that is not a reason to do it all in one night or two nights. That is a reason to drop clauses 11 to 18 and new clause 1 from the Bill and examine the matter properly in the new Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o640"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para2"><a name="10040767000104">The dangers lie with sites such as WikiLeaks, which is a good example to look at. It publishes leaked Government information, on which Governments always have the copyright. A recent example is the US air force video, which it published. Copyright exists with the US Government, who under the Bill could, and would want to, apply to ban WikiLeaks from the UK. That provision is clearly in the Bill. Yesterday I gave the example of freedom of information. Most local authorities, when they send people freedom of information requests, say, "By the way, we keep the copyright on this." They keep the copyright, and they could say, "There are websites that report on freedom of information requests, and they can be banned as well." I know that it sounds absurd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o641"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para3"><a name="10040767000105">This debate comes down to the fact that we need to review copyright, fair use and where copyright does and does not exist. On the one hand, the Government are imposing massive restrictions on copyright, whereby any situation involving any vague copyright suddenly means banning everyone in the family from the internet. On the other, the Government are taking from a television programme a picture of an Audi Quattro and mashing it up-and then somebody else is doing the same thing. We have that absurdity.</p>

With laws we have scrutiny, and that process should be rigorous, particularly when it involves something that is a part of so many people's daily lives.</p>

to consider, as are the websites that report on freedom of information requests, because the Bill would give the US Government the opportunity to ban people from looking at WikiLeaks. I am sure that the Government do not wish to achieve that end, but the way to deal with the issue is not to push the Bill through in two nights without any adequate scrutiny, and not to push through new clause 1 or clauses 11 to 18-although I understand that clause 18 will actually be disagreed to. The way to deal with the issue properly is to spend some time on it in the new Parliament, so that it can be examined from all angles. There is a real problem, but let us not make a real mess of it in order to deal with just one aspect.</p>

<p><a name="st_o522"><a name="10040767000108"><a name="100407-0028.htm_spnew2"><a name="10040767000223"><b>Dr. Palmer:</b>
 I shall be brief, because time is short. I am possibly one of the few Members who have suffered directly from illegal copying. When I produced my video game it was almost immediately copied, and I presume that I lost some royalties from that. So I do not consider this to be a completely trivial problem, as has been suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o644"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para6"><a name="10040767000109">However, there are two basic difficulties. First, the remedy is inappropriate. I am completely open to the argument that we should have stricter penalties for people who seek to make money out of illegal copying, from which many young people, to whom we referred earlier, might benefit. However, young people are not the primary instigators. The primary instigators are the people who make the original illegal copy and sell it on for gain. If we blocked internet access for individuals who make use of illegal copying, that would be inappropriate in two ways: they are not the primary instigators, and although we can imagine that perhaps they should be fined, we would be denying them access at a time when society as a whole increasingly depends on access, and when we are attempting to reduce the digital divide. By analogy, if I misused the postal service and as a penalty I was no longer allowed to receive letters, that would simply not be the right solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o645"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para7"><a name="10040767000110">Secondly, owners of copyright are generally quite powerful in their financial resources. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) that some of them may be start-up bands and not very well set, but there has been reluctance among major companies to pursue copyright infringements. Sometimes the infringements can be helpful in their marketing. As one of my constituents has said to me, targeting ISPs is a bit as though we were prosecuting road maintenance workers because the council had failed to impose the correct restrictions on how the roads were used. The ISP should not be our primary target in attempting to attack the problem.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman believe that, although we will not get the opportunity to look into it, there is a lot to be said for confining the offences to those who are both organised and acting for profit on a commercial basis? Any attempt to place a restriction on young people and then provide for an astonishing mechanism of appeals to a first-tier tribunal seems unbelievable. Young people who are engaged in the activities in question as a matter of practice will not be restrained, despite what everyone might want to say. We might end up producing an unworkable law on a fast track through the House, when there are remedies if we could only get down to the business of considering them properly.</p>

It is pathetic for Labour Members to pretend that the fact that we have had two hours to debate the Bill on Second Reading and one hour in Committee has nothing to do with them.

 We decided to support the Bill in principle. We would have loved to scrutinise the clauses being debated now and to table and debate amendments in the House. However, we supported the Bill in principle, and we support the principle that something should be done to combat illegal file sharing. In fact, every single Labour Member who has spoken has said that they support the principle that something should be done to combat illegal file sharing; they simply said that there is not enough scrutiny to make the Bill work, and whose fault is that? It is the fault of Labour Members.</p>

 We simply make the point that there is not time-we have been put in an invidious position. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) has made this absolutely clear. The astonishing position of the Labour Members-it's nothing to do with me, guv!-is absolutely incredible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is a very good friend of mine, and that is the most intellectually disingenuous contribution I have heard in the debate. If I, as a raggedy Back Bencher, can table a dozen amendments in 12 hours and write a speech, he should pull his finger out and do the same.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is not even going to move all his amendments; he is simply putting them forward for form's sake. I ask him what conversations he had with the Prime Minister-a close personal friend of his-who could have brought this Bill forward for scrutiny. The fault lies on the Labour Benches and with those hon. Members who could have brought the Bill forward for scrutiny. I rest my case, Sir Michael.</p>

My hon. Friend said that the remedy is inappropriate, but let us be clear that the remedy here is to send people a letter informing them that a copyright infringement has occurred. I hope that, in dealing with peer-to-peer file sharing, as this part of the Bill does, that measure-sending letters to people-on its own will lead to a substantial reduction in the incidence of the unlawful activity about which we are concerned. Many people have rightly spoken about the seriousness of the concern about the current level of unlawful activity under way.</p>

 I apologise for interrupting so early, but will the Minister make it clear to the House that the ambition to reduce the number of illegal file sharing activities will be met not though letter-writing alone, but by placing requirements on the industry to develop new models that make it easier for people to legally access their material at an affordable price?</p>

<p><a name="st_o536"><a name="10040767000127"><a name="100407-0028.htm_spnew16"><a name="10040767000237"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It is very important that the industry does that and develops an effective education campaign. In fact, I have seen some interesting proposals to do that, which I hope will go forward. However, we need legislation as well. The House needs to be clear that we cannot make headway on this issue unless we have legislation along the lines proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o649"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para11"><a name="10040767000128">Stepping back from the detail of the amendments, let me make a couple of points. Does anything really need to be done to address online copyright infringement? A subsidiary question might be: is legislation the right vehicle to do so? In a number of the speeches that we have heard, hon. Members have expressed misgivings about some aspects of the Bill. I am thinking, for example, of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt), who, in his speech on Second Reading yesterday, strongly supported the need to support the creative industries in the Bill. However, my sense is that there is a pretty broad acceptance across the House that we are talking about a serious matter, that it needs to be addressed and that legislation is appropriate for addressing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o650"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para12"><a name="10040767000129">There is certainly significant harm to our creative industries resulting from the current level of online copyright infringement. That harm is estimated in the impact assessment for the Bill at £400 million for music, film and TV. Others have come up with a larger figure for the content industries more widely. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East talked about the games industry, which is certainly affected by online copyright infringement. The figure that the International Chamber of Commerce estimated for the scale of the problem is £1 billion, or perhaps more, so we are talking about a serious problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) suggested that we are taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but it is not a nut; it is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o537"><a name="10040767000130"><a name="100407-0028.htm_spnew17"><a name="10040767000238"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 There is a real problem, but there is also a problem of proportionality and realism. I return to the question that I put to the Minister earlier, which is simply this. I object to the speed at which the Bill is being progressed, but leaving that aside for the moment, if the Bill was more focused on that £400 million, or whatever figure the Minister quoted for the loss to legitimate complainants whose copyright was being infringed, so that only those who were organised and engaged in such activity for commercial advantage were affected, those complainants would get the benefit of a piece of legislation that was directed at something that can actually be tackled. The problem is that we are trying to engage in a surveillance society-like attack on young people, who will not take any notice and in respect of whom there will be no reasonable way of enforcing the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o538"><a name="10040767000131"><a name="100407-0028.htm_spnew18"><a name="10040767000239"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman's characterisation of clause 4 is quite wrong. It is a very focused provision, dealing with the problem of unlawful downloading by means of peer-to-peer file sharing, which accounts for the lion's share of the problem, although that will no doubt change in future. Clause 4 is proportionate to the scale of the problem, and we have come up with an effective method to address it. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) suggested that the provision had been added at a late stage, but that is not the case. It has been in the Bill from when it was published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o651"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para13"><a name="10040767000132">There are strong feelings on the issue, but let me say this to the House. We have heard the strength of feeling against what is in the Bill, which many people have expressed. However, the House also needs to recognise both the strength of feeling on the other side of the debate-a feeling that we need to move, as we are in this Bill-and its importance, not only given the point of view of an economically significant part of UK activity, but in terms of the number of people affected. That is reflected, for example, in the campaign of the Creative Coalition Campaign, the trade unions representing workers in the film industry and others. In the end, the House has to take a view. There are different and opposing views being expressed, and we have to take a view about what is right.</p>

 On the practicalities of clause 4, proposed new section 124A(6)(d) of the Communications Act 2003 talks about collecting the IP address, which will be supplied to the internet service provider. How is that to be achieved?</p>

 When a copyright owner identifies that their copyright has been obtained by somebody without payment, they will notify the details to the ISP. The ISP will then send a letter to the customer who is responsible for that account. We are simply talking about letters being sent at that stage. I challenge anyone to suggest that sending such a letter would be a disproportionate response, given the scale of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o653"><a name="100407-0028.htm_para15"><a name="10040767000139">Turning to amendment 36, I think it appropriate that we should ask an internet access subscriber to be responsible for trying to ensure that their access is not used for unlawful purposes. That is what the current wording of the Bill does. Perfectly proper concerns have been expressed about children downloading material unlawfully. I remind the House that, under the clause, a letter would be sent to the person responsible for the internet access, to inform them that unlawful downloading had occurred. It would be a matter for them to ensure that their internet access was safeguarded. Sending a letter is entirely appropriate in such circumstances.</p>

measure to cases in which there was clear commercial gain. People who take what others have paid for without paying for it are doing something that is already illegal; that is clear in the law at the moment. To say that we should not send a letter to such people is quite wrong.</p>

 The amendment does not seek to do that. It seeks to oblige people to say whether they think the infringement is for financial gain or not. That would enable the industry to gather its own evidence on how deep the piracy runs and how much of it involves people sharing not for financial gain. This is important because, if the Bill is going to go through-and there is an insistence that it does-there will be an emerging debate in the industry about incorporating a fair use clause following copyright reform. I hope that the Government will accept that this is about helping the industry to get its figures right. It is not about targeting a particular group; it is about collecting evidence.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that reassurance, but I do not think that we need to amend the Bill to enable the industry to collect data in that way. He is perfectly right about the need for us to reform copyright. The Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property, who was with me on the Front Bench yesterday, intervened to point out that the Government are developing a copyright strategy, which is certainly needed in the light of online technological developments. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, however, that we ought not to give the impression that it is okay for someone to take something that they should have paid for without paying for it, so long as they are not doing it for commercial gain.</p>

 It really is kind of the Minister to give way. I support him in what he says about copyright. I have a real problem, however, as a result of a constituency case in which someone was accused of illegal downloading. We found out that the IP number-I have to say that I am a member of the Luddite society on this issue-was not unique, so the provider gave an IP number and the person who thought that copyright had been infringed wrote to a person who had nothing to do with the infringement. What worries me is that, because the IP number is not unique to one particular person, there is a chance of innocent people being accused.</p>

 The copyright owner can obtain the information by observing the fact that somebody has downloaded material that is their copyright, which can be done by using the same P2P methods that the downloaders use. From that information, it is clear which service provider has provided that connection. The copyright owner gives the information to the internet service provider, but he does not know who is breaching the copyright; he does not know anything other than a technical address. The internet service provider, however, knows who is responsible for the account, and it writes to the individual to inform them that a breach has occurred.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend. I wanted to draw his attention to his repeated use of the phrase that an infringement of copyright "had occurred". In fact, what the Bill says is somewhat different-that what is required is that the copyright owner produce information about an "apparent" breach of copyright. I am puzzled about the test that must be applied to demonstrate that a genuine breach has actually occurred as opposed to an apparent perception of the same on the part of the copyright owner. I spent 20 years in the media industry, so I know that demonstrating precise copyright ownership is not by any means as straightforward as might be assumed.</p>

We will come on later to the possibility of technical measures, which I hope we will never need to invoke because I hope that the letters alone will be sufficient to reduce the incidence of the problem.</p>

Many "digital natives" have huge amounts of dormant e-mail accounts. Indeed, if a Member of Parliament were suspected of copyright infringement in the next six weeks and had given his or her parliament.uk e-mail address to the ISP, it is highly likely that he or she would miss the e-mail.

 My hon. Friend has identified a further flaw in the clause that I had not. The importance of the postal address is that if clause 4(8)(d) goes through and the number of notifications is taken into account when it comes to technical measures, there is an incentive for people to appeal at the first notification, even if they know that it is their next-door neighbour who has stolen their bandwidth and downloaded something that infringes copyright. They may have put a security measure on, but this could still be taken into account if a further copyright infringement takes place, so my proposal seeks to provide clarity on that.</p>

If a Secretary of State were less charitable than the current incumbent-let us suppose that a successor was a lickspittle to a media oligarch who just gave instructions from his tax haven abroad-people could be cut off as a result of a single allegation of infringement by some hokey rights holder. The amendment seeks to remove or curtail the powers of the Secretary of State.</p>

 I just wish to strengthen that point. Does my hon.

The amendments that I have tabled are an expression of my legitimate concern that music lovers and internet users alike will not get justice if an allegation is made against them. This is not an attack on the music industry, and I hope that the tenor of his argument is along those lines; this is about trying to obtain a necessary settlement for people who have been accused of copyright infringement.</p>

 We are often concerned about why members of the public hold us in such low regard, but anybody observing our proceedings tonight will not be convinced that this House is doing its job of holding the Government to account. We have spent more than an hour discussing just one clause of a 50-clause Bill in the knowledge that we have less than an hour left to cover all the remaining clauses-that is hardly evidence that we are doing our job properly. It is frankly totally disgraceful that a Bill of this complexity has been given so little time for debate in this House.</p>

That is why so many of us are in such a difficult position. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) has already moved a number of really important probing amendments about various aspects of the legislation. We already know that this evening there will be no time to discuss, for instance, orphan works and the very legitimate concerns raised by photographers.

On Second Reading, I acknowledged that there was a serious problem in terms of providing support to our creative industries, which are losing hundreds of millions of pounds because of illegal activity on the internet. Action needs to be taken. That is why we have been willing to consider supporting the string of clauses-4 to 17-on illegal peer-to-peer file sharing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o672"><a name="100407-0029.htm_para18"><a name="1004088000050">We pointed out then that three additional conditions need to be put in place. The first was that we needed to have the super-affirmative resolution to ensure that the next Parliament could have proper scrutiny of any proposals to introduce technical measures, which we believe should be introduced only as a last resort based on clear evidence of the need for them. The super-affirmative resolution is what is proposed in amendments 16 and 17.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o673"><a name="100407-0029.htm_para19"><a name="1004088000051">We also said that we needed to resolve the serious problems faced by our universities, schools and wi-fi cafés to ensure that they will not fall foul of this legislation, given that they often have one IP address and a very large number of users. That is the case, for example, in this place. Many of us use the same IP address.</p>

 I fear that the hon. Gentleman ought to do his homework a little better. If he reads the amendment that we are debating, he will see that that is exactly what it does. It proposes a super-affirmative resolution in relation to clause 11, which is what I said a few moments ago.</p>

They go a long way, if not the whole way, towards addressing the concern about the need for a super-affirmative resolution. However, I believe it is crucial that we should have the maximum opportunity for scrutiny in the new Parliament. There should be an amendable resolution before that House before the severe technical measures are introduced. That is why I have tabled these amendments.</p>

 I want to say a few words about the concept of the super-affirmative resolution procedure, which I had never heard of before last week when I was having my photograph taken with six members of the Mongolian Revolutionary People's party-a sister party of the Labour party-and Lord Mandelson. That is not an event that happens every day, but it did happen last week. Lord Mandelson whispered "super-affirmative resolution" in my ear. I was not quite sure what he was referring to, but I realised I would have to explain it to my Mongolian friends later, so I looked it up. It certainly is not the answer to the democratic deficit in this Bill, which will give Ministers of whichever party forms the Government after the election extensive powers to lay orders that will basically translate the principles of the Bill, which are very bad principles for much of it, into legislation.</p>
<a name="1004088001524">
<p>Such orders will not be rushed through a legislative Committee of the House, as often happens with orders. Instead, there will be a 90-day consultation process in which a Committee-it is usually the Regulatory Reform Committee, but I do not know whether it would be another Committee at that stage-will take evidence. The Committee will also be able to propose amendments, but in the end the Government will be able to go through the normal procedures of getting an order through. Heavily whipped, the order will no doubt go through the House whichever Government is in power and on to the House of Lords. The idea that everyone in this House and outside who is concerned about the democratic deficit in the Bill can breathe a sigh of relief  <br>

because we now have a super-affirmative procedure promise is far from the truth.

None of the Front Benchers are saying clearly that they are taking a different course. They are whingeing at length about the process, but we are not hearing an alternative concept.

 Let me comment on the three amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) moved at the outset of the debate. On the first amendment, I can give him an assurance that technical measures will not be imposed until Ofcom has concluded its report. On the second amendment, we will certainly need to cover, in the code that the Bill requires to be drawn up, how the notifications will be sent out.

That is why clause 11 requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the assessment prepared by Ofcom as to whether technical measures should be imposed as well as to the reports prepared under clause 9. We have agreed that those documents should be published so that everyone can see the evidence that will inform the decision.</p>

 I have tabled some of the amendments in this group. Amendment 35 is really a reaction to the Bill's economic impact assessment which, frankly, was fairly hopeless. It did not look at the impact on libraries, hotels, internet cafes or any other institution that might have wi-fi. The problem is the lack of clarity about what constitutes a service provider, and the amendment would enable Ofcom to define special categories of service provider, such as libraries, universities and institutions, that provide open wi-fi networks.</p>

The aim is to provide some safeguards to ensure that such measures are proportionate. Obviously, we could take a technical measure to remove internet access from a parent because their child had been infringing, but that parent might sustain a small business in their home, employing a number of people. We should be removing those people from employment. There are many examples showing that the technical measures might be unfair and disproportionate to the infringement that had taken place. The amendments would provide protections in the Bill, so that Ofcom had an obligation to measure its proportionality and fairness.</p>

 I have been following the debate in great detail. In the very last debate of this Labour Government, some of my hon. Friends are telling my journalist colleagues and others that they do not have the right to protect that which they have created, and to have some modest share of the value they add to our economy, because that would represent problems for wi-fi providers, internet café owners or hotels. That is not something I am happy with, and that is why, in the last, dying hours of a Labour Government, I am doing something that may be difficult for colleagues, which is to support a Labour Government. I do so not from Labour loyalty, but because I profoundly believe that the explosion of the net-of information provision-which I welcome, must not deny those who add value to it their chance to have some share of that which they produce.</p>

 I agree that what we are doing on infringement must not undermine our efforts to ensure that there is good public access to broadband and to rich content.

I agree that there might well be a case for such institutions to be subject to a different threshold than other subscribers.

 We want to remove clause 18, the text of which was inserted in another place on a joint initiative of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. New clauses 1 and 2 contain amended provisions, and I hope I can persuade the Committee that our approach is the right way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o703"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para2"><a name="1004088000111">We have set out why we did not think that the clause 18, which was inserted by the other place, would work and our concerns about introducing such provisions in such a way and at such a time. We have also set out why we think the text in new clauses 1 and 2 would have the same benefits, but ensure proper consideration, including full consultation and proper safeguards. The key benefits of the amended approach are that, as a power to introduce regulations, which is what we are providing for, it is enforceable; it does not immediately fall foul of the technical standards directive, as the existing text would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o704"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para3"><a name="1004088000112">There will be proper opportunities to consult on the measure and for Parliament to consider it via the now famous super-affirmative procedure, with any recommendations having to be taken into account. The Secretary of State must consider the proportionality of the regulations and the evidence that they are necessary to deal with infringement that is having a serious adverse effect. We can also ensure that any security law enforcement concerns are properly taken on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o705"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para4"><a name="1004088000113">In addition, should such regulations be introduced, the court from which an order was being sought would need to consider carefully legitimate uses and users affected by any order, as well as have due regard to freedom of expression. We certainly do not want the clause to be used to restrict freedom of speech. We want to ensure that the safeguards are properly considered and that ISPs do not have an incentive to block sites purely on the basis of an allegation, for fear of bearing costs-although we also need to ensure that ISPs are not allowed to flout a decision of the court. Essentially, our view is that the costs should be borne, not by the ISPs, but by those seeking a court order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o706"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para5"><a name="1004088000114">The new clause we propose does the job of dealing with online infringement other than unlawful file sharing, which is dealt with by earlier parts of the Bill, but adds safeguards to ensure that the position of internet intermediaries and citizens are properly protected. On that basis, I commend the amendments.</p>

from illegal peer-to-peer file sharing, but the other third comes largely from persons downloading material from illegal websites, often hosted in Russia and that part of the world. Clearly, that is wrong and action is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o707"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para6"><a name="1004088000116">Having got rid of the all-embracing clause 17 in the original Bill, which gave the Secretary of State unfettered powers, my colleagues in another place thought it appropriate to table an amendment to deal with the problem of illegal websites. However, we did so in the certain knowledge at that time that we would not have got it all right and that it was likely to be the subject of extensive debate in this House. As I freely acknowledged last night and I repeat now, there is considerable concern in the community about that amendment; however, there is also widespread concern about the new clause now proposed, which has many faults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o708"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para7"><a name="1004088000117">First, the new clause penalises sites that facilitate access, or that are</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o709"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para8"><a name="1004088000118">That is too wide ranging and even puts sites such as Google at risk. Injunctions can be used against sites that are not only making such material available in the present, but that have done so in the past and that "are likely to". That is hardly a good basis for the principle of innocent till proved guilty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o710"><a name="100407-0031.htm_para9"><a name="1004088000119">There is not enough indication that the rights holders must take reasonable steps to notify the site owner before seeking an injunction. The proposed injunctions are indefinite, which is inappropriate, and the injunctions would, it appears, not cover all service providers. Infringing customers could therefore simply move from one provider to another, as the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt) said earlier. There are many faults in new clause 1. For the reasons that I have given, and because of the House's total lack of ability to scrutinise the proposals in detail, we will vote against amendment 2.</p>

 In my speech on the proposed reforms of House procedures, I referred to my disappointment that the Committee that sponsored those changes had not been asked to consider the role of MPs-and nor had it sought to be asked to do so. I then touched on my family experience-my grandfather was a Member in the 1930s-and my understanding of the traditionally understood role of an MP as defined by Edmund Burke, famously, if patronisingly, in his address to the electors of Bristol. I noted how far we had travelled from that model, and how little we had either consulted the public on those changes or discussed their broader impact. That is what I shall attempt to do this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o750"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para13"><a name="1004088000656">First, what are the understood functions of a Member? In Churchill's definition, published in the 1950s, the role was threefold, and in order of priority. I have edited it to remove the explicit sexism from his text. He said that the roles of a Member were: to exercise judgment in the interests of Great Britain; to act as a representative, but not a delegate, of his or her constituents; and to serve his or her party's interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o751"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para14"><a name="1004088000657">The Select Committee on Modernisation's report on the role of Back-Bench Members, published in 2007, set out the following functions. Unlike Churchill's, they are not in priority order. They were: supporting their party in votes in Parliament; representing and furthering the interests of their constituency; representing individual constituents and taking up their problems and grievances; scrutinising and holding the Government to account and monitoring, stimulating and challenging the Executive; initiating, reviewing and amending legislation; and contributing to the development of policy, whether in the Chamber, Committees or party structures, and promoting public understanding of party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o752"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para15"><a name="1004088000658">An MP serving between 1935 and 1950 said that,</p>
<a name="100407-0032.htm_brev0"><a name="1004088001543"><ul><p class="tabletext">"before 1939, unless there was some controversy afoot, I rarely received more than twenty letters a week...But after the election of 1945, everything was changed...suddenly the MP ceased to be a politician and potential statesman and became an official of the welfare state. Thousands wanted houses; old people wanted pensions; ex-service men wanted jobs; everybody wanted something and 'write to your MP' became a cliché".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o753"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para16"><a name="1004088000659">Patricia Hollis's excellent biography of Jennie Lee attributes her defeat in the 1970 election to infrequent visits, inattention to constituency business, and an unwillingness to attend constituency functions, which steadily undermined her vote in what appeared to be a relatively safe Labour constituency. The process of change in the expectations of MPs and in their performance was uneven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o754"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para17"><a name="1004088000660">Even in the early 1970s, one MP-I do not believe that he was from my party-could sketch his parliamentary activity thus:</p>
<a name="100407-0032.htm_brev1"><a name="1004088001544"><ul><p class="tabletext">"I hunt three days a week, always. Probably hunt four days a week. I don't get any letters anyhow. I only have a secretary part-time. I have one woman at home, who deals with Parliamentary letters on a Monday and that's it".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o755"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para18"><a name="1004088000661">That quote also puts into context any suggestion of some golden age of disinterested service among tribunes of the people. We often hear favourable comparisons of   <br>

<notus-date day="7" month="4" year="2010" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>7 Apr 2010 : Column 1147</b><br>
past times in Parliament with the performance of parliamentarians now, but I have always thought them to be fantasy. That sort of quotation bears out the fact that some of the what was going on at that time was pretty inactive in many senses and rather little aligned to the public good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o756"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para19"><a name="1004088000662">There have been a number of analyses of how a modern MP spends their time. A sample of the 2005 intake showed an average of 49 per cent. of MPs' time spent on constituency work, however that might be defined. In my own case, the proportion would certainly be greater than that. All recent analyses have shown constituency work to be by far the dominant part of the MP's job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o757"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para20"><a name="1004088000663">From the model set out by Churchill in the 1950s, going further back to my grandfather's time, as remembered by my father who recalls him as an MP at a time when the constituency workload was light and the quantity of correspondence was small, how has the change to the present situation come about? The first quotation that I gave hints at one reason-the burgeoning role of the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o758"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para21"><a name="1004088000664">As the state extends its reach, the role of an MP is the most obvious contact point with the state apparatus, so it gets extended, too. Setting aside the merits of extensive state provision, there have been some unhealthy aspects of the relationship between MPs' casework and state services. I cannot be alone in having heard citizens report to me that public servants have told them to contact their MPs if they have complaints. Having noted the higher quality response service offered to MPs-on tax credits and Child Support Agency cases, for example-constituents are motivated to use an MP rather than the official complaints process, which must be extremely hard. MPs have almost assumed the role of self-interested-I shall come back to this-quality control in some services, removing the incentive to get services right first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o759"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para22"><a name="1004088000665">The fall of Jennie Lee and the experience of Members in all but the safest seats hints at another reason for the change. Assiduous constituency service appears to be rewarded at the ballot box. With modern office systems, casework also provides databases of contact for future reference-potential building blocks of additional support in votes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o760"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para23"><a name="1004088000666">A third reason is the combination of modern technology and the use of constituency mail by campaigning groups. Postcards and e-mails urging MPs to sign early-day motions, write to Ministers and take other actions now proliferate, built on the knowledge-again taken from surveys-that MPs look hardest at material sent to them by constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o761"><a name="100407-0032.htm_para24"><a name="1004088000667">What have been the consequences of these changes? I have mentioned one already-the design of some state provision around the assumption of an MP advocacy role. We have MP helplines and MP correspondence units, specifically to deal with the assumed level of complaints that MPs will have to handle from their constituents.</p>

Concerns about planning, housing, education and many other services offered by local councils really lie within the responsibility of a councillor. Many electors, however, feel that contacting  <br>

an MP-"going to the top", as has been said to me on many occasions-is more effective and that if I should pass a matter to a councillor, I am "passing the buck" on the complaint that has been raised. I see you nodding, Madam Deputy Speaker, as I say this, and I would be surprised if most constituency MPs had not had similar experiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o763"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para1"><a name="1004088000669">In addition, local political competition may dissuade MPs from passing casework to a councillor from an opposing party. As I have said, simply building on the database of contacts one has from electors on whatever subject provides a strong incentive to pursue a complaint, whether it is relevant to the responsibilities of an MP or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o764"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para2"><a name="1004088000670">We may also find that Members of Parliament are ill equipped for such purposes. I am not a lawyer, yet I regularly receive queries in regard to which some legal knowledge is at least desirable. I am not a financial adviser, yet I have often received queries about pensions. I am not a benefits specialist, yet I frequently receive queries about benefit entitlement. If the compass of an MP's role is so wide, MPs need appropriate resources in order to address at least the common concerns. Given the scale of their casework-in a typical year, I deal with well over 2,000 new cases-offering a quality service is a challenge. I emphasise the word "quality", because I am not talking about a simple acknowledgement or routine correspondence. Adding genuine value by saying something of substance is quite difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o765"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para3"><a name="1004088000671">It seems certain that the increase in constituency work, willingly undertaken by Members, will compress the attention given to their other functions. Critical parts of the role of the House of Commons are already poorly fulfilled. For instance, the scrutiny of huge volumes of European legislation is manfully tackled by a very small resource. It is arguable that the House transferred detailed scrutiny of legislation to the House of Lords far too readily, and the Finance Bill-with which I have dealt in the House on several occasions-suffers particularly when that cover from the Lords is unavailable. While Select Committee work remains a largely quality process of scrutiny and policy contribution, much of Question Time on the Floor of the House is a formulaic mix of partisan work and constituency name-checking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o766"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para4"><a name="1004088000672">I have always regarded constituency work as both a good in itself, providing a service that is clearly demanded, and a resource. There is not a complete division between a Member's constituency role and his or her parliamentary work. I regularly say that if I do not learn something new through my constituency correspondence almost every day, I cannot be doing my job. The sheer variety of subjects raised forces one to learn., and it often prompts parliamentary activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o767"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para5"><a name="1004088000673">I have also always regarded correspondence that I receive as personal. If someone takes the trouble to write to me, at the very least I should look at the letter and give some direction on the response, if I cannot reply myself. Until recently, I replied to most letters personally, and that personal link remains an important anchor in the job, connecting Members to local realities and broadening their knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o768"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para6"><a name="1004088000674">You will sense, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I am not suggesting that the shift in emphasis is wrong. It serves a need, and it delivers a wider value. However, it has taken place silently, gradually and patchily, without strategy and without any genuine engagement with  <br>

citizens on what they want from MPs. Results of surveys suggest that about half of them believe that MPs should represent the views of local people, but do they mean that in the sense in which Burke tried to define the relationship? I rather think not. And how is it possible to determine what those views really are? They are, of course, diverse, and it is difficult to weigh them against each other in terms of volume and quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o769"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para7"><a name="1004088000675">Nearly the same proportion of citizens suggest that an MP should represent a national interest. Setting aside how that might be defined, we must ask whether there is a conflict between the two goals, the serving of local interests and local concerns and the national interest. In some circumstances, there is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o770"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para8"><a name="1004088000676">I hope that when the House reassembles after the election, it will seek to establish the purposes of an MP through a process of public engagement. Once we have that foundation, we can better define the resources that are required, the procedures and business balance of this place, the skills that are desirable, the relationship with the other parts of our country's governance, and even, I have to say-because it forms part of the programme of one party at the election-the broad number of MPs that there should be. To cut the number without any intellectual apparatus relating to justification of the role of an MP is frankly lazy and facile.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing this debate, which will be one of the last of this Parliament. It will be the last time that we three shall stand here together, Madam Deputy Speaker. Like you and I, my hon. Friend came into this place in 1997, and in the next few days we shall all leave it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o771"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para9"><a name="1004088000678">My hon. Friend has been a committed and assiduous Member of Parliament since his arrival here 13 years ago. I know, from many long nights in this place talking to him, how passionately hard he has worked for his constituents. During his time here he has held a number of posts, including Parliamentary Private Secretary to Baroness Symons when she was Deputy Leader of the Lords and when she was in the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry. He has also served on a number of Select Committees and is currently a member of the Treasury Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o772"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para10"><a name="1004088000679">Tonight my hon. Friend has spoken thoughtfully, knowledgeably and, occasionally, amusingly about the changing role of a Member of Parliament in the 21st century. As he so rightly emphasised, this is a growing role and one that is increasingly scrutinised by organisations such as TheyWorkForYou.com, which is mainly based on the internet. They scrutinise aspects of the role that not everyone would consider to be as important as they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o773"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para11"><a name="1004088000680">I agree with my hon. Friend that establishing the purposes of an MP and then deciding the resources, procedure and business balance would be enormously helpful. I well remember my first few days in this place and how overwhelming the role suddenly seemed. As he said, the role broadly has three different responsibilities:  <br>

holding the Executive to account through membership of Select Committees and through questions; participating in deliberation on legislation; and representing constituents in Parliament. As he so rightly emphasised, the latter has become far and away the larger part of one's job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o774"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para12"><a name="1004088000681">Hon. Members will know that my husband is a writer. He has recently been writing about Members of Parliament in the 1920s and has been constantly interrupting my work and his to tell me how little they did. He described how many books they managed to read, how much hunting they managed to do and how much time they managed to spend with their families. Things have changed from the days when Members of Parliament would visit their constituencies only once a year and be greeted at the station with flags and celebrations by their constituents. Members now live in their constituencies; most of us spend the majority of our week and of our summer in them. We live in our constituencies because we want to know those constituencies so that we can better represent them. That is a good development, but it also means that the balance of our work here has changed. I passionately believe that the work of a Member of Parliament is extremely important and that before we make decisions about the number of people we have in this place and the way we work, we need to discuss it in a way that we have so far failed to do. The Government have taken the role of the Member of Parliament seriously and the Modernisation Committee has considered some aspects of it, but it has never held an investigation into that specific subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o775"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para13"><a name="1004088000682">The work of Members of Parliament has been the subject of much public attention during the past year. That can only increase in the run-up to the general election. One of the things that the Modernisation Committee has done-it did it when I was a member-has been to engage the public more in the work of the House. The launch of the new website last year improved public accessibility to information about the functions of MPs and Parliament. As my hon. Friend rightly said, those functions are not clear and not everyone does the same thing, so there is no real yardstick against which people can measure the work of their Member of Parliament compared with that of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o776"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para14"><a name="1004088000683">The Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons' recent report recommended ways in which Parliament could better interact with the public. The Government accepted these recommendations and are committed to engaging the public in the work of Parliament. On 22 February, the House agreed that consideration should be given to a new system whereby petitions from the public could trigger a debate in the House. The House also agreed that during the next Parliament there would be a trial of debates on petitions in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o777"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para15"><a name="1004088000684">Members play the crucial role of holding Ministers to account over their proposals to amend or make law. The close and detailed scrutiny of Bills and delegated legislation is invaluable. As my hon. Friend rightly said, the volume of this legislation-in particular the legislation coming in from Europe-needs to be considered. We do not need to be overwhelmed by it, but we must ensure that we have both the time and the resources to cope with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o778"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para16"><a name="1004088000685">The introduction of pre-legislative scrutiny has also added to work loads. However, it has made a lot of legislation a great deal better and I welcome it. I welcome  <br>

the fact that four out of five draft Bills that received pre-legislative scrutiny in the 2008-09 Session were introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o779"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para17"><a name="1004088000686">There are also private Members' Bills, which in some cases allow Members to bring their own policies into law. I know that my hon. Friend has had success with his own private Member's Bill, which became the Co-operatives and Community Benefit Societies Act 2003. That Act has protected charities, housing associations and clubs from asset strippers and it is something of which both this House and he should be proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o780"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para18"><a name="1004088000687">Members of Parliament are also responsible for holding the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to account. That is done daily through written and oral parliamentary questions. As a Minister, I know how important they are in my work load and how much time and thought go into their setting and their answering. The same is true of the departmental Select Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o781"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para19"><a name="1004088000688">Over the past 13 years, the increasing work load and increasing number of subjects to be discussed has led to the establishment of Westminster Hall as a parallel Chamber.

Regional Select Committees has certainly added to the Government's accountability across the United Kingdom and brought the regions, Whitehall and Westminster closer together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o782"><a name="100407-0033.htm_para20"><a name="1004088000689">Given all that has been said tonight, the theory and practice of the role of Members of Parliament has grown. In the past 13 years, my hon. Friend has been exemplary in his service to the House and to his constituents. I know that, as we leave this House, many of us are thinking of ways it could have been made better in those 13 years. I personally regret that we did not manage to address the hours of the House sufficiently to make it an attractive place for younger people with families and other commitments. I hope that that will be considered in future, alongside the role of MPs, because in order to do his or her job well, an MP must, by necessity, have a well-rounded family and personal life.</p>
