<p><a name="qn_o0">1. <a name="60213-01_wqn0"><b> Martin Linton  (Battersea)</b> 
 (Lab): What his most recent estimate is of the annual cost to public funds of a stand-alone identity card. [50390]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60213-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Clarke): </b> 
 Our estimate of the average annual operating costs of issuing passports and ID cards to British citizens was published last year and at present is unchanged at &#163;584&nbsp;million. As is the case with passports, those costs will be met in the main by fees rather than by a call on public funds. I have said that within our current estimates it will be affordable to set a charge of &#163;30&nbsp;for a stand-alone identity card issued to British citizens.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60213-01_spnew0"><b> Martin Linton: </b> 
 If the cost is &#163;30&nbsp;for 10&nbsp;years&#151;in other words, &#163;3&nbsp;per person per year&#151;and the benefits, according to figures agreed by the Home Office and the banks, are more than &#163;20&nbsp;per person per year, can my right hon. Friend see any rational reason why the House of Lords would have voted against the proposal on cost and benefit grounds?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60213-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I always hesitate to ascribe rationality to the House of Lords in its decisions, but it is legitimate to address the costs issues, as Members of both Houses have concerns about them. We have worked them through carefully. My hon. Friend is right to say that for a stand-alone card &#163;3&nbsp;a year is the figure that we have in mind, and the benefits of the reform would be massive for the whole country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60213-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold)</b> 
 (Con): For the 38&nbsp;million people who are likely to have to register for an ID card&#151;those over 16&nbsp;and those who have been here for more than three months&#151;can the Home Secretary tell us what the cost will be of the combined passport and ID card? If the estimate of &#163;5&nbsp;billion over 10&nbsp;years is correct, it is on my calculation likely to be in excess of &#163;120.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60213-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is wrong. As I have indicated before, the average annual cost of passports 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1118</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and ID cards is unchanged at about &#163;584&nbsp;million a year. We estimate that the cost per joint passport and card would be some &#163;93. The fees have not yet been set: they can be set only if the legislation is passed by a vote of Parliament on the precise fee regime, but &#163;93&nbsp;is our combined estimate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60213-01_spnew4"><b> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West)</b> 
 (Lab): Can we define the difference between Bill Gates&#039;s suggestion for the near future and what the Government suggest? Bill Gates&#039;s suggestion is for a link between the biometric information and one single card, which is a relatively simple matter. However, the Government suggest that there should be a differentiation between the information on one biometric identifier and many millions of others. The process that has been suggested by the Government is many millions of times more complicated and more expensive than what Bill Gates suggests. Can my right hon. Friend give us some information on that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60213-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an interesting comparison. I have not studied Bill Gates&#039;s proposal in detail, but I understand that he argues that the national identity register, which we are introducing, with its 13&nbsp;biometric identifiers, would give the assurance that at some point in the future the biometric identifier itself, rather than the card, could provide the identity security that is required. Obviously, my hon. Friend is right to say that it would be simpler if we had one identity system for the whole country for every time that identity needs to be checked, but many arguments have been made in this House and elsewhere about the disadvantages of having one database for everything. Instead, we have one narrow database that enables everybody to secure their own identity, which we think is a major step forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60213-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b> 
 (Con): The Home Secretary has told us that his estimate is &#163;584&nbsp;million per year, which is a lot of money. However, some hon. Members will be a little sceptical of Government estimates, because in the past they have been woefully out. Would the Home Secretary stake any money on the &#163;584&nbsp;million being reasonably accurate, or does he think that the figure might go up?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60213-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Actually, I think that it is accurate and likely to go down, rather than up. The nearest major IT project in the area was for the passports agency, which was widely criticised five or six years ago. Its IT programme now handles some 40&nbsp;million to 44&nbsp;million database files and had the most efficient public service in the country, beating major private sector providers from the consumer point of view, such as Amazon, eBay and Virgin, as the result of a major effective public sector IT investment, changing the quality of life for everyone.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60213-01_spnew8"><b> Lynne Jones  (Birmingham, Selly Oak)</b> 
 (Lab): According to parliamentary answers I have received, the cost of operating and maintaining the verification services is not included in the &#163;93&nbsp;charge to applicants. What is the Government&#039;s estimate of that particular cost? How much will be met by the public sector, how much is to be met by charges and what are my right hon. Friend&#039;s assumptions about the number of people who 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1119</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will want to use the verification services and the charge that they will be asked to bear? I understand that when potential users were offered a charge of 57p, not many were keen.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60213-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I have just published overall figures for verification and all the other services, but three sources of income will deal with the charges. The first is the fees themselves, which is why I said that fees would make up the giant&#039;s share, rather than a call on public funds. The second is a small contribution from public funds, which is the only amount that could be spent on other things&#151;as is widely alleged&#151;and the third is income that could be derived from contracts with organisations that use the database. Those are important factors, which is why I was able to tell the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) a moment ago that I think the figure will end up being less than &#163;584&nbsp;million, although I think that is a firm and strong estimate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60213-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b> 
 (LD): Why does not the Home Secretary demonstrate the courage of his convictions by allowing the Lords amendments on costs to stand? Surely, if his scheme is costed and affordable he should have no problem in demonstrating that before bringing it to the House for implementation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60213-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 We have no problem in demonstrating that and have done so, but the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) is of a rather more profound nature. It states that there should be a regular report to the House setting out the full cost situation so that the House can debate and consider it as it wishes. That is a rather superior way of doing what the House of Lords was edging towards. The amendment also reflects concerns expressed, fairly, on both sides of the House about whether the cost system is under control. A system of six-monthly reports is a good way of dealing with that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60213-01_spnew12"><b> David Davis  (Haltemprice and Howden)</b> 
 (Con): The Liberal Democrat spokesman made a good point: few people really believe the Home Office numbers and the House of Lords is trying to find a way of establishing a reliable figure. Let us take things out of arcana such as the billions and House of Commons procedure. If the Home Secretary was trying to pay for a capital project, such as a house extension, and the contractor came to him and said, &quot;I know I&#039;ve overrun before on money and time. I&#039;m not going to give an estimate because that upsets my subcontractors, but I&#039;ll let you know every six months how much I&#039;ve overrun&quot;, would the right hon. Gentleman accept that contract? The answer of course is no, so why should the House of Commons accept that from him?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60213-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I must say that I think that the right hon. Gentleman has put it completely the wrong way round. If I indeed wanted work done on my house, as he suggests, I should first make a clear estimate of what I was ready to spend and on what; secondly, I would not tell the bidders how much money was available for them and, thirdly, I would establish a contract to be tendered for on a competitive basis. That is precisely the right way to give us value for money.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60213-01_spnew14"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 Let us test the process against some real figures. The right hon. Gentleman cited the passport agency, which nobody in their right mind would hold up as a serious project, so let us try some others. In the green book, his right hon. Friend the Chancellor pointed out that 54&nbsp;per cent. of Government IT projects fail. Since 2001, four major projects in four Departments have gone seriously wrong; their collective budget was about &#163;9&nbsp;billion and they overran by &#163;33.9&nbsp;billion&#151;nearly &#163;34&nbsp;billion. Can the Home Secretary name one IT project costing more than &#163;1&nbsp;billion that was on time and on cost and delivered what it was supposed to?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60213-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the passport agency, which has done precisely that. It is a ridiculous state of affairs for the right hon. Gentleman to assert that no Government can ever organise an IT project in the interests of the country. I am perfectly well aware that there are major issues in both the public and private sectors about major IT projects. As somebody originally from the private sector, the right hon. Gentleman will know that that is the case and he is right to say, in terms of his first question, that we should have a proper contractually based tendering process, which is precisely what we have.

<p><a name="qn_o1">2. <a name="60213-02_wqn0"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b> 
 (Lab): Whether his Department is planning to amend the law on international arrest warrants. [50391]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60213-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham): </b> 
 The Government are currently considering a range of issues relating to the issuing of arrest warrants in international cases, but have not yet concluded what changes, if any, are required to current legislation. Any proposals for amending the current legislation would be a matter for Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60213-02_spnew0"><b> Dr. Starkey: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware of press reports that the Government are considering removing the right of an individual victim to apply to the magistrates court for an arrest warrant against the alleged perpetrator of war crimes. If that right were removed, does he agree that it would leave it open for the UK Government to decide not to proceed against certain alleged war criminals simply because to do so might embarrass a foreign Government? Does he agree that that does not square with the Government&#039;s duty, under the Geneva convention, of universal jurisdiction?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60213-02_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Let me begin by assuring my hon. Friend that the Government stand firm behind the principle of the international arrest warrant system and are clear that the UK will never provide safe haven to those guilty of atrocities, but she refers to the process by which international arrest warrants are secured. They can be applied for and granted to private individuals by a district judge, the effect of which is that someone can be arrested and detained with no immediate prospect of any charge being brought. The balance must be right, and the question is whether the prosecuting authority that is required to bring the case should have a role in whether the person is arrested, but I have heard what my 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1121</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Friend has said, as has the Home Secretary, and we will, of course, take her views on board in taking the matter forward.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60213-02_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The Home Office has had discussions with the Israeli authorities, following the case that the hon. Gentleman mentions, and has held discussions with a range of parties who have had an interest in that case. As I mentioned in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), the issue is whether there is an inconsistency and whether the authorities that would be responsible for bringing a prosecution should have a role in the arrest. It is important to point out that we may be talking about individuals who are not normally resident in the UK and are not under investigation by the British police, and there could be very real practical difficulties in bringing evidence to this country about whether a prosecution should happen here. My point is simply about whether it is right that the prosecuting authorities have a role in deciding whether an arrest should take place in the first place, given that that would deprive an individual of their liberty for a serious amount of time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60213-02_spnew4"><b> Emily Thornberry  (Islington, South and Finsbury)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that, if someone from another country comes here and it is found through the great good sense of a district judge that the person may be guilty of war crimes, it is our duty as a nation to prosecute them properly and that, in considering whether the law should be changed, we should weigh in the balance very heavily the great good sense and experience of district judges?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60213-02_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I can say to my hon. Friend that of course the Government remain absolutely committed to the principle that those guilty of atrocities should not find a safe haven in this country. I would also say to her, though, that the duty to prosecute those accused of atrocities falls quite rightly to the public authorities of this country. In hearing what she says and in agreeing with her that the onus needs to be on ensuring that those responsible face up to their actions, we need to consider whether the public authorities that would be responsible for mounting any prosecution should have a role in deciding whether that person should be arrested at the beginning of the process.

We have been working with experts on the financial detail of those business cases to assess the costs of merger.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60213-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 Given that Northumbria council tax payers currently have a police force that meets Government criteria in both size and performance, what indication can the right hon.

What figure does she suggest?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60213-02_spnew7"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 First, as the right hon. Gentleman will recognise, the protective services assessment from Her Majesty&#039;s inspector of constabulary says that the one viable option to go forward is a regional strategic force. I also emphasise that the Northumbria police force&#039;s case said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;There are clear operational benefits of moving to a regional strategic force in particular in relation to the ability to invest in level 2&nbsp;protective services.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_o0">Although the right hon.

We have a working group that is looking at start-up and precept costs, as well as ongoing costs, and we are looking at a number of different models, but this is about not simply having a larger force, but being able to release resources to invest in better policing for the people in the right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong when he asserts that we do not have regard to the costs.

 The Government did not undertake consultation specifically with ethnic minority communities on the provisions in the Terrorism Bill partly because the timetable for bringing the legislation forward was accelerated in the wake of the July bombs and partly because the Bill goes to the entire community rather than specific communities.

 I thank the Minister for that reply and praise the Government for making immense efforts to talk to ethnic minority communities and to build up an excellent dialogue with them.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words. The point that he raises is entirely fair. There has been some concern expressed among some non-Muslim ethnic minority communities that perhaps attention has been focused too much on the Muslim community. However, we do not accept that. Clearly we have done much with the Muslim community, but if we have to do more with other communities, we will. My hon. Friend will know that we regularly meet the Hindu Council, the Hindu Forum of Britain, the National Council of Hindu Temples and the Swaminarayan temple at Neasden to discuss matters of terrorism and other matters not least, as he will know, in terms of immigration rules and ministers of religion.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="60213-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I totally agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s opening statement, as, I am sure, does the whole House. Everyone will know, not least because of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the disparity between the last two sets of demonstrations, that in any community, frankly, it is the extremists who do down the moderates far more than anyone else. The hon. Gentleman said it was suggested that we should consider, in extremis, closing down specific facilities.

 The most comprehensive national assessment was published in the Office for National Statistics survey of mental ill health in the prison population in England and Wales in 1997.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="60213-04_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 We have two main approaches. We work through mental health in-reach teams in prisons, which work with community teams on a care plan. On an offender&#039;s release, they work together to pass that individual into the care of a community mental health team in a negotiated transfer. That did not happen before.

<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60213-04_spnew5"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 In terms of responsibilities for former servicemen, the hon. Lady&#039;s question is probably best directed to the Ministry of Defence. I will ensure that my colleagues in that Department are made aware of it. Offending as a result of people&#039;s previous experiences is a critical consideration in everything that we are trying to do to reduce reoffending. She will have seen in the reducing reoffending action plan, which we published last week, that one of our ambitions is to bear down on all the features, including mental ill health, that lead to reoffending, and to have a much more comprehensive programme to achieve that.

 My hon. Friend is right; that is a substantial challenge. There has been an increase in the number of transfers in recent years. In 2003, 721&nbsp;prisoners were transferred.

 My hon. Friend is correct, except perhaps in the rugby team that he supports. It is critical to deal with so-called abstractions from neighbourhood police teams, whether for operations, as he describes, or for some training functions, and one reason why we are reorganising the strategic level of policing is to strengthen neighbourhood policing.

When the scheme was introduced, we were assured that that would not happen, but certainly in the Metropolitan police area it is happening.

However, to fulfil the Bill&#039;s detailed requirements, the Department would need to develop new financial and management information systems that are capable of producing data, disaggregated to the level of detail that the measure requires.

It would ensure accountability for more than just 44.2&nbsp;per cent. of bilateral aid spending and would include countries such as Mozambique and Kenya&#151;which are currently excluded&#151;as recent allegations demonstrate the necessity for increased accountability and transparency. Such an amendment may involve a corresponding increase in costs, which may or may not be covered by the resolution.

<a name="stpa_14">I hope and trust that the resolution will authorise general expenditure resulting from the Bill, probably covering issues that I and others have raised, such as independent monitoring and assessment criteria relating to the millennium development goals.

<a name="60213-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_15">While I understand the generic nature of the money resolution, the Minister said that he had an idea of the maximum charge that must not be extended. Can he also tell us whether he expects the estimate for future financial years to be the same as the first-year estimates? Are the costs front-loaded, or will they increase over time as the aid budget grows exponentially towards 0.7&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product? The Minister spoke of plans for expenditure covering only three years. Why should that be the case, given that the 0.7&nbsp;per cent. will not be reached until 2013, seven years from now? Can the Minister assure us that the cost of the Bill will be financed by the reduction in leakage that its implementation will facilitate, and will not have a negative impact on poverty alleviation?

I trust that the Minister will confirm that there are no circumstances in which such an eventuality would arise.

 This motion illustrates all too well the weaknesses of the money resolution process, as both the Minister and my hon.

<a name="stpa_20">If that is not a blank cheque, I do not know what is. Because we normally know from a given Bill&#039;s Second Reading its parameters and detailed provisions, we can make a rough estimate of such expenditure; indeed, I seem to recall that on certain very rare occasions, Ministers have been kind enough to give the House some idea of the expenditure involved. However, this is a different case altogether.

We are in the absurd position of being asked by the Government to approve a money resolution for a Bill that we know will be amended, both in Committee and on Report, by Ministers and, I hope, by other Members of the House when we are given an opportunity to do so. How can we possibly, on behalf of our taxpayers, sign up to the incurring of &quot;any expenditure&quot; by the Secretary of State in respect of a Bill whose provisions we know will be radically altered by both the Government and the House at large?

Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) are being tabled as we speak. I recognise that Members like to have early sight of Government amendments; nevertheless, all will want the Government to take time to get them right.

<a name="stpa_25">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked about the distribution of expenditure and whether some will be front-loaded. Some investment in new systems will indeed be required, so some front-loading will be necessary. He also asked why a three-year period is specified, given that it will take seven years to reach the 0.7&nbsp;per cent. target. The three-year period relates to the comprehensive spending review period. We will not necessarily be able to speed up progress toward the 0.7&nbsp;per cent. target; it would take the international finance facility to do that. If the hon.

 The Government have decided not to seek to reverse Lords amendments Nos. 19&nbsp;and 20, which removed clauses 6&nbsp;and 7&nbsp;on the procedure for introducing compulsory registration. The clauses dealt with the requirement to register and be issued with an identity card in the second stage of the identity card scheme and for compulsion to be brought into effect by way of secondary legislation made under this Bill and subject to the super-affirmative procedure. We agree that those provisions should be dropped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-09_para5">

<p>
<a name="60213-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_34">We decided from the beginning that there is substance to the Committee&#039;s point: it is a sufficiently important step from the first stage to the second stage and compulsion to require a vote in both Houses. In the early stages, we decided that the super-affirmative procedure should apply, but many&#151;not least the House of Lords&#151;disagreed, and that is the territory covered by the amendments.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60213-09_spnew2"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 The Minister knows that my colleagues and I oppose compulsory identity cards. Is it now the Government&#039;s view that a voluntary scheme would be acceptable and justified if there was no later agreement for a compulsory scheme? Is it still the Government&#039;s view that a scheme with a card that people do not have to carry will ever work?
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60213-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 On the first point, no. We have made it clear from the beginning that the ultimate aim for the programme was compulsory registration. The answer to his second question is also no.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 My intervention might be a little premature, because the Minister has hardly had the chance to get to the end of the first paragraph of his remarks. I am grateful to the Government for not seeking to reverse the Lords amendments on the deletion of clauses 6&nbsp;and 7, but I need to be sure of the limit to their agreement. The Government accept that primary legislation will be required to introduce compulsion, but there will be compulsion through the back door under clauses 4&nbsp;and 5&nbsp;and designated documents. Can the Minister state explicitly that it will still be a compulsory requirement to provide information to the national identity register in relation to designated documents&#151;a concept that has so far been undefined, save in relation to passports and immigration or travel documents?

 I can certainly give the hon. and learned Gentleman that explicit assurance, but it would tempt the House&#039;s patience if I travelled too far down the road he suggests, as it forms the substance of the next group of amendments.

 I have two questions.

Secondly, will my hon. Friend comment on suggestions in the press at the weekend that motorists will need an ID card when they reapply for their driving licence?
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60213-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Sunday press always affects Ministers&#039; blood pressure, but I have never read such an absurd and inaccurate story as the one about driving licences. When I was part of the Department for Transport, we made it clear long before, and during, proceedings on the Road Safety Bill&#151;which I thoroughly enjoyed&#151;that all paper licences, which are the most inappropriate and insecure form of such an important document, would need to be replaced by small plastic photocard licences. I can say without fear of contradiction that that is entirely separate from&#151;indeed, nothing to do with&#151;what we want to do in the ID cards programme.

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60213-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 No, with respect to the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend&#039;s comments related to a fatuous piece in one of the Sunday papers, which referred to a clause in the Road Safety Bill about the recall of paper licences and the issue of more secure and substantial licences. We have made it clear that we shall look only at passports and immigration documents in the implementation of the first phase of ID cards. We have never excluded from subsequent consideration documents such as driving licences, but the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point relates neither to the story to which my hon. Friend referred nor to reality.
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60213-10_spnew1"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 My question is germane to both this and the next group of amendments. International obligations for biometric tests in the reading of passports will be imposed on Britain, but does the Minister accept that it would be entirely possible for us to comply with those obligations without requiring additional information to be held on a passport or other document? Our international obligations are thus not a reason for the Government&#039;s policy on identity cards.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60213-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I accept that, but I would qualify it in part by saying that that is the initial position and the start of a trend in international obligations. In strict terms, on whether we are going beyond the minimum standards that are required at this stage and that are likely to be needed in the very near future, the hon. Gentleman is entirely right, but why should we go for something substandard or second rate, or that is likely to be second rate within five or 10&nbsp;years? In essence, he is, of course, entirely right.

 Will the Minister enlighten the House about whether he has discussed these clauses and amendments with the Information Commissioner, who pretty well condemned the procedures that were outlined on Second Reading, as I stated at the time? Will he explain why the reference to &quot;compulsory registration&quot; has not been removed from clause 9?
</p>





<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60213-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those questions, which lead me neatly into the second paragraph of my opening speech, in which I want to go into the substance of the choreography or jigsaw, which also refers to the point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). It is very 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1148</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clear from the debate in the other place that their lordships would prefer us to go down the primary legislation route, rather than the super-affirmative route. That is what they seek to achieve in the amendments that they have offered to the House. The removal of clauses 6&nbsp;and 7&nbsp;goes part way to achieving that, but to go all the way to achieving that we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include our proposal in lieu of Lords amendment No. 21.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_38">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) is entirely right: what their lordships chose not to do and what we are not doing in response to them is to eradicate every element or reference to compulsion in the Bill. In essence, all the building blocks for compulsion in the Bill remain. He will know from the debate on Second Reading and the other Commons stages that a number of elements in the Bill refer to the compulsion stage, rather than to the run up to that stage. Given the wording of our proposal in lieu of the Lords amendment, none of the buildings blocks for compulsion that remain can be enacted until the subsequent primary legislation has been passed. That more neatly achieves precisely what their lordships required in respect of the balance between super-affirmative and primary legislation, as is shown in the reports of their debates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_39">An order under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, however, will not be an Act of Parliament, so the hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_39"><a name="60213-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 The Minister refers to building blocks in respect of the inner parts of the Bill. He might recall that, in addressing my remarks to the Home Secretary on Second Reading, I demonstrated the relationship between the Bill, what the Information Commissioner had to say and what I thought George Orwell would have made of the provisions on the building blocks of compulsion. I do not see any change in substance or principle. Does the Minister accept that the building blocks are those of George Orwell&#039;s Ministry of Truth?
</p>





<p><a name="st_40"><a name="60213-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I certainly do not accept the latter point, although George Orwell&#151;also known as Mr. Blair&#151;is one of my favourite authors, so I am with the hon. Gentleman at that level. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Eric Blair, I think hon. Members will find. However, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s general point that the key elements of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondary phase&#151;that is, compulsion&#151;remain in the Bill is entirely fair. The point that he makes within the confines of the debate and these Lords amendments is entirely right: none of them goes to the substance or principle of voluntary, compulsory or any other form of ID card scheme. The debate is only on the narrow ground of whether there should be a super-affirmative procedure in both Houses or primary legislation. I think that everyone at both ends of this place accepts the premise that the step-up to compulsion is of sufficient seriousness to demand a vote in both Houses. We are discussing the technique and process rather than the substance.

 I was not a member of the Committee, so I ask this question for genuine clarification. What is wrong with the scheme is the register, because if we had biometrics and voluntary identity cards, it would be acceptable. If we accept the Government amendment, will some people still be compelled to be on the register because they have applied for a passport?
</p>





<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60213-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I say in all candour that the answer is yes. Nothing in the provisions would change the way in which the first part of the process would unfold regarding its implementation for passports.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60213-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow) (Lab):</b> 
 Will the Minister clarify a matter&#151;we need to get this absolutely straight&#151;about clause 15, which will allow public services to be conditional on identity checks? The measure would apply if an individual was subject to compulsory registration. If the Government amendment is accepted, will that measure not come into effect until after the subsequent primary legislation has been passed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60213-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I can give my hon. Friend an absolute assurance about that. The measure is one of the building blocks in the Bill to which the hon. Member for Stone referred. I assure my hon. Friend that it will not be switched on or enacted until the second piece of primary legislation has been passed to bring in compulsion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_57">We said several times that although the super-affirmative procedure applies to the new procedure, before a move to compulsion takes place we and the House will want to be satisfied that implementation of the initial phase of the identity card scheme has achieved significant coverage of the population so that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1151</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>compulsion would have an impact on only the relatively small number of people who had yet to register for and obtain an identity card. We would also want to be satisfied that there continued to be clear support for identity cards, that no vulnerable group would be disadvantaged, that the scheme had contributed to meeting the aims outlined in clause 1, and that the technology supporting the identity card scheme was working and trusted. All those matters will be reviewed before the introduction of primary legislation to flick on the switch for compulsion. If we go down the road suggested on costs, which we will address later, the six-monthly report to the House that accompanies the review will take us to a point at which we will have all the information that we require when we consider primary legislation on compulsion.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60213-11_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes </b> 
: The Minister clearly gave us a list to indicate how the conditions for moving to compulsion would be met. What is his estimate of the approximate percentage of the adult public with identity cards that would be sufficient to justify moving towards compulsion?

 The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely fair point that we will have to consider seriously as we move towards flicking the switch for compulsion through primary legislation. I suggest that there will be plenty of time to discuss that, but I said quite deliberately that compulsion would have an impact on only the relatively small number of people who had not registered for and obtained a card. I suggest that the proportion would be considerably more than half the eligible population, but the House will have plenty of time to discuss such detailed matters as we get closer to that time.

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60213-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I repeat the assurances that we have already given on several occasions. The stand-alone ID card will cost about &#163;30&nbsp;and the joint package with the biometric passport will cost about &#163;93. My hon.

 On costs, if identity cards are eventually to become compulsory, what is the argument for making them so for a citizen who does not need to travel abroad and does not want a passport? Why should he have to pay for what the Government are going to make him do?

 First, we are not making the cards themselves compulsory&#151;it is the registration that will

We drew the issue to the Committee&#039;s attention but the Government, in their wisdom, decided that they knew best and that if they wanted to bring in compulsion&#151;which was clearly their end intention&#151;they would do it through secondary legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_61">The problem facing the Government is that they have, as usual, misused the English language.

That is why they were given a thorough ticking-off in the other place, where Members of the House of Lords&#151;not only from the Opposition parties, but from the Government party&#151;turned up in numbers to persuade them that their original thinking was wrong.

<a name="60213-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_62">I am delighted that the Minister and the Home Secretary have changed their mind. They were sensible to do so and here we are, dealing with something of a concession. However, before we get overexcited, we need to be clear about the value of the concession&#151;how limited or extensive it is. We shall come on to designated documents in the next group of amendments, but we have already discovered from my intervention that a compulsory procedure will still be required when they are applied for. That is to say that when people apply for their passport, a residential status document or an immigration document they will still be compelled, whether they like it or not, under this Christmas tree of a Bill&#151;which allows the Secretary of State to take unto himself 61&nbsp;powers to make further law&#151;to do things

<br>&nbsp;<br>that he requires them to do. It is only in the discrete area of clauses 6&nbsp;and 7&nbsp;that the requirement for primary legislation bites. We are grateful for that&#151;let me not give the Home Secretary and the Minister of State any other impression&#151;but the problem remains that compulsion is still a big part of the Bill, which is still no more than a Christmas tree, providing various little places for this Secretary of State or his successors to add on secondary legislation giving them powers to tell us what to do.

 Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that the number of people in the United Kingdom who do not have a passport, driver&#039;s licence, pension book, national insurance number, work permit or any need to access public provision is tiny? It would be compulsion by the back door.
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60213-11_spnew15"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 It is my view and that of the official Opposition that it is compulsion by stealth. Only about 20&nbsp;per cent. of the population do not have a passport. If the measure is implemented in 2008, only 20&nbsp;per cent. of a population of broadly 60&nbsp;million will be relieved of compulsion except by primary legislation.

 Is not the problem with the proposed system that the Government cannot control the current passport system? There are lots of forged passports and a good trade in them. They recently told me that they have no idea how many people are eligible to have a national insurance number, let alone what the correlation is between those who have them and those who should have them. Why should we believe that they will be any better at controlling the system if they do not have proper control of the borders and a proper policy on who is eligible to be here?

 My right hon. Friend properly raises all sorts of issues, and I trust that the Government will condescend to answer them in due course. I agree with the thrust behind his question. The Government&#039;s conduct on such matters is incredible and unconvincing. One only has to look at how they handle the Home Office accounts. Not even the Comptroller and Auditor General was prepared to sign those off. Why should we give them the trust that they desire and is required if the system is to command public confidence?

The passport is a designated document, and immigration documents will be designated documents under the secondary legislation that will be introduced under clauses 4&nbsp;and 5. The European travel document, which is what the identity card will eventually become, is another designated document. Mr. Frattini&#039;s point would therefore be more properly addressed in later debates. None the less, I do not wish to inhibit my hon. Friend from pursuing that argument.

It is one thing to say that there will be another Bill, but it is quite another thing to introduce a Bill that says precisely what it means. The Identity Cards Bill is nearly 45&nbsp;pages long, and gives the Secretary of State 61&nbsp;separate powers, but we cannot divine how the Secretary of State will use the powers that he gives himself and how he will define the documents and the other instruments on which he wishes to introduce secondary legislation.

However, it is a 20&nbsp;per cent. or partial concession. As I have said, there are still plenty of provisions in the Bill that give the Secretary of State power to compel the citizen to do something. It is right to welcome the limited concession, but we need to be very careful indeed about a Bill that essentially sets up a national identity register, which is a large Government computer into which all sorts of private information will go, and to which various Government agencies will have access. We the citizens will have no knowledge of when that information goes in, what is taken out, and to whom it is passed.

It is reasonable to assume that there will be a powerful driver for any Government to ensure that that process is convenient, effective and works quickly.

Getting that phase right and being sure that the system is designed to make the process as user-friendly as possible is critical. When we considered the Bill two years ago, we could not look eight years into the future and know the design of the process.

 I am grateful to the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. On passports, does he agree that we must consider carefully the arguments about convenience that he touched on a moment ago? The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government claim that international obligations require us to have on our passports biometric information that will be sucked into, or will be available to be stored on, the national identity register. However, our international obligation is merely for our passports to have digitised biometrics that are readable by the passport officer using a machine at the port of entry&#151;those biometrics would not be accessible by a national identity register. The Government keep trying to smooth over that distinction.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60213-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 The hon. and learned Gentleman and I start this debate from different points of view: he is against having a national ID register and ID cards, and I am in favour of them. My hon. Friend the Minister conceded earlier that the proposals go somewhat beyond the strict minimum required by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and other regulations; however, that is not entirely the point. The ICAO requires this sort of development in the passport and that an infrastructure should be set up to collect biometrics.

<a name="60213-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_77">If we are to go through the process of collecting biometrics because our citizens need that to be done to travel abroad, let us do the job properly and do the other thing that we need to do, namely, establish a decent ID card system and a national identity register. We need that development to enable us to tackle the whole range of identity fraud and to deal with illegal migration problems over the next 10&nbsp;years, particularly as the EU expands and borders become more difficult to secure nationally. That is a gain worth having. The fact that we need to collect biometric data for passport use does not mean that all we should do is the absolute minimum required by those international requirements, given that the gains of having a decent identity register system are significant. That is where the hon. and learned Gentleman and I have different approaches to these issues.

He talked about and gave examples of the ways in which identity cards will resolve various problems, but many of us believe that they are being held up as some sort of panacea on terrorism and identity fraud, whereby if we name a problem, the identity card will resolve it. We simply do not believe that identity cards will be the solution any more than they have been in countries such as Spain, where there has been terrorism.

My view&#151;and that of the majority of the Select Committee&#151;is that identity cards will make a significant contribution to each problem that we are trying to tackle.

The super-affirmative procedure was a secondary legislative procedure and the Parliament Act could not be applied to it. It would therefore have been possible, especially given the requirement to agree a report in both Houses, to block the implementation of a compulsory scheme indefinitely. However, it is not the job of the House to implement law that we know to be bad, even if it sometimes appears convenient to do that.

<a name="stpa_90">I am afraid that I must point out to the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) that his argument misses the wood for the trees. He is a tremendous advocate of identity cards and he argues that we do not know what the position will be in eight years&#039; time, but I point to the example&#151;as I have done before&#151;of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. When George Orwell wrote that book in the 1940s, he was projecting forward to what would happen in circumstances that he foresaw at that time. I recognise the motivation behind the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument, but he is completely missing the point. The Information Commissioner made it abundantly clear that the Bill will fundamentally alter the relationship between the individual and the state. He has kept very quiet about the arrangements made and the amendments tabled since our debate on Second Reading. I should be very interested to know his thoughts now, but I doubt whether he has changed his opinion very much.

This is the offence of which I accuse the Government: they are engaging in a cynical exercise to gain more control over the individual, and in a way that is inimical to the liberties of the people of this country.

 With great respect to the right hon. Gentleman, that sounds to me like a pretty typical report from the members of the Home Affairs Committee. They say, &quot;We concede that this is a matter of fundamental importance to the relationship between the individual and the state, but it doesn&#039;t matter: we&#039;ve got a whole range of other reasons that we can invoke for making such a change.&quot; We have seen some pretty remarkable Select Committee reports over the years, but that one just about takes the biscuit.

 We have just heard the verdict of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) and his Committee, but does my hon. Friend recall that it was the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) who argued&#151;as long as two years ago&#151;that, yes, compulsory ID cards would indeed change the relationship between the individual and the state, in the sense that they would allow him to overcome his sense of alienation and to assert his identity. I have met a lot of people in Buckingham who have grumbled about the loss of identity, but I have yet to hear any of them say that the problem would be addressed by a compulsory ID card from this Government.

 The Orwellian scenario to which my hon. Friend referred is not that far away. We established in Committee that not only an ID card reader but a biometric reader will be needed at every airport terminal and in every police car, so the requirement to hold an ID card is not really necessary. Once the information is on a database, we will have to enter our details at a given terminal every time that we are arrested. That makes the whole debate on ID cards and compulsion completely obsolete.

 The real reason why the Government are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including arrangements relating to biometric procedures is that they are based on a European directive, and the Government know that perfectly well. It is time that the House understood the extent to which domestic legislation is driven by European directives and regulations. The Home Secretary knows that that is why it is impossible to change the arrangements in the Bill. He has already signed up to them. He has given it away in principle and in practice.

 I am grateful for that intervention, but I thought that the hon. Gentleman was about to refer to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) on this matter. The plain fact remains that whether one considers the Tampere discussions or the Hague conventions or arrangements made at a summit in The Hague or in any other circumstances, the provisions in the Bill are inimical to the principles and liberties on which this country has been built. We do not have state control or a police state, but this Bill is the beginning of such arrangements. Ministers know that to be the case, although they are camouflaging it under a range of matters, including terrorism and state security. In essence, they are giving away the fundamental liberties of the people of this country and that is why we should oppose all the measures in this Bill.

 I shall be brief, so that other hon. Members have the chance to speak. I shall try to stick, as little of the debate has done, to the substance of the amendment. It deals with the simple issue of compulsion. I could go on at great length about the Bill, as I have in the past, but I want to point out that no other country is doing this. No other country is going down this road. I think that in a couple of years the whole issue will be abandoned. The idea that the Home Office, of all Departments, will get this massive infrastructure to work, which nobody else in the world has managed to do, is unreal.

<a name="60213-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_97">I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of the amendment, because it would not affect everybody. It affects those people who will not be caught under clause 5. The amendment will make a difference because primary legislation, with proper debate and scrutiny in this place, will be needed before a move to compulsion. I would much rather have that than secondary legislation. We should welcome the fact that this step has been taken; it is an improvement, although it does not deal with the aspects of the Bill that concern some people.

<a name="60213-16_para8">

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60213-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 I invite the Home Secretary to be quite careful about this. I do not want him to mislead himself or anybody else. Is there not a difference between the international obligation and what the Government require? Under the international obligation, biometric information that can be read by a passport officer&#039;s machine appears on the face of the passport. What the Government require us to do is to provide biometric information on the passport that can be read by, and stored in, the national identity register. There is quite a difference of quality and principle that the Government keep eliding.
</p>





<p><a name="st_156"><a name="60213-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. and learned Gentleman is right in one respect. We are in an evolving situation as far as the international requirements are concerned. That applies to the EU, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the UN Security Council resolution. It is equally the case that many countries are evolving their own systems&#151;whether they go for the number of biometrics that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) mentioned, for biometrics for all 10&nbsp;fingers and thumbs or the 13&nbsp;that we will have for our ID cards. It is also true that there are different states of decision in different countries on those points. All is evolving. However, both within the EU and in the dialogue between the EU and the United States that has explicitly addressed these matters, including in the G8&nbsp;context, the overwhelming view is to move towards the most rigorous form of biometrics for fundamental documents such as passports and visas. That is the point that I am trying to make.

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="60213-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I have seen that report. If one considers different biometrics, one sees that there are different issues for different communities. The biometrics for the face, the iris and for fingerprints and thumbprints give rise to different issues in each case. However, as I know my hon. Friend will accept, the point is simple and straightforward. The more biometrics we have, the more reliable and fraud-proof is the system. For example, it is better to have biometrics for all 10&nbsp;fingers and thumbs than it is to have them for one.

 The Government&#039;s figures show that while &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion is lost due to fraud each year, identity-related fraud accounts for between &#163;20&nbsp;million and &#163;50&nbsp;million a year. That amount is considerably less than the &#163;85&nbsp;million cost of implementing the ID card system, as we established in Committee.

I argue strongly that the system that we are creating will be less susceptible to fraud, whether we are considering passports that are used fraudulently, or the variety of ways in which identity fraud is committed. Of course we will have to consider fraud under the new system, but we must compare the system that we are establishing with the existing system.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="60213-18_spnew14"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 I shall make this intervention as constructively as I can. The simple truth is that the test is not simply whether the system will be better than that which we have now.

Plenty of identity card systems do not challenge individual privacy or require massive central databases, but are far more secure than the system that the right hon. Gentleman proposes.

 With the greatest respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I do not think that he is correct. The distinguishing aspect of the scheme is the move towards using fingerprint biometrics and other biometrics. To respond to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, some 30&nbsp;countries already intend to include fingerprint biometrics on their passports. As I said, the United States is increasing its programme. In my opinion it would be utterly foolish of us not to take advantage of the advances in biometrics to increase our security, and that is the intention behind the proposal.

<a name="stpa_117">My argument is that the ID cards system brings substantial benefits to both individuals and society and that the opt-out proposed by the Lords puts those benefits at risk.

The benefits of the ID cards scheme will grow steadily as more people obtain

<br>&nbsp;<br>their cards. By linking the process with the issue or renewal of a document such as a passport, which around 80&nbsp;per cent. of the population already holds, there will be a manageable roll-out of the ID cards scheme. That is surely in the public interest. If those hon. Members who say that they are concerned about the cost of the scheme really do want to avoid excessive costs, they should accept the logic of combining the process of issuing ID cards with the issuing of passports or immigration documents.

<a name="stpa_118">In practice, of course, the process of obtaining a passport and an ID card will be combined in future, so issuing the two documents as a package will be just as convenient as applying for a biometric passport. When we introduce passports with fingerprint biometrics, the process of obtaining a passport and an ID card will be so similar as to make the need to combine the two quite obvious.

 The Department has not made a systematic, rigorous assessment of the costs that my hon. Friend describes, but we have considered the issue in principle, to see what the overall situation would be. As he implies, if the amendment were passed, the costs would be greater because they would be shared among fewer people and the implementation of the whole ID cards system would be far less assured. If the amendment proposed by the Lords were passed, the effect on both the cost and the roll-out of the scheme would be serious, but detailed costings would take some months to clarify.

In practice, it is the most controversial and, indeed, the most important debate that we shall hold today, because it will determine whether the ID card scheme is covertly rendered compulsory or not. In 2005, under the heading, &quot;Strong and secure borders,&quot; page 52&nbsp;of the 111-page Labour manifesto said:

<a name="60213-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_129">I heard what the Home Secretary said about consultation papers and so on, but any reasonable member of the public would deduce that they could choose whether or not to have an ID card when they renewed their passport. That is a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw, but it is the opposite of what the Government intend. To justify what this Bill does, the Labour manifesto should have said: &quot;We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a compulsory basis for a progressively larger portion of the population as people renew their passports.&quot; That is the truth of today&#039;s proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_130">Faced with that fact, Baroness Scotland, speaking on behalf of the Government, tried to claim that passports are voluntary. That is not the case if someone&#039;s work takes them abroad, nor if their parents live abroad, nor if their spouse or partner is from an another country. Nor is it the case if their children travel abroad, fall sick or get into trouble. It is a novel interpretation of &quot;voluntary&quot; if the price of a foreign holiday is a requirement for inclusion in the national identity register. The Lords therefore amended the Bill, quite properly in my view, to remove that creeping compulsion, and make inclusion on the register optional when someone receives or renews a passport. That is what the Government are seeking to reverse, for reasons to which I shall return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_131">The Government may ask why that should be voluntary. If people are already getting a passport, what is the reason for turning down an identity card? There are many good reasons for not wanting to be on the national identity register, which involves a large number of pieces of data about each individual being put on a single Government database, many of them the access keys for other Government databases. That is the important point: it is a central database with access keys effectively to all the other Government databases.

Those barriers were a protection of the liberties of the individual, and now they have gone.

Why should we imagine that it is capable of setting up the very complex register required by the Bill in an acceptable and workable way? If it goes wrong, that may manifest itself in problems and delays in getting the designated document. How much longer will it take to get a passport if we add the ID card requirements? Once we have renewed our passports, we are required to keep the Government informed of any changes. We will have to tell the Government every time we change our address, on pain of a fine of &#163;1,000, which is quite a lot of money.

Should he not therefore be supporting the Government?
</p>





<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60213-21_spnew11"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a decent point in truth. A large database should be introduced on an evolutionary basis and slowly. However, that could be done on a much more steady basis with a voluntary system. The point here is the strategic problem of the database itself, but I will come back to that in a moment because it is a serious point to take on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_141">There is also the question of inaccuracy. The Government have tried to persuade the public of the value of an identity card, but they have not considered the consequences if there are erroneous records. Many hon. Members have dealt with personal disasters that have befallen constituents when some data held about them have been wrong. As the Select Committee Chairman will know, the Home Office cannot even ensure that the Criminal Records Bureau database is accurate. At one point two thirds of it was in error, and at the last check it was one third. Those are serious errors in what should be an absolutely accurate record. So what chance with a 40&nbsp;million person database? So there are many major problems even before one considers the hundreds of thousands of people who will be the victims of false positive or false negative biometric tests, as has been clear from the studies done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_142">Finally, there is the most important question about the whole issue&#151;the insecurity of the system. The Government have made, in a way properly, much of the issue of identity theft, particularly with regard to terrorism. Yet their proposal&#151;a point I referred to earlier&#151;is to gather the access keys to virtually every Government database in the national identity register, put them on one large computer and then create many thousands of direct access points to that computer. They will have created the most attractive possible target for every fraudster, terrorist, confidence trickster and hacker on the planet. Those people will be able to lift data out and put viruses and false data in.

There is a national identity register. It is a central database system. It has many thousands of access points around the country. It has to do so because that is the way it works. It is different from most other identity card systems around the world. The compulsory ones are largely localised databases, not national, and that is why they cost only about &#163;4&nbsp;a head, not the sort of cost that this system will engender when we see it.

Therefore, the purpose of a clean identity base nationally is to achieve what the Conservative party paraded as its policy before the election, namely, an understanding of who is in the country, who is entitled to work, who is entitled to services and to ensure that those who are not, are precluded from working, drawing down on free services or being involved in other such ventures.

 I shall begin by saying something that will comfort the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis). Again, I shall quote the Home Affairs Committee report on ID cards, which addressed the question of the use of language:

<a name="stpa_157">In reality, people must accept that if they want a passport, they will have to go on to the national identity register, and the question is whether that is justifiable. As a supporter of ID cards and the national identity register, it seems to me that that approach is right and sensible. It would be nonsense to go through the entire process of collecting one set of biometric data and storing it with all the relevant background information for the purpose of issuing a passport, and then to run an entirely separate exercise in parallel to collect slightly different biometric data and store them on a different identity register in order to have an ID card system. Running the two systems together will be far more convenient for the citizen, and it makes much more sense in terms of building a system that has integrity and security. Furthermore, it will certainly be far more cost-

<br>&nbsp;<br>effective. Moving towards ID cards and a national identity register means that using passports as a designated document is the sensible way forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_158">To be fair, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden spent most of his speech attacking the principle behind the measure rather than the use of the word &quot;voluntary&quot;. He attempted to argue that we should not require people to go on to the national identity register as part of the process of obtaining a passport because the risks posed by the national identity register are so immense that it is unjustifiable to ask people to go on to it. That basic contention lies at the heart of the entire debate about ID cards, but those fears are misplaced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_159">The scheme&#039;s opponents have failed to make substantive arguments. I know that it is slightly bad form to quote one&#039;s own intervention and the response to it, but I shall do so on this occasion. When the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden made a powerful point about the dangers of bringing different databases together, I asked him to name two pieces of data that are kept separately and that he thinks it would be dangerous to bring together. Hon. Members will have noted that he could not name two pieces of data that we should not put together in one place. He mentioned medical records and criminal records, which have nothing to do with ID cards, and names and national insurance numbers are stored together on plenty of databases. He could not establish what would go wrong if two particular pieces of data were stored together.
</p>





<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60213-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the register will contain extra detail that is not currently held on other databases, such as the footprint of questions put to the new database and when someone last went to a doctor? It will also contain NHS numbers and criminal record numbers, which will be taken from one database and put on another.
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="60213-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has not made the case why different bits of data should not be brought together.
</p>





<p><a name="st_232"><a name="60213-23_spnew3"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 When the right hon. Gentleman raised that point, I was dealing with amusing heckling. I shall take up his point in a way that may embarrass my party, but never mind. A previous Chancellor&#151;he is now Lord Lamont&#151;became known as our &quot;flexible friend&quot; because of one or two pieces of data in relation to a credit card. The simple point is that it allows fishing expeditions, which people undertake if they are trying to embarrass somebody or to find something that puts them in a difficult position. The easier those fishing expeditions are, the more dangerous it is to the privacy of the individual.

<p><a name="st_233"><a name="60213-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 Let me say in passing that two of the suggestions made by Opposition Members about what would on the database are incorrect. The right hon. Gentleman says that there will be fishing expeditions. That is to assume something unjustifiable&#151;that nothing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1188</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the law that we are being invited to pass, nothing in the system of regulation, and nothing in the system of oversight can ever be expected to work. He conjured up an image of huge numbers of individuals with a right of access to the database. First, that is not true. Secondly, those people who will be allowed access to the database for the purposes of crime prevention, for example, would be able to do so if they were not able to access that information in another form. Given that all the information is already on a Government database and can be accessed under existing crime-fighting powers, the Bill gives no significant increase in access to the people about whom the right hon. Gentleman is worrying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_160">The only new issue that arises is that of the audit trail about an individual registration. That would be subject to exactly the same controls that exist on access to information that is already on the Government database. Throughout this debate, not only today but previously, I have struggled to understand exactly why access to that audit trail by proper and regulated authorities for the purposes of crime prevention is seen as massively detrimental to the interests of the individual. It is not; in fact, it is just as likely to be of value to the individual. Let us take as an example the hypothetical situation of a Chancellor of the Exchequer who had been accused of shopping in Thresher&#039;s when he wished to say that he had been in no such place. In those circumstances, the individual would have had access to the audit trail and been able to prove that he had been nowhere near Thresher&#039;s on that occasion. The audit trail is of far more advantage to the individual than to any other authority.

</p>





<p><a name="st_235"><a name="60213-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 That is right, with the exception that is always there in law of the detection and prevention of crime, which is subject to its own specific regulation and oversight. It is well established in this House, and has been on many occasions in relation to many sources of information, that we have given the police and the security services access to that information for the purposes of fighting crime and defeating terrorism. The Bill introduces no new principle and no new threats to the individual.
</p>





<p><a name="st_236"><a name="60213-23_spnew7"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend is going through the arguments in a cogent way that will convince many people. We may be able to introduce more and more safeguards into the system through encryption and so on, but the key issue on legislation of such importance is to ensure that we have the confidence of the British public. We can do that in two ways&#151;by putting it to them in a general election in which they can vote for that system, or by having them buy into the system through personal decisions. When we put it to them in a general election, they voted for a voluntary system. The Bill does not allow them to have that, and the only way in which we can give it to them is by an individual decision on a voluntary basis, as the amendment suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_161">It has been pretty clear throughout that the Government intended to link the issuing of ID cards and the establishment of a national identity register to passports. That has never been a secret. It was clear at the time of our Select Committee report, when we were working on the assumption that driving licences would also be included. There has been no deception of the public. No danger is brought about by bringing the data together.

<p>
<a name="60213-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_162">Furthermore, no significant danger has been introduced by access to audit trails, given that that is supervised. The third question is whether the database can, by virtue of its very existence, be hacked into by people trying to get a list of identities that they can use to mimic or fake them in some way. Of all the issues in the debate, that needs to be taken the most seriously. When our Committee heard a wide variety of technical evidence on these questions, I was convinced that there are no insuperable or unknown technical obstacles to designing the database in such a way as to make it free from such attack. There will be a huge responsibility on Home Office Ministers and their team to get those technical questions right, but it is an entirely resolvable problem.

<p><a name="st_240"><a name="60213-24_spnew0"><b> Chris Mole: </b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the fundamental assumption that underlies the errors in people&#039;s conclusions about this is that there is two-way traffic? From the majority of verification points, people do not have access to the data in the central database. They are able only to submit data about the individual concerned to the central database and get back a yes or no confirmation as regards their identity. It is wrong to conclude that those access points create weakness in the security of the system.
</p>





<p><a name="st_241"><a name="60213-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. To listen to some speakers, one would think that the national identity register will run live, rather like national rail inquiries on the internet, so that one can go in and access information. That is not how it will operate. There will not be lots of live access points with people interacting with the system and being able, for example, to get viruses into it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_163">It would be possible to say, &quot;For the elimination of all doubt, let&#039;s not do this.&quot; That leads to the conclusion that it would be better not to have a Revenue and Customs computer or any other type of computerised system that could allow for hacking and destruction. The gains of this system, to our society and to individuals, vastly outweigh the risks that can be identified.

 I am one of those&#151;I am sure that there are many others in this House&#151;who carries out most of his banking transactions on the internet. The risks to individuals and society of having any type of internet exchange of financial information are vastly greater than anything to do with a national identity register, yet we have not banned internet banking. The vast majority of problems have arisen from individuals volunteering their own information to fraudsters. The existence of a huge variety of very sensitive internet applications that are used with great confidence across the world, day in, day out, should give us the confidence to believe that this important project can be delivered and will work.

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60213-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I begin by picking up a point that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) made. I hope that I do not misrepresent him when I say that I understood him to argue that all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the information exists on various Government databases and it is therefore not objectionable to bring it together, and that exceptional access to it would be allowed only for the prevention and detection of crime.

<a name="60213-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_190">This amendment is also about the argument between compulsory versus voluntary. Here, however, I agree with the Government. I oppose the Lords amendment because it is important to preserve the requirement for the decision on the national identity register to be taken at a later stage. In the short term, very little will happen. When we apply for a passport, we already have to give our name, address, date and place of birth, sex and nationality. Those six pieces of information are then stored on a separate database known as the national insurance register. I waited for the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) to reveal why the provisions would have the effect of making secret information more accessible. I waited in vain, however, because he never came to the point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">The Government already have many databases that contain that same basic information. The electoral register, for example, contains our names and addresses. The Inland Revenue possesses the names and addresses, and many more details, of 40&nbsp;million people, and the national insurance register contains the details of 60&nbsp;million people. I believe that eBay has a database of 157&nbsp;million users.

 I will not give way, because we are reaching the end of the debate. The key question is whether the existence of these databases gives anyone unauthorised access to confidential information, and the answer totally eluded the right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_192">A voluntary ID register makes no more sense than voluntary bus fares or voluntary juries. The huge benefits that will come to the citizen, to the Government and to private industry with the introduction of ID cards are to a large extent dependent on it being compulsory for everyone&#039;s name to be on the national identity register. The figures in the Home Office benefits overview show that we could draw benefits worth &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion from the existence of such a register, but that we would draw 100&nbsp;per cent. of those benefits only if we had 100&nbsp;per cent. take-up. With only 50&nbsp;per cent. take-up, the benefits would be less than 10&nbsp;per cent. of that figure. This is precisely the point that the amendment does not deal with. With a take-up of only 60&nbsp;per cent., the benefits would be less than 20&nbsp;per cent. Only when we pass the 80&nbsp;to 90&nbsp;per cent. take-up rate will the benefits of this legislation really come to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">The lion&#039;s share of the benefits, in financial terms, will come from fraud prevention and the reduced cost of crime. Only a small benefit will come, in the earlier stages, from the greater efficiency of public services and from more effective control of work permits and visas. If we had a low take-up, we would see significant benefits only in public services and in immigration, although the savings would still be well worth having to organisations such as the Criminal Records Bureau, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Department for Education and Skills and the immigration and nationality directorate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">To reduce fraud, however, we need everyone to be in the scheme. As long as we are allowed to present alternative forms of identification, such as utility bills, the people who intend to commit fraud will do just that. It is ironic that hon. Members who were concerned about the weakness of List 99&nbsp;and the sex offenders register should have missed the point that those weaknesses are in large part due to the lack of any way of being sure of someone&#039;s identity. The Criminal Records Bureau has estimated that the time needed to carry out a check would come down from four weeks to three days if we had ID cards. More importantly, the result of that check would be much more secure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">The other point that we have missed is that the largest beneficiary of a full ID card system would be not the Government but the citizen. When someone has their identity stolen, they do not usually lose out financially. It is the bank that loses, and passes the cost on to other users. According to the Home Office, the benefit of ID cards would amount to about &#163;420&nbsp;million for the citizen, and a similar amount to industry, but only about &#163;240&nbsp;million to public services. We have only to consider the costs and benefits of the ID card system to see that&#151;

 I should say at the beginning that the Government support amendment (a), tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) and, should the need arise, the Government will move it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_202">The amendments cover the requirement for openness in relation to the costs of the identity card scheme. That is a legitimate request, with which I shall deal head on. It is of course desirable that as much information as possible about the scheme is placed in the public domain. However, it is true to say that that aim has to be balanced by the need to secure best value in an open procurement process and to adhere to the guidelines for such Government procurement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_203">We have two legitimate aims, therefore, that pull in opposite directions. We have to seek to resolve that tension and strike a balance. We believe that my right hon. Friend&#039;s amendment does just that, with subsection (4) being the crucial element. By contrast, the alternative amendment passed by the other place is heavy-handed and prescriptive and would not allow us to achieve best value in the procurement process. It would of course also be something of a precedent to accept that amendment and we will resist it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_204">We have made available a full account of the costs of the identity card scheme and we are pleased this evening to account again for the costs and explain them in some detail. We touched on the issue earlier in the debate, and we heard some inaccurate and misleading comment designed to undermine public confidence in the scheme. Some even claimed that a card would cost as much as &#163;300. I would not pay &#163;300&nbsp;for an identity card, and nor would I expect my constituents to do so. Those costs, I am pleased to say, are completely wrong.

<br>&nbsp;<br>fatuous report on the &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion cost of identity fraud that was pulled apart by experts on both sides of the argument?
</p>





<p><a name="st_274"><a name="60213-27_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should be cautious about rubbishing the figures that were placed in the public domain, not by No. 10&nbsp;Downing street but by the identity fraud steering committee, which works under the auspices of the Home Office but brings together a range of partners from the public and private sectors and is engaged in a serious attempt to tackle a real threat. I am sure that the figure placed in the public domain underestimates the true cost of identity fraud. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that it was a cynical exercise. The group has been meeting for some time and its methodology and the breakdown of its figures were placed in the Library. I urge the hon. Gentleman to look at the detail if he has not done so already.
</p>





<p><a name="st_275"><a name="60213-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 Does the Minister recognise the public&#039;s concern that the costs of the scheme might be better spent on more police officers on the beat and tighter border controls? There is natural suspicion that the costs of any Government procurement scheme, especially one involving IT, are likely to exceed the amount stated, not fall below it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_276"><a name="60213-27_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I have two points to make in response. First, it is not a case of either/or. The hon. Gentleman will know&#151;the point has been made many times&#151;that this Government have invested significantly in police on the beat and we are proud to have done so. His main point&#151;and a mistake made by the Opposition throughout the debate&#151;is the suggestion that a pot of funds is sitting in the Home Office to pay for the entire scheme and that it can easily be directed to another Home Office priority. The whole premise is that the basis of funding the scheme will be the same as for passports: the costs of running the passport service are predominantly recovered from the fees people pay for their passport. That principle will continue when we introduce a biometric ID card system.

<a name="stpa_207">I am pleased that the hon. and learned Gentleman has attached himself to the parliamentary Labour party mailing list&#151;I do not know what his intentions are. He will see from my letter that, based on our scheme, the main cost driver assumed by the LSE is incorrect. The LSE assumed a five-year refresh rate for biometric enrolment, but there is no evidence to support that as the main assumption for the scheme&#151;the major basis on which we have challenged the LSE figures, because they would add enormous costs to the scheme.

<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60213-27_spnew10"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 Can we get a straight admission from the Minister that the allegation in his letter, that the LSE allocated an inflated &#163;1&nbsp;billion marketing budget, is wrong? If that is true, where does it appear in any of the LSE documents? There is no point in the Minister trying to avoid the point: is it true or not? He has been told by the LSE that it is not true, so why does not he tell the House what he thinks?
</p>





<p><a name="st_282"><a name="60213-27_spnew11"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I do not intend to debate the detail of the LSE report. If I need to correct anything, I shall write to the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I can say with confidence that the LSE figures have moved around somewhat. In a discussion with me in the House, one of the authors of the report said publicly that they would have to &quot;revise downwards&quot; some of the figures. It has been quite hard to keep track of the some of the LSE figures, but I do not want the debate to be purely about that point.

<p>
<a name="60213-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_209">My two key points are, first, that the costs of the scheme are both realistic and affordable for the Government and the individual citizen and, secondly, that it is worth making the investment now because Britain does not have a high-standard, comprehensive system of identification. We have published the expected costs of issuing ID cards, and the current best estimate of the annual average running costs of issuing ID cards and passports to British citizens is &#163;584&nbsp;million, from the start of the ID scheme, including the cost of compiling and running the national identity register.
</p>





<p><a name="st_285"><a name="60213-27_spnew14"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I am pleased that the figure has been made public, but does my hon. Friend accept that some of us still have concerns about the cost? The biggest problem is the cost of the IT infrastructure. We do not want another Rural Payments Agency problem, where the IT was renegotiated as the scheme was being introduced, so it would be helpful if the Government said that, rather than hiding behind commercial confidentiality, they are prepared to share such information with the House so that we can be sure that the IT consultants do not run off and make a bomb out of the proposal. Does my hon. Friend agree?
</p>





<p><a name="st_286"><a name="60213-27_spnew15"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 It is precisely because we do not want people running off and making a bomb at the expense of the taxpayer that we are proceeding as we are. As I said earlier, we recognise the tension between running, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1206</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>getting best value from, a procurement process and the need to be open and accountable by putting as much information as possible in the public domain. Those are two conflicting aims, but in the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras we begin to see a way to resolve them. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) inasmuch as we want to put information into the public domain as early as possible, but without fettering our ability to secure the cost and keep it down when we go to market. A person would not ordinarily say how much they had to spend before trying to obtain the best price from a supplier, and that principle holds good for this exercise.

<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60213-28_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> 
 It may help my hon. Friend to learn that when I questioned IT professionals who are hoping to take part in the tender, they said that the LSE figures were entirely speculative, bearing in mind the degree of knowledge about the project, but they added that the Government&#039;s were too. There is no proper basis for estimating such a project without much greater knowledge about its purpose and its specification. Does my hon. Friend agree?
</p>





<p><a name="st_288"><a name="60213-28_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I note my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the LSE figures. On the Government&#039;s figures&#151;the main thrust of his question&#151;he will know that we commissioned an independent assessment from KPMG. It looked in detail at the business case for the scheme and concluded, in an independent summary that we placed in the Library, that it was &quot;robust and appropriate&quot;. We have not opened up the whole report to Members, so some of the details will have to be taken on trust, but I can assure my hon. Friend that that was KPMG&#039;s conclusion and I urge him to refer to the document, which suggests that our figures have some validity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_289"><a name="60213-28_spnew2"><b> Glenda Jackson  (Hampstead and Highgate) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend set out how the Government are approaching the commissioning of the enormous contract for a database that must be pushing at the envelope of IT knowledge? The Government&#039;s track record in commissioning computer-based technology is disastrous&#151;as was that of the previous Government&#151;so how are they approaching it differently to ensure that we do not experience, as we have in the past, vast overruns and increases in expenses in a programme that is not fit for purpose?
</p>





<p><a name="st_290"><a name="60213-28_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to note that the project is a major undertaking and will require significant sums, and I shall set out in detail how much we expect to spend. I have two points in response to her question. If we said that because there had been problems in the past we would never embrace new technology and never make significant investment in a project that could bring improvements, that would be the wrong approach. However, I assure her that we are basing the delivery body for the scheme on that of the UK Passport Service. It had problems a few years ago, but they were not related to the introduction of the IT system, and it has since emerged as one of the highest-performing public sector organisations and is extremely well equipped to deliver the scheme cost-effectively.

 I am not against identity cards in principle, so I ask this question 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1207</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in kindness, rather than anything else. Does the Minister agree that there has been a pretty long trail of failures by all Governments in implementing IT and that this Government have had a number of such failures, which he perhaps underestimates? Has he conducted an inquiry into those failures? Will he place in the Library the list of lessons that the Government have learned from the failures of the past, so that we can estimate whether they will be able to handle what is, on all accounts, a very large order of magnitude in changed technology?
</p>





<p><a name="st_292"><a name="60213-28_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I hesitate to ask whether the right hon. Gentleman has experience of such matters. Governments of both colours have had negative experience in that regard, but it is precisely because of some of the past procurement problems that the Office of Government Commerce gateway process has been established. As he will know, that involves private sector expertise at every stage of a major project to consider its readiness and whether the associated risks are adequately addressed. The scheme has been through a series of gateway reviews, and I assure him that that directly builds on experience learned from past failures. Some of the people involved in the process have been involved in other major public and private sector procurement. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Obviously, they have clearly learned the lessons and know exactly what they are doing now. The serious point is that the scheme is being closely examined, and we seek to make as much information from the gateway process available as possible. I take on board the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_293"><a name="60213-28_spnew6"><b> Mr. Brooks Newmark  (Braintree) (Con):</b> 
 I am not satisfied that the Minister has answered the question asked by the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson). The tax credit fiasco suffered from enormous IT overruns, and when the Government tried to fix them the costs went up even further. I wonder whether the Minister still shares the Home Secretary&#039;s confidence that he will not only hit the target of about &#163;540&nbsp;million, but beat it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_294"><a name="60213-28_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I do share that confidence. Let me develop the point that I made in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson). It is not correct to say glibly that the scheme is directly comparable to the Child Support Agency. They are not analogous, and we are describing a very different function. Before hon. Members run away with the idea that the scheme is intended to encompass everything, let me say that it is a basic identification scheme that will hold biometric details.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_210">Let me refer the House to the experience of the United States since 11&nbsp;September. The US has introduced biometrics into its immigration system pretty much from a standing start, and they are now used for all visas around the world and for people going through US customs control. Such schemes are workable. They are in use today. The British Government are increasingly using biometrics. We have progressively introduced biometrics into visas, and that process is beginning to be implemented around the world. A biometric is being used in applicant registration cards for asylum seekers, and we are seeking to build on such relevant experience.

 May I draw my hon. Friend&#039;s attention to the need for greater transparency, which might provide reassurance? He referred to the fact that only a summary of the KPMG report has been published. It would certainly be helpful if the whole report were published, and commercial confidentiality would not be affected in doing so. The OGC gateways could readily be disclosed, at least in summary form. It is welcome that the Government have commissioned a concept viability report on the project, and it could also be made available. I have yet to see it, and it would have been useful to have seen it before the debate.

 I take on board my hon. Friend&#039;s general point. I hope that, after this evening&#039;s vote, the discussion will change from one about whether or not the scheme should happen to one about how it will happen. I think that that important distinction will quickly take root in people&#039;s minds. I embrace my hon. Friend&#039;s point of view. It would not be right to proceed with a scheme of such national significance with any sense of a culture of secrecy. We will seek to put as much information as possible into the public domain, but as he will understand from his experience before first coming to the House, that must be balanced by a requirement to secure best value from what will be a major procurement process. We need to keep those two things in mind.

<a name="stpa_212">I want to stress to the House that the &#163;584&nbsp;million cost of issuing passport and identity cards includes all the existing costs of issuing passports through the United Kingdom Passport Service, together with the developments that will be needed over the next few years to introduce biometric passports, starting with passports incorporating facial images and moving to biometric fingerprints. About 70&nbsp;per cent. of the cost of issuing identity cards, alongside passports, is attributable to the introduction of biometric passports. Let me put that figure into perspective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_213">The figure of &#163;584&nbsp;million includes the baseline figures for the operation of the UK Passport Service, which in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;is expected to be some &#163;397&nbsp;million. That is the organisation&#039;s running cost in carrying out its core responsibility of issuing passports to the British public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the difference between those two

<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1209</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>figures&#151;about &#163;200&nbsp;million&#151;is what we are debating. That is the extra cost that the identity card scheme will place on the public, and it is the set-up costs of establishing the scheme, which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud.

<p><a name="st_299"><a name="60213-29_spnew0"><b> Stewart Hosie: </b> 
 The figure of &#163;200&nbsp;million represents the non-passport element of the scheme, but is the Minister convinced that that will be the total required to tackle insurance fraud, payments fraud, banking and building society fraud and finance and leasing fraud? It seems a rather small sum if it is intended to tackle all &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion fraud identified by the Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_300"><a name="60213-29_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I am making the point that that figure relates to the budget for issuing biometric passports and identity cards to the public. The perspective that needs to be taken is that ID cards do not account for the whole of that amount. The hon. Gentleman makes my point partly for me: &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion is the annual cost to the UK of identity fraud, so the benefits case begins to stack up for the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_214">I will summarise the additional costs over and above those of biometric passports that the scheme would place on the Government, as shown in the regulatory impact assessment. First, the costs include covering the whole resident population aged 16-plus, rather than just the 80&nbsp;per cent. of British citizens who will have passports by 2008. Secondly, they include recording, matching and storing three types of biometric information&#151;face, fingerprint and iris&#151;rather than one, which is the current standard required for the first generation of biometric passports. Thirdly, they include providing an online identity verification service that can validate ID cards and other identity inquiries for user organisations in the public and private sectors. That is what we are talking about this evening, and it is important to apply that perspective to the scale of the costs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_301"><a name="60213-29_spnew2"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 The current passport application support system is a 10-year private finance initiative and, as my hon. Friend said, that must be part of the &#163;397&nbsp;million for the Passport Service&#039;s running costs. Is the &#163;584&nbsp;million for both capital and revenue costs? Will it be a similar sort of PFI scheme?
</p>





<p><a name="st_302"><a name="60213-29_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend asks a fair question. The &#163;584&nbsp;million relates to the cost in its totality of issuing biometric passports and ID cards and, crucially, of enrolling people. That is where the bulk of the costs of the process would be. It would be an annual cost that the expanded Passport Service would need. She is right to suggest that it is possible that payment for some of the set-up costs of the scheme could be delayed into the running costs of the scheme. That would be a way of financing the scheme that would require the private sector to fund the scheme up front, and the costs would be recovered over a longer period. Those would, quite properly, be issues for the procurement process. Obviously, we will seek to secure the best deal for the taxpayer when we make the decision.
</p>





<p><a name="st_303"><a name="60213-29_spnew4"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 Is my hon. Friend saying that if it is not a PFI scheme, which would have an annual running cost, there will be an additional capital cost to begin with

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is &quot;revenuised&quot; into the &#163;584&nbsp;million? What proportion of the &#163;584&nbsp;million is for the operation of the verification scheme?
</p>





<p><a name="st_304"><a name="60213-29_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I will be honest with my hon. Friend. Some of these issues have not been decided yet. They will be decided when the procurement phase gets going properly. It is true that there are up-front set-up costs at the start of the scheme that fall to the Home Office. As I have explained, we have decided not to make those costs available at the moment because that would prejudice our ability in the middle of the procurement process. However, I can tell my hon. Friend that those costs will be much less than the annual running costs of the scheme.

<a name="stpa_215">We have said that the costs should not be fully divulged as that will limit our ability to secure value in the market, but I can say that the annual set-up costs will be much less than the annual running costs.

The work that we have undertaken so far shows that there would be a net benefit for many public and private sector organisations. There may be many net benefits to a wide range of organisations and the Government have already published a high-level summary of likely future benefits in the &quot;Benefits Overview&quot; paper, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. It suggests, we believe, conservatively that the quantified financial benefits of the identity cards scheme will range from &#163;650&nbsp;million to &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion per year once the scheme is rolled out fully.

 My hon. Friend mentioned the benefits review.

Since he published those figures, he has revised his estimate of the total amount of ID fraud from &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion to &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion.

 That is a good point. Of course, we keep the benefits case under review and it changes as the scheme develops and as different organisations see how it might benefit them. My hon.

 We have been in a different phase of the scheme. The debate has been happening in the House and in another place and, in those circumstances, one might expect that people would not want to intrude on the debate. I suspect that, now the scheme has received a pretty strong endorsement from the House, there will be considerable interest from the private sector in delivering it. I would be surprised if that were not to be the case. I am confident that the capability exists within the market to deliver a high-quality scheme.

Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson). I note that there is a difference. The Lords amendment talks about costs and benefits whereas that of my right hon. Friend talks about costs. I suspect that taking references to benefits out of the report would not shorten it by much but, more importantly, my right hon. Friend&#039;s amendment takes out references to all Government Departments. When costs are published over the next period, it is important that we do not see just what is happening in the Home Office but what is happening in other Government Departments as well.

At the point at which it makes that decision, it is a matter for it as to whether it puts that information into the public domain. I am saying to my hon.

I suspect that the United States Congress got more candour out of the Pentagon on the projected costs of the stealth bomber than we are getting out of the Government on the IT project that we are discussing.

 It merely confirms that a Government who do not know what they are doing ask a distinguished firm of accountants to produce a report that answers no useful questions and we are no further on. No doubt the public were required to spend several hundreds of thousands of pounds on fees to obtain that rather unhelpful answer. In any event, the end picture is not a happy one for the Government, and it is certainly not a happy one for the taxpayers of this country.

 The Minister said that the LSE revised its costs downwards because of the durability of the card, but that is not the case.

It originally assumed that everyone would be interviewed to get verification of their biographical details. The Government explained that that was not going to be the case.

As I understand it, the Government have refused&#151;they may have changed their mind today&#151;to cap fees. The implication is that if costs rise, so too will fees. There is plenty of research to show that the acceptability of the ID scheme declines as its costs increase.

We ought to behave as the Victorians did with cheques. There was a simple law on cheques&#151;if someone did not sign the cheque and the bank paid out, the loss was the bank&#039;s, not the account holder.

<p><a name="st_367"><a name="60213-33_spnew12"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 I welcome the Government&#039;s agreement with amendment (a). However, my problem is that large amounts of public money will be spent before we reach the inevitable point at which we have to call a halt to the terrible monster. I am more sceptical than my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) about the Government&#039;s figures. Their precision is incredible&#151;&#163;584&nbsp;million, not &#163;583&nbsp;million or &#163;585&nbsp;million. At least the London School of Economics gave a range of estimates. The Under-Secretary did not make it clear in reply to my interventions whether the figure included set-up costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_303">However, we have information about current expenditure from the United Kingdom Passport Service website. I also obtained information through parliamentary questions and from letters from the Under-Secretary. We therefore know that the cost of running the old-style passports was &#163;219&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;and that the charge to people who wanted a passport was &#163;35.60. This year, we commence the introduction of biometric passports, which will include only the facial biometric&#151;a digital image. Yet it will cost the Government &#163;397&nbsp;million a year and people who purchase the passports will have to pay at least &#163;57.93, which, according to the Government, is the cost of producing the passports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_304">In getting from old-style passports to the first phase of the biometric passport, which includes only one image, the running costs will increase by &#163;178&nbsp;million a year. Those figures are probably reliable. However, the jump from the new passport with one digital biometric to the all-singing, all-dancing biometric passport/ID card system database is supposed to entail an increase of a mere &#163;187&nbsp;million. I cannot believe those figures. I cannot believe that it costs &#163;178&nbsp;million a year to get from A to B yet it will cost only &#163;187&nbsp;million a year to get from B to C. That does not include the &#163;93&nbsp;that will have to be paid. Apparently, 70&nbsp;per cent. of it is attributable to the passport, working out at approximately &#163;65&nbsp;for the passport element. I cannot believe that a passport that contains two fingerprint biometrics as well as the facial biometric will be so cheap, given that the Government have already said that the cost will exceed &#163;57.93. Furthermore, the &#163;93&nbsp;that people will pay for the privilege or otherwise of having their details on the national identity register and being forced to have an identity card will not cover the cost of operating and maintaining the verification services. We have had no breakdown of how much of the &#163;584&nbsp;million that would account for; it is an additional cost.

<a name="stpa_305">I am cynical about Government computer systems. I recently served on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which conducted a brief inquiry into the Rural Payments Agency&#039;s computer records system. The initial cost of that system was going to be &#163;37.4&nbsp;million a year, to cover capital and revenue costs. That figure has now risen to &#163;54.3&nbsp;million&#151;an increase of 50&nbsp;per cent. If a database of only 100,000&nbsp;records is costing &#163;50-odd million a year to run, it does not seem sensible that we are going to have to pay only an extra &#163;187&nbsp;million a year to run a massive database of 100&nbsp;million records, which will be interrogated and will have an audit trail&#151;never mind the cost of the security.

<a name="stpa_306">What really frightens me about this scheme is that it will make me feel less secure, rather than more secure.

In America, the biometric passports&#151;which also have just the facial biometric&#151;have radio frequency identity chips so that they can be read without contact. There was a furore there when people realised that anyone could intercept that identity information, and an agreement to allow the scheme to go ahead was reached only because a shield was provided in the cover of each passport to stop the signals being intercepted other than when the cover was opened for the passport to be verified at border controls or for Government purposes.

Even if the system proves 99&nbsp;per cent. accurate, there will still be 48,000&nbsp;false matches in a database of 48&nbsp;million people. It will not be the ordinary citizen who will apply for multiple ID cards using the same biometrics.

<a name="stpa_324">We have heard a lot of hocus-pocus economics this evening. It must be down to my experience in local government, but I always get worried when a report goes into minute detail. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) said, the Minister can pinpoint the cost as &#163;584&nbsp;million a year. But when we start asking the big questions, everything becomes vague and we are told that for reasons of commercial confidentiality the capital costs cannot be revealed. In my experience of local government, that usually means that no one is quite sure how much the scheme will cost at the end of the day. When I encounter that approach, I begin to be wary.

<a name="stpa_325">The Minister, again in answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, said that the capital could either be paid in a lump sum or annualised and added on as running costs. He gave an assurance that it would not be more than the annual running costs according to the present estimate, but if the amount was equal to the running costs the annual cost would double. Will that be added to the fees that the public pay for the card? The Minister gave no indication.

 I did not say that the set-up costs would be absorbed in the &#163;584&nbsp;million; they are additional. The baseline for the UK Passport Service is included in the &#163;584&nbsp;million. I said that the increment&#151;the additional amount in respect of ID cards&#151;was in the region of &#163;200&nbsp;million a year. That is the increment for the annual running costs; the set-up costs will be much less than &#163;584&nbsp;million a year.

 The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak asked how the costs of the scheme would be paid. One of the options was that it would be on an annual leasing basis, but would that be included as part of the cost of the card? If so, the cost of the card would increase.

<a name="60213-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_326">The right hon.

Reference has been made to many public sector schemes this evening, and we are all familiar with the Child Support Agency on which &#163;400&nbsp;million was spent, yet three years on, we are still considering what to do about it. Once the capital investment in the technology was made, it was felt that we had to try to make it work. I suspect that will be the case with the ID card scheme. Once the capital investment has been made, and the scheme is up and running and a large number of people have bought the cards, the argument, regardless of the costs, will be, &quot;Well, we can&#039;t drop it now. People have paid for the cards and we&#039;ve bought the technology, so we&#039;ve got to make it work&quot;. If that means extra costs, that is what will happen.

<a name="stpa_327">The amendment will not put the chocks under the wheels. All it will do is enable us to observe, on a six-monthly basis, the increase in the costs of the scheme.

The amendment will enable us to watch the costs increasing, but we shall be unable to stop the bandwagon rolling. For that reason, I shall not support it.

Nor shall I endorse the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), for reasons that I shall give in a moment.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_328">The Lords amendment is rather too narrowly written. I tabled a new clause on Report that attempted to set out the kind of things that I would expect the Government to produce before they authorised substantial expenditure on such a project. Unfortunately, that new clause was not selected, but it focused first on the fact that the Secretary of State ought to set out properly the reasons for such a proposal. We have seen a number of documents so far that, frankly, make limited reading indeed in explaining why the proposal is a good idea, why it will produce the sort of benefits that have been vaguely referred to and why we should endorse it. I do not share some colleagues&#039; views that the Bill is a terrible threat to civil liberties. I have never thought that. My instinct is that it might be a terrible threat to our public purse. That has been the focus of my concern throughout.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_329">Secondly, I would expect the costs and benefits to be set out in reasonable terms. This is not the time at which one could certainly demonstrate the cost with any authority. As I have remarked in my interventions, frankly, the LSE proposals are based on its own concept of how an ID card system might work. They may be valuable in those terms, but they have no authority since they bear no relationship to what the Government may be attempting to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_330">The Government have set out their ideas in such vague terms that, frankly, it would be impossible for a professional contractor to produce anything other than fairly speculative estimates of how much those ideas might cost. That is why I have remarked on the KPMG report. I do not know how much was spent on it, but to be honest, it will do what most consultants will wisely do: it will cover their bases very carefully and certainly not end up by giving a great deal of authority to a figure that most professionals would say could only be speculative at this time. I suspect that, if the full report were made available, one would probably see those caveats written in rather larger type than in the summary. I would expect the costs and benefits to be produced, but when procurement was about to proceed. That was the point of the new clause that I tabled on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_331">Thirdly, I would want the assumptions behind any savings to be properly set out. I intervened on my hon. Friend the Minister about the buy-in of other stakeholders in the project. I referred particularly to the private sector, but I could equally have touched on the role of other Departments. Even given the rather vague business case that has been produced to date, the private sector obviously has an important role to play. It is understood that the project may be crucial in reducing fraud in our financial system. If so, one might expect that many of our financial institutions would be putting up their hands now, saying &quot;We wholeheartedly endorse this project, and we wish to see it proceed as fast as possible.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_332">I drew my hon. Friend the Minister&#039;s attention to the fact that those statements of faith have, as yet, not been made. When I questioned officials and IT professionals, they gave a rather sunny and optimistic reason for that and suggested that people were waiting for the Bill to be passed and would then dive in very quickly. They genuinely do not know whether they are buying a pig in a poke, exactly what the project involves and what meaning it may have for their businesses. For that reason, they are most unlikely to put a buy-in together. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1233</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I would expect the stakeholders&#151;whether private sector partners or those in other aspects of government, such as the agencies and Departments, which must clearly play a part&#151;to make a much more coherent statement of the benefits when procurement is about to proceed.

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_333">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) referred to the Department of Health, and that is a very good example. We would expect it to participate in the scheme, but I doubt whether it has even the vaguest idea of how the scheme might apply to what it does.Much of the information will be required at some stage in the future. I do not expect the documents that the Government have produced so far to refer to it in detail, but I would expect there to be a point at which we have an opportunity to review the details before further substantial sums of public money are committed.

<a name="stpa_334">I also want a much more rigorous examination of the risks in the project&#151;one or two of them have been touched on in the debate&#151;and how they are likely to be mitigated. Risk mitigation means cost. Dealing with perceived events and working out their likelihood of threatening a project of this kind require steps to improve its security. Such steps may deal only with a one-in-a-million circumstance but, in a project as central as this, a one-in-a-million circumstance may well be what we have to deal with.

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_335">I often remark that our tolerance of error rates for people flying airlines or performing complex surgery is much lower than it would be for someone performing a less critical function. We expect people carrying out high-risk functions to take steps to reduce the risks either through the intervention of technology or additional human support. Those certainly cost money. I am not clear how the risks have been analysed and how costs have been applied to reducing those risks.

<a name="stpa_336">I have described the points that I would like to have seen covered but, unfortunately, the Lords amendment is rather more narrowly drawn. If they choose to consider what happens tonight, they may want to reflect on that should they return the issue to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_337">I have already referred to the importance of transparency for all our benefit in the project. A number of reports have been pulled together by agencies outside and inside government to assist us in judging whether it is the right thing to do. We have had the KPMG report. Although I would not want to read it in considerable detail, its full publication would have been helpful to us at this time. The Office of Government Commerce gateway process that the project will go through on a number of occasions at various points in its life also provides a useful indication of risk. One of its major focuses is to say what risks have been anticipated in the running of the project and how we might deal with them. From the little glimpse that some civil servants kindly gave me the last time the process was carried out, it is not surprising that it is regarded as extremely high risk with a number of flashing amber lights indicating that steps need to be taken to deal with possible failure in the future. That would not surprise anyone, but it would be useful to have the risks more clearly defined so that we can understand them and can start to put money towards dealing with them.

 Whatever the figure is. The right hon. Gentleman has not been present for this debate, but he will know that I have cast doubt on all the estimates that have been made. That is one of them.

<p>
<a name="60213-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_339">People in the industry are keen, but I think that they share my concern at the rather muddled presentation and the possibility that it will lead to a complex and poor quality specification that will not necessarily get the buy-in of all the critical players. That is at the root of failed IT projects. I shall not go down the route taken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, who chose to cast a great deal of blame on IT companies. Of course, they fail and do things wrong. However, the critical thing that normally goes wrong in such projects happens right at the start. It is necessary to get the specification of what is being done absolutely straight before driving the project through with narrow-minded rigour. A critical test is thus the quality of project management, which would indicate whether costs could be managed effectively. However, although I have met one or two of the people involved in the project, I have seen no evidence to date of the rigorous project management disciplines that would be required to deliver a project that was a tenth as difficult as the identity card scheme will be.

<a name="stpa_340">For the reasons that I have outlined, I take no great comfort from the debate. I have given all these pieces of advice in private, so it is a little sad to find that little progress appears to have been made. I am surprised that the Government have chosen to support the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras because while I accept the caveats that have been cited about the possibility of evading various responsibilities due to the amendment, the provision will give rise to a process of terrible Chinese water torture because some poor Minister will have to produce a report every six months. The Minister might well say, &quot;I can&#039;t reveal them this and can&#039;t tell them that,&quot; but the reports will prompt ongoing repetitive debate on the merits and purpose of the scheme. I am not worried about that, but I am puzzled by the Government&#039;s insistence on taking that route to reassure people about the project, rather than the route that I would have commended, which would be a more rigorous attempt to nail things down right at the start. That remains my preferred strategy, so I still hope that the Government will adopt it. I am sad that I will not be able to give the Government my support on these matters tonight.

<p><a name="st_380"><a name="60213-36_spnew2"><b> Stewart Hosie: </b> 
 I want to take the Minister back to his opening remarks when he mentioned fraud worth &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion. Such fraud is central to the debate because it determines whether the Bill is a proportionate response to the problem. I have no doubt that the figure 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1235</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion was put in the public domain to give the impression that when the ID card system was fully deployed in the public and private sectors, a problem of such magnitude could be resolved, but I question that assertion. I also wish to focus on the fraud because it is the only argument in favour of the identity card scheme that the Government have consistently used from the outset&#151;they abandoned all their other justifications at various points along the way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_341">There are many components to the &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion figure. Although I will not bore the House by going through them all, I shall outline several because it is genuinely important that I make this case. The Association of British Insurers says that the estimate of financial loss due to identity fraud is &#163;22&nbsp;million. If the biometric system and ID cards are to tackle such fraud in the insurance system, every insurance policy will have to be linked to a biometric card and its holder. Every time an assessor checks water or fire damage against a policy, the holder&#039;s biometric card will have to be verified so that there is a link between the person, the card and the policy. That is the only way in which the scheme could help to tackle fraud in the insurance system, but the process would be expensive, and no doubt the full cost of it would be passed on from the insurers to the citizen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_342">The Association for Payment Clearing Services says that &#163;504.8&nbsp;million is lost due to plastic cards being used by criminals who are not their rightful owners. It has been said several times that the cost of fraud due to payments made when a card is not present is &#163;150&nbsp;million. If a person buys a plane or cinema ticket with a plastic card, both that card and the ID card could be presented at the aircraft or cinema for checking to prove that the person had made the purchase. However, if people buy goods by mail order that are simply delivered by a man with a white van, the scheme will provide no assistance whatsoever because goods can be delivered when people are not at home and the man is not going to have a biometric scanner in the cab of his van. That part of the &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion figure cannot be dealt with by the biometric register or the identity card.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_343">According to the Building Societies Association, &#163;3.1&nbsp;million is lost to identity fraud, but the same applies to building societies as it does to insurers. Every building society account would have to be linked to a person with a biometric profile and every time a transaction on that account took place, fraudulent or otherwise, the person involved would have to verify their card against the central database and the central database against their account. That is the only way in which the proposed system could prevent fraud in the building societies sector, but it would be disproportionate and highly expensive, and the full costs would be passed on to the citizen and the customer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_344">CIFAS, the UK&#039;s fraud prevention service, says that the cost of identity fraud to the retail sector is &#163;2.3&nbsp;million. Much of that involves stolen cards being used in corner shops or supermarkets. It is inconceivable that there would be a biometric scanner at every till in Sainsbury&#039;s or Tesco&#039;s or&#151;even worse&#151;at the till in every corner shop. It is unlikely that the biometric register and the ID card could tackle that type of retail without placing a massive cost burden on the consumer and the citizen.

The police will need portable scanners in their police cars, and insurance assessors likewise. The costs of all that would be fully passed on to the consumer.

From the very beginning of this debate four or five years ago, it was made clear in the Government White Paper and the consultation document that the Government did not want to consult on&#151;indeed, they did not even countenance&#151;the introduction of an ID card that people must carry at all times. Some European countries require the carrying of ID cards, but that option was excluded from the start. I do not believe that the police should be able to stop people and ask them for details of biometrics or anything else for which they cannot already ask.
</p>





<p><a name="st_390"><a name="60213-37_spnew7"><b> Mr. Sadiq Khan  (Tooting) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend said that some people were concerned about civil liberties. There are anxieties that the amount of information on the register that is limited under schedule 1&nbsp;to name, date of birth, place of birth, gender and address will creep up and increase. Can he confirm that before additional information is included in the register primary legislation must be introduced?
</p>





<p><a name="st_391"><a name="60213-37_spnew8"><b> Martin Linton: </b> 
 That is my understanding. Only six items of personal information will be included on the register&#151;name, address, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality and, for people from overseas, information about their work permit. The legislation does not allow any further information to be added to the register. I believe one or two items should be added to ID cards, including organ donor information and medical information which, in an emergency, could make the difference between life and death. However, even that information, which could save someone&#039;s life in hospital, cannot legally be added to the register.
</p>





<p><a name="st_392"><a name="60213-37_spnew9"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 May I clarify something in response to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler)? I can confirm that the Bill does not extend police powers, as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) rightly said. It would only provide power of identification in the case of arrest, but obviously the police already have such a power. The Bill does not create the situation feared by

<br>&nbsp;<br>my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South, but it would ease police bureaucracy in the case of ascertaining identity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_393"><a name="60213-37_spnew10"><b> Martin Linton: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that reassurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_356">The total quantified financial benefits are estimated by the Home Office&#151;anyone is welcome to challenge the figures, but it is significant that in six hours of debate few Members have chosen to do so&#151;to be &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion. That figure, as I said, was agreed with the banks and the organisations that will use the scheme. More than half the expected savings are expected to come from savings on ID fraud alone, and they will amount to &#163;570&nbsp;million. The more efficient running of public services will account for &#163;385&nbsp;million&#151;&#163;85&nbsp;million from the reduction in crime and only &#163;39&nbsp;million from the reduction in immigration offences.
</p>





<p><a name="st_394"><a name="60213-37_spnew11"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 The database will be an active database containing the audit trail and a record of every time the verification service is used. Does that not cause my hon. Friend concern? With reference to the question from our hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler), the police will not need to access the card if they have readers, because the person will be present and they will be able to check the biometrics against the register.
</p>





<p><a name="st_395"><a name="60213-37_spnew12"><b> Martin Linton: </b> 
 As I understand it, the organisations that seek verification from the register will be able to do so only with the consent of the individual, and they will get verification only of the details that they give. Only the police and the security services, when investigating a crime, will be able to get the audit trail. I am happy to be corrected by my hon. Friend the Minister if that is wrong. The audit trail is available for the investigation of crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_357">We should concentrate on the massive cost of identity fraud, which has increased, as we know from last week&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_396"><a name="60213-37_spnew13"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman was asked by the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) whether he could confirm that schedule 1&nbsp;could be altered only by way of primary legislation. He confirmed that that was the case. Has he considered the effect of clause 3(5), which states:

<a name="stpa_359">Does he wish to reconsider the answer that he gave to his hon. Friend?
</p>





<p><a name="st_397"><a name="60213-37_spnew14"><b> Martin Linton: </b> 
 I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will intervene if I am wrong. At the very least, the subsection that the hon. Gentleman quotes is an indication that the schedule could not be changed without the approval of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_360">All hon. Members must know someone who has had their card stolen and their identity stolen, perhaps by someone going through rubbish and picking out their credit card numbers. That is one of the fastest growing crimes. Quite apart from the effect on the individual whose identity is stolen, the average time taken to sort 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1240</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>out the financial problems caused by identity theft is 60&nbsp;hours, and in some cases goes up to 240&nbsp;hours. Individuals who are victims of identity crime may be compensated by the banks, which are held responsible, but the banks must recover their costs from us in bank charges. The average person in the UK pays at least &#163;25&nbsp;or &#163;30&nbsp;a year through bank charges to cover the cost of ID fraud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_361">Wednesday sees the introduction of chip and pin to make savings on fraud, but the savings to be made from reducing ID fraud through the ID card are far greater. If those who make the cost argument were to succeed, they would have to argue that the cost of the card is nearly 10&nbsp;times higher than the Home Office says. All the indications are that the costs of ID fraud are rising. The benefits of curbing it are likely to be higher. The Minister announced from the Home Office this week that the cost to the country of ID fraud has increased from &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion to &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion.

: In the time assigned to me, I shall make two points. I am delighted to say that having been a critic on the basis of the costs of the exercise, I find myself in agreement with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. We will look carefully at the figures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_362">My second point is about a matter on which I feel strongly. I am sure that my hon. Friends the Ministers will listen, as I have lobbied them in the past. It is a great shame that we have not reached the Liberal Democrat amendment on accessibility. There is an issue that is not financial in terms of costs and benefits, but concerns how individuals can be persuaded to take up biometric passports, and ID cards in due course, and that relates to the need for people to be able to get easily to places where they can give their biometric details. I would argue strongly that only one body meets that requirement, and that is the Post Office. I have lobbied Ministers on this and I make no apology for finishing this particular set of debates on that&#151;

<a name="time_29">
<a name="60213-41_time0"><h5>10.46&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_414"><a name="60213-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robert Syms  (Poole) (Con):</b> 
 This is not the first time that I have debated local government finance in Poole; it probably will not be the last, since we have a perennial problem with the shortage of funding from central Government. It does not seem to matter what system is invented by the people in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, we always seem to come out very much at the bottom end of the table. So whether it is the standard spending assessment, the formula spending share or the new system, Poole does not seem to be doing very well out of the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_379">This year, the total Government grant increase is the minimum, which is 2&nbsp;per cent. The unitary authority average, against which I shall compare during this short debate, is 2.8&nbsp;per cent. Our total formula grant will be &#163;22.8&nbsp;million, which provides funding of a little under &#163;167&nbsp;per head. The unitary average is &#163;330. That difference is worth nearly &#163;22.3&nbsp;million&#151;a substantial sum that could make a significant difference to the quality of services delivered to my constituents in Poole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_380">I will not go into too much technical detail&#151;not least because the new funding system, with its four blocks, is a little more difficult break into and break down when trying to find out the reasons why the grant is at a certain level&#151;but the finance officers in Poole certainly feel very disappointed with the new system, which they think is complex and rather less transparent than the older system. The Minister might acknowledge the fact that the Local Government Association and others have criticised the new system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_381">None of the 150&nbsp;education or social services authorities is receiving what the formula grant needs and resources calculation determines: 70&nbsp;of them are at the floor and gaining more&#151;including Poole, which is getting an extra &#163;323&nbsp;per head&#151;and 80&nbsp;are having their grant reduced or dampened to ensure that they all receive a minimum grant increase. That fact indicates that the formula system does not work, and there are real concerns about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_382">What special issues do we have in Poole? Wages are certainly low. The average weekly wage for full-time workers resident in Poole was &#163;448.50&#151;86.4&nbsp;per cent. of the average for England&#151;but that contrasts with house prices, which are particularly high. The average selling price of all houses sold in Poole in 2004&nbsp;was just over 10&nbsp;times the average annual full-time income. That big gap has a great impact on the local authority&#039;s finances and recruitment. The population is ageing. Compared with the rest of the country, a smaller proportion of Poole&#039;s population is found in all five age bands under 50&nbsp;and a greater proportion in all age bands over 50, across both sexes. Currently, about 54,500&nbsp;people in Poole are aged 50-plus, which represents 40&nbsp;per cent. of the population. Although, when one looks at the Sunday papers, one occasionally sees fabulous houses for sale at extortionate prices, that is not typical of Poole. It might be typical of one or two areas but, along with the areas of wealth, there are areas of great deprivation, including some wards that show up as being very deprived.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the continuing poor settlement year after year along with exactly the same cost pressures, such as the increasing wages that are a big component of local government expenditure, inevitably means that there have to be cuts in sectors in which costs are rising steeply? For example, there are cuts across the board, including cuts in social and respite care in social services. Does he share my concern that our constituents will lose out big time if this continues year after year?
</p>





<p><a name="st_416"><a name="60213-41_spnew2"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Lady with whom I share representation of the borough of Poole. Both the Conservative and Liberal groups have a common front in trying to get a better grant for Poole. Both parties feel that we are not being very well treated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_386">The council is looking to make significant efficiencies in next year&#039;s budget, and it is expecting to make them beyond the Gershon review. I am fortunate to be able to say that, although the council&#039;s final decision will be made on 16&nbsp;February, it is looking as though there will be a 3.5&nbsp;per cent. increase. Such an increase takes a lot of hard work and one way that the council was able to introduce an increase of that level despite bad funding from central Government is by keeping high vacancy levels and controlling staffing to increase its balances. It keeps control in that way. It is very much aware that our profile of an elderly population means that many people on fixed incomes find it difficult to meet a substantial part of their budget, so it is doing all that it can to minimise the tax burden on local people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_387">Poole people get significantly less Government funding and there are the whole range of costs that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) mentioned. We expect annual pay settlements to go up by 3&nbsp;per cent. and there are additional recruitment and retention pressures. The changes to advance corporation tax have had a big impact on local authority pensions, and Poole local authority workers are mainly part of the Dorset pension scheme that has suffered and requires more money. Waste management, street cleansing, licensing, highway maintenance and the EU hazardous waste directive present further costs, and the council is also looking at paying, with an increase this year, about &#163;1.2&nbsp;million in landfill tax that eventually goes back to the Treasury. They are very real costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-41_para10">
<a name="stpa_388">Let us contrast and compare where we are. Fortunately, Poole is not at the bottom of the list of all-purpose authorities. That place is taken by Wokingham, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which is preceded by Windsor and Maidenhead, Rutland and then Poole. Poole&#039;s formula grant per head is &#163;166.53. Of course, there are no doubt different circumstances in the all-purpose unitary authorities, but let us consider a few boroughs that may have a similar profile to Poole. For example, I know that my colleagues in Bournemouth next door do not think that they are very well funded, but it receives &#163;293.61, which is &#163;127&nbsp;more than Poole. Some of the streets in Poole stop where those in Bournemouth start, and there are probably slightly more people on benefit in Bournemouth because there are more hostels there. However, the difference is substantial when it is sometimes difficult to tell whether one is in Poole or in Bournemouth.

<a name="stpa_389">I guess that Torbay&#039;s profile&#151;it is a seaside and retirement area&#151;is not dissimilar to that of Poole. The formula grant per head in Torbay is &#163;328.01, which is &#163;161&nbsp;more than Poole. I suspect that Brighton and Hove faces many issues similar to those faced in the Bournemouth and Poole area, but it gets &#163;385.29. We are very much adrift from many comparable authorities.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I know how hard he works on behalf of his constituents, and he is raising an important issue. Has he not just highlighted the fact that one of the big problems with local government finance is that the system is simply not transparent? No one really understands how the Government work out the formula funding.
</p>





<p><a name="st_418"><a name="60213-42_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. I must urge hon. Members not to widen the debate, which is quite clearly on local government funding for Poole. If Adjournment debates get extended due to general interventions, the Minister replying to the hon. Member who has secured the debate sometimes ends up with insufficient time to do so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_419"><a name="60213-42_spnew1"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 Of course the problem that my hon. Friend highlights applies to Poole. When local authority officers in the borough of Poole examine how the grant is calculated, it is difficult for them to work out why we do so badly. If we had a better idea of how the grant was calculated, perhaps we could more effectively make representations to try to put the situation right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-42_para0">
<a name="stpa_390">Let me touch on this year&#039;s dedicated schools grant. The Minister&#039;s constituency goes across two London boroughs: Tower Hamlets and Newham. The dedicated schools grant for Tower Hamlets is &#163;5,610&nbsp;a pupil and Newham receives &#163;4,526&nbsp;a pupil. Poole receives a dedicated schools grants of &#163;3,349&nbsp;a pupil. A secondary school with 1,600&nbsp;pupils in Tower Hamlets would thus receive &#163;8.976&nbsp;million, while such a school in Poole would receive &#163;5.3&nbsp;million. I know that there are specific problems in Tower Hamlets, such as linguistic problems, and I do not wish to do down the Minister&#039;s constituency, but the gap is large and I hope that the Government will start to do something about it.

<a name="60213-42_para1">
<a name="stpa_391">The precept of Poole borough council is not the only worry.

It has real problems and estimates that a &#163;1&nbsp;million pension shortfall will have to be met by council tax payers. There is pressure from all directions on my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_392">We in Poole have done our best over the years to make our case. Delegations have been to see Ministers, and Baroness Andrews cordially received me, the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, Dr. Brian Leverett, who is the leader of the council, and Mr. Mike Brooke, who is leader of the Liberal Democrats on the council, when we went to lobby her. We invited her to come to look at Poole so that she could see that we needed more grant. I hope that the Minister or one of his colleagues will come to Poole to see our problems and not only the wealthy parts, but some of the deprived areas, because we do not think that they are being addressed by the grant that we are receiving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-42_para3">
<a name="stpa_393">There is a sense of grievance in Poole. What we get puts us very much at the bottom of the league, although that does not mean that all our outputs are bad, as can be seen from our provision for schools and the way in which the council conducts its business. The council has been a good authority for several years and has attracted good officers. However, a council has to work much harder when its funding is low. When Poole&#039;s situation is compared with that of Bournemouth and other south-coast authorities with similar problems, one sees that we are badly treated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_394">I know that the grant is fixed for this year and that nothing can be done about it following last week&#039;s votes.

I appreciate that many of the points raised in the debate by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) were made and reinforced by the delegation from Poole that met Baroness Andrews on 11&nbsp;January. Let me assure hon.

That represents increases over the next two years of 4.5&nbsp;per cent. and 5&nbsp;per cent. respectively. Of those totals, &#163;24.8&nbsp;billion and &#163;25.6&nbsp;billion will be grant that is distributed as formula grant, which provides above-inflation increases of 3&nbsp;per cent. and 3.7&nbsp;per cent. respectively.

<a name="60213-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_397">To get a fuller picture of the Government grant available to Poole, we should include in the comparison the dedicated schools grant, since funding for schools was included in the formula grant in 2005&#150;06. Including schools funding, Poole will receive grant increases of 5.8&nbsp;per cent. in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 4.3&nbsp;per cent. in 2007&#150;08. In total we will provide specific grants amounting to &#163;37.3&nbsp;billion and &#163;39.4&nbsp;billion over the next two years. That is a key element of the overall picture, particularly as those specific grant totals include funding for schools&#151;the Government&#039;s No.1&nbsp;priority. We have also been able to provide a two-year settlement for the supporting people grant programme, with &#163;1.685&nbsp;billion allocated for 2006&#150;07, and we have so far announced allocations of 95&nbsp;per cent. of the grant for 2007&#150;08.

That builds upon the work we have been doing over the past few years in freezing grant formulae and allocating specific grants in advance. We have now announced two-year individual allocations of formula grant for every authority; and more than 90&nbsp;per cent. of all specific grants that can be allocated in advance have been allocated for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08.

In the interests of further stability, we have made grant floors a permanent part of the grant distribution system. Floors guarantee a minimum year-on-year grant increase and curb the volatility of grant levels for individual local authorities. Poole has benefited from the grant floor in both 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, which has ensured that it will receive a reasonable increase in grant in each of these years.

<a name="60213-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_400">The hon. Gentleman was concerned about the calculation of the formula grant. This year, we have reformed the grant calculation system. The new system has the advantage of removing the old assumptions about spending and tax from the calculation of grant. As a result, it devolves more accountability to local authorities. Many authorities have said that they find the new system difficult to understand. I readily concede that it is still complex. However, in the past we have found that local authorities were concerned that simplifying the grant calculation would, in their view, reduce the fairness and the responsiveness of the system. Our policy therefore is to make the system simpler.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_401">For the present, the new system is simpler in principle. Grant distribution is now determined by four things: a relative needs formula, an amount relative to the resources that can be raised locally based on the property profile, a central allocation per head and grant damping. The relative needs and resource elements should be broadly familiar to the hon. Gentleman, since the system has long contained formulaic estimates of relative need and relative ability to raise council tax.

<a name="60213-43_para1">
<a name="stpa_403">The hon. Gentleman raised issues about the funding formula. To work out each council&#039;s share of formula grant, we need first to calculate the relative needs formulae, which include information on the population, social structure and other characteristics of each authority. Each of the main services provided by councils has its own relative needs formula. There are seven formulae in all for children&#039;s services, adult social services, police, fire, highways maintenance, environmental, protective and cultural services, and capital finance. The formulae assess the relative need for a particular service in each area based on the characteristics of the area.

<a name="stpa_404">The hon. Member for Poole suggested that the funding formulae do not recognise the significant pockets of deprivation within Poole. However, most of the funding formulae take account of the relative levels of deprivation in each area. For example, in calculating Poole&#039;s relative need for children&#039;s social care, we take account of the proportion of local children in income support households and the proportion of working age adults who claim income support. To calculate the relative needs formula for environmental, protective and cultural services, we take account of rates of incapacity benefit, income support and other unemployment related benefits in each area. It is wrong to say that the funding formulae ignore deprivation factors in Poole or elsewhere. In fact, our formulae take detailed account of the relative levels of deprivation in each local authority area.

<a name="stpa_405">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the higher than average number of ageing people in Poole places a greater strain on social services. However, that is taken into account in the older people&#039;s social services funding formula, which is based on the number of pensioners in each area, their levels of deprivation and the proportion of very old people living in each area. The Government are committed to ensuring that local authorities can deliver effective local services without needing to impose excessive increases in council tax.

: I, too, am grateful for the proposed visit by the Minister for Local Government. Is there any work on the methodology of the area cost adjustment to take account of the special characteristic in Poole and Dorset of high house prices and low average salaries?

 I can assure the hon. Lady, notwithstanding representations that she has made with local colleagues, as well as representations by the local authority, that there is an ongoing assessment of the area cost adjustment and all the factors involved. In reaching the local government financial settlement for each area, the Department bases its calculations on all the evidence presented by its own sources and, indeed, by local authority sources. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Poole, a dialogue is under way. There is continual assessment and reassessment, and any evidence or information that is presented is taken into account and assessed. Conclusions are reached by civil servants, and final submissions are made to Ministers, who make announcements to the House. We are open to representations and so on. Some people may think that certain factors are not taken into account, but I can assure the hon. Lady that all representations are considered very seriously.

<a name="stpa_406">We have worked closely with the Local Government Association to look at the pressures that councils will face in the next two years, and the ways in which central and local government can manage those pressures. We accept that there are pressures on councils, especially waste management and social services, which is why we have provided an extra &#163;305&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;508&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;in formula grant above what was previously planned. We are satisfied that the settlement following the spending review 2004, coupled with the significant extra investment that we have made

<a name="stpa_407">We have agreed to work jointly with local government in a number of areas. We will work with the Local Government Association to take account of pressures, and we will focus on pay, adult social care and waste in the context of the 2007&nbsp;comprehensive spending review. We will introduce a strengthened new burdens procedure, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to discuss new burdens with local government as well as the measures to mitigate them. I understand the concerns of people in Poole, particularly of pensioners on fixed incomes and others on low incomes who are worried that the settlement may impose another large increase in council tax for the next two years. There is no need for them to be anxious but, given the average 3.4&nbsp;per cent. increase in formula grant until 2007&#150;08&nbsp;that Poole has received since 1997, residents are right to express dismay at the persistently high council tax increases imposed on them and the proposed increase for the forthcoming year.

<a name="stpa_408">Given the Government&#039;s significant extra investment in public services and the scope for efficiency improvements, it is unacceptable for local authorities to set large increases in council tax. The average council tax increases in both 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, as we have said, should be less than 5&nbsp;per cent. We have made it clear that we are prepared to use our powers to cap any excessive council tax increases, and we have done so in the past two years.

<p>
<a name="60213-43_para7">
<a name="stpa_409">In conclusion, I can assure the hon. Member for Poole, his colleagues and his constituents that I understand fully the points he has raised today. We have provided a good settlement overall, and, given the significant investment in local services, we believe local authorities can and should deliver council tax rises below 5&nbsp;per cent. in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. I will alert my hon. Friend the Minister of State to matters raised in this debate before his visit to Poole next month.
