 It may help the House if I give it the actual facts, rather than the partial presentation given by the hon. Gentleman. In 1997, the UK Government had 242 overseas posts. In 2007, there were 261. In the past 10 years, the number of overseas posts has increased by 19 by any calculation.</p>

By no stretch of the imagination is it possible to argue that the UK&#146;s influence in Africa is lower today than it was 10 years ago. In fact, it is massively enhanced. There has been cross-party agreement about the activities of the Government on this issue over the past 10 years.</p>

 The most important criterion is that the Foreign Office&#146;s network is aligned to the shape of the modern world rather than the world as it was after 1945. There has already been a 20 or 25 per cent. reduction in the number of personnel deployed in Europe, which in part reflects the amount of extra business done in UKRep&#151;the UK Permanent Representation to the European Union&#151;in Brussels and the multilateral engagement that we have. I see that continuing, with the shifting of more of our diplomats&#151;UK staff and locally engaged staff&#151;towards the middle east and south Asia, where, by any stretch of the imagination, we need more representations to meet all the national interests that we have at the moment. That seems to me to be the alignment of people and priorities that we should be seeking.</p>

 Of course, in most of Africa DFID and FCO staff work side by side.

 The Foreign Secretary has been somewhat creative with his figures in respect of embassies, high commissions and consulates. He says that their numbers reflect how the world is changing, so I presume that the closure of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office language school and the withdrawal of the FCO&#146;s contribution to the cost of maintaining defence attach&#233;s are also connected with that. Do not the figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) have more to do with financial cuts imposed by the Treasury than with any changes in the nature of the world? After all, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs has said that the Foreign Office budget will see a reduction of 5.1 per cent. per annum across the board and that that will jeopardise its work. Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us how many more embassies, high commissions and consulates have been identified for closure over the next two years to pay for those cuts?</p>

 It is very odd to define increased spending as cuts. The increased spending over the next period will be used in the areas of greatest need. Moreover, it is right that we do not use defence attach&#233;s for non-defence work, as they are specialists and should work on defence matters. The hon. Gentleman accuses me of creative accounting, or at least creative number work, but he may be interested to know that Germany has 226 posts, the US 262 and France 275. The UK holds a diplomatic network of outstandingly qualified individuals who work closely with DFID and British Council staffs. They provide a network that, in times of crisis, has shown itself to be more than adequate for the country&#146;s needs. I am sure that he will seek to criticise the Government about many things, but I believe that we should all be proud of the  nature of our global network and its deployment around the world.</p>

Progress must also be made through other organisations, such as the G8, the World Bank and the UN, but the EU is a crucial component in any international climate change strategy.</p>

 The UK is the first and so far the only country to have set binding targets for reducing carbon emissions. We are leading the way in Europe and throughout the world, but carbon emissions can be reduced only through international co-operation. We cannot set up a patriotic front against climate change, as such change does not recognise the national boundaries and borders that the right hon. Gentleman seems to believe in. In fact, I understand that he opposes the binding targets on carbon emissions.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not mind my saying so, but the basic premise of his assertion is absolutely correct. The problem in the past was that there was not enough international co-operation and countries set their own targets in a way that did not fit international priorities or the scale of the problem. Over the next 30 years, if we continue at the current pace, international and world energy demand will increase by a remarkable 50 per cent. That is clearly unsustainable, which is why there is a real need for internationally agreed binding targets of the type that the United Kingdom was first in the world to agree to.</p>

It is therefore the intention of the British Council to remain open and operational in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The independence of the British Council is asserted on both sides of the House. Certainly it is not a political football from our point of view, and our message to the Russian Government is that they should not use the British Council as a political football. I hope that that can be a united message, because 1.25 million Russians benefited from the activities of the British Council last year, and that must be in both our countries&#146; interests.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. The first thing to say is that, while a threat was issued on 12 December, it has not yet been carried out. Our first priority is to send a clear message to the Russians that this is illegal and there is nothing to be gained by them&#151;in fact, there is everything to be lost, in terms of services for Russian people and of the reputation of Russia around the world&#151;in carrying out this threat. Certainly, my conversations with European and other G8 colleagues suggest that there is unanimous incomprehension at the proposal of the Russian Government to crack down on the British Council. Our duty of care to our staff is obviously something that we take seriously and the offices are in the first instance a matter for British Council management. I assure my hon.

 Is not the really worrying thing about the Russian ban on the British Council outside Moscow the fact that it is far from the first time that the Russians have tried to undermine the work of the British Council in Russia, and that it is not the only non-governmental organisation in Russia that has been systematically undermined by its Government in the past few years? Is it not important that we continue to be robust, not least now that Mr. Lugovoi has been elected a member of the Duma?

My hon. Friend has spent a lot of time on the issue. He is, of course, absolutely right. The shocking quotation that he read out should indeed be denounced. I will just pick up two of the points that he made. First, let us not yet talk about Russian actions. There have been threats, but there have not yet been actions against the British Council outside Moscow, and we should continue to urge the Russian Government not to take any actions. Secondly, we need to continue to give the Russian Government the clear message that we will continue to take the Lugovoi issue seriously; the request for his extradition remains in force, and it remains a commitment of ours to see justice done in this country. At the same time, we are determined to work with Russia on a range of international and bilateral issues. We must continue to make that twin-track message clear.</p>

 It is important that we remember that in the last years of Saddam Hussein&#146;s rule, he had six women murdered in Basra.

It was a brutal regime and it has been a brutal history. My hon. Friend, who knows a great deal about the subject, is right about dress codes. One has only to visit the middle east to witness how differently dress codes are interpreted across the region. It is a mystery to those of us who go there and ask, &#147;If the dress code is interpreted in that way in one country, why should it be so strictly interpreted in another?&#148; I hope that our dialogue with countries in the middle east will help them understand the concern that we feel at the fact that human beings are treated in that way as a consequence of their mode of dress.</p>

 Across the House, we are united in deploring the rocket attacks against Israel and any attacks on UN peacekeepers, as the Foreign Secretary said, and also in intensifying the pressure on Iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment programme and return to negotiations. The Foreign Secretary gave a welcome assurance in November that he had agreed with the other members of the Security Council that a new UN resolution, imposing sanctions on Iran, would quickly be introduced unless Javier Solana reported a positive outcome to his discussions. Mr. Solana reported no such positive outcome, yet no UN resolution has been agreed so far as we know. Will the Foreign Secretary assure the House that it is postponed rather than abandoned?</p>

I can confirm to the right hon. Gentleman that intensive work is going on among all six Governments, designed to take forward a resolution on a unanimous basis.

General Mohan told me that although the security situation of course remains difficult&#151;some of that was discussed earlier this afternoon&#151;he is confident that Iraqi security forces have the capacity to take their work forward. I very much hope that the unity that he called for&#151;on security issues, economic reconstruction and political reconciliation&#151;can bring unity across the House on how we move forward on the issue of Iraq, even though I understand that there will never be unity on the original decision five years ago.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has long made important contributions on this issue, and he is right to highlight the discrepancy between the agreed intended size of the AU-UN force and its current size. I spoke to the UN Secretary-General over the Christmas and new year break, because of the difficulties in Pakistan, and was able to register the importance of the issue. The mission in New York is also taking it forward. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will also agree that, in parallel to the work to ensure that the force, with the right equipment, is on the ground in Darfur, we must pursue the work to bolster the comprehensive peace agreement, which has brought three years of peace between north and south, but needs to be taken forward further. I hope that the political track, as well as the military track, can be taken forward in 2008.</p>

My hon. Friend asks what difference the visit will make. I very much hope that it will continue to focus the attention of the world on the need for far more work to be put in on the middle east peace process, which has been a desultory process for far too long.

 Further to his answer to the right hon.

While I recognise that our own armed forces are in need of more helicopters, particularly in Afghanistan, what is the British Government doing to ensure that UNAMID has the 24 helicopters that it was promised?

 I again welcome the hon. Gentleman to his post, and to his first Foreign Affairs questions. He rightly raises a detailed point about helicopters. Of course, the pressure on helicopter numbers is reflected not just in Afghanistan but in Chad, where an important French drive is taking place. The hon. Gentleman asked how we were taking discussions about this forward, and I can assure him that in NATO, in the EU and at the UN, strong diplomatic representations are being made at the political and official level. He referred to the calls already being made on British forces, and he will know that although it is easy to talk about deploying one or two helicopters, to do that requires significant numbers of staff in support. It is a complex matter, but I strongly share the hon.

Bali conference, where my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Minister for the Environment played a critical role in the last hours of the negotiations in securing an agreement. It is not a final global deal on climate change, but it includes for the first time commitments for all countries to be engaged in emissions reduction. Secondly, it specifies 25 per cent. to 40 per cent. cuts in emissions by the developed nations that were signatories to Kyoto by 2020. I think that that provides a basis for serious negotiations over the next two years. Perhaps the greatest thing achieved in Bali was the setting of a deadline for those negotiations, of December 2009&#151;the last date by which we need an agreement if there is not to be a gap when the current Kyoto commitments lapse in 2012.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80108-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08010880000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to promote the donation of cord blood from women after giving birth; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08010880000157">Given that I have six children, I should be declaring an interest in the subject of the Bill. My constituency is adjacent to Barnet general hospital, one of only four NHS hospitals that collect umbilical cord blood. That would seem to be a good reason for developing an interest, but we have not donated umbilical cord blood despite six opportunities to do so at a nearby hospital. Like most parents throughout the United Kingdom, we were not informed of the value of cord blood or the possibility of collection. Until recently I did not consider the umbilical cord, once clamped after birth, as anything more than a waste product. The first purpose of the Bill, and of my speech, is to encourage parents and the wider public to be more informed about the value and benefits of umbilical cord blood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08010880000158">Hon. Members may be ignorant, as I was, of the nature of cord blood. The baby&#146;s blood in the cord contains different types of cell, including stem cells. Cord blood has been used for the last 20 years for blood transplantation. It has treated patients with leukaemia, sickle-cell diseases, immune deficiencies and other diseases: there have been 85 treatments to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08010880000159">There are possible treatments in the pipeline beyond blood therapy. Trials for the use of cord blood in brain injury in children are under way and cord blood is being developed for many other therapies, including diabetes and liver therapy. Treatment for leukaemia highlights the particular value of cord blood transplants, which can be used as an alternative to bone marrow transplants. Such cord blood transplants are less complicated, with fewer delays, and more readily available, as they can be stored and frozen for many years. Significantly, it is easier to find a match from stem cells than from bone marrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08010880000160">Umbilical cord blood collection leads to increased access to transplantation, particularly for patients from ethnic minorities. The reality is that umbilical cord blood, which is thrown away routinely after birth, has a life-saving value. Becki Josiah contacted me after her daughter Billie died from leukaemia in April 2006. She was ill for two years and awaiting a bone marrow transplant. A major difficulty for the Josiah family  was their daughter&#146;s mixed-race background. As Mrs. Josiah said to me,</p>
<a name="80108-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08010880000161"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Mixed-race individuals have a much lower chance of receiving a match in bone marrow donations and cord blood donation gives them another vital chance at a cure.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08010880000162">The Bill attempts to increase the chances of a cure for families such as the Josiah&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08010880000163">Mrs. Josiah has also highlighted the limitations on donation. She recently had another baby and wanted to donate her newborn baby&#146;s cord blood to help cure a child with leukaemia, like her daughter. However, her family does not live near one of the four NHS hospitals with facilities to accept her donation. As she said, it was not possible for her blood to</p>
<a name="80108-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08010880000164"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;go to another family to help spare them the agony of losing someone they love.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08010880000165">Successful treatment is possible for one&#146;s own blood, a sibling&#146;s or that of an unrelated patient. We must find a way of enabling more patients to access this source of treatment, and my Bill takes some steps in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08010880000166">My interest in umbilical cord blood arose when as a member of the Joint Committee I scrutinised the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. Our remit was focused on the Government&#146;s approach, which is to ensure that the UK is at the forefront of scientific development in embryonic stem cell research. A majority of public money supports embryonic research compared with other stem cell sources. The House will no doubt have the opportunity soon, with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, to debate whether it is wise to move into the realms of interspecies  research to deal with the limited number of embryonic stem cell lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08010880000167">As well as the political hurdles, there are ethical and biological hurdles in the way of the Government marching us up to the top of the hill of embryonic research. It is therefore timely to consider an alternative hill of stem cell research. The terrain is the same: wanting the UK to be at the forefront of bringing stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine to the clinic in order to relieve suffering and reduce health care costs. With the help of this Bill, the focus would be on core blood stem cell therapy, which already results in treatment of diseases. Research in the field holds out an exciting future; notably Professor Colin McGuckin has led a team in Newcastle to be the first in the world to characterise human embryonic stem cells from umbilical cord blood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08010880000168">The question that the Bill raises is why only 150 cord blood transplants out of 8,000 worldwide have been carried out in the UK. Why are we routinely disregarding the proven life-saving value of umbilical cord blood but legislating and investing predominantly in the unproven and ethically challenging route of embryonic research? Given that we will in the foreseeable future depend on non-embryonic stem cell therapies, why are we putting literally most of our eggs in one basket?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08010880000169">There are supporters of the Bill who are not necessarily opposed to embryo research but recognise the value of umbilical cord blood and its availability. The Bill would make it a universal requirement for doctors to inform pregnant women of the benefits of collection and storage of cord blood. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advises that if there is a known genetic condition in a family&#151;already a child with leukaemia or a blood-related disorder&#151;a clinician may recommend that parents bank their babies&#146; cord blood. My Bill would presume that collection takes place in such circumstances unless parents opt out or medical reasons prevent it. If nothing is done in this area, some private banks will simply exploit families&#146; fears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08010880000170">The practical problem facing any future extension of donation of cord blood is the limited number of NHS maternity units equipped for collection and storage in a safe environment. The NHS cord blood bank at Edgware restricts its collections to Barnet general, Northwick Park, Luton and Dunstable and Watford hospitals, which are the only dedicated units in England. The collection sites do not form a planned   <br>

approach to collection of cord blood and we are currently missing&#151;or, more to the point, wasting&#151;the opportunity presented by umbilical cord blood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08010880000171">The Bill seeks to promote the collection of cord blood from specific shortage groups, particularly ethnic minority groups and mixed-race families. The UK Thalassaemia Society, which has its base in Southgate in my constituency, recognises that point in its support of my Bill, as does the Leukaemia Society in the United Kingdom. They have emphasised to me the difficulties for leukaemia patients of Cypriot origin in finding appropriate bone marrow matches and support the proposed extension of cord blood donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08010880000172">The purposes of the Bill are not wholly dependent on legislation. The Anthony Nolan Trust, which also supports the Bill&#146;s aim to promote the benefits of cord blood collection, is setting up the first charitable cord blood bank in the UK and plans to promote opportunities for more cord donation. The hope is that six maternity units will facilitate collection. The aim is to harvest 12,500 cords within five years for clinical and research use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08010880000173">The Bill seeks to raise our sights higher, given the value now of cord blood&#146;s treating 85 different diseases. It also seeks to rebalance the debate on stem cell therapy, which can often be more led by media proxy and hype than the ability realistically to treat patients. The Bill supports an ethical and convenient alternative to embryonic sources of stem cells. It also supports parents who are waiting desperately for treatment for their children with diseases such as leukaemia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08010880000174">I leave the last words to Becki Josiah. She says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08010880000182">As if non-stop gloomy economic news and the return to work after the Christmas break were not enough to depress people last week, thousands of travellers had rail chaos to contend with as well: a truly miserable new year greeting from this Government and Network Rail, the organisation that Labour created to maintain and run the tracks on our railways&#151;a creation process in which the Prime Minister and his closest Treasury advisers were heavily involved. A key national route&#151;60,000 passengers a day use the extensive stretches of the west coast main line&#151;was seriously disrupted when upgrade works around Rugby ran four days over time. Many people were forced on to lengthy bus journeys and were subject to hours of delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80108-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08010880000183">Liverpool Street station, which is used daily by 100,000 passengers, was completely closed on the first working day after the new year, when a bridge project overran, and services remained disrupted for another two days. That level of disruption damages our economic competitiveness, and causes misery for passengers and inconvenience for those who are running freight on our railways. It is simply not acceptable, it should not have happened and it need not have happened had there been sensible planning. The fact that it occurred on a day when fares increased by as much as 14.5 per cent. in some areas compounded the anger and dissatisfaction felt by so many passengers, who rightly believed that they were not getting value for money.</p>

 My constituents in Wales were seriously affected by the overrun of engineering works in Rugby, but their main concern is that the lessons are learnt for the future. They welcome the upgrade of the line and the additional services that they are now getting, but what they want&#151;sensibly&#151;is for the regulator to look into the problems and the lessons to be learnt, so that we can have even faster and more frequent trains to north-west Wales.</p>

 Absolutely lessons must be learned for the future, and it is sad that Network Rail has not always learned lessons from similar incidents in the past. The simple fact is that Network Rail&#146;s senior management was incompetent in failing to plan properly to get the work finished on time. I emphasise that it is senior management that has been found wanting, because the Opposition recognise the hard work and difficult job done by so many dedicated Network Rail staff, whose morale must have plummeted in recent weeks.</p>

Network Rail&#146;s failure to communicate effectively either with passengers or with the people responsible for running the trains was inexcusable. It is one thing to overrun on a possession, but the impact is far worse if one gives only short notice that that will happen. There seemed to be a blithe assumption that if a train company were given a few days&#146; notice, its passengers could switch their plans and travel on a different day. But we are talking about new year&#146;s eve. If one is going to a new year&#146;s eve party, there is not a lot of point in getting a train on 4 January.</p>

work overrun at about 1 am on 2 January, about four hours before the station was due to reopen and trains to start running. By then, it was simply too late to get any information to customers before they turned up at stations across East Anglia, not unreasonably expecting to be able to take a train into work. That is an extreme example of Network Rail&#146;s damaging tendency not to co-operate closely enough with train operating companies, or even keep them informed of what is going on. That approach is hindering efficiency in the railways and increasing fragmentation.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, as ever. Network Rail needs to get a grip and seriously raise its game. Its performance is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para12"><a name="08010880000225">Another key error committed by Network Rail was its failure to tackle the situation effectively when things started to go wrong. The problems did not come out of the blue. Possessions are planned 18 months in advance. As early as 6 December there were clear warning signs that serious problems were occurring at Rugby when there was surely still time to remedy the situation. One question that the Secretary of State has to answer today has to do with when she was first warned about the potential overrun, and when she started to take action to sort the problem out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para13"><a name="08010880000226">As my hon.

It was confirmed in November that the &#163;286,000 in bonuses suspended after the Grayrigg accident had been paid out to Network Rail&#146;s four senior managers, despite the serious failures that the accident revealed. Network Rail&#146;s annual report disclosed a further &#163;362,000 of longer-term performance incentives. Last year, the pay of Network Rail&#146;s non-executive directors rose by 18 per cent. It looks as though the pay restraint that the Prime Minister has been grandstanding about does not apply to some of Labour&#146;s friends at Network Rail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para15"><a name="08010880000229">It was, of course, a matter of huge irony that, on the very day that Virgin took out advertisements in the national press to warn passengers about the expected disruption, those same national newspapers carried news of the knighthood that the Government had awarded to the chairman of Network Rail for his services to transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para16"><a name="08010880000230">The fundamental problem that the House must address is that Network Rail&#146;s management is not accountable to anyone. We believe that that must change. The people who in theory are supposed to hold Network Rail to account are its members, but the Network Rail board decides who most of them are. It is therefore no wonder that that check has been derided as toothless and ineffectual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para17"><a name="08010880000231">Reform is needed to put in place a more effective way to penalise failure by Network Rail&#146;s management, and to ensure that they are forced to listen to the regulator and their customers. Getting that right is of critical importance if we are to have the high-quality rail network that our economy needs. There are many reasons for that, but I shall outline just three.</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Lady does not want to mislead the House, but she seemed to suggest that the Network Rail board chooses its members.

The Network Rail board does not choose its members&#151;far from it. A perfectly straightforward machinery exists for that, and she must know about it.</p>

 My understanding is that the board has the final say over the public members appointed, but not over the industry members. According to the latest information, industry members make up about 24 per cent. of the board&#146;s membership, with public members accounting for 76 per cent. I certainly meant to say that the board has a veto over the majority of members, and it was an error on my part if I did not make that clear. However, I am willing to be corrected. </p>

 The hon. Lady also knows that board members are selected by an independent body. The divide is very clear. I am sure that she does not want to mislead people by suggesting that Network Rail has a veto, as it does not.</p>

 My understanding is that there is an independent element in proposing public members, but that the Network Rail board ultimately can say yes or no to any nomination. However, I shall be happy to check my facts to ensure that I have presented the situation correctly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para19"><a name="08010880000239">The second reason why it is vital to ensure that Network Rail is accountable is that it does not give high enough priority to passenger concerns. That must surely be a key reason why it has been so exasperatingly slow to deliver capacity enhancement&#151;measures such as longer platforms or short rail extensions into ports and industrial estates. As Network Rail&#146;s own business plan confirms, overcrowding is not confined any longer to busy London commuter routes. It is spread across Britain and is a serious problem, even on many off-peak trains. Passenger numbers on commuter services into Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow far exceed capacity on many trains. Capacity expansion is vital to tackle growing overcrowding problems, but a recurring complaint from stakeholders is that Network Rail management are simply not concerned enough about growing the railway.</p>

This is a body that has directly received &#163;10.3 billion of taxpayers&#146; money at today&#146;s prices since 2002 and will get another &#163;3.05 billion this financial year. That does not even include the further taxpayer subsidy that it receives indirectly via payments from the train operating companies.

 Things would certainly be more positive if there were more co-operation between the management of track and train. As I have stated, that is one of the weaknesses displayed by Network Rail senior management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para21"><a name="08010880000243">The disruption around Birmingham coincided with the day that the cost of an annual season ticket to Euston rose from &#163;7,260 to &#163;7,608. It is no wonder London TravelWatch described new year fare rises as a bitter pill. Passengers are being asked to pay more and more, often for grossly overcrowded trains and disrupted services. The reality is that fare payers are picking up the bill for Network Rail&#146;s failure to get a grip on costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para22"><a name="08010880000244">So this afternoon the Secretary of State has many questions to answer, not least of which is what is the total cost of this fiasco to the taxpayer. How much have the extra engineers who were needed for the overrun works cost? Will the money paid in fines&#151;we surely expect some of those&#151;be recycled and spent on rail or is it lost to the rail network? What discussions has the Secretary of State had with the Office of Rail Regulation on how to improve the performance of Network Rail? What did she do to respond to the problems revealed at Portsmouth, so many of which were repeated on this latest occasion? What discussions has she had with passenger groups and train companies about getting better performance from Network Rail? Above all, what guarantees can she give us that lessons will be learnt from the current fiasco and that steps will be taken to prevent its being repeated?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80108-0005.htm_para23"><a name="08010880000245">With major projects planned for Reading, Birmingham New Street, Thameslink, and the east coast main line, not to mention the remaining stages of the west coast main line upgrade, and with work scheduled for more or less every bank holiday up to December, I am afraid that there could be a great deal more disruption in store for passengers. Some projects, such as signalling work at the Glasgow Shields junction, are still overrunning from the new year break. Is the Secretary of State confident that the upgrade of the west coast main line will be completed on schedule in December this year?</p>

What a contrast with the hope and excitement at the launch of High Speed 1 last month. The incident illustrates how vital the railways are for our economy, our quality of life and our country. The underlying problem is that when they created Network Rail the Government failed to put in place effective means to ensure that it was answerable for its actions. When it provides poor services, too often it gets away with it with impunity. The taxpayer deserves better from Network Rail; its staff deserve better; but, above all, passengers deserve better.</p>

Also, there was yet another abject failure to commit to matching Labour&#146;s investment plans for the next seven years. Secondly, it was bravery given her party&#146;s track record on rail, which was defined by years of under-investment, declining passenger numbers, closure of lines, and of course a botched privatisation. I recognise the compliment that she paid the Government when she accepted that performance had improved on the railways in the past 10 years. However, people will be incredulous that she puts the improvement down to the privatisation that took place under the Tory Government. Sometimes I think that she lives on another planet.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his question.

The performance of the rail network has improved so considerably that I am delighted to tell the House that I can now use that route regularly, whereas after the Hatfield incident, when it was clear how chaotic a state the railways were in, some of us, including me, had to switch to the air for a period.

 Will the right hon. Lady deal with the question that I put to the Opposition spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)? It seems ridiculous that, by way of a fine for the incompetence of management, we should deprive Network Rail of money that would be spent on the infrastructure.

 I understand the genuine concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman, and I, like him, sympathise with all the passengers who suffered disruption on the network over the Christmas and new year period.

 Certainly, if the results of the investigation by the Office of Rail Regulation suggest that Network Rail is in breach of its licence, has been in breach of its licence or is likely to be in breach of its licence in future, that would need to be taken into account in setting bonus payments, as the contractual management incentive plan, as I understand it, sets  out clearly.</p>

In those costed plans, we have said that there will be no line closures and that we will monitor the growth in passenger numbers over that period; if passenger numbers grow faster than expected, we will, in the following period, think about whether additional railway capacity is needed, including whether to open new lines. When we come to the second control period, from 2014 onwards, I retain an open mind on whether we need, for example, to reopen a disused rail line between London and Birmingham, whether we should have a high-speed rail link that links London to Birmingham, or even beyond to Manchester and so forth, or indeed whether other modes of transport, such as roads, should be encouraged.

Network Rail was able to get a grip on costs, no longer underwritten by blank cheques from the Government. Its work was endorsed not only by the Public Accounts Committee, with which the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet should be familiar, but by the National Audit Office. We are seeing steady improvements in overall performance, reliability and safety. We have delivered the channel tunnel rail link on time and on budget. It is precisely because we have regained control of spending that I was, in July, able to set out the resources that we intend to devote to the railways over the next seven years and the further improvements that we expect the industry to deliver.</p>

I can tell her that in this current five-year control period, Network Rail is on track to deliver efficiency gains of more than 30 per cent.&#151;a record that Railtrack was never able to match. I would be interested to know whether she would commit to match the &#163;10 billion investment that we intend to make between 2009  and 2014.</p>

 We have heard Opposition Members suggest that the fare payer should not have to put any more into the railways, whereas previously they have suggested that taxpayers should not pay more.

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Indeed, I am still not clear about the fares policy of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. If she disagrees with what passengers are being asked to pay, would she and her party expect the taxpayer to pay more instead, or would they rather cut services and investment? If so, which of the projects that we have announced would they like to cut? I remind the hon. Lady that rather than people being priced off the railways, passenger numbers are at record levels, with 370 million more passenger journeys every year than in 1997&#151;a figure that is increasing year by year.</p>

 That is one of the issues we need to consider. Indeed, the Office of Rail Regulation will examine the impact that that disruption had on passengers. There are clear arrangements in place under which compensation can be paid to train operating companies and, under the passenger&#146;s charter, to passengers, if they have been incorrectly sold tickets or subjected to severe disruption. I would expect those measures to be enforced.</p>

I must say that I have not checked the price of such a season ticket, but the hon.

I had the opportunity to read an article that she wrote recently in the <i> Yorkshire Post</i>. In it she bemoaned the fact that a walk-on-and-go saver return from Leeds to London would go up from &#163;149.60 to about &#163;156.78, and that a walk-on-and-go open return for the same journey was going to rise from &#163;370 to about &#163;400. I am afraid that the hon. Lady may need some remedial maths lessons because she arbitrarily doubled the cost of the actual fare.

 I agree with the point about funding, and we have identified ways of raising funds from public money, which I will set out.

The companies that operate from Liverpool Street were made aware only at midnight that there would be no trains the following day. With the best will in the world, it is difficult for a train company to arrange for alternative transport on buses and coaches when it is given almost no notice of Network Rail&#146;s failure to complete engineering works.

Perhaps the Secretary of State knows that freight customers had to be told that depots at Daventry were effectively isolated by the west coast main line works and their overrun.

Individuals who contacted me in the past few days include self-employed people who lost much money as a consequence of an overrun.

 No, I do not agree with that. To be fair, some elements of privatisation worked better than others. As a matter of fact, train operating companies have been reasonably successful. However, the creation of Railtrack was a complete fiasco, with the setting up of a body that naturally wanted to prioritise money for shareholders in a monopoly situation. The way it did so was to spend as little as possible on maintaining the network. I welcomed the creation of Network Rail, which was a Lib-Dem proposal&#151;one of the ones that the Government nicked, dare I say, along with many others, including independence for the Bank of England and so on. Nevertheless, Network Rail is a much better solution and we are happy that it was created.</p>

The whole network, comprising two branches, was shut for two days. There is no way that Network Rail could have been working on that entire stretch for two days. There are places such as Haywards Heath where it is perfectly possible to turn trains round. What Network Rail does is purely an administrative convenience.

 I was trying to be helpful to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) earlier, as I will now show. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one problem that has not been discussed, but should be, is the acute shortage of railway engineers in this country? A number of my friends are railway engineers and sometimes they despair. The problem obviously relates to the previous Government, but my Government have not really done enough to deal with it. Much of the reason for our problems, along with the acute contractualisation in the industry, which causes its own difficulties, is to do with the fact that, on occasion, there are insufficient railway engineers to conduct a proper safety case.</p>

 That is true. Network Rail told me that one of the problems was the number of people qualified to reinstate overhead electrification lines. There are simply not enough people able to do that. Network Rail should have identified the problem and perhaps allowed a longer period for that work; nevertheless, it is an issue. For a long period of time when Railtrack was in operation, the required investment was not being made and the maintenance was not being done, and sadly some of the skills were lost. They have to be rebuilt for the industry.</p>

Paragraph 28 says that public members are appointed by the board on the recommendation of a membership selection panel and later in the document it makes it clear that Network Rail&#146;s articles of association require a majority of members to be public members. Thus, the board has a veto over the majority of members&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 That is a matter for the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) rather than for me. She is welcome to intervene at some stage to make her point. It is interesting that the Conservative spokeswoman clarifies a point for the Government rather than for her own party&#146;s policies, which, as was mentioned earlier, are not at all clear. Having listened to the opening speech from the Conservatives, I have to say that their policy seems like a destination board on which it is not quite clear at which stations the trains will be stopping. Perhaps we will hear more detail when reviews or reports are discussed at some distant point in the future. What is perfectly clear is that it is inconceivable and inconsistent to argue on the one hand that the Government should do more to bring Network Rail under control while on the other to argue for a Railtrack-type solution, which moves things more into the private sector. With respect, the Conservatives need to sort out which of those directions they choose to follow rather than trying to argue for both sides of the case at the same time. I would ask the Secretary of State, however, to look further into Lord Berkeley&#146;s suggestions about foundation status.</p>

Although &#147;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&#148; makes many useful points and the Government have been moving in the right direction on rail in recent years, I think that they have flunked in one key respect: they have not grasped the nettle and acknowledged that network capacity needs to be increased far more than the White Paper suggests. By sorting out Gatwick airport and providing a bit of signalling here and a couple of extra lines around a station there, the Government have bought five or 10 years and nearly  15 per cent. extra capacity. The trouble&#151;or the benefit, if you like&#151;is that, as the amendment says, the railway is carrying 40 per cent. more passenger traffic since 1997, and the volume is increasing every year. Even if all the improvements identified by the Government were brought onstream in sufficient time, they would not cure the problem within five or 10 years.</p>

The lead-in periods for major infrastructure projects such as reopening lines or building a high-speed line are such that even if the Secretary of State or her successor decides in 2012 or 2015 to go ahead with a major scheme, it will be another 10 years before it is introduced. In the meantime, it will be impossible to meet the demands caused by overcrowding. The Government ought to anticipate the decisions that will be needed now, rather than waiting for overcrowding to become even more chronic.</p>

 The Minister seems keen for an answer to that question, and, unlike the Conservatives, I will give him one. We have a future public transport fund consisting of an extra &#163;6.5 billion, which recognises that money can come from a climate change charge on internal flights, from the auctioning of landing slots and from the introduction of a transport development levy on heavy goods vehicles. We know how we will pay for improvements that are above and beyond what the Government propose. The Government&#146;s scheme has been costed, but I do not think it goes far enough; our scheme has been costed, and goes further. I shall leave the economic analysis there, in the context of the  three parties.</p>

programme significantly&#151;but not so easy to get railway lines reopened or stations opened. The hurdles for rail projects are still far higher than those for road projects. If we are to take climate change seriously, let alone congestion on the network, we must change the mindset in the Department for Transport and in the House more generally.</p>

 They have no plans to put any money in. They would be very happy if someone else did all the work and found the funds. That is not the approach they take to roads, but it is the one they take to railways. That alternative mindset needs to be changed within the Department.

I think it is wrong on that and that the price will be rather more than that; indeed, it is rather more than that now. As a consequence, electric-based transport, including rail, will become more financially attractive than petrol-based transport.

 Clearly, the subject of today&#146;s debate is topical and important, because we should be giving extensive consideration to the structure of the railway at this time. The track record of the Conservative party in government was such that it is unlikely that anyone will listen to proposals that might come from it. We understand that the Conservatives might propose horizontal fragmentation of the railways, involving a merger of the train operating companies and Network Rail, but at this stage we do not know.</p>

That does not mean that no criticism can be made of the current position or that no improvements need to be made, but it is grudging of the Opposition not to recognise that improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80108-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08010880000367">Network Rail was created in 2004 as a not-for-dividend company.

We have to recognise that if we are to see significant investment in the railways over the coming years&#151;and, perhaps, investment beyond that currently proposed&#151;passengers will occasionally be inconvenienced by engineering work. However, we shall have to get on top of the issues that have arisen over the past few weeks and do everything possible to ensure that passenger inconvenience is minimised.</p>

When we consider what we definitely know, it is apparent that Network Rail management knew&#151;certainly by 21 December, and probably a long time before&#151;that there would be significant problems in the area around Rugby. However, it is not apparent what, if anything, management decided to do about it. Those are the relevant questions not only for the regulator to address when the inquiry begins, but ultimately for the Government and the Secretary of State to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80108-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08010880000387">On 21 December, when Network Rail realised that the engineering work around Rugby was due to run into new year&#146;s eve, what did it do? What action did it take? What did it do when it realised that the work would overrun beyond new year&#146;s eve? The management has given me and others the explanation that when they talked to the limited supply of skilled engineers and electricians who had the knowledge and expertise to deal with the overhead lines&#151;which is what needed to be done&#151;they all said that they had made other plans for the new year celebrations. One can understand that to an extent, although it should have been anticipated. However, the line did not reopen until 4 January. What went on in the Network Rail management offices that meant that they did not make adequate provision to ensure that the line opened almost immediately after the new year? One has to wonder whether managers made a clear calculation that the works would inevitably overrun by more than was acceptable and that the company would be fined, but that it would be easier and cheaper to pay the fine than to do what was necessary to get the work done on time. That is what the Office of the Rail Regulator will investigate, and we all&#151;especially the residents of Rugby&#151;look forward to the conclusions of that investigation. It seems to me that we have to ask such questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08010880000388">Another question that should fairly be asked of Network Rail is about the information that it gave to the train operating companies. Virgin Trains suffered hugely as a result of the overrun and was not given adequate information at adequate times. After the first announcement of the engineering overrun, the Virgin Trains website said that although people could not travel on new year&#146;s eve and new year&#146;s day, for which the company was sorry, their tickets would be valid on Wednesday and Thursday. It quickly became apparent  <br>

that rail travel on Wednesday and Thursday was not going to happen, either. That made Virgin Trains look foolish. The company would have made that announcement based on information that it was given by Network Rail. If that information was wrong, we need to understand why it was wrong and why Network Rail did not give out accurate information about when it realistically expected the line to reopen.</p>

I am sorry to say that no Member of this House&#151;or anyone else&#151;has been able to do so effectively for a long time. My interest as the Member of Parliament for Rugby is not only in the level of disruption in and around Rugby and its effect on Rugby&#146;s reputation, but in what the disruption and its consequences mean for the people whom I represent. One of the problems that the level of disruption throws up is that those who live in Rugby or travel from Rugby station see an awful lot of down sides in the disruption caused by the upgrading of the west coast main line. They cannot rely, as perhaps others elsewhere in the country can, on the hopeful prospect that one day it will all be wonderful and that they will be able to get up and down the country easily and much more quickly. For those who live in or travel from Rugby, that is not necessarily the case.</p>

The problem is that the overruns in engineering work and disruption affect people in Rugby as much, if not more so, as everyone else. However, those people do not have the prospect of a better service when it is all done.</p>

Members have mentioned them in particular&#151;will be noticeably worse. There is a tension, if not a conflict, that we must resolve. If we are to develop a fast rail line, as the west coast main line will be, of course it is right that there will be a tension between getting people from one end to the other as quickly as possible while simultaneously stopping the train at all the places where people wish to get on and off. I understand that. However, it does not seem that it can possibly be right that the improvements to the west coast main line could so effectively bypass the people of Rugby, who have suffered so much in making them happen.</p>

I shall meet the managing director of Arriva, the company that has taken over from Virgin Cross Country, and that will be one matter that I shall raise.

He does not have an easy task, but the problem is that those who have suffered the most from the terrible debacle on the west coast main line over the past few days are likely to benefit the least when the work is finished. That will cause greater resentment and make it more difficult to attract people onto the railways. The hon. Member for Lewes was right to say that people will put up with a bit of inconvenience once in a while when they understand that a big project has to be carried out, but that they will not do so over and over again. They will not put up with inadequate information, or with being told one thing one day and something else the next.</p>

It will then be much more difficult to persuade them to leave their cars behind and try the railway again when the work is  done and the service is as fantastic as we all hope that it will be.</p>

 I very much welcome this debate. Many hon. Members have a lot to say about what is happening on the railways, and those of us who believe firmly that the rail service can make an enormous contribution to the fight against climate change want to ensure that it is as good as it can possibly be. Rail travel can be extremely quick, and it is much safer than road travel. It has a significant role to play in helping to combat climate change. The Climate Change Bill will set the challenging target of reducing carbon emissions by at least 60 per cent. by 2050, and greater use of the railways will be vital if we are to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08010880000402">However, there is a genuine problem with the services offered on Sundays. I fully understand that our rail networks need to be maintained and upgraded, and I support that. I also appreciate why much of that work has to take place on Sundays, but I want to question our attitudes to Sunday services. Under this Government, there have been considerable improvements in the frequency of some trains and in the quality of rolling stock, but in many parts of the country the attitude to the provision of Sunday services remains very outdated. In those areas, the approach seems to be that train services exist only to transport workers five days a week, in a world where annual holidays last from Saturday to Saturday and football matches are only ever played on Saturday afternoons. However, the world has changed&#151;as anyone who has been to an airport or shopping centre on a Sunday will know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08010880000403">People want to travel on Sundays. They may want to have a family day out at the seaside or attend a sporting event or go shopping, but they invariably find that they cannot make the necessary return journey by train on a Sunday. Anyone going away for a weekend, or a student coming home from university for a weekend, will want to travel on a Sunday, but railway services are very restricted. For example, the earliest that people can leave Llanelli on a Sunday is 11 am, which means that they cannot get very far. They cannot get to the seaside until after lunchtime, and if they want to come to London they will not get here until late afternoon if they are lucky and have not been delayed too many times by various transfers on to buses and other delaying tactics that seem to beset the railways on a Sunday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08010880000404">I have often found that Sunday services are crowded, especially during the evening when people are trying to get back from weekends away. Many people are completely put off travelling on a Sunday by the lack of trains, the lack of choice of routes, overcrowding or because they really cannot face the unpredictable delays and the inconvenience of struggling with heavy luggage in and out of stations and on and off replacement bus services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08010880000405">We had exactly the same problem on Boxing day. Many of us witnessed traffic jams on Boxing day&#151;a day that is now popular for sporting events and that many families can enjoy out together. If we want to encourage people to leave their cars at home and to go by train we need services that they can use. Likewise, many people who go away to visit friends or relatives at Christmas have no option but to use their cars, because they simply cannot get back on Boxing day ready to go to work on 27 December. Effectively, if people want to use the train to go away at Christmas, they have to be able to leave relatively early on Christmas eve, stay away for at least three nights and come back on 27 December. In many other countries there is a much more comprehensive service on Sundays and Boxing day. That is what we need here. Travel is an important part of people&#146;s leisure activity and we need a much better service on Sundays, with more frequent trains and far less disruption to services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08010880000406">I would like a much more organised approach from Network Rail to the maintenance and upgrading of our railways. It seems to be very inflexible in the way it works. As other hon. Members have said, it seems to take out an entire track or area for weeks and months at a time. Perhaps 200 miles of track seems to be affected. Instead, it could take the work bit by bit and say that from one station to another might be closed for a month, and then the next one and the next one. It has taken out the entire line from Llanelli to Newport. It can be immensely inconvenient to go from one tiny station to the next by bus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08010880000407">The other problem is that once Network Rail has fixed its dates it is incapable of changing them. We had a poignant example last year. A big match was taking place in Cardiff and many people would have liked to take the train to it. Although there were weeks of notice, Network Rail was inflexible and unwilling to change its arrangements, so it was impossible for anyone to use the railway on that day. Many people who would have enjoyed relaxing on the train and arriving in Cardiff without the fuss of finding somewhere to park had to drive down the motorway with so many others and wait in traffic jams and queues to get into the city. There is a lot to be said for keeping a close eye on what Network Rail is doing and I implore the Minister to require strong answers about recent events during the recess and to look to the future at exactly what Network Rail can do to guarantee that its work will be much less disruptive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08010880000408">On a more positive note, I welcome the Government&#146;s proposals for simplifying the fare structure. I look forward to the implementation of a ticketing system that will ensure that passengers are sold the best available tickets for a journey. I understand that that will be in place by the autumn. It is very much needed, because the present system leaves people confused, especially if they are travelling from one area of the country to another. There seem to be so many different types of tickets and operating procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08010880000409">We are all concerned about what happened during the recess, but there is a tremendous future for the railways and I would very much like to see that we get the problems sorted out so that people can have confidence in our service and we get more people out of their cars and on to the railways.</p>

 We saw a sorry performance from the Government Front Bencher this afternoon. There was a complete lack of analysis of what really went wrong, and a complete absence of remedies to make sure that, in future, money is not wasted and there are not so many delays. There was no real understanding of the structure that the Government created in their new Network Rail company, and there was no real, sincere apology to all the people whose travel arrangements, local stations and rail tracks were disrupted over the Christmas and new year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08010880000411">The Government are backed by Labour Members who seem to believe in a couple of myths&#151;in ideological baggage left over from the old socialist period. One of them is the proposition that a nationalised monopoly railway, taking us back to the golden age of British Rail, would be a lot better, and the other is the proposition that fragmentation was the cause of the recent delays and problems. I shall consider those two myths before providing a bit of analysis on what is wrong with Network Rail, how it could be put right in the short term, and how it could be made a lot better through fundamental structural change in the medium or longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08010880000412">Let us deal first with the myths. We are invited to believe that the nationalised monopoly between 1947 and 1993 was a paragon of virtue, which never delayed people, produced extremely good services, and delivered a much better railway for less money. Those of us who have read the history books, and some of those who are old enough to have lived through that period, will know that the reality was very different. Between 1947 and 1993, the nationalised monopoly was in continuous decline. I am not making a party political point. It did not matter whether there were a Labour, Conservative or Labour-Liberal coalition Government; the system did not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08010880000413">Over that long period, there was a continuous trend: a fall in the proportion of our freight carried by rail and of passenger journeys by rail. People voted with their feet and their pocket books for the flexibility of road travel. Hauliers came into the market and took the freight business. Indeed, the nationalised monopoly railway stopped competing for most freight business, because it decided that it would not do single-wagon marshalling at all. It decided that it was interested in rail freight business only if it involved complete train loads, and if there were a reasonable number of trains a day, or a week. There were only a few people in the country with enough business to get an offer from the railways to run rail freight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08010880000414">It was not surprising, therefore, that there was a  big decline in rail freight and passenger movements. The decline was accelerated by the gross financial mismanagement that characterised the nationalised railway under all Governments over a long period. During the period in question, huge subsidies had to be put into the railway. Despite those large subsidies, fares rose in real terms year after year, which put people off using the railways. Those on low income were deprived of any realistic chance of access to the railway, because rail travel became prohibitively expensive. It was a double whammy: the system was bad for the taxpayer,  <br>

who had to subsidise it, and bad for the fare payer, because fares kept rising in real terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08010880000415">From time to time, under Treasury pressure, the railway was forced to cut services and to make closures. Sometimes there were a lot of closures all in one go, as in the case of the notorious Beeching cuts. More often, there was a dribble of closures, year after year, as and when Governments thought that they could get away with it. The nationalised monopoly always presented Governments of all persuasions with exactly the same cruel choices: &#147;Pay up, or we close lines&#148;; &#147;Pay up, or we close services&#148;; and &#147;Pay up, Minister, or we will pick on your line for particularly bad treatment.&#148; That was the brutal political reality that characterised the rows between the nationalised monopoly and Labour or Conservative Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08010880000416">I find it surprising that after all these years of allegedly new Labour, the Labour party has not moved on in its thinking and realised that that was not a particularly good model. It was not even a good model for the people who worked for the railway. The nationalised monopoly kept sacking people, because as it retreated, made cuts and reduced services, it had to take cost out, although the costs still grew unrealistically. An awful lot of people were therefore made redundant into the bargain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08010880000417">I think that Ministers understand those points, because we are 11 years into a Labour Government and there is absolutely no sign that they wish to recreate a nationalised monopoly. One cheer for that. We have some common ground, and some agreement. I do not expect any Minister to leap to his or her feet this evening and suggest that the record of the nationalised monopoly under Labour Governments was particularly fine. Ministers know that what I say about fares, service quality, delays, reliability and redundancies is all too true of the nationalised railway monopoly. Those on the Front Bench have at last realised that there needs to be a different model, and that a nationalised monopoly is not run by the Government but runs the Government, bosses the Government around and does not deliver for all the money that is put in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08010880000418">However, many Labour Back Benchers seem to think, fondly, that there was a golden age of nationalised monopoly and, fondly, are misled into believing that their Government might one day recreate that nationalised monopoly. I should like to assure Labour Members that I do not believe that there is any chance of the present Labour Government recreating the nationalised monopoly of their dreams. The Government could not afford to nationalise the train companies, and they know that it would be a disaster trying to run the railways as they were in the 1970s and 1940s under Labour Governments and in the 1960s and 1980s under Conservative Governments. It was the failure of the nationalised monopoly that drove the Conservative Government into fundamental change, which ushered in a new era for the railways.</p>

Whichever period one chooses, it presents a very different picture from the previous 40 years. It is a picture of growth in passenger travel and in freight transportation. Many of the present problems of the railways are the kind that one wants in a business. They are the problems of too much pressure of demand&#151;more people wishing to use the railways and more people frustrated that better use cannot be made of those fabulous routes across the country and into the centres of our leading towns and cities, which are at present in the monopoly custodianship of Network Rail, the subject of the debate this evening.

 My problem with the structure that we chose and with the Government&#146;s structure is that I think we left too big a monopoly element in the track. The evil is monopoly&#151;it is not public ownership so much as monopoly. As all the economic textbooks rightly tell us, monopoly does in the customer. It always charges too much and delivers too little. It always looks after the interests of the owners and the senior managers. It does not look after the interests of the customers or even of the more junior employees, who do most of the work. So it is a nasty system, and even public ownership does not tame monopoly sufficiently to get rid its evil consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08010880000423">At the time, I favoured splitting the railway into regional rail companies, which would allow competitive challenge over time, because they would have to re-bid for franchises; so it was not a perpetual monopoly for them. At the same time, it would allow others to come in and build new track or suggest new services, so that there was some element of contestability where the tracks could, in certain circumstances, be used as a common carrier and would not necessarily remain the monopoly preserve of the regional company. The basic structure was to go back to regional companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80108-0009.htm_para30"><a name="08010880000424">Although I do not think it necessary, reconnecting track and train can make sense. I was a strong opponent of the London underground system developed by the Government, because I thought that splitting track and train in confined tunnels was particularly foolish. I proposed the pro-competitive solution of splitting things into competing companies that owned track and train entire with their own lines; I think that that would still be a better answer, given that the system has gone bankrupt in one major company and is obviously struggling.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way once more. Would he like to share his thoughts on the fact that European legislation prevents the ownership of trains and tracks together?</p>

<p><a name="st_o230"><a name="08010880000426"><a name="80108-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="08010880000712"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 I am not an expert lawyer on that issue; nor am I any kind of lawyer. However, my understanding and reading of the situation is that European legislation does not prevent that. That legislation requires more competitive challenge than a nationalised monopoly would allow, so I find myself in the curious position of supporting the thrust of those European regulations and that legislation, because competitive challenge is a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08010880000427">I turn to the second myth that I want to dismiss before going into the future, where the Minister wants to tempt me. That is the myth, which we have heard throughout this debate, that the particular problems of the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) and others were caused by fragmentation. That is complete nonsense. If Network Rail had been British Rail recreated, owning the trains that could not run, that would have made absolutely no difference to its mistake over the engineering works at Rugby and Liverpool Street. The same people would still have made the same miscalculation of failing to deliver enough engineers to sort out the complicated project within the deadline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08010880000428">I am afraid that Labour Members who think that fragmentation caused the problems during the Christmas and new year are simply wrong. The problems were caused by Network Rail&#146;s gross management miscalculation, and would have happened whether there had been fragmentation or not.</p>

 I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. Does he accept that if Network Rail&#146;s management themselves say that there has been a management failure, there is no need for the Government to look for any other explanation?</p>

 I agree, and I hope that the Government will not waste money on that. If Network Rail were a business reporting to me, the problem would be so obvious and would be sorted out with a timely and lively exchange with the senior management. I shall come to that when I discuss what power the Government have over that particular creature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08010880000431">First, however, I should like to dismiss the fragmentation argument. If we compare the rail industry, which has all the problems that we have described&#151;not growing quickly enough, fares too high, inadequate service for many people&#151;with the aviation industry, a successful public transport industry in this country, the contrast is telling. The aviation industry is completely fragmented; on the Labour analysis, it should not work at all&#151;it should be delaying passengers, putting fares up and doing all the bad things that the Labour Members I mentioned seem to expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08010880000432">The aviation industry is totally fragmented: there are competing public and private owners of airports, there is a privatised company dealing with air traffic services and a range of competing companies deals with luggage, other services and the retail offer at airports. Furthermore, competing companies own the planes and fly people around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08010880000433">Aviation is more complicated to control. If there is a mess on the railways, all the signals can be put on red and problems can be sorted out. However, if a mess is made at an airport, a load of planes will stack up without much fuel and things cannot suddenly stop for a couple of hours so that problems can be sorted out. There would be a real disaster on our hands&#151;the aviation system is much more complicated, working in three dimensions with limited runway space for landings. An awful lot of people would be at risk as they flew above the airport without much fuel in their planes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08010880000434">The system shows that if we trust competition&#151;what the Labour Members I mentioned would call &#147;fragmentation&#148;&#151;we get much lower fares, much faster growth and much better passenger satisfaction. There is a much better range of offerings at a typical airport than at a typical train station. Airports usually offer a more pleasurable experience, except when the Government intervene on the security side. Aviation attracts a lot more people and delivers far more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08010880000435">The Government&#146;s problem is that aviation is a runaway success. They do not like that, as they do not think it green enough and it uses a competitive challenge model. Railways, which they think a greener way to travel, are not a sufficient success. Whether railways are greener is arguable; that depends on how many people are travelling and how old the train is, although they could well be greener in some cases. The Government have problems with the rail industry because a lot of monopoly is still left in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08010891000001">Let me turn to the main focus of the debate, which is Network Rail. Ministers would lead us to believe that this business is an independent private sector company&#151;that it just happens to have a different structure from all other private sector companies, that it just happens to be set up by the Government, that it just so happens that the Government own all the shares, and that it just so happens that the Government give it the bulk of its revenue. Ministers must be living in cloud cuckoo land. It is a Government creature&#151;they can do anything they like with it. They can come to this House today or tomorrow and change its whole structure, and nobody will object because all the people on the board, the membership list and so forth are creatures of this Government, put there for some strange purpose&#151;presumably to try to pretend that its borrowings are not properly public sector borrowings but are in some mysterious way private sector borrowings. Of course, they are as public as any borrowings could be, because they all have a Government guarantee. The only reason that Network Rail has been trading without qualified accounts and having access to banks is that it gets a guarantee from the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08010891000002">The company&#146;s financial structure is remarkable. It is a rather tiny company, as its net assets are only  &#163;6.3 billion. After all the billions of expenditure and with potentially billions in assets&#151;or so one would have thought, given all these fabulous routes&#151;the company&#146;s net asset value is &#163;6.3 billion. To put it in context, that is just two years&#146; worth of the revenue subsidy that the Government tip into the business. However, the business has more than &#163;18 billion of net borrowings, or net debt, because it has a Government guarantee routing private sector money into it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08010891000003">Even more remarkable is the revenue account. Last year, 90 per cent. of the operating costs were paid for by a revenue grant. Those who confuse investment and revenue subsidy complicate the debate to no little extent. Yes, the business needs investment, and yes, it is making investment, but it survives only because a colossally high proportion of its operating costs are being paid by a revenue subsidy. That does not happen to the competing road haulage or road passenger industries in the way that the Liberal Democrats imply; they seem to have mistaken investment money for revenue subsidy money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08010891000004">This business is not efficient or well run, and it is not in robust financial health. It is there entirely because the Government support it with revenue and with guarantees on capital account. Its management do not seem able to make their business more efficient or, despite endless fare increases, to be able to do enough to grow the business so that the revenue strand from the fare payer overtakes that from the Government and becomes the dominant influence in the way one assumes that Ministers would like, given that they too must be rather worried about its huge dependence on revenue subsidy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08010891000005">We are also led to believe that Railtrack failed because it did not invest enough. If the Minister looks at the figures, he will see that there was a quantum leap upwards in the amount of investment going into the railways after privatisation compared with pre-privatisation performance under Labour, Labour-Liberal and Conservative Governments at the time of the nationalised industry. In the last two years of its existence, before it was so rudely terminated by the Government, Railtrack had invested &#163;5 billion, and then &#163;5.3 billion in successive years. That shows that it was making a substantial commitment to the improvement of the railways, bearing in mind the fact that in the last couple of years of the nationalised industry the investment level had been about &#163;2 billion. The privatised industry managed to invest at two and a half times the level achieved by the nationalised industry in its dying years. If Members wanted to rush to their feet&#151; although they do not seem to be&#151;to say that that was because there was a Conservative Government, I should say that the investment record under Labour and Labour-Liberal Governments was equally gloomy. There was not a sudden big reduction in railway investment when the Conservatives came to office in 1979.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08010891000006">Quite a lot of the railway investment under nationalisation was ill-judged. It went on glamour projects and on switching traction methods&#151;particularly electrification, where the benefits are somewhat arguable&#151;rather than being concentrated on better types of train, such as lighter or better braking trains, that could be used more frequently on the network, which must be the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08010891000007">I now wish to be a little more creative and say what should happen from here. First, we all want the management of Network Rail to be made accountable for the egregious errors that we all agree have occurred in recent weeks. Those are not new errors, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) pointed out. It did not learn the lessons from previous mistakes when engineering works had similarly overrun. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth pointed out, they were eminently foreseeable errors. Those involved  <br>

had to undertake a survey of quantities. They needed to know how many man and woman hours of good engineering skill they needed, and to understand the complexity of the task ahead of them. The main thing that management should do in such a situation is break the job up into manageable units of work, and create a contingency for things going wrong&#151;people not turning up on new year&#146;s day because they may be preoccupied, a bit hungover or whatever. Instead, they crammed too much into a limited time, and on two separate occasions they had to come to industry and the travelling public to say, &#147;We&#146;ve overshot. We can&#146;t actually manage it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08010891000008">Some Labour Members seem to think that it is a sufficient excuse to say, &#147;Oh well, some of this work entailed private contractors, which again shows that fragmentation was wrong, but it was a mistake to use private contractors.&#148; It was the call of Network Rail, the Government&#146;s own creature, whether to use private contractors or to hire the staff in-house so that they were permanently on its books. That is a matter for Network Rail; I do not have an ideological bias on that. Sometimes it is better to have one&#146;s own people in-house, and sometimes it is a good idea to use private contractors. People need to form a judgment based on how often they use them, how much they cost and how competitive the consultants and contractors are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08010891000009">We pay very large salaries to Network Rail senior executives so that they can decide such matters  for us. Ministers should be supervising that process. If senior managers cannot make such judgment calls sensibly&#151;if they get the balance between in-house staff and private contractors wrong, if they get the bills of quantities wrong or if they cannot work out how long a given type of engineering will take&#151;they simply are not up to the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08010891000010">The defence of Ministers is to say that that is not really any of their business because they have created an independent private sector company, and it is up to the board of the company and the remuneration committee of the board to take the necessary decisions. My view is very simple, and I think that it is shared by most members of the public. If a business is 100 per cent. owned by the Government, if 90 per cent. of its operating costs are paid for by taxpayers&#146; subsidy and if all its borrowings are guaranteed by the public, we should expect our representatives&#151;the Ministers&#151;to hire the best managers, and fire them if they get it wrong, or to find a way of making sure that they do not get it wrong again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08010891000011">I found the evasive answers from the Secretary of State on the matter of remuneration and bonuses both surprising and depressing. If I were running a private business and my managers had done something wrong, the first thing I would say to them, after one had got to grips with the magnitude of the error, would be, &#147;Of course, there won&#146;t be any bonuses this year.&#148; I think that they would then say, &#147;Well, if that&#146;s all you&#146;re going to do to us, boss, we&#146;ve got off quite lightly. Can we keep our jobs?&#148; One might hear that sort of thing in the private sector context. Why do we not have that sort of feeling in the public sector? Ministers should have a private but lively conversation with the managers in this company to tell them that this is not only unacceptable, but that there has to be some visible financial penalty on senior managers.</p>

I do not want to penalise those at the bottom of the heap who did all the work and did not get paid much for turning up on a wet and cold December night, but the people at the top, who have made the misjudgments, have to feel the penalty in their pocketbook. The least that one would expect a Minister to say is that the performance pay element will either be abolished or much reduced, because performance has been sadly lacking in this situation. I do not know of anyone who will write to me saying, &#147;How disgraceful of you to say that these highly paid people cannot have their full bonuses this year&#148;, given the suffering that people went through when they could not get their trains at Christmas and new year, and when they saw their stations and services so disrupted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08010891000013">We need Ministers to tackle the rather ramshackle structure of Network Rail and to put in place a serious board with a limited number of really good people who can provide a critical appraisal of senior managers and provide focus through the remuneration committee and board meetings to ensure that such things are unacceptable to the board and, therefore, are less likely to happen in future. It will not help to have 100, 1,000 or 20,000 &#147;members&#148;, or whatever. That is completely bogus. It is mock democracy, whereas I am a true democrat. If it is to be proper democracy, all 60 million people, or all 45 million taxpayers, have to be involved because we are the stakeholders. We are the ones who are paying the bills. However, that is not realistic. We have representatives to carry out the process for us, and they are called Ministers. Ministers have to appoint a limited number of really good people, who can ride the business hard and ensure that it performs to proper commercial disciplines&#151;if they want to carry on doing things the Network Rail way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08010891000014">Let us get away from the myth that Network Rail is a completely private sector entity, and let us see Ministers laying down, at least once a year, at corporate plan and Budget time, what they expect for the &#163;3 billion-odd of Revenue subsidy and what they expect for the several billions of guaranteed investment moneys borrowed on the taxpayer tab. We need to see performance, and there have to be results to show for such a sum of money going into the business. I see no evidence from today&#146;s debate, from reading the papers, or from previous debates on the subject that Ministers have seriously entered into the complicated but important task of setting feasible, limited objectives for the expenditure of that money, and determining how they will hold people to account if they do not achieve them.</p>

 On a point of clarification, the right hon. Gentleman may have missed the publication in July of the Government&#146;s White Paper, which contained the high level output specification. That specifically states what we expect to buy from Network Rail in terms of performance and efficiencies. It sets out explicitly the statement of funds available. It sounds to me as if he has just described what we have already produced in July. He referred to that being done on an annual basis, however, and we are doing it on a five-year control period basis.</p>

That process has to take place at a more detailed level through the eyeballing of senior management in the ministerial office.</p>

I prepared very strenuously for them; I trust that the people on the other side did, too. They were rather foolish if they did not. I used those meetings to say, &#147;You&#146;ll be very pleased to hear from a Minister like me that you are going to get some money, but I really expect you to make that money work very hard. This is how I expect you to make it work hard. These are the rewards for success, and these are the penalties for failure.&#148; That has to be a ministerial function, and if the Minister is going to insist on doing it through a so-called independent remuneration committee, he will have to hand pick that committee and brief its members so that he knows they are in line with his wishes.</p>

We need to see performance, and the Minister needs to see it in return for all this money. The money has to be limited. It is a huge task: we have a massive railway that needs injections of cash for growth and development. It is very clear that it is not being well run or managed at the moment.</p>

Even with the improvements I have suggested, I am sceptical about how well a Network Rail monopoly would work. I have been honest with the House. I do not think that Railtrack was brilliant, either, but Railtrack and Network Rail are not very different. They have the same principal problem, which is that they are monopolies, and it is difficult to make them responsive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08010891000021">I have a slight preference for Railtrack because it had more of the disciplines of the market.

It had to respond to market disciplines on many of its borrowings and activities in a way in which Network Rail does not. The Government have relaxed the constraints on the railway track monopoly and that is why they have problems with overruns, delay, poor service and high costs.</p>

investing the capital worth while. However, they must also know that, at some point, they have to try again to maintain the franchise. The quid pro quo is that one has to tell them that they can sell on the capital that they have invested and the capital that they bought and inherited so that they know that, if they are unsuccessful, they will not wipe out their shareholders. There must be a penalty but it must not be so harsh that no one will take the risk or make the venture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08010891000024">Contestability is also required. The ability to run across other people&#146;s regions and to use the track more intelligently and better is necessary. An independent regulator or adjudicator, who can decide how the track can best be used, is also needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para29"><a name="08010891000025">At the beginning of my speech, I referred to the tragedy of having fabulous routes that are not used enough. If one flies over southern England in a light aircraft at peak hours in the morning, one sees completely jammed roads, with vehicles bumper to bumper as people try to use cars, buses and motorcycles to get to work, and practically empty train tracks. The way in which the railways are currently run means that few trains an hour can be operated on those tracks. Typically, only 24 trains an hour can run given the existing technology. We need to operate far more than that to deal with peak hour demand. The railway is better for that than for dealing with off-peak demand because frequent services are required to make rail travel attractive. The best green advantages and time advantages of using the railways are obtained at peak times because the roads are congested and therefore polluting more. We need much more peak time rail travel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80108-0010.htm_para30"><a name="08010891000026">How do we achieve that? There is an easy answer in the short term, before the technology and structure are fundamentally changed. If lighter weight trains are used, more of them can be run because they accelerate and brake more quickly. That happens on many networks abroad. In Britain, our system is over-engineered and heavy. Other hon. Members have referred to the complexity and absurdity of many of the rules for taking possession of the track for engineering works. I agree, but there is another set of rules for operating a railway that militates against using modern, state-of-the-art lighter weight trains, which are perfectly safe when used elsewhere and mean that more trains an hour can be operated.</p>

It would be a great prize, which Ministers might like, if one could run, for example, 40 rather than 24 trains an hour. I hope that they will take seriously the proposition that, if one used trains that can speed up and slow down more rapidly&#151;of course, signalling changes would also be required to deal with that, but they could be made within the system budgets; it would be much cheaper than building new track&#151;a big improvement in the railways could be achieved. My hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) pointed out that under this Government the railway is going in the opposite direction&#151;unless one lives at a terminus or near a large principal station on a main line, all the expensive works may lead to a deterioration in the service because the fast trains may not stop in one&#146;s town or city. The fast trains occupy much track space and time because they need good clearances for a long time for safety reasons  <br>

We do not feel that the railway industry is ours, except when it needs someone to pay the bills, and we do not feel that, managed by the effectively nationalised monopoly of Network Rail, it is customer friendly.

 There is no doubt that the rail industry in the UK is challenged by its own success. The 40 per cent. increase in passenger numbers that we have witnessed over the past 10 years and the projected continued growth in numbers is something that the rail industry in general and the Government need to respond to positively. I am delighted that the Government have indeed responded positively, with the White Paper recognising the need for continued investment in the railways, both in the short term, through the provision of longer carriages and longer platforms to accommodate them and the renewal of many outdated stations in order to make the facilities that they provide more fitting for the numbers being carried, and in some of the major projects in which the Government are investing, such as at Birmingham New Street station and in Reading, as well as Crossrail, which we debated comparatively recently, in which &#163;16 billion is being invested.</p>

The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) talked about Railtrack, the predecessor organisation, having been&#151;I think I quote him correctly&#151;&#147;rudely terminated&#148;. However, there were few in this Chamber or elsewhere who shed tears at its termination. Whatever one thinks of the overall effect of the rail industry&#146;s privatisation&#151;whether one thinks, as I do, that the whole thing was botched and resulted in fragmentation, or whether one thinks otherwise&#151;there are few who mourned Railtrack&#146;s passing or who, having looked at the performance of what replaced it over the past few years, would fail to see Network Rail as a significant improvement. That said, I and all right hon. and hon. Members would acknowledge that the experience of rail passengers over recent weeks is intolerable and must never be repeated.</p>

We are undoubtedly at a time when rail is again seen as a mode of transport for the future. We were all heartened by the enthusiasm generated by the completion of St. Pancras and the linking of High Speed 1 to the station, as well as by the potential for the benefits of that to be fully exploited. Many of us also feel considerable frustration that the Government cannot as yet commit to further high speed lines throughout the UK, to take advantage of the enthusiasm generated by St. Pancras and the linking of High Speed 1 to it.</p>

Network Rail has much to be proud of, in how it has delivered for the passenger and on behalf of the people of Britain, and how it responded to the Government&#146;s agenda. However, it undoubtedly also has much to learn from the events of recent weeks. One can only hope that the investigation that the Government have instigated into those events will enable them to learn for the future and to deliver, as I hope we all expect they will do, in the months and years to come.</p>

 I want to make a brief contribution. Oddly, I want to put in a small word of praise for Network Rail&#151;I say &#147;oddly&#148;, because there are plenty of negatives that I could mention, such as delays and costs on the west coast main line, as well as the lack of interest in Lime Street station, Liverpool&#146;s main rail terminus, in the city&#146;s capital of culture year. I could also mention the muted support for the Merseyside dock expansion and the unforgivable opposition to the vertical integration of Merseyrail, as well as the extraordinary salaries paid to Network Rail&#146;s top executives. I want to park all that and be positive, although not simply because Network Rail is currently spending &#163;6 million on Southport railway station.</p>

For years after that, all we got was retrenchment and battening down the hatches. Anyone who approached Network Rail in those days with a suggestion for rail would get a lecture about bringing down costs and running existing track efficiently&#151;in fact, about mere coping. In those days, a business case for rail expansion was viewed as a contradiction in terms&#151;an oxymoron, something best left to the dreams of anoraks. Now, however, as a result of the rail utilisation strategies&#151;I believe I am the first to mention them&#151;Network Rail has moved. It has done so ever so tentatively, but it has moved, and on to the front foot. It seems to recognise that small-scale improvements and small adjustments to networks can add functionality, capacity and utility to the rail system, bringing with them passengers, profitability and environmental and economic gain. It will probably cost less than the small change from Crossrail&#151;I welcome the fact some of my fellow victims from Crossrail are in their places today&#151;and will in all probability deliver huge gains for the region.</p>

Were this in London, such connectivity would have been delivered decades ago, but because it is in the north-west, it is a struggle to get it done.

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) who, in a very long but worthwhile speech, made a huge contribution to the debate. He assessed the position of our railways over a number of years and put forward some firm propositions about how to run a more effective railway service than we do now. I happen to agree with my right hon. Friend. I believe that we need to put track and rail together and go back to the regional railways that we used to have before nationalisation. That would create co-ordination and an identity that would dramatically improve the morale of the UK rail network. I also commend my right hon.

I asked that question because my own station of Macclesfield is going to suffer. I explained in my intervention that Arriva Trains, which has taken over the cross-country services that were previously run by Virgin Rail, is cutting local services, preventing trains going to Manchester to the north and Birmingham to the south from stopping at Macclesfield because the track is required for the increased number of inter-city trains that will be travelling much faster from Manchester to London. That strategy leaves out certain important profit centres such as Macclesfield.</p>

 Of course, I agree with my very good and honourable Friend. He is making the same point as our hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. Rugby is also going to have fewer services because many more passenger trains are going to sweep through Rugby, sweep through Lichfield, sweep through Nuneaton and sweep through Macclesfield on the way from Manchester to London. That is letting down the people who are based in important profit centres en route and it is not offering the best or best value-for-money use of our rail infrastructure. The Minister must have an influence over these matters. It is no good saying that it is all up to Arriva Trains or Virgin Rail. By the way, I note that Virgin is very unhappy about losing the franchise in the north-west.

I have sought to put Network Rail in touch with the borough council and the county council in Macclesfield in order to treble the parking spaces. If we are to get people out of their cars, as the Government say they want to, not just for long journeys like Macclesfield to London but also for journeys like Macclesfield into Manchester, having more parking spaces will become even more important in the future.</p>

It was thought provoking and extremely well argued. We were also fortunate enough to hear from my right hon.

that some may wish to forget: that the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) praised privatisation for increasing passenger traffic. My right hon. Friend was, of course, right to point out the Network Rail is the creation of this Government. At the heart of his reasoning&#151;which is why it was so correct&#151;was the fact that Network Rail has &#163;18 billion of debt guaranteed by the Government, and relies on the Government for its revenue subsidy.</p>

Member for Lewes with which I strongly agreed was the part in which he said that the Government had not focused on capacity. The speech from his colleague, the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), was succinct and positive. I wondered whether the positive element was caused by the fact that so much was being spent on capacity improvements at Southport, but I am sure it would be ungenerous of me to suggest that that was the only cause.</p>

She was honest enough to state that she favoured public ownership&#151;not a sentiment that will necessarily endear her to those on her Front Bench or, indeed, guarantee her promotion. The hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), who also seems to have disappeared, spoke of the lack of Sunday and holiday services. The hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby), who is present, expressed some disappointment with Network Rail, but complained that he had heard no alternative suggested from the Conservative Front Bench. I cannot remember too many alternatives coming from the Front Bench of his party when it was in opposition, but I can give him the glad tidings that we are undertaking a rail review. We are taking our time over it, and coming up with measured, costed proposals that he will be able to see later this year.</p>

The motion calls on the Government to take steps to make Network Rail more accountable and efficient, and that is only right. Even this &#147;not me, guv&#148; Government must accept that they created Network Rail, and that if Network Rail is failing they must correct it and take some responsibility.</p>

Regulation to take enforcement action against the likely disruption over that period. In other words, the problems on the west coast main line and Liverpool Street did not come out of the blue; they were anticipated and expected. The question to which we have failed to receive any answer, and which must be answered by the Office of Rail Regulation inquiry, is &#147;Why did Network Rail not act at that stage?&#148; Why did it not reschedule lesser works so that thousands of people would not be disrupted and uncompensated?</p>

One of the questions that the Minister might wish to answer is &#147;When did the Secretary of State know of the likely problems?&#148; Did she know before Christmas, and did she speak to Mr. Coucher then? If she did not&#151;given the clear statement by Passenger Focus and others that there would be problems over the new year&#151;she has been negligent.</p>

During the current financial year alone, they have experienced 150,000 hours of delay. Perhaps the Minister will answer the question that the Secretary of State chose not to answer: do the Government still believe that the west coast main line upgrade will be delivered by December 2008, and if not, when do they expect it to be delivered?</p>

He also declared that Network Rail had not delivered on assurances that it had given him before Christmas. The Minister might care to address the following questions. Why could Network Rail not predict the likely problems at Liverpool Street? If it did predict them, whom did it tell and what did the Department do about it? This was a failure of project management systems. Who was in charge? When did Mr. Coucher tell the Department? When did Mr. Coucher know, and when did Mr. Henderson, the engineering director, know? Whom did he tell, and when? When did the Secretary of State know, and what action did she take? The short answer to the second part of that question must be &#147;none&#148;.</p>

The trouble is that for all the comments about learning lessons, it was not an isolated incident. Even as we stand here today, there are Network Rail overruns in Scotland. There are systemic problems with Network Rail that need to be addressed: its efficiency, its accountability, its priorities and the way in which it delivers services to passengers.</p>

Rail Authority, and then created Network Rail. We were led to believe in a brave new world created by the Government: never again would there be an incident, never again would there be overruns, and never again would there be accidents. What nonsense! Network Rail has had a history of overruns and accidents. In the last two years alone, its record reads like a catalogue of mismanagement, inefficiency and incompetence. In March 2006 it was fined for failing to provide proper information to other TOCs. In September to October 2006 there were derailments at Waterloo, where the rail accident investigation branch catalogued a failure of reporting and fault management systems and supervision errors, and at Greyrigg. In March 2007, it was fined for overruns at Paddington.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80108-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08010891000078">In July 2007, Network Rail was fined &#163;2.5 million for failing to complete re-signalling at Portsmouth. At that point, the ORR concluded that Network Rail had failed adequately to evaluate and mitigate the risks associated with the project. That might sound rather familiar to constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, for that appears to be exactly what happened there over the new year. Far from learning any lessons, Network Rail seems to have failed to address those lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80108-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08010891000079">Mr. Coucher&#151;following the lead of the Government, who seem to say, &#147;It&#146;s not our fault, it is always someone else&#146;s&#148;&#151;has sought to blame his contractors. This is feeble at best and disingenuous at worst. It is feeble because these projects have long lead times, contractors need to procure supplies and TOCs need up to 15 months&#146; notice. If that were so, the question we should be asking is whether the complete scheme was identified on time and agreed, and what interaction Network Rail was having with its contractors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80108-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08010891000080">It is feeble to blame the contractors, partly because only a bad workman blames his tools. It also implies a complete failure of oversight, of management supervision and of management. The accident report for Waterloo shows that failures have happened whether functions have been taken in-house or not.</p>

 I am just coming to that point, but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield. Network Rail is not properly accountable and it needs to be made so, but do not take our word for it. This morning, one could have read Tom Winsor&#146;s remark that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80108-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08010891000088">Where else should accountability for Network Rail lie? Should it lie with the non-executives, who awarded themselves a pay rise of 18 per cent. on average last year and are supposed to be holding the executive body to account? In yesteryear, the then, and hopefully soon to be again, Labour Opposition used to lecture us about fat cats. At least those privatised companies delivered. In the world of new Labour, a failure to speak out or to provide accountability earns people a self-awarded 18 per cent. pay increase. Causing disruption to thousands of people earns the chief executive a &#163;466,000 salary and &#163;76,000 in bonus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80108-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08010891000089">The short answer is that Network Rail is not a private sector company but a public sector one. This Government created Network Rail. The Secretary of State today has sought to hide behind the ORR. It is typical of an exhausted Government, clamouring for any credit they can find but shirking any responsibility. The Secretary of State failed to answer the key questions today. When did she know? What action did she take? Increasingly, she is a Secretary of State out of touch with the needs of the travelling public. Network Rail is in danger of hitting the buffers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80108-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08010891000090">If, after the new year chaos, the travelling public and the TOCs view Network Rail as not fit for purpose, that is equally so of the Government and the Secretary of State. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that Network Rail works. It is a failure: the failure of the Government. The travelling public, who suffered fare increases of up to 14 percent and often travel in sub-human overcrowded trains, deserve and have a right to expect better.</p>

Passengers have paid the price for the mistakes made and that is unacceptable, as both sides of the House accept. The hon.

Nothing would please the Conservative party more than to have Network Rail painted as the same basket case as Railtrack. It is simply not the case.</p>

It was Network Rail that helped push performance up by more than 10 per cent. as measured by the industry standard public performance measure. It is the outstanding engineering experience of Network Rail that is leading renewal and expansion of the rail network at Birmingham New Street, at Reading, on the west coast main line and through Thameslink.</p>

He can search the Library and the online version of <i> Hansard </i>as much as he likes, but he will not find any comment by me encouraging&#151;or dictating to&#151;people to get out of their cars. It is the Government&#146;s intention to provide people with informed choices, and to allow them to make decisions about which modes to use. The fact that 40 per cent. more people are using the railways today than 10 years ago says a great deal about the stewardship of the railways under this Government.</p>

There would indeed be fewer network rail possession overruns under a Conservative Government, and that would be for one very obvious reason: there would be far fewer engineering works. The west coast main line upgrade, Thameslink, Crossrail, Reading, Birmingham New Street&#151;funding for all those projects, which are so vital for the expansion of the railway, simply would not be guaranteed under a Conservative Government.</p>

There we have Tory transport policy to date: train companies do not like paying premiums. I wonder how the hon. Lady came to that conclusion&#151;perhaps she commissioned research from the university of the blindingly obvious? Of course they would prefer not to pay premiums, but if a train operating company is making large profits on a franchise given to it by the Government, why should not some of the profits go back into the transport budget? That is what is happening. However, like her predecessor on the Front Bench, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), the hon. Lady wants TOCs to be given subsidy only from the public purse, regardless of how profitable a franchise might be. The disappearance of those premiums would present a net loss to the rail budget, so where would the cuts fall?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80108-0013.htm_para0"><a name="080108101000020">Let us turn to the Opposition motion, which states that Network Rail should be held more accountable&#151;more accountable than what? Should it be more accountable than its predecessor, Railtrack, perhaps? How accountable was that organisation, set up by a failing Tory Government to oversee the decline of the  <br>

railways&#151;an organisation whose first priority was not maintaining the railways in a safe manner, but providing dividends to its shareholders? The hon. Lady waxes lyrical about the injustices of poor TOCs having to pay some of the profits back into the rail budget, but I have yet to hear her complain about Railtrack shareholders receiving their dividends while track maintenance was ignored and lives were put at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80108-0013.htm_para1"><a name="080108101000021">How should Network Rail be held more accountable, according to the hon. Lady? That point was ably made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South. Her remarks earlier today shed no light on the matter. It was up to Eddie Mair on the BBC Radio 4 &#147;PM&#148; programme last week to elicit some details, and we are all grateful to him for that. Eddie Mair asked, &#147;How would you fix what you clearly believe are structural problems in the railways?&#148; The hon. Lady replied, &#147;Well, we&#146;re looking at a range of options to ensure that Network Rail does become more accountable to its customers.&#148; Eddie Mair then asked, &#147;What are the options for making Network Rail more accountable?&#148; The hon. Lady said, &#147;Well, we&#146;re looking at a range of options at the moment. We&#146;re carrying out a rail review, which we will be publishing shortly.&#148; Eddie Mair&#146;s next question was, &#147;But can you give us no further ideas?&#148; The hon. Lady responded, &#147;There are a range of options we are looking at, but I can&#146;t give you details as yet, but they will be published shortly.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80108-0013.htm_para2"><a name="080108101000022">The hon. Member for Wimbledon said in his summing up that the Conservative rail policy will be published later this year. I think he also said the same thing last year&#151;he said then that it would be published later in the year. So, that is clear then: the Conservative party regrets to announce the late arrival of its railways policy and any inconvenience that that may cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80108-0013.htm_para3"><a name="080108101000023">We have an expanding railway. We have record passenger numbers totalling more than 1 billion in the past three years. We have cheaper regulated fares in this country than we had 10 years ago. We have the youngest train fleet in Europe. For the first time in 50 years, we have a Government who are actually able to plan for expansion in our railways. A Conservative party which created Railtrack and starved the rail industry of vital investment is in no position to give lessons to this Government.</p>

 We now come to the debate on higher education and adult learners. I have to announce that Mr. Speaker has selected the amendment in the name of the Prime Minister. I remind the House that there will be a 10-minute limit on Back-Bench contributions to the debate.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80108-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="08010898001287"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House is concerned that the Government&#146;s decision to withdraw funding from institutions for equivalent or lower qualification students will have a disproportionate impact on the part-time sector in general and on specific institutions such as Birkbeck and the Open University; and urges the Government to consider ways in which it can minimise the damage this measure will do to lifelong learning and the delivery of the Leitch agenda objectives.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08010898001127">Although that is the motion, it is really early-day motion 317, which is a cross-party motion tabled by the two Members who represent Milton Keynes, where the Open university is situated&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) and the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey). That early-day motion has collected more signatures than any other motion before the House. The official Opposition are simply a modest vehicle to ensure that the House has an opportunity to debate and vote on that excellent motion. The Prime Minister has claimed that he believes in radical constitutional reform, but I doubt that even he envisaged anything as radical as a non-partisan Opposition day debate on a cross-party motion. Let us see how we get on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08010898001128">First, let me help the Secretary of State with a little problem that I think he has recognised. It seems that his amendment to our motion is seriously defective and is not an accurate account of the Government&#146;s policy. I hope that he will correct the record, either now or during his speech, and amend his amendment so that it gives a more accurate account of his Government&#146;s policy. If we cannot rely on the Government to table an amendment that is an accurate account of their policy, we should not be surprised that they got into such a muddle.</p>

<p><a name="st_o258"><a name="08010898001129"><a name="80108-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="08010898002408"><b>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry) (Con):</b>
 Has my hon. Friend noticed that the second objective of the Secretary of State&#146;s new Department is to:</p>
<a name="80108-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="08010898001288"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Improve the skills of the population throughout their working lives&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08010898001130">Without prejudice to my hon. Friend&#146;s speech, does he not think that it would have been helpful if, instead of bringing forward these measures, the Secretary of State had deferred consideration until after the comprehensive review of student support in 2009, which is only next year, and had then consulted on its conclusions?</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="08010898001131"><a name="80108-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="08010898002409"><b>Mr. Willetts:</b>
 I totally agree with that excellent intervention, which was based on the excellent early-day motion. There has been such support for that early-day motion because of the enormous respect on both sides of the House for the work done by the Open university, Birkbeck college and other institutions across the country in providing educational opportunities to mature part-time students, and especially to women, giving people a second chance in life regardless of what they have studied in the past.</p>

<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>8 Jan 2008 : Column 224</b><br>

<p><a name="st_o260"><a name="08010898001132"><a name="80108-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="08010898002410"><b>Robert Key (Salisbury) (Con):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend not think it odd that, at a time when the Government are increasingly saying that the faith communities are important, the new regulations will impinge on the training of priests, imams and rabbis? In the Church of England alone they will add at least &#163;500,000 to the cost of training priests.</p>

<p><a name="st_o261"><a name="08010898001133"><a name="80108-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="08010898002411"><b>Mr. Willetts:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right. Many people who share his concern about education will have received a host of representations from a variety of professions that often recruit and train people who have already done a degree in a different subject. I think that some 75 per cent. of ordinands in the Church of England study theology after they have studied a separate degree. Those are exactly the groups that will be affected by the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08010898001134">Harold Wilson famously believed that the Open university was one of his greatest achievements. Some on this side of the House might say that it was one of his few achievements. Nevertheless, it was a Labour creation. That might be one reason that we welcome so many Labour Members to the debate. The Prime Minister is proud of having taught at the Open university. We ask all hon. Members, especially Labour Members, to be true to the principles of their party and its historic achievements, and to be true to themselves by voting for a motion that many of them have already signed up to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08010898001135">Of course, although the debate will focus on the Open university and Birkbeck college, the decision has a much wider application. The Government are proposing that students who already have a degree qualification should not receive any support if they return to university. We are talking not about grants or loans, as the regime governing them is already much tougher for returning students, but about the removal of Higher Education Funding Council teaching support for any university that takes on returning students. For the first time, home students on approved courses at English universities will not get even a contribution towards teaching costs. They will be treated as though they were from China.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08010898001136">That is an unprecedented shift in the pattern of higher education financing. I believe that such a decision should have been taken only after a serious review of its implications, and that it should have been considered alongside all the other issues connected with the future of university fees that legislation already requires us to look at in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="08010898001137"><a name="80108-0014.htm_spnew6"><a name="08010898002412"><b>Mr. Gordon Marsden (Blackpool, South) (Lab):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman mentioned the 2009 settlement, but the proposal under discussion is part of the existing settlement. Will he share with the House how he would substitute for the &#163;100 million that the proposal will produce, given that his party&#146;s record on higher education funding before 1997 was so abysmal?</p>

 My argument is very simple. It is that the Government&#146;s decision should be sent for review, and perhaps considered as part of the 2009 review of fees. The HEFC budget amounts to &#163;7.5 billion, and the Government have no reason to impose a cut worth only &#163;100 million.</p>

 We are talking about an HEFC budget of &#163;7.5 billion. For reasons that have left most people baffled and confused, the Government have decided to take &#163;100 million away from mature students who already have a degree qualification and to use that money for some other, unspecified, purpose. We believe that that decision should be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o266"><a name="08010898001141"><a name="80108-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="08010898002416"><b>Mr. David Chaytor (Bury, North) (Lab):</b>

 The Government&#146;s decision was announced last September. The relevant brief from the HEFC&#151;the Government&#146;s own quango&#151;was last updated on 11 December. It takes the form of questions and answers, and one question was how the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills intended to use the money saved from withdrawing funding for ELQs&#151;that is, students with equivalent or lower qualifications. The response was:</p>
<a name="80108-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="08010898001289"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Secretary of State has confirmed that any savings made from withdrawing funding for ELQs will be available for HEFC to redistribute according to agreed priorities yet to be decided.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08010898001143">That was two and a half months after the reduction was announced, and yet the &#147;agreed priorities&#148; were &#147;yet to be decided&#148;. It seems to me that the decision was taken in haste, and that we are in danger of having to repent at leisure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08010898001144">The Government argue that people with a degree who return to study must be hit so that new students can be helped. Of course, the Opposition want more new students to participate in higher education, but the Government&#146;s argument rests on a false dichotomy. The Government often cite the Leitch report but, as has been noted already, that deals with lifelong learning, which is about both reskilling and upskilling. To say that we must penalise people who are reskilling to make available money for new students who are upskilling is to fail completely to understand what the Leitch agenda of lifelong learning is all about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08010898001145">Labour Members may not want to take my word on that, so perhaps I should quote what the Prime Minister said in a speech on this subject in May 2006. Talking about his approach to lifelong education, he said that it should be &#147;recurrent&#148;, &#147;permanent&#148; and on offer to anyone at any time. We are simply trying to hold the Government to account over a statement that the Prime Minister made about his approach to the matter. He made a commitment that all adults</p>
<a name="80108-0014.htm_brev4"><a name="08010898001290"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should have access to training and vocational opportunities throughout their working lives.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08010898001146">We believe that that commitment clearly matters to the Prime Minister. It matters to the many Labour Members who have signed the early-day motion, and it is a commitment that the House should reflect in the vote to be taken later tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08010898001147">However, instead of that vision of lifelong learning, we now have what has been called the &#147;measles&#148; theory of education&#151;get it once, get it early and try never to have it again.

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08010898001148">Among the losers would be a person who had studied medicine at university and would now like to study cognitive therapy. I saw that the Secretary of State for Health was here briefly a little earlier. He has launched an initiative to try to ensure that there is more access to cognitive therapy on the NHS. However, people who already have a medical degree and who wish to study cognitive therapy and deliver the Government&#146;s objectives will be penalised by the policy under discussion this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08010898001149">In addition, a person who wants to do a post-graduate certificate in education will get funding, but someone who wants to get a qualification to teach in the FE sector will not, even though the Government are supposed to value the FE sector and to want to see it expanded. Moreover, a person with an engineering degree who wants to use his expertise in business and to study for an MBA will not be funded, even though we are supposed to want to encourage innovation and enterprise in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08010898001150">Another loser would be a woman with a degree in French who may have taken time out of the labour market to raise children. If she now wanted to do a higher education IT course&#151;it does not even have to be at a university&#151;she would not get any support from the HEFC. Let us be clear: some of the biggest losers as a result of the Government&#146;s policy will be women who want to return to the labour market after a long period away.</p>

 We believe that the current regime should be retained, pending a review of the Government&#146;s proposal. We should be happy for such a review to be held, and indeed the relevant legislation on higher education finances makes it clear that the fee regime should be reviewed in 2009.

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08010898001156">The Government announced their decision on this matter with no consultation.

 This is the false dilemma that has got the Government into such a muddle. Large numbers of British citizens historically had a right to go to university and study on approved courses, without any grants or loans but at least with HEFC support for their teaching costs. The decision that, for the first time in the history of British higher education, a group of people should not receive finance even for their teaching costs because they have a first degree is a significant one. I personally think that many such people are deserving. Many of them are women wishing to return to work. Many of them are trying to enhance their skills or change their career.

can help a new student is by penalising a group who have benefited not only themselves but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) said, the wider society and economy by returning to university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08010898001164">The Government say, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. It&#146;s all going to be fine because many returners will be financed by their employer.&#148; But often one of the main reasons that people study is that they wish to change their career and their employer. In fact, one of the things that Birkbeck, the Open university and other institutions say is that sometimes they have students who do not wish their employer to know that they are studying because it is a prelude to changing the direction of their career. So the idea that someone can go to their employer and say, &#147;I have decided that I want to leave my current employment and do something totally different. By the way, the Government have just slapped an extra charge on me. Would you mind contributing to my studies?&#148; is fanciful. It is not just us who are saying this; we are simply speaking on behalf of the experts and institutions affected across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80108-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08010898001165">On this occasion, the point has been made clearly by the director general of the Confederation of British Industry. He said:</p>
<a name="80108-0014.htm_brev6"><a name="08010898001292"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No doubt there will be real interest in the possibilities of cofunding now being developed by the Government. ...

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08010898001167">So employers are not saying that they will be willing to finance courses, because the people who want to do a second degree are often people who are trying to change the direction of their life. Many of them come specifically to London because they want to embark on a new career. It is why so many of the institutions that will be most severely affected are in London and why it is a great pleasure to see my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) here in the Chamber. I suspect that this may be something that he wishes to touch on if he succeeds in catching your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08010898001168">So the policy affects London; it affects women returning to work; but above all it affects part-time students. In fact, 20 per cent. of part-time students will be hit by the Government&#146;s proposal as against perhaps 2 per cent. of full-time students. This proposal thus has a 10 times greater effect on part-time students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08010898001169">Again, in trying to continue in the spirit of cross-party openness on this issue, we have to recognise on both sides of the House that we have given part-time students a raw deal. We have not cracked the challenge of how we improve the deal, given the amount of money involved, but we all know that part-time students have a raw deal compared with full-time students. That seems to be a shared analysis.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises another important aspect of this tangled debate. I am trying to keep it simple. It seems to me very simple indeed. There is an excellent early-day motion; it has been signed by more Members than any other. It is a cross-party motion brought before the House by two hon. Members in opposite parties. It has been signed by hon. Members from all parties. We would simply like the House to vote for it tonight. That seems to be the right approach.

Many marriage guidance counsellors trained for marriage guidance having previously obtained a degree. Relate estimates that 70 per cent. of the people it trains have a previous degree and that withdrawal of funding would reduce the institute&#146;s funding by a quarter. Did the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills realise that he was doing that to the finances of Relate when he launched his policy without consultation? I very much doubt it. Did he know what he was going to do to pharmacists? Has he seen the letter from the Council of University Heads of Pharmacy, which says that universities train as pharmacists people who have a previous university degree and that his proposal would have a major impact on students studying for the Master of Pharmacy degree and seriously undermine the School of Pharmacy and other schools of pharmacy across the country? Was the Secretary of State aware of that when he took this decision? What were the Government up to?</p>

The Secretary of State may come to the Chamber now and announce more exemptions, but I do not like the game of exempting some subjects but not others and making invidious decisions that some courses are desirable and others are not. This is a fundamental change in the way in which higher education is financed in this country and it should be reviewed as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08010898001174">The Secretary of State may offer support for particular institutions. He will know of course of the powerful feeling on both sides of the House about the Open university and Birkbeck, but some cobbled together package to help with the transitional costs of one or two institutions would fail to rise to the nature of the problem that he has created. Perhaps I can quote from a letter to <i> The Guardian</i> from the president of the National Union of Students and 27 others on  21 November. It states:</p>
<a name="80108-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="08010898001294"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Funding Council&#146;s consultation is restricted to implementation, but broadening exemptions won&#146;t solve the problems. With no public consultation on the principle, no evidence base on the outcome and a real danger of damage to the lifelong-learning agenda, the sensible way forward is for Ministers to defer implementation in 2008 and refer this policy to the 2009 Fees Commission for the proper scrutiny which it deserves.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08010898001180">The reality is that the principle behind the proposal was announced in September. Since then, the Higher Education Funding Council for England has carried out a consultation, which was completed on, I think,  7 December. Ministers expect to receive advice from HEFCE on the proposals in the near future. I cannot anticipate the results of that, but clearly there has been a consultation. Those with an interest, and the universities, institutions and courses mentioned in tonight&#146;s debate, have had the opportunity to respond to that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08010898001188">Let us all be clear: there is no cut to overall higher education funding. Spending on higher education will remain at the record levels established by this Labour Government. By 2010-11 there will have been an increase in Government spending of over 30 per cent. in real terms since 1997-98, and there will be 2 per cent. real growth per annum over the next three years. Of course, in sharp contrast, between 1989 and 1997, when the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) was a Minister, state funding per student fell by 36 per cent.</p>

 I accept what the Secretary of State is saying, as far as the global budget is concerned, but does he not appreciate that if he carries on with the proposals, there will be unintended consequences? I have received a letter from a constituent, Chris Holden, who wants to be ordained. He gained a degree from Lancaster university a few years ago. He recognises that if the funding disappears, there will be an enormous impact. Does the Secretary of State recognise that there will be unintended consequences if the Government carry on with the proposals?</p>

 One of the reasons for holding a consultation is to ensure that Ministers understand the consequences. That is why one consults. An initial idea is always put forward, so that we can find out the detailed reaction. I notice that the hon. Gentleman did not make the obvious point that I would make: today, the choices available to the House and to people who want to enter higher education are vastly greater than when the Conservatives were in power. The Opposition have still not acknowledged the damage that they did to higher education in their time in office.</p>

That money will not be lost to the system. It will be redirected to fund more university places for first-time learners, or learners progressing to a higher level of qualification. Up to 20,000 full-time equivalent students&#151;and so, in reality, far more students, some of them studying part time&#151;will have the chance to start a first degree or higher level course in the first three years. That sets the right priority for individual opportunity, and for the country.</p>

As the noble Lord Leitch made clear, to be in the premier league for skills, our country will need 40 per cent. of working-age adults to have a level 4 qualification by 2020. Today, 20 million working-age adults do not have a degree-level qualification. An extra 5 million people will need to go through university by 2020 if we are to be even on the edge of the premier league for world-class skills. Lord Leitch not only set out the challenge, but was clear about the priorities for funding: the higher the qualification, the greater the level of individual or employer contribution. He argued that that was fair, given the benefits for individuals and employers who gain higher-level skills. Those principles are being applied across the adult education system.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for giving way to me a second time, but I am still confused about how the problem came about. He mentioned &#163;100 million. Did he ask the HEFCE to find him  &#163;100 million, and if so, why is he now consulting on how to spend it, or did the HEFCE randomly decide to cut &#163;100 million from its own budget?</p>

 The position on that is clear, and is on the public record. I wrote in early September, asking for the HEFCE&#146;s advice on how to prioritise funding towards those who had not previously had the chance of higher education. That letter is in the public domain, so there should be no confusion about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08010898001196">Let me give some background. Over the next  10 years or so, the number of young people available to go to higher education will fall by about 100,000. There will need to be a massive expansion of higher education opportunities for adults who have already left school, and who never had the chance to go to university; perhaps they did not think it was for them. Most of them will study part time, rather than full time. It is those people whom the Government want to benefit from the change in priorities. I believe that they should be the first priority for a Labour Government. But of course I recognise that it is not as simple as that. There are people who have had higher education, perhaps 20 years ago&#151;perhaps women who have taken time out to have a family. It is necessary to develop the work force that the country needs. The measures on which the HEFCE has consulted offer a balanced way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08010898001197">For those who wish to have vocational retraining because their qualifications are out of date, foundation degrees are protected. They will continue to attract ELQ funding. For those wishing to study science, maths, engineering, modern languages, education, some medical disciplines and other strategically important subjects, ELQ funding is protected. For those wishing to top up their qualification, perhaps from a higher national diploma to an honours degree, ELQ funding is protected. For those whose employers will co-fund their courses, ELQ funding is protected. In other words, many opportunities will remain open to those seeking to obtain higher qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80108-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08010898001198">Not everyone is covered, but for many of those, the value of investing in their own higher education will be well worth the cost of a subsidised career development loan, just as many people at lower levels of skill who have never had the chance of higher education also pay towards the cost of their qualifications.</p>

 I believe&#151;I shall return to this later&#151;that the Open university is probably better placed than many other institutions because of its style of work, the ways in which it can reach people who want to study from home or study part time, and its ability to design new courses to appeal to people who do not study there at present. It is true that not every course at the Open university is protected by that list, and clearly, there could not be a reprioritisation of funding if every course was protected. None the less, I am considering first and foremost whether the higher education system will protect a range of opportunities for people who wish to retrain in the way suggested in the debate, and I believe that the proposals do so.</p>

 My right hon. Friend rightly reminded the House of the emphasis that the Government have put on upskilling adults. The list of those who will be exempted is formidable and impressive, but will he ask the HEFCE to consider that there is an issue, particularly in our more fluid economy, in relation to self-employed people who may wish to take a further degree? They will not automatically be covered by the exemptions that he described.</p>

 I respect my hon. Friend&#146;s knowledge on the matter and would be happy to discuss it after the debate. [Hon. Members: &#147;Why not now?&#148;] Without prolonging the exchange, I am not entirely clear about the point that my hon. Friend is making. Many of the routes that I have described as being protected would be available to those who are self-employed. The particular route of co-funded courses, for obvious reasons, may not be available, but that was not by any means the only route that I proposed.</p>

 As a former Chairman of a Select Committee, I can hear myself making a similar argument if I were in my hon. Friend&#146;s position. The Government believe that it is important to press ahead with the beginnings of the change. If that is to be done, we must take decisions on a timetable that enables higher education to plan for next September. We cannot put ourselves in the hands of the Select Committee inquiry, because that is likely to put us beyond any reasonable time scale. We are, of course, interested in discussing issues with the Chairman and other members of the Select Committee and other knowledgeable and interested parties, but I cannot commit myself to the time scale that my hon. Friend has asked for, as we must make progress.</p>

 I do not want to be drawn into a topic-by-topic discussion of the list, because we have not yet received the report from the HEFCE. The point that the hon. Gentleman makes was made earlier. I acknowledged that there was an issue to be debated and I do not think that I should say more, because we genuinely have not taken decisions but we recognise the breadth of opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80108-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08010898001210">Having set out the issue of principle, I turn to an equally important issue&#151;practice. Can the change be made without the damage that some are claiming? It will undoubtedly mean change for every higher education institution. For some, including the Open university and Birkbeck, the change will be greater than for others, but the approach proposed by HEFCE is designed to ensure that institutions can respond, and that they are protected while they do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80108-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08010898001211">First, transitional protection will mean that no institution will lose money in cash terms against its 2007-08 baseline over the next three years. That protection would exist even if those institutions did not successfully attract a single additional student. Secondly, as I said, a range of courses are protected from the change. Less than a third of the ELQ budget will be reprioritised over the next three years. Thirdly, clear incentives are proposed to enable institutions to further protect existing funding and attract additional funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80108-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08010898001212">Courses that attract employer co-funding are protected and will continue to attract ELQ funding. Over the coming years we need to expand the number and range of employer co-funded provision. The Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education recently announced an additional &#163;100 million of co-funded higher education courses over the next three years. Employer take-up of that money will obviously be greatest where higher education institutions offer the courses that employers want to those employees who need to retrain on a part-time basis, who need to be able to study flexibly and who need to be able to study from home. Not only can the Open university and Birkbeck bid for those funds, but the way that they operate and the education that they offer means that they are particularly well placed to develop the higher education that employees, employers and the wider economy need.</p>

 What would my right hon. Friend say to the constituent who wrote to me this morning? As an 18-year-old, he had done a chemistry degree at Manchester and then served nearly 32 years as a probation officer&#151;not a high-earning occupation. He was looking forward to taking an interesting degree when he retired at 60, to stimulate him in his retirement. Under these rules, will such a thing be impossible for most older people?</p>

 As my hon. Friend well knows, in the past three years we have reprioritised funding, across the education system, from informal learning towards the qualifications and skills most directly needed in our economy. My hon. Friend will be familiar with the fact that that has happened in further education.</p>

I want that to range from the leisure course in the local community to higher levels of education. I hope that my hon. Friend will take what I have said as an acknowledgement of his point and a suggestion that how we have met such need in the past may not always be how we will meet it in future. But yes&#151;we need to find ways to meet that need, and in the next few weeks my hon. Friend will hear more about that from me and my Department.</p>

 The Secretary of State said that there is a three-year time scale for a number of elements on the menu of protections that he has identified. However, he has not mentioned any time limitation on protections for key courses and strategically important and vulnerable courses. Clearly, however, the Open university and others are briefing that those are also subject to a three-year time limitation. Will the Secretary of State take it from Members that we are not comforted and that three-year protections that work on a downward curve are no significant reassurance?</p>

 I am particularly concerned about suggestions that &#163;30 million or &#163;31 million is at stake at the Open university, as though the money will disappear from its budget tomorrow. Such suggestions assume a much wider reprioritisation than we propose at the moment and an absolute cut-off of transitional protection after three years. The HEFCE consultation merely covers the comprehensive spending review period, so none of those things should be taken for granted and our proposals should be assessed on the merits that we have put forward.</p>

 The Government have to take account of a number of criteria in deciding how to allocate funding, and my right hon. Friend has referred to some of them.

One of the critical issues is whether the resources allocated will end up delivering a qualification.</p>

 We have extremely good completion rates in higher education. If my hon.

In the past couple of days, I have done several radio interviews based on one of my own EDMs about Bristol Old Vic, which I invite colleagues to sign. People ask what is the point of an EDM; well, this is the point. EDM 317 has now been withdrawn as we are, in effect, discussing it tonight, but the Table Office informs me that 211 Members had signed it.

Of course, that settlement was made before the split and the setting up of the new Department, and I wonder whether this is a casualty of the disaggregation of the old DFES budgets. The change has been rushed through with little consultation. The Department&#146;s predecessor has form in that area, given that it announced, without any consultation at all with the higher education sector, that it was going to give foundation degree-awarding powers to colleges. It announced the decision and let everyone else sort out the details and deal with the implications. Once again, the higher education sector feels bounced. This decision will hurt its institutions financially, as well as individual students, some of whom will surely now decide that they are not going to go on to do an equivalent or lower qualification. That will undermine the Leitch agenda that the Government say that they are trying to achieve.</p>

I have the parliamentary Labour party briefing that has been circulated to help Labour Members to rebut the points that have been made by Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. If you do not mind, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will quote from it&#151;even though it says that I might be committing an offence by doing so, I believe that I am protected while I do it in this Chamber. There are some choice quotes. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I notice that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) is laughing; an institution based in her constituency is raising this concern with her and with all hon.

Students should be free to make their own decisions on what is necessary for them to increase their employability in the labour market, and if they need to study for an equivalent level qualification or for a lower level qualification, that is the choice that they should make and the choice that the higher education market should offer to them. It seems ludicrous to say that they could go away and study for a masters.</p>

The cost in question will be imposed on top of what they are already paying as a student. In effect, they will be treated like international students from outside the European Union. And while I am talking about the international aspect, what will the effect be on UK taxpayers who did their first degree at a foreign institution&#151;such as my new party leader, for instance? It looks as though they will be charged in the same way, even though it did not cost the British taxpayer anything. Surely that cannot be right. There will be anomalies within courses where people studying exactly the same course, sat next to each other in the same lecture theatre, could be paying nothing, or &#163;10,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08010898001271">There are also anomalies within the exempt courses. Medicine has been mentioned, but what about the professions allied to it? What about radiography, physiotherapy or psychology? My hon.

Stress in the workplace is important, and we need to deal with it to achieve the Leitch agenda and get more people back into work. However, none of those professions allied to medicine fall within the exemptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08010898001273">The changes will undermine the delivery of the Leitch recommendations. The 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force referred to in one of the most quoted parts of Leitch are already in work, and they will need the retraining implicit in the taking of an ELQ. The Open university tells us that 68 per cent. of its existing ELQ students are over the age of 35. They are precisely the people whom the Leitch report talks about&#151;people who will need to upskill at some point during their career. If a person is over 35, their first degree is clearly 15 years out of date. Birkbeck has specialised in the refreshing of adult skills since 1823, but it tells us that the proposal will fundamentally undermine its capacity to support Government policy. It provides several case studies, and I shall just mention one. Jayne Kavanagh got her degree in medicine in 1990, but in 2002 she went to Birkbeck in order to do a degree in philosophy. Birkbeck says:</p>
<a name="80108-0017.htm_brev7"><a name="08010898001311"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A degree in Philosophy might be regarded by many as an esoteric qualification, but...it has helped her to become lead in medial ethics and law at the Royal Free and University College Medical School&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08010898001275">The change may lead to some courses becoming unviable. The Open university and Birkbeck have provided examples and many other higher education institutions, including Bristol university, have made representations to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08010898001276">The change will be especially felt by smaller institutions, particularly specialist institutions. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education has given several examples. The Conservatoire for Dance and Drama will suffer a 26 per cent. cut in its core teaching income. The Institute of Cancer Research  will experience a drop in its core teaching income of 19.5 per cent., which undermines the publicity that the Prime Minister received for his new found enthusiasm for prevention being better than cure. In an Act last year, the Government gave further education colleges foundation degree awarding powers, yet their provision for full-time higher education honours courses could be undermined because they tend to be few in number. There is a lack of joined-up thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08010898001277">Switching &#163;100 million in the budget is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, which brings me to recognising the effect on the clergy that several hon. Members have mentioned. Westcott house in Cambridge and Trinity college in my constituency are examples of institutions that could be affected. They say that 60 per cent. of ordinands who go for training in the Church of England do not do their first degree in theology, so they clearly need to study a further course. Training for the priesthood is obviously not a Leitch target&#151;it must be one of the few things that does not have a target in the Leitch report.</p>

We should remove the distinction between full-time and part-time students, as happens in Australia. Our higher education funding system is modelled on that in Australia, with the exception of the anomaly that I outlined.</p>

We have heard much about the Labour Government&#146;s legacy in recent times. The Secretary of State ended his speech by citing the main legacy of the 1964-70 Government, led by the previous longest serving Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, as being the Open university. I am sure that right hon. Gentleman does not want to be the Secretary of State who damaged the Open university. Despite what he says, the Open university tells us that that is the implication of his policy announcement. Surely it would be better to delay implementation until 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08010898001281">Whenever I have taken part in such debates, the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education has said that it would be 2009 before  the Government understood all the implications of the changes that they have made in higher education in the past five years. He said that it is too early to tell whether the changes have had an adverse impact on applications&#151;indeed, too early to tell many things&#151;and that the Government would hold an in-depth review in 2009, as was promised when the Higher Education Act 2004 was being considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08010898001282">Given all that, why introduce such proposals now? Why are the Government subjecting themselves to such self-inflicted pain when a fundamental review will take place next year?

 Birkbeck college is in my constituency. It is one of many distinguished academic institutions in my constituency but most of the others provide full-time courses for undergraduates and graduates. Birkbeck provides full-time courses for graduates but mainly part-time courses for teaching people to study for first degrees or other, lower qualifications. Its undergraduates are not the usual 18 to 20-odd-year-olds;  <br>

they are people who work for a living during the day and study at Birkbeck in the evening. Unlike other undergraduates, they also pay tax, because they are working people, so when we talk about looking after taxpayers we are talking about them, among others. Those students show an amazing commitment to learning and a zeal for knowledge that puts to shame what I suspect most graduates in the Chamber&#151;that certainly includes me&#151;showed when we had the privilege of doing our full-time degree courses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para23"><a name="080108107000002">Some 2,600 of Birkbeck&#146;s part-time students already have degrees and are working for equivalent or lower qualifications. They include women who want to study again after taking time off to bring up children, people who have lost their jobs, people who are disabled and people whose first degree proved unsuitable or irrelevant to their current occupation. Nearly all Birkbeck&#146;s part-time students are seeking to upgrade their knowledge and skills. They include people in management who want to make further studies of personnel&#151;or human relations, as I believe it is called these days&#151;as well as people who feel the need to add IT or computer science skills to enable them to progress in their current occupation, and those, including doctors and nurses, who work with the elderly, the mentally ill or children in the day and want to study psychology to improve their ability to look after those people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para24"><a name="080108107000003">Generally, part-time students at Birkbeck are not doing flower arranging. They are studying serious subjects. They are doing what the Government want: upskilling themselves. They are setting an example for others, in respect of what the Prime Minister said he wanted when he talked about people needing not one chance but second, third, fourth and, indeed, lifelong chances. That is what Birkbeck has been providing since 1823, but the Government are stopping the funding of those courses, against a background of part-time students and what might be described as part-time institutions getting a raw deal, compared with full-time students and colleges that mainly deal with them. That has gone on for decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para25"><a name="080108107000004">The Government&#146;s decision means a reduction of about 1.6 per cent. for institutions providing full-time studies, but a reduction of about 16 per cent. for institutions providing part-time studies. The impact on institutions that provide part-time opportunities rather than full-time study is therefore 10 times greater. Yet the work of Birkbeck and other institutions that provide part-time courses is crucial to the Government&#146;s plans for widening participation. They are the very institutions on which much of the Government&#146;s strategy will depend. Indeed, Birkbeck recently opened what might be described as an outpost in Stratford, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown), in an effort to spread the opportunities and the benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para26"><a name="080108107000005">The Government have said that they will try to help Birkbeck and the others by making provision to tide them over, but that help is time limited. My understanding is that if those institutions are successful in obtaining alternative sources of income, the safety net will be reduced by however much their efforts succeed in securing. The question then is: where can they get the extra money from? Most part-time students and people who go to night classes are not very well off. They cannot get student loans, and their  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para27"><a name="080108107000006">I am therefore disappointed with the Government&#146;s decision, as well as concerned about it. There does not seem to have been much consultation before the outline decision was taken. I find it hard to believe that this is being done by good and decent people such as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. He is my friend and he is honourable, but he is not right; he is wrong on this occasion. I cannot believe that Ministers have seriously considered the impact of this change on individual institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para28"><a name="080108107000007">I was also perturbed to encounter a suggestion by one Minister that there were more than 250 higher education providers in England so that students could shop around for the best deal. That sounds rather like an &#147;on yer bike&#148; statement de nos jours, which fails to understand the position of the part-time student. For full-time students, study during the day is their main object, so they can shop around and go to where the course they want is provided, but it is not the same for part-time students, who work for a living during the day and study in the evenings. They cannot shop around; they have to stay where their job is; they are not as mobile as the average undergraduate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80108-0017.htm_para29"><a name="080108107000008">Setting aside the impact on students, are the Government seriously telling Birkbeck to go up market? That is plainly contrary to the Government&#146;s policy and Birkbeck&#146;s proud record for the past 185 years. It is also plainly contrary to Birkbeck&#146;s modern intentions, which included and led to the setting up of their outpost in Stratford, east London. I believe that its response has been very temperate. It is asking only for the Government to exempt more subjects from the cuts and to exempt people who are coming back for a second helping, so to speak, after being out of education for more than five years. That would exclude what might be described as the serial scholars. It is a perfectly reasonable request to make and I hope that further long-term support will be provided to Birkbeck and the other institutions to cope with the change in funding and to enable Birkbeck to continue what I regard as its noble past over those 185 years of providing teaching to working people who have a thirst for learning. It is not too late for the Government to reconsider at least the practical implications of what they are proposing.</p>

In 2003, for example, the OU helped in the middle east to set up and provide teaching materials for the Arab OU, which already has 30,000 students. Our Open university has paved the way and helped other countries to establish their own open universities to allow people all over the world to improve their academic records, which otherwise would have been too expensive or too time-restrictive to pursue. The OU has recently started talking to the Government of China to explore the benefits of collaboration on open and distance learning to meet the huge growth in demand for higher education, which its growing economy requires.</p>

For example, some 3,500 ELQ&#151;equivalent or lower level qualifications&#151;students have special needs and want to study on an equal platform with their peers. From the OU&#146;s earliest experiment in using the latest technology to take education right into people&#146;s lives via their TV sets, it has continued to pioneer ways of reaching ever more people in ever more places, using the almost limitless power of the digital age.</p>

How strange, then, that the OU should have been one of the principal victims of the decision to remove funding from those studying for courses that involve equivalent or lower qualifications.

In many cases, employers will not make up the lost funding. It is very rare for the employers of people who are trying to forge new career paths for themselves away from their current jobs to help fund their spirit and drive to better themselves. Under the proposed new funding system, people who went to university straight after school or college but left the workplace in later life to raise children or become carers of relatives will have their right to re-equip themselves for the rapidly evolving UK economy denied.</p>

There is a high risk that thousands of ELQ students studying for vocational reasons and paying their own way will be priced out of continuing professional development by the Government&#146;s ELQ policy. It is equally true that certain groups of students will be particularly affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para12"><a name="080108107000023">Research shows that employers have tended to offer support mainly to full-time workers from the wealthiest households. Part-time employees, the self-employed and those on low incomes will be disadvantaged, as will those such as carers who are temporarily out of employment. The Minister need not take my word for it; I have a few more quotes from current OU students:</p>
<a name="80108-0018.htm_brev6"><a name="080108107000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am a single mum trying to survive on a less than average public service salary in expensive London. These changes would effectively bar me from the opportunity to help myself.&#148;</p>

It will reduce resources available for core services at the OU and will jeopardise plans for growth and innovation. In financial terms the OU will lose funding for 25 per cent., or 29,000, of its 140,000 students in England from 2008, which combined with the HEFCE estimated loss of grant of &#163;32 million is a total lost or at risk in 2010 of some &#163;49 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para17"><a name="080108107000031">I welcome this opportunity to rehearse again the virtues of the Open university. I do not intend to do so at great length because many others have already done it, but it is a fantastic institution. It has made degree level courses available to a wide range of individuals whom conventional universities would not allow to take degrees. It has contributed over the years precisely to upskilling and skilling many who would otherwise have been trapped in very low-skill, low-paid careers. I understand that the OU&#146;s commitment is to make sure that it is able to continue in that role, and I simply intend to repeat the three major points that I have made directly to Ministers in meetings, most recently just before Christmas when my hon. Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education met me and two trade union representatives from the Open university. I understand that a final decision will be made on the detail of the proposals in mid-January.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para18"><a name="080108107000032">The first point relates to the list of exemptions. There are strong arguments, made when the trade union representatives met the Minister, about adding IT to the list. It is clear that individuals who took their first degrees about two decades ago are unlikely to be quite up to the minute on IT skills&#151;to put it mildly&#151;and that therefore there are strong reasons why individuals who already have one degree might wish to get another at the same level but in IT. When we spoke with the Minister, he was sympathetic to the arguments we made although, obviously, he felt unable to commit himself at this stage when the final announcement has not been made. I certainly hope that IT will be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para19"><a name="080108107000033">The second issue is employer co-funding. Employers, who gain enormous benefit when their employees are upskilled, should be expected to co-fund the training of their employees; that is highly desirable. There are lots of reasons why they should do so. If employers treat their employees well, on the whole their employees feel a sense of loyalty and tend to stay with them. Providing decent training helps not only to upskill their work force but to engender a feeling of loyalty among them towards their employer&#151;and, of course, the employer cashes in on the employee&#146;s experience of the firm or business and the way it works, instead of having to bring in somebody new who would not be familiar with that. Therefore, we should expect employers to co-fund more of the training of their employees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para20"><a name="080108107000034">However, a reasonable point was made by Open university people: although employers are often willing to co-fund the training of their senior staff, they can be a lot less keen to do so for middle-ranking staff. As what we are requiring is a comprehensive change in culture among businesses, Ministers ought to be a little more cautious about the speed at which they believe we might be able to persuade employers to change their culture. I therefore ask Ministers to consider phasing in these changes over a slightly longer period in order to see quite how successful they are at persuading employers to be more effective in funding training.</p>

 Can the hon. Lady give the House one reason why an employer would wish to support financially an employee to do an ELQ&#151;an equivalent or lower qualification&#151;when the outcome of that would be of no benefit to their business?</p>

 Obviously not, but that is a curious question to ask because I could throw it back by asking why an employer would not co-fund an employee&#146;s training if that training was going to benefit the employer<i> &#151;</i><i> [Interruption.] </i>I will get on to the point about people moving employer. In many cases, rather than looking to recruit more highly trained people from outside the business, an employer could be thinking of, so to speak, growing their own expertise by retraining individuals they already employ at a much lower level. That is perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para21"><a name="080108107000039">Employers will obviously not fund everybody, and they certainly will not fund people who actually desire just to go off to another employer, but that does not cover all cases, or even the majority necessarily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para22"><a name="080108107000040">The third issue has been alluded to: women returners. They are probably the largest single group who are likely to have taken a degree a long time ago, and which they have not been using recently as they have not been at work because of family responsibilities. Because they have not been at work, they do not have an employer to co-fund their training. Therefore, Ministers should consider the group of women returners in more detail as they are a special case. For a huge range of reasons&#151;not least those of equality, but also of making use of the skills and experience that such women can bring to the work force&#151;we ought to make sure that any proposals we put forward do not inadvertently militate against that group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para23"><a name="080108107000041">Those are the three points that trade union representatives made directly to the Minister, and which I wanted to repeat in the debate. I am confident that the Government will have been listening to the points people have made and to the feedback that the Higher Education Funding Council for England&#151;HEFCE&#151;has received from universities during the consultation period, and that the final proposals will not be the same as the original ones. If they were, they would be likely to cause unacceptable damage to the Open university and, presumably, to Birkbeck, which is an institution that I know less well, so I strongly urge Ministers not to bring back the original proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para24"><a name="080108107000042">As the hon. Member for Havant has now returned to the Chamber, I want to make a final remark about some of his comments on the general system of university funding. As someone who had been on the receiving end of it before becoming an MP, it seemed to me that some misdirection was being given to hon. Members who might be slightly less familiar with how HEFCE has, for some time, taken decisions on the priorities to be given to different subjects. An individual with qualifications does not have a right to have a place on a degree course and subject of their choosing just because they fancy it. That has never been the case in the British system, unlike the French system, where someone can turn up at a university, sign up to something whether or not sufficient places are available and engage in a ridiculous Darwinian survival of the fittest that has a huge wastage rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para25"><a name="080108107000043">HEFCE has always taken decisions on university funding. It decides which subjects it regards as being more necessary&#151;in the national interest&#151;than others and uses the funding accordingly. To suggest that expressing priorities is an outrageous departure<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> No, this is precisely the point that I made about the early-day motion, because if one reads it carefully one finds it does not say what Conservative Members are suggesting. I accept that individual Members who signed it may mean it to mean different things from what other Members mean it to mean, but it asks the Government to consider the representations that are being made to them by the Open university. That is what I am asking the Government to do now. There has been a consultation period and they have received representations, so I am asking them, as the EDM did, to consider the matter and to make changes. I believe that that is also what the Government&#146;s amendment does, which is why this debate is somewhat curious. I would want to vote for both the motion and the amendment&#151;the two are entirely consistent.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey). I do not know whether she will vote for the motion or for the amendment. I do not think it is against the rules to vote for both, and she will doubtless do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para26"><a name="080108107000045">I want to make a brief contribution. It has been mentioned on a number of occasions that the new Select Committee on Innovation, Universities and Skills is holding an inquiry into the issue of equivalent or lower qualifications, following an unprecedented barrage of correspondence and lobbying not only by the Open university and Birkbeck, but by universities ranging from those as far north as Sunderland and Middlesbrough to some of the London colleges. It is important for us to widen the debate. We must not consider only the Open university and Birkbeck.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80108-0018.htm_para27"><a name="080108107000046">Our inquiry will examine four key things. The first is the arguments presented by the Secretary of State and the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education for phasing out support given to institutions for students studying ELQs. The second is the timing of the decision on the implementation of change, given the proposed review of higher education funding and fees for 2009-10. The third is the exemptions in respect of certain courses, as proposed by HEFCE. We will want to know, as doubtless will the Minister, why HEFCE has not exempted such courses as theology and pharmacy&#151;the list could go on. The fourth is the impact on students, in particular women and older workers. The issue of immigrant workers has been mentioned. They often come to this country with a degree that is not accepted in the workplace, and thus there is a need for retraining. We hope to obtain information on those four criteria.</p>

We hear the Minister&#146;s comments about supporting the universities over the first three years, but the crucial aspect to understand is what happens at the end of those three years. When the Minister winds up, I hope that he will tell the House what will happen after those three years  <br>

if the OU, for instance, has not made up the quota of students that would guarantee its base resource funding. Do we go on supporting it or will it have to make significant cuts in its organisation? That is an important question.</p>

 When the Secretary of State responded to my intervention about the protection lasting only three years, he explained that that was the length of the comprehensive spending review period. However, there is a protection for six years, in terms  of the teaching out of people who have already started an ELQ at the OU, and hon. Members are right  to be concerned that the other protections will last only three years.</p>

 Has the hon. Gentleman considered that the Leitch proposals suggest that many more people should have level 4 qualifications and above? There will therefore be a pool of adults from which the OU and other higher education institutions will be able to draw additional students in the future.</p>

 I shall return to the subject of the pool, because there is a real question about where the 20,000 extra students will come from, especially as we will have a significant demographic downturn. The number of 18-year-olds going to universities will decline significantly over the next decade. I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point that there will be a pool of people which will need to be tapped, especially married women who are returning to the work force.</p>

We hope that by 14 January we will have had even more responses. I have not carried out a scientific analysis of them, but the typical response is from someone who took a three-year full-time arts degree as an 18 to 21-year-old and now plans to take a degree or lower qualification in computer science, accountancy or management. They are people who genuinely want to change course. Among the many points made by those students is an echo of what the Government have said many times&#151;that we now live in a constantly shifting global economy, that qualifications relevant even 10 years ago may no longer be relevant in the workplace today and that ELQs are essential to keep up with the pace.</p>

After all, there was no consultation about the principle behind the initial announcement. The Secretary of State was very honest, as he always is, when he said that he had asked HEFCE to find money to fund another 20,000 full-time equivalent students. That is where the &#163;100 million figure came from. The Secretary of State has done a valiant job in defending a policy that HEFCE&#151;not the Government&#151;decided.

20,000 students. Tonight we have had a recognition of the fact that there will be a &#163;100 million cut for mostly part-time students studying for ELQs. That will be a cut in order to finance an expansion in the number of students elsewhere by 20,000. That has been fully established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para3"><a name="080108107000054">The Secretary of State has produced no research evidence to support his strongly held views that the change will not damage the drive for new skills in the workplace. As other hon. Members have commented&#151;the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) made the point in his opening remarks&#151;why choose now, when there will be a review in 2009? We recognise that there has to be a fundamental look at how we fund higher education and at what we want it to deliver in the  21st century, but why pick out such a small bit&#151;merely &#163;100 million of the &#163;7.1 billion that is spent on teaching in higher education?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para4"><a name="080108107000055">I have listened carefully to the arguments that the Government have presented to our Committee as well as those that they have made tonight. We have no problem with Lord Leitch&#146;s analysis that 40 per cent. of adults need to be at level 4 by 2020. We believe that that is a sound policy. We accept that to achieve that target we will have to increase significantly the number of students studying for the first time at that level, as the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) said. We accept that in order to support a more highly educated and skilled work force employers will need to contribute to developing that pool of labour, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said. We accept that as far as the overall spend in higher education is concerned, there will not be a net reduction but simply a redistribution of the resources. We can accept all those facts without questioning  them deeply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para5"><a name="080108107000056">There is a question about whether the Secretary of State has fully understood the nature of the part-time student market, and in particular the market for existing graduates to retrain in new areas where they can, we hope, become more economically active. I am sure that the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education would agree it would be absurd to develop a policy whereby initial qualifications, provided they were at level 4, were sufficient to meet the hugely complex and ever-changing demands of a modern economy. That would be nonsense. I do not believe that the Minister believes that at all. How does the ELQ policy fit into a broader Government  strategy of not simply upskilling&#151;which we all accept is a good policy&#151;but reskilling at whatever level is necessary to make individuals more economically active and productive?</p>

A drive for quantity rather than the appropriateness of the qualifications is a mistake that we should not make again. Far too many of those who have graduated over the past 10 years have qualifications that they simply cannot use or they find themselves employed in positions that require at best a level 3 and, more often, a level 2 qualification. How on earth do those people  <br>

Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) pointed out, those who are studying in the marketplace that we are discussing are serious students. I ask the Minister to set out the Government&#146;s policy on reskilling rather than simply upskilling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para8"><a name="080108107000059">No doubt the Minister will point out the many exemptions&#151;such as medicine, economics, law and psychology. However, I ask him when the policy suddenly arose. If the public purse in education is now to be used to influence people&#146;s choice of course and the outcome to meet national skills needs, why does the policy not apply at level 4? That would be more appropriate. What principal difference means that a student is allowed carte blanche to study wherever he likes for his first degree, provided the institution will accept him, but not if he wants to retrain to become economically active? There is a difference between the two policies.</p>

The debate is important in the broader context of what we should expect from higher education, given that no party can devote limitless resources to it. However, the policy under discussion is not being applied to the vast majority of post-18 graduates, so why are the Government picking on one small group of students?</p>

It is not a sensible description of the process, and I am sure that it is not what the hon. Lady meant.</p>

The Government say that they must do so to ensure that people have the skills they need, but employers have responded by saying that they would simply go to the EU, as there is now a global market in labour. The task of ensuring that our nation&#146;s work force have the necessary generic skills lies with the Government, and the necessary funding must come from the taxes that we pay to the state.</p>

However, I worry about the unintended consequences of the proposal. We have heard about them already this evening, and they have been described eloquently by the Open university, Birkbeck college, NIACE and the think-tank, Million Plus. The consequences have also been set out by the CBI director general, Richard Lambert, who has been quoted several times in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para16"><a name="080108107000070">I tend to agree with those critics who worry that the proposals will distort&#151;clearly unintentionally&#151;the Leitch agenda.

The House should welcome that commitment as a genuine gesture of support and of his willingness to await the results of the HEFCE inquiry. I urge him to go further and allow even more time for change to take place and to consider the suggestions made by the OU and Birkbeck, particularly that the proposals should be withdrawn or at least that the money saved should be reinvested specifically in institutions that support the skills development of mature part-time learners.</p>

 When it was my privilege to help shadow the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education, I had the pleasure of giving the founders day address at Birkbeck college. I also saw a great deal of the wonderful work done in universities across London. It is also one of the most important jobs of the Mayor of London to speak up for education in London, to use all his powers to defend London universities and entrench the position of London as the knowledge centre of Europe, and to make sure that we continue to have a constellation of first-class institutions that continue to attract huge numbers of foreign students from across the world and contribute healthily to the &#163;1.5 billion in fees that are so vital to the higher education economy of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para20"><a name="080108107000075">At the risk of being partisan, I think it is incredible that the current Mayor of London has said nothing about this issue or about cuts that profoundly affect higher education in this city. I do not wish to do him a disservice; I have not heard him say anything about the issue in the past few weeks. Thousands of people come to London to start their lives afresh and often a major part of that reinvention is a process of re-education and acquiring new skills. That is why there are so many institutions in London whose bread-and-butter work is to teach those who already hold a qualification at an equivalent or higher level. They include City of Westminster college, Birkbeck, South Thames college, the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama, London Business School, Open university, the Institute of Cancer Research, the School of Pharmacy, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, City university, Thames Valley university, Lewisham college, the University of East London and London Metropolitan university. Many of these institutions will have to rethink radically their provision in order to survive. Nine out of 10 of the most seriously affected higher education institutions and 54 per cent. of students taking equivalent or lower qualifications are in London. This move is seriously regressive for London. It is injurious to the interests of thousands of potential learners across the city. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has said, it is particularly damaging to women who wish to acquire further qualifications after a change of career. It frustrates opportunity, stifles aspiration, and sends a negative message to those thinking of pursuing higher education in London. It does nothing to help our status as the centre of the global knowledge economy.</p>

Secretary of State gave a speech underlining the need for universities to offer flexible part-time provision, in order to help hit the target of 40 per cent. of the work force holding an HE-level qualification by 2020. Many London institutions are uniquely placed to deliver that. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80108-0019.htm_para22"><a name="080108107000077">Birkbeck has specialised in the high-quality, research-led teaching of working people since 1823. In 2007, it broke all records for its recruitment, and it was praised by its students for the third year running for delivering an exceptional, high-quality education. As a result of the flexible style of its provision, a third of Birkbeck&#146;s students are equivalent or lower qualification students, yet under the new measure they will pay for that. It is estimated that 6,000 or 7,000 people will be affected. The Government&#146;s cuts will directly limit the potential of a great institution, and the potential of thousands of students to change their lives. London is disproportionately affected by the cuts. I urge the Secretary of State to rethink this arbitrary decision, and to instead incorporate the proposal in the wider review of fees expected in 2009, as my hon. Friend the Member for Havant and Members of all parties have argued.</p>

Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), no consultation took place before the proposal was made. There was no lobby or campaign to bring about the change. I repeat that there was no consultation on the principle. The Secretary of State implies that a consultation is under way, and he is of course right, but it is a consultation on how to implement a proposal that has already been made, as the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education told me in answer to a written parliamentary question. In other words, rather than asking those who know best whether the change should happen, the Secretary of State will consult them on how to limit the damage when it does.</p>

As the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) said, Birkbeck college in London is among those institutions. A third of students at Birkbeck college, which specialises, as he said, in part-time evening courses, are ELQ students. The proposal means severe cuts to the part-time learning that the Secretary of State claims to champion.</p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) said in a stout defence of the Open university&#151;not for the first time, he was its champion in the Chamber tonight&#151;the OU will be severely affected by the proposal. It was good to hear my hon. Friend speaking up for Harold Wilson&#146;s brainchild. By contrast, the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)&#151;I do not mean to be unnecessarily unkind to the hon. Lady, and I emphasise the word &#147;unnecessarily&#148;&#151;managed, with remarkable dexterity, to skate on thin ice and dance on the head of a pin at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para2"><a name="080108107000089">One of the other institutions that will be affected is the Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education, where more than 80 per cent. of students already have a first degree or equivalent qualification.</p>

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), who is not in his place, and the university of East London, both of which attract nearly 40 per cent. of their students from the bottom three socio-economic groups, will lose millions in funding as a result of the Minister&#146;s proposals.</p>

It is not in the letter that the Secretary of State sent to HEFCE. There is barely a mention of the &#163;20 million being redirected to help the students whom he mentioned tonight. We can only assume that he had not made his mind up then or does not know now. I hesitate to say this because I do not want to offend anyone in the House, but I wonder whether that was a rabbit drawn from a hat to cover the Secretary of State&#146;s embarrassment once he realised how unpopular and how unacceptable the proposal was among Opposition Members, the representatives of HE and his colleagues.</p>

The proposal undoubtedly makes reskilling harder for all and impossible for many. The exemptions are arbitrary and inconsistent. Vets will be exempt, but not pharmacists. Land management will continue to be supported, but not law or business studies. Many professional qualifications will be damaged. In 2005-06 21 per cent. of students studying for science, technology and engineering degrees were ELQ students.</p>

 As usual on these matters, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have heard nothing from the Conservatives about the 20 million people in the adult work force, 10 million of whom are women, who have not got to that first degree level, and we should hear more about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o352"><a name="0801095000008"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="0801095001122"><b>Mr. Boris Johnson:</b>
 Can the Minister, for whom I have the highest regard, explain exactly how he will increase opportunities for people who have not yet had a degree by taking away opportunities from those who might go on to acquire further qualifications?</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="0801095000009"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="0801095001123"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 We are redirecting &#163;100 million, which is 0.2 per cent. of the higher education budget, in the first year of the operation of this new system, and we are redirecting that &#163;100 million towards people&#151;20,000 of them by the end of the three-year comprehensive spending review period&#151;who are not yet at first degree level. In order to meet that stiff and challenging target, adult learning and part-time study are important; that is why the Government have been so keen and determined to increase both in higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0801095000010">Words, including some of those that we heard from Opposition Members, are cheap, but our commitment has been reflected not in words but in actions. We have also been treated to some words intended to suggest that the Government are somehow trying to persecute the Open university. Let me make it abundantly clear for the record that nothing could be further from the truth. I say this with genuine conviction. I believe that the Open university is one of the finest creations of any Labour Government; that is why that institution has such strong support from my right hon. and hon. Friends. I have to say that Conservative support for the Open university was not as apparent at its inception, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out when he quoted the late Iain Macleod, who, when he spoke for the Conservatives, described the idea of the Open university as &#147;blithering nonsense&#148;. Let us bring it further up to date. My right hon. Friend might have added that as Education Secretary in 1970, Margaret Thatcher had to struggle hard against pressure from her own Back Benchers in order, as she said her biography, to save the Open university. This commitment to and support for the Open university is a little late and opportunistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0801095000011">Nevertheless, the Labour party&#151;the party of this Government&#151;created the Open university and we continue to support it. We retain, importantly, our commitment to part-time study as a route to individual betterment for people who, for whatever reason, have missed out on the chance of higher education first time round.</p>

<p><a name="st_o354"><a name="0801095000012"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="0801095001124"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 Could the hon. Gentleman be clear about what consultation took place with the Open university, Birkbeck and others before the letter was sent from the Secretary of State to HEFCE suggesting these measures?</p>

<p><a name="st_o355"><a name="0801095000013"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew7"><a name="0801095001125"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 The Secretary of State has made the position clear. We set out the policy, we have been consulting on its detail, and that consultation has not concluded. HEFCE and Ministers have been listening to the points that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0801095000014">Under this Government, part-time student numbers have risen by no less than 40 per cent.&#151;faster than numbers of full-timers. That has happened because we have continued with the strong and long Labour tradition of support for mature students in higher education and for the part-time mode that is so important to them. That is why this Labour Government were the first Government to bring in part-time student support. It is why, two years ago, we increased the part-time student grant by 27 per cent., and why in each of the past two years we have allocated an additional &#163;40 million, through the funding council, to support part-time provision. Compare and contrast that with the record of the last Conservative Government, of whom the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) was a member, when there was precisely no incentive for higher education institutions to recruit part-timers and no support to allow learners to study part-time.</p>

<p><a name="st_o356"><a name="0801095000015"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="0801095001126"><b>Mr. Willetts:</b>
 But does the Minister not understand that his proposals will damage part-time students who do not have a degree already, as well as those who have a degree? Those proposals will make part-time courses less viable, they threaten existing part-time provision, which means those without degrees suffer, and they will limit the range of students studying part-time courses. He is undermining his own policy through those ill-conceived proposals.</p>

<p><a name="st_o357"><a name="0801095000016"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew9"><a name="0801095001127"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 That is emphatically not the case. I urge the hon. Gentleman, whose views I normally respect, to look at the detail of the proposals, and to recognise the fact that we are increasing the part-time premium to institutions such as the Open university through the Higher Education Funding Council. Institutions such as the Open university and Birkbeck will be exceedingly well placed to take up the additional growth from the redirected &#163;100 million, and the 2 per cent. above inflation increase in the overall higher education budget each year, in order to make good any loss in respect of ELQ students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0801095000017">We have invested in and supported part-timers; the previous Government did nothing whatsoever to support them. Let us also remember what happened to overall higher education funding under the previous Government. During the last seven years of that Government, there was a 36 per cent. real terms cut in higher education funding. When one talks to vice-chancellors and lecturers, one finds that they very much remember those days. In the past 10 years, we have seen the biggest increase in higher education funding for 40 years. Since this Government came to power, we have increased funding by 23 per cent. in real terms, and for each of the coming three years of the CSR period, there will be a further increase of 2 per cent. above inflation. This Government are not cutting funding for higher education; we are maintaining and expanding higher education. What we are doing, rightly, is redirecting 1.5 per cent. of the overall higher education budget by the end of year three in order to give a chance of a university education to more than 20,000 full-time students who would never have had that opportunity otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="st_o358"><a name="0801095000018"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew10"><a name="0801095001128"><b>Adam Afriyie (Windsor) (Con):</b>
 The Minister is throwing out a lot of stats, and going back 20 or 30 years in some cases, but could he explain clearly to this House which bit of the motion he disagrees with?</p>

<p><a name="st_o359"><a name="0801095000019"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew11"><a name="0801095001129"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 I disagree with the bit of the motion that says that the Government should ensure that we minimise the impact on institutions such as the Open university and Birkbeck because that is exactly what we have already been seeking to do through the consultation. We have sought to ensure that those institutions are able to benefit from the growth that will come from the redirected &#163;100 million and the overall increase in higher education funding. I shall return to that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0801095000020">I shall now comment specifically on some of the points that have been raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Havant made a significant issue of the proportion of women who will be affected by the policy. Let me be clear and state for the record that  47 per cent. of ELQ students are women, just as 47 per cent. of non-ELQ students are women. It is also the case, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) alluded to, that tens of millions of women in the adult work force do not have a first degree, and ensuring that they receive funding will be a priority under the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para21"><a name="0801095000021">The hon. Member for Havant was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) to say what he would he do if he were faced with this decision, and on where the money would come from, and he said quite simply that he would not make this decision. That is fine; such a priority can be made, but if another decision were taken, the Opposition would have to go out and explain it to the 20,000 students who would not have their first degree funded as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para22"><a name="0801095000022">The hon. Gentleman also made a point about our proposals being contrary to what Sandy Leitch has recommended. I do not believe that that is the case. The proposals will give significant opportunities to enable people to reskilll through employer co-funded courses, vocational foundation degrees and whole range of exempted subjects.</p>

<p><a name="st_o360"><a name="0801095000023"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew12"><a name="0801095001130"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 As I said at the beginning of the debate, if the Tories were honest, they would say, &#147;Let&#146;s raise taxes and have it all.&#148; That is what I believe.</p>

<p><a name="st_o361"><a name="0801095000024"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew13"><a name="0801095001131"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 I know from many conversations that my hon. Friend believes that. I will leave it at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para23"><a name="0801095000025">More interesting was the intervention from the  hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who chairs the Select Committee. He challenged the Conservative party to make a commitment that, if a Conservative Government were elected&#151;</p>

 Indeed. The Chairman of the Select Committee challenged Conservative Members to make a commitment that any student who had a first degree could get a funded ELQ. The hon. Member for Havant could not make that commitment and urged us simply to wait for the results of the commission in 2009. We  <br>

therefore have principled opposition, but only for a year. Indeed, we have political opportunism that masquerades as principled opposition on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0801095000028">The hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams), whom I welcome to his new position and responsibilities, mentioned foundation degree awarding powers for further education colleges. My memory of that change was of significantly more noise and opposition compared with the reaction to the proposals that we are introducing today. Yet now that the change has been made, we hear not a murmur from the sector. That demonstrates that we sometimes have to do what is right, consult and take people with us.</p>

<p><a name="st_o364"><a name="0801095000029"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew16"><a name="0801095001134"><b>Stephen Williams:</b>
 The reason for the noise from the sector was that the Government had not consulted it. Matters improved and there is not so much noise now because we went through a legislative process in this place and significantly amended the original proposals. We will not get that chance with tonight&#146;s proposal.</p>

<p><a name="st_o365"><a name="0801095000030"><a name="80108-0020.htm_spnew17"><a name="0801095001135"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 The same principle applies. One presents a proposition and consults about the detail&#151;we did that previously and we are doing it now. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is new to the Front Bench, but he is seriously misinformed about the current position. He lamented the fact that ELQs would now be unregulated and that higher fees could be charged, but that is the current position. Institutions can already charge higher fees for second degrees. Given the competitive market, I believe that universities will think long and hard before raising fees. They know that significant other sources of funding will come forward as a result of the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para25"><a name="0801095000031">I respect the integrity and commitment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson). Let me reassure him about Birkbeck college. I have met representatives of Birkbeck twice and I spoke at its founder&#146;s day before Christmas. I have been impressed by the college&#146;s willingness to engage with the Higher Education Funding Council and examine the way in which it can reorientate the organisation to take up the opportunities that are on offer. It is a model for the way in which we expect higher education institutions to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para26"><a name="0801095000032">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) claimed that the changes would result in the Open university losing &#163;49 million in funding. That is categorically untrue. It does not serve the cause of the argument to make such claims. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) passionately supports the Open university, as was demonstrated when she made exactly the same arguments in private to me as she made on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80108-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0801095000033">Let me conclude by making the position abundantly clear. First, there is no overall reduction in funding for higher education. On the contrary, it will continue to increase. Secondly, funding for students taking ELQs in strategically important and vulnerable subjects will be protected. Thirdly, students taking foundation degrees will be protected. Fourthly, funding for employer co-funded courses will be protected. Finally and crucially, no institution&#146;s grant will be reduced in cash terms in the next three years while the new policy is introduced. That is an important message to Birkbeck and the Open university.</p>

The problems with trafficking in the UK demonstrate how the current laws do not assist in reducing prostitution nor do they help to protect vulnerable women who have been coerced or in many instances forced into prostitution. Although slavery was abolished in the UK almost 200 years ago, slavery still exists for many women in prostitution in the UK.

We believe that prostitution is inherently an abuse of women and does not exist to allow women freedom of choice, but is a symptom of the lack of choice for many women. We believe that prostitution will only be reduced in the UK if the demand for prostitutes is tackled in a thorough and comprehensive manner.</p>

 On 28 January 2004 it snowed in High Peak&#151;that is not unusual at this time of year. The snow was so heavy that school buses were summoned and children sent home. My constituent, Mary Ann Bailey, then aged 15, went to a friend&#146;s home in Hadfield, near Glossop, for the afternoon, with others. At 4.40 that afternoon the emergency services found Mary Ann and a friend, Martin Taylor, dead at their friend&#146;s home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0801096000004">The previous week a valve had been replaced on a gas boiler in the room below where the young people died. It had been incorrectly fitted, by one Jason Barton, and as a result the gas pressure was too high and the gas was not burning efficiently. Carbon monoxide was being produced by the boiler and it killed the two young people. Two years later a jury failed to agree&#151;for a second time&#151;on a charge of manslaughter against Mr. Barton for his negligence. Instead, he was convicted of a breach of health and safety legislation. He was fined just &#163;2,000 and had his CORGI registration removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para5"><a name="0801096000005">The Health and Safety Executive stated in evidence that 36 properties where Mr. Barton had worked had gas installations which rendered them either &#147;at risk&#148; or in &#147;immediate danger&#148;; and that 120 acts of faulty workmanship had been identified in Mr. Barton&#146;s work over just 12 months. The judge at Nottingham Crown court said that Barton should have gone to jail. The judge also regretted that the law said that Barton could only be fined, and that the fine had to relate to his ability to pay. Prosecutions for negligence in this field too often fail to convict and I know that that is of great concern to those interested in gas safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0801096000006">In November 2007, another constituent, pensioner John Froggatt, sat down with a friend to share a whisky in a caravan in Bamford in the Hope valley. Again it was a cold High Peak night. Although he did not intend to stay out for long, the gas heater was switched on for warmth. Two days later, the two missing pensioners&#146; bodies were found. It is believed that the heater was in good working order, but that a mouse had built its nest in the flue over the summer, preventing the products of combustion from escaping from the caravan. Carbon monoxide had built up and killed both men in what was likely to have been a slow, but relatively painless death.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right, and if he will bear with me, I will list the demands that I wish to make of my hon. Friend the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0801096000010">Ten years ago one person died each week from CO poisoning on average; today it is one a fortnight across the country as a whole. But four in four years in High Peak alone is way above the average. Last year only eight people died from CO produced from mains piped gas&#151;making it the best year on record&#151;but proportionately higher numbers of deaths arising from CO are produced from the burning of coal, wood, oil and other domestic fuels. How can it be justified that gas is subject to proper regulation and licensing of fitters, but those other fuels are not? And why is the enforcement of high standards of gas fitting so inadequate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0801096000011">All deaths from CO, including all four of those in High Peak recently, have one thing in common&#151;they were avoidable. None of those four would have died had the house or caravan concerned been fitted with CO detectors and alarms. I will return to that point later. Suffice it to say for now that more than half of mains gas-related carbon monoxide incidents over the years come from open flue gas appliances. Open flue gas central heating boilers, of a type which have not been installed since 1993 but which are still common in older properties, account for more than half of all deaths from CO poisoning in that time, says British Gas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0801096000012">CO is a highly toxic, colourless, odourless gas. It is produced by the combustion of fuel in poorly ventilated areas. It is the potent element of car exhaust emissions in confined spaces, which explains the use of car exhaust as a means of suicide. I occasionally find my past as a biology teacher of use in this place and I can tell the House that CO binds to haemoglobin in the blood as carboxyhaemoglobin 200 times more strongly than oxygen. Normally, haemoglobin binds loosely with oxygen in the lungs and then releases oxygen to the brain, muscles and other tissues in response to an oxygen deficit. Carboxyhaemoglobin, by contrast,  is a stable compound that does not break down readily at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0801096000013">In air with 21 per cent. oxygen, which is the normal level, a CO level of just 0.1 per cent. can cause half of the haemoglobin in the blood to bind permanently with CO, which means that the blood rapidly and permanently becomes unable to deliver sufficient oxygen to our muscles and brain. Last October in the House of Lords I joined David and Mary Jane Worswick, the parents of Mary Ann Bailey, at an event to mark the launch of the second carbon monoxide awareness week. I expected to meet other bereaved families, but there were actually very few of them. Most of the dozens of people present were victims of non-lethal CO poisoning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0801096000014">Some 200 cases of such poisoning are identified every year but many others go undiagnosed, because doctors do not routinely check for CO poisoning, because dead bodies are not routinely checked for CO poisoning as they are in France, and because symptoms vary from person to person and are easily confused with other causes. For example, 90 per cent. of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning produce headaches, 50 per cent. cause nausea, 50 per cent. cause dizziness, 30 per cent. cause tiredness, and flu-like symptoms are  <br>

reported in 20 per cent. of cases. In more serious cases palpitations are found as well as chest pain. Collapse, unconsciousness and death follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0801096000015">Those attending the event in the Lords exhibited a variety of medical conditions associated with brain damage due to oxygen starvation caused by CO poisoning. Many had physical disabilities such as being unable to walk and many had lost their jobs through disability, while some reported severe personality problems. Patient UK confirms that 200 people a year survive significant CO poisoning but long-term damage includes kidney failure, heart attack, blindness due to retinal bleeding, brain damage due to swelling of the brain, loss of memory, personality changes, irritability and incontinence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0801096000016">CO awareness week was launched in 2006 with a view to raising awareness of CO poisoning among medical practitioners and the general public, thereby tackling its causes. University of London research published by the Health and Safety Executive in 2006 shows that 23 per cent. of homes&#151;one in four&#151;have one or more defective gas appliances. Some 8 per cent. of homes&#151;2 million houses, which are home to  4.5 million people&#151;are at risk of dangerous levels of CO while 45 per cent. of homes had no information on or awareness of the dangers of CO. Problem appliances are most likely to be found in the homes of vulnerable people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0801096000017">CORGI has also published research. It found that  28 per cent. of CO deaths are caused by faulty or poorly maintained appliances. It confirmed that CO poisoning is not spread evenly across society, hitting some disproportionately with 27 per cent. of incidents occurring in rented accommodation while 50 per cent. of victims are elderly or children. More than half of all incidents, or 53 per cent., take place between November and February each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0801096000018">British Gas reports that residents of flats and terraced houses who maintain their equipment properly are nevertheless subject to an additional risk of CO poisoning from poorly maintained equipment in neighbouring properties, with the CO coming through the walls. Some 55,000 businesses in this country are registered with CORGI, including many sole traders, which represents about 120,000 gas fitters. CORGI says that perhaps 20,000 people in this country carry out gas fitting, servicing and repair but are not registered. Some of those people will be qualified and their registration will have lapsed, but many will be untrained or inadequately trained, while some will have been removed from the CORGI register for negligence or malpractice. Those 20,000 people clearly represent a much higher risk to the public than CORGI-registered operators. It has been calculated that unregistered and possibly illegal gas workers are 32 times more likely to be involved in a serious CO incident than a CORGI-registered installer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0801096000019">British Gas reports that, of the 43 million gas appliances in this country, 14 million are gas boilers, of which 3.4 million are serviced under contract by British Gas&#146;s 8,600 qualified engineers. Another 3.4 million appliances are serviced regularly by other CORGI-registered operators. That means that 7 million gas appliances are not serviced at all, are not serviced regularly or are serviced by an unregistered engineer who is not qualified to do the work. To complement  <br>

those figures, 3 million gas appliances are sold every year, but CORGI operatives install only half of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0801096000020">I welcome the news that, as of last week, the company Part Centre&#151;a major supplier of materials to the gas fitting industry&#151;will supply parts only to purchasers who have a CORGI registration. I call on other companies to follow suit, and for the scheme to be extended to complete appliances and to appliances that burn other carbon fuels. I commend to the Minister early-day motion 462 tabled by the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0801096000021">I recently carried out a survey of residents in High Peak. We have had about 650 replies but some arrived too late to be included in my analysis. Of those replying, 95 per cent. had gas boilers and 20 per cent. used other carbon fuels, so it is clear that some people have more than one system. In addition, 92 per cent. had smoke detectors in their homes, while only 34 per cent. had CO detectors. In fact, that compares well with the national figures of 83 per cent. for smoke alarms and 21 per cent. for CO alarms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0801096000022">Only 3 per cent. of respondents to my survey had a CO detector that was portable for holiday use, and I remind the House that two British children died from CO poisoning in an incident in Corfu a couple of years ago. Thanks to the organisation CO-Awareness, I am now able to distribute free of charge 10 CO monitors with audible alarms to constituents who replied to the questionnaire and who do not already have such an alarm. I shall be giving them out in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="st_o371"><a name="0801096000023"><a name="80108-0022.htm_spnew4"><a name="0801096000056"><b>Mr. Fraser Kemp (Houghton and Washington, East) (Lab):</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Many hon. Members have had to deal with the consequences of CO poisoning, and many people have been killed by what is a silent killer. Will he comment on the recent initiative in my constituency that was launched by Councillor Joan Carthy, using money from the strategic initiatives budget? In partnership with the Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service, the initiative ensures that CO detectors are fitted when fire safety checks are carried out on houses where vulnerable people live. We anticipate that 750 such detectors will be installed in four local authority wards. Is that not a tremendous example of how local authorities can work in partnership with the fire and rescue services to get CO detectors fitted in homes?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I agree that it is a very welcome initiative. I have not heard of one on that scale before, and I hope that it is a precursor of things to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0801096000025">Only one in five respondents to my questionnaire were tenants and most of them thought that their landlords had their central heating system serviced regularly, although I cannot be sure that the work is done to the legal standard. Every incident of CO poisoning that I have described could have been prevented by the use of electronic CO detectors with an audible alarm. For the record, they are much more reliable than the cheaper black spot detectors, which have no alarm. Because CO incidents can develop in minutes or hours, black spot detectors cannot be relied on to draw attention to danger when it arises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0801096000026">Before I complete my remarks, I wish to pay tribute to those who have assisted me in preparing for this  <br>

debate. They include my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) who, in his role as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gas safety, organised the event last October, and my colleagues who have intervened so constructively tonight. I should also like to thank CORGI, British Gas, CO-Awareness and its president, Lynn Griffiths, as well as the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, the practice of Russell Jones and Walker, and the people of High Peak who responded to my survey. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the steadfast commitment to the cause shown by David and Mary Jane Worswick, my constituents from Glossop who lost their daughter to CO poisoning almost exactly four years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0801096000027">In summary, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to take action on six fronts. First, I hope that she will act to ensure a greater awareness of CO issues among householders, landlords, tenants, housing authorities, tour operators, emergency services and doctors. Secondly, given that one person in seven moves house each year, I hope that she will act to ensure that having a working CO monitor is compulsory when every house is built. That requirement could be included in building regulations. In addition, I hope that she will ensure that CO monitors are made compulsory when every house is sold, a provision that could be included in home information packs. Will she also ensure that CO monitors are required when caravans and mobile homes are sold or advertised for rent, as proposed by the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), and when tenancies are changed? The advice from British Gas to prospective tenants is that if a landlord cannot show them a current gas safety certificate, they should not move into his property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0801096000028">Thirdly, will she encourage the industry to phase out smoke alarms in favour of combined smoke and CO alarms for domestic use at an affordable price? Fourthly, will she redouble efforts to replace all open flue boilers with the more energy-efficient and less dangerous balanced flue variety, especially for vulnerable groups? Fifthly, can she reduce the level of illegal gas fitting by enabling a greater chance of securing meaningful convictions for those whose action or negligence contributes to CO poisoning? Finally, will she ensure that installers of oil and solid fuel boiler systems are brought under a mandatory system of registration comparable to that which applies to gas installers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0801096000029">If those measures had been taken, my constituents Mary Ann Bailey and John Froggatt would be with us today. Mr. Froggatt would have been looking forward to his 73rd birthday in 2008, Mary Ann to her 20th. In one respect, these two have been spared a lifetime of the sort of disability, brain damage or incapacity that others have suffered from this completely avoidable source of poisoning, but that is little consolation to their families. They want to hear that the Government have learned lessons from their misfortunes, and that steps will be taken to ensure that deaths and injuries from carbon monoxide poisoning continue to fall.</p>

He has taken a close personal interest in gas safety and is working closely with the Health and Safety Executive towards improvements for gas consumers. Like other hon. Members, I would like to offer my deepest condolences to my honourable Friend&#146;s constituents at High Peak, David and Mary Jane Worswick, who tragically lost their teenager daughter, Mary Ann Bailey together with her friend, Martin Taylor, to carbon monoxide poisoning almost four years ago, and to the other families sadly affected, to whom my hon. Friend referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para27"><a name="0801096000032">I am all too aware of the problem that can arise from defective gas appliances. As my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East highlighted, many of us have had experience of CO poisoning incidents. Some six years ago, two of my constituents&#151;two young students&#151;living in rented accommodation died from CO fumes from a portable room heater. Indeed, when my daughter was sharing a flat as a student she was fortunately able to recognise the early symptoms of CO poisoning. It is something that touches us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80108-0022.htm_para28"><a name="0801096000033">Let me assure the House that the Government are committed to playing their part in improving gas safety. For more than 20 years, domestic gas safety has been controlled within the framework of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. In that period, the resulting regime has undergone many reforms aimed at tightening gas safety standards for domestic consumers. As my hon. Friend has readily acknowledged, this legal framework has set the scene for a significant downward trend in the number of deaths due to CO poisoning from gas installations over the years. The most recent HSE figures provisionally show that there were eight deaths from CO poisoning related to gas installations during 2006-07&#151;the lowest figure on record. This compares with 16 for the previous year, and, as my hon. Friend highlighted, 10 years ago, the figure was more than three times that number.</p>

<p><a name="st_o374"><a name="0801096000034"><a name="80108-0022.htm_spnew6"><a name="0801096000059"><b>Tom Levitt:</b>
 It is important to put on record that the figure of eight relates to mains gas, so deaths such as that of Mr. Froggatt in his caravan would not be included in that figure.</p>

 I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point, and I recognise that mobile homes and caravans are a particular issue, as hon. Members have highlighted. We need to recognise the context: 22 million households, mobile homes and other places of abode use gas appliances. I suppose that we have to recognise that we   <br>

have an encouraging, improving record, but we must also recognise that we cannot desist in our efforts to ensure that gas safety improves. The gas industry, gas safety campaign groups, and a host of other people, including many hon. Members, have helped to achieve that improved record, and I pay tribute to them for those efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para0"><a name="0801096000036">However, as my hon. Friend explained, the Health and Safety Executive figures refer specifically to deaths related to gas installation work, and do not take account of carbon monoxide incidents arising from other fossil fuels. Those other incidents are no less important; they, too, involve human suffering. More needs to be done to improve public awareness of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning from all fossil fuels, and to raise awareness of the benefits of using carbon monoxide alarms in the home. I shall come back to that subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0801096000037">Although the legal framework has provided a context for improving gas safety over the years, unfortunately there are still cases in which the law has not been followed. Sometimes gas fitters are not registered or competent to carry out gas work safely. As has been said, sometimes landlords do not take their gas safety responsibilities seriously, and sometimes members of the public attempt do-it-yourself gas work, with dangerous consequences, or fail to get their appliances properly maintained by competent installers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0801096000038">When things go wrong and there are serious breaches of the law, enforcement action will be taken. Gas safety cases make up about 8 per cent. of all prosecutions brought by the HSE. They involve actions against landlords, individuals and installers. Registration with the Council for Registered Gas Installers, or CORGI, is a legal requirement for anyone installing or repairing fittings or appliances in homes. The aim of the gas installer registration scheme is to improve standards in the industry, and to help the public find and use safe and competent tradespeople. The HSE will hold all installers, registered or unregistered, to account for their actions if their work is found to be dangerously incompetent. If someone is not registered, it does not mean that the HSE will not pursue them if their work is dangerously incompetent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0801096000039">Some landlords and people undertaking gas work who have blatantly failed in their responsibilities have ended up in prison for causing deaths from dangerous gas appliances. Recent HSE initiatives against unregistered gas installers have led to the courts imposing sentences that generate significant local and national publicity on gas safety issues. Of course, that strengthens the deterrent to others who might think that they can install gas appliances. Sentencing is obviously a matter for the judiciary and the courts within the legislative and regulatory framework set by Parliament. Ministers and the HSE agree that the sentences or fines for health and safety offences can be too low, and do not always reflect the seriousness of the failure, as my hon. Friend has said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0801096000040">I should like to express my sympathy to Mr. and Mrs. Worswick for the protracted proceedings in their case, and for what was undoubtedly a wholly inadequate outcome, given the terrible circumstances of their daughter&#146;s death. As my hon. Friend may be aware, we have tried to introduce legislation to increase sentencing powers through the private Member&#146;s Bill  <br>

route. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill) is yet again to introduce a Bill to increase sentencing. If successful, it will raise the penalties for health and safety offences, and will make imprisonment more widely available for serious offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0801096000041">I hope that all Members of the House, including those who raised technical or procedural issues to talk out a similar Bill that was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) will think seriously before they do so again. We want to see the Bill enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0801096000042">I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak that the Department of Health is committed to helping prevent deaths caused by carbon monoxide poisoning and to raising awareness of the dangers of poisoning. The chief medical officer has made a point of regularly bringing the issue of CO symptoms to the attention of the medical profession&#151;for example, through his regular updates. The Department of Health recognises, as my hon. Friend indicated, that more needs to be done, working with the medical community, to raise their awareness of CO poisoning, and to provide practical advice on recognising symptoms to help them better diagnose CO poisoning. This is important, as CO poisoning can sometimes be confused with other ailments, such as flu. Recognising the symptoms of CO poisoning is not always easy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0801096000043">I welcome the Department of Health&#146;s decision to put out a call for funding research into carbon monoxide poisoning. Research undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive as part of its 2006 review of the domestic gas safety regime suggested that problems with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning may be more widespread than anticipated&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend. The new Department of Health call for research asks for proposals to investigate the incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning, both acute and chronic, and further work to help define the extent of the population at risk who use cooking or heating appliances that are faulty or installed incorrectly.</p>

 Will the Minister convey my thanks and the thanks of many fire authorities in Britain for the help that the HSE has recently given with the production of 400,000 leaflets to raise awareness of  the dangers of the silent killer, so that when fire checks take place in local communities, people also get information about the dangers?</p>

<p><a name="st_o377"><a name="0801096000045"><a name="80108-0023.htm_spnew2"><a name="0801096000062"><b>Mrs. McGuire:</b>
 Indeed. I know that a great deal of work on the matter has been done by the HSE and the fire and emergency services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0801096000046">The research will also call for proposals to assess the number of people experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning by looking at how many are admitted to hospital suspected of non-lethal poisoning, plus the number subsequently diagnosed. This will cover carbon monoxide poisoning from gas and other fossil carbon-based fuels. The results from the proposed research will help to give us better evidence on what is happening with CO exposure and inform us about what more needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0801096000047">I emphasise that although the evidence shows that the existing arrangements have helped to improve  <br>

safety standards, the Government accept that more needs to be done. I welcome the new industry initiatives to exercise leadership in raising public awareness of the risks of other fossil fuels, as well as gas. As my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, these other fuels also present CO risks. The messages are similar to those for gas, and the public need to be fully aware of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80108-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0801096000048">My hon. Friend raised specific issues, which I shall try to deal with. I shall follow up and write to him about those that I cannot cover now. We need to  <br>

reinforce the message that householders should arrange to have their gas appliances regularly checked for safety by a CORGI-registered installer. Gas appliances should always be used correctly. They should never be used if there are any signs that they are not working. Approved carbon monoxide detectors with an audible alarm are highly recommended&#151;</p>
