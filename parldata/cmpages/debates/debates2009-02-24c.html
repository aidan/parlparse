 The composition of the next Israeli Government is not yet clear. However, at the earliest opportunity, the UK will engage with Israel&#146;s new Government on the important task of reinvigorating a serious political dialogue aimed at establishing a lasting and just regional peace between Israel and its neighbours. Working with and supporting all parties in their efforts to reach that goal will remain a central tenet of the UK&#146;s policy in the region.</p>

 With right-wing religious nationalists now vying for control of the Knesset, there appears to be little prospect of peace for the families and friends of the 1,300 Gazans killed and 5,500 injured by Israeli military operations before and during the recent general election campaign. Does my right hon.

 I think that the prospects for peace probably seem very remote for a large number of people in the middle east, which is a reason for us to redouble our efforts to secure that peace. On the second part of my hon. Friend&#146;s question, it is very important that we condemn all loss of innocent civilian life on any side. We should not get into the business of justifying one set of civilian losses because of another. A vital part of our work and, critically, the work of the new US Administration, is to try to build a durable peace that is in the interests of Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p>

 Is the Foreign Secretary aware that Israel is one of the most advanced countries in the world in tackling human trafficking? The number of convictions of traffickers is up and the amount of compensation paid to victims and the amount of legislation on the statute book are increasing.

 I have just come back from Gaza, where I saw whole business districts, villages, hospitals and schools that had been systematically razed to the ground by a Government of the centre left, as we are now told to call them. The prospects for progress on peace and other matters being made by a Government of the far right seem unlikely without pressure from this Government and their international partners.

 The picture that my hon. Friend paints of the situation in Gaza was confirmed to me by Senator Kerry, whom I met on Sunday and who had also recently been in Gaza. He painted a picture of extreme devastation right across Gaza. As I said, there is not yet a Government in Israel, but the most significant thing is that in the latter part of last year, we were talking in the House about the importance of the new US Administration engaging on middle east issues from day one, which has indeed happened.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to emphasise the importance of restating a commitment to a two-state solution. It is fair to say that it is an indicator of how dangerous the situation is that the mere repetition of that commitment is in itself important. At this time, it is very important to keep on the table the commitment to a two-state solution, especially by the United States, given that the division between Gaza and the west bank currently threatens the very heart of the idea of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter) made the point that a Government of the centre left could not find a road to peace, and it seems likely that we will have a Government of the right in Israel shortly. The Foreign Secretary has made it plain that he, along with the international community, wishes to redouble his efforts to try to get a settlement and agreement in the region. How optimistic is he, given the clear political obstacles that the composition of the new Government presents?</p>

 The situation on the ground means that anyone who claims to be optimistic at the moment is not engaging with the facts. It is not an optimistic, but a dangerous moment. The dangers mean that not only European countries and the United States, but&#151;critically&#151;countries throughout the Arab world, as well as Israel, have to peer into the abyss of the idea of a two-state solution disappearing. That is dangerous for Israel and for the whole Arab world. It is one reason for my putting such stress in the past six months on the Arab peace initiative, which offers not only a two-state solution, but the prospect of 23 states&#151;Israel and 22 states of the Arab League&#151;normalising relations with each other on the back of the creation of a Palestinian state. That regional approach is essential at this time.</p>

 Does the Foreign Secretary agree that Israel is entitled to insist that the Palestinians and the wider Arab world accept her right to exist?

 Yes, it is important&#151;I hope that it is noted&#151;that, in all parties in the House, there is an absolute commitment to the centrality of Israel at the foundation of a stable middle east and to the fact that Israel, never mind the Palestinians, will have safety and justice with the creation of a Palestinian state. It is significant that, across the United Kingdom political spectrum, every party is committed to the goal of a safe Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state in a region that benefits from that co-existence. I think that the cross-party commitment to using all Britain&#146;s assets to further that goal is widely welcomed, and it is something that I carry with me as I travel in the region.</p>

The current joint operation in eastern Congo is unlikely to eradicate the presence of the Forces D&#233;mocratiques de Lib&#233;ration du Rwanda&#151;FDLR&#151;before the Rwandans reach the end of the time that they had allocated for that. Will my hon.

 First, I commend my hon. Friend&#146;s work in the region and her assessment of the position. I can give the reassurance that we have continued to press the DRC Government to plan for post-military action, including humanitarian work and stabilisation, in the way that she describes. As she says, MONUC is key to that, as is the DRC Government&#146;s working with MONUC and the reinforcement of MONUC troops. I understand that most of the 3,000 reinforcements have been identified, and that MONUC will soon send extra troops to northern Congo.</p>

 Indeed, there are discussions at the UN about all peacekeeping operations.

 We very much welcome the US Administration&#146;s willingness to engage directly with Iran, which I think is what my hon. Friend was referring to. However, no one should be in any doubt that President Obama has made it clear that a nuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable.

 My hon. Friend makes an exceedingly pertinent point. In all the discussions that I have in the middle east, there is significant concern, among the Gulf states and other middle east states, about the position of Iran. We need to maximise the consensus and force Iran to face the choice that is before it. The United States Administration have rightly said that they are willing in principle to open a direct dialogue with Iran. We need to reinforce that.

There was, I think, in Secretary Clinton&#146;s remarks in Beijing an important recognition of the changed balance of power in the world and of China&#146;s centrality to addressing many of the big global problems we face&#151;not least economic and environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.</p>

The fate of these returnees to North Korea is extremely gruesome, so will the Secretary of State ensure that his new love-in with China&#151;whether via Mrs. Clinton or anyone else&#151;does not prevent him and the Government from raising this issue with the Chinese Government as a matter of urgency, or does he think that China is too important and large to merit such criticism?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman raises an important point, which is one that we have raised with the Chinese. I think I should write to him with a report on how those discussions have gone and what the latest stage is. The importance of our engagement with China is precisely that, because we engage with the Chinese, we are able to raise all issues, including human rights issues, openly and frankly. That spirit of candour has been developed over the past few years in our relationship with China. Respect for China does not mean the relegation of our concerns to a subsidiary role. In fact, I would argue that the respect that is afforded to China is the basis for proper engagement on issues that concern us.</p>

 Further to the point made by the right hon.

Indeed, why, when Mexico recently asked for the council to be briefed on Sri Lanka, did the British representative to the UN fail to support that call? Does the Foreign Secretary realise that people get pretty angry when UK Ministers here in London talk about and call for a ceasefire, but British officials in New York do not follow through?</p>

I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are using all our best efforts to achieve that. It is deeply to be regretted that the appointment of an envoy has not yet been met with a welcome in Colombo, but that is what we are working for.</p>

There are very distressing reports of both sides interfering with civilians&#146; ability to find safety. It is at the heart of our concerns not just to try to provide money, but to try to provide space to which civilians can escape and in which they can be given proper safety.

 When I recently visited Palestine with the Halifax Friends of Palestine group I saw for myself the atrocities being committed against the people there; day after day, they are terrorised, homes are demolished, concrete walls are built, which prevent children from going to school, and innocent lives are lost. Will the Minister reassure me that he is doing everything he can, working with his international counterparts, to protect the Palestinians and their land, and to find a swift and peaceful solution?</p>

 I say to my hon. Friend, who takes a real interest in these issues, that there has clearly been an unacceptable loss of innocent civilian life. The reality is that we have been at the forefront of efforts to press for a ceasefire, including by leading the way at the United Nations Security Council. We are strongly supporting efforts to stop arms smuggling into Gaza and we are strongly pressing the Israeli Government to open the crossings. However, peace will ultimately be secured by the actions of Hamas, on the one hand, and the Government of Israel, on the other.</p>

 Is it not the case that Hamas continues to store arms in schools, mosques and civilian areas? The arms are clearly still getting through. Does not the international community have a role to play in stopping things being smuggled from Egypt and in assisting the Egyptian authorities in ensuring that the tunnels are maintained? <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 I get the point. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that unless we tackle both sides of this, we will not get the security and the peaceful solution that people seek. That is why we, in concert with other international partners, are doing everything possible to support the Egyptian efforts to tackle smuggling across the borders. We have also, in our own right, made an offer of naval assistance, and that, too, might be able to make a contribution.</p>

 By the Attorney-General, who is the independent Minister for justice and is the right person to assess whether there has been any criminal wrongdoing. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) is right to say that transparency is important. That is one reason why we argued so strongly that the US Government should give the relevant documents to Binyam Mohamed&#146;s legal team. It is because of those &#147;strenuous efforts&#148;, in the words of the Court, that he has now been released from Guantanamo Bay.</p>

We have made it absolutely clear to the US Administration, most recently in a visit by the senior legal adviser of the Foreign Office to Washington about 10 days ago, that we have absolutely no objection to the release of the documents. The Attorney-General of the US has said that the Americans will review all cases of confidentiality against their national security criteria, and that is right, but our position is absolutely clear.

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that the House should know as quickly as possible whether the person who returned to the UK yesterday was tortured and, if so, whether it was with the knowledge and support of British officials? Indeed, if the latter were the case, it would be a disgrace and those responsible should be brought to justice. When will the Attorney-General report? I understand that this has been with her since last October.</p>

 I entirely share my hon. Friend&#146;s view that this country rightly has very high standards. We unreservedly condemn torture. We never collude or co-operate with torture, and where there are any allegations, we take them extremely seriously and ensure that they are independently investigated. The precise point about an independent investigation by the Attorney-General is that I do not tell her when to come to conclusions. It must be right that the Attorney General, with the Director of Public Prosecutions, should be able to conclude her inquiries. Of course, my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) is right: in general, everybody wants that to happen as soon as possible. However, it must be for the Attorney-General to set her own timetable.</p>

 My Bill, the European Union (Audit of Benefits and Costs of UK Membership) Bill, is due for Second Reading this Friday.

 I look forward to debating the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill, should we make progress on Friday. We are happy to debate the costs and benefits of European Union membership, but we do not see the need for the expense or bureaucracy of a commission that would do that. There is plenty of material&#151;more than most people want in a lifetime&#151;available on the costs and benefits of EU membership. Also, we should not see our EU membership only in terms of economic costs and benefits, important though they are; it is also about the security that the EU gives us, and the peace that it has provided for us over many years.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point; in the end, the Arab states are vital to giving security to Israel, and vital to supporting a future Palestinian state. As I said earlier, a regional solution must be pursued in the middle east&#151;a so-called 23-state solution, not simply a two-state solution. Certainly, that is what the UK Government argue strongly, not just with Egyptian colleagues, whom I will meet soon, but across the region.</p>

 I say to the hon. Gentleman, who I know takes a real interest in the issue, that it is right that we press the Chinese authorities.

I strongly argued that there needs to be a settlement that is negotiated with the representatives of the Dalai Lama. That is our position, and we will continue to argue it strongly.</p>

The hon. Gentleman is also right to raise the case of Roy Bennett, the Deputy Agriculture Minister, and the charges that have been laid against him. We have been clear that we will not only continue our humanitarian aid to Zimbabwe, but stand ready to engage in a massive reconstruction effort, but that must be on the basis of clean politics, an end to violence and an economic approach that benefits the people of Zimbabwe, rather than the cronies of Robert Mugabe.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="90224-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09022444000878"><h5 align="left">3.35 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o110"><a name="09022444000162"><a name="90224-0004.htm_spmin1"><a name="09022444001013"><b>The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Mr. Jack Straw):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the use of the ministerial veto under section 53 of the Freedom of Information Act, in respect of minutes of two Cabinet meetings in March 2003 relating to Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09022444000163">I need first to set out some background. The Freedom of Information Act has profoundly changed the relationship between citizens, and their elected representatives and the media on the one hand, and the Government and public authorities on the other. It has, as intended, made the Executive far more open and accountable. The Act provides a regime for freedom of information which is one of the most open and rigorous in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09022444000164">The Act was the subject of almost three years&#146; intensive debate, by which the original scheme of the Bill was much improved and strengthened. As initially proposed, decisions of the Information Commissioner would in law have been heavily persuasive, but not binding on Ministers. This reflected the regimes in other countries, such as Canada. In the event, however, that scheme was replaced by a much tougher one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09022444000165">There was, however, a key balancing measure written into the Act, and accepted by Parliament. This was to provide, in section 53, that in specific circumstances Ministers and certain others could override a decision of the commissioner or tribunal requiring the release of information, if they believed on reasonable grounds that the decision to withhold the information was in accordance with the requirements of the Act. At the time of the passage of the Bill, Ministers in both Houses provided reassurance about the use of this veto. It would not be commonplace. Undertakings were also given that, although section 53 required and requires a certificate by a single Cabinet Minister or Law Officer, any use of the veto would be subject to prior Cabinet consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09022444000166">The Act came into force on 1 January 2005. From then until September 2008, in approximately 78,000 cases where the requested information was held by Government Departments, it has been released in full. Before the Act, some of it would not have been released for 30 years. Since 2006, the Information Commissioner has dealt with more than 1,500 cases involving Government Departments, and the Information Tribunal has dealt with more than 50 such cases. But no section 53 veto has been used to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09022444000167">In December 2006, the Cabinet Office received a freedom of information request for Cabinet minutes and records relating to the meetings that it held between 7 and 17 March 2003, where the Attorney-General&#146;s legal advice concerning military action against Iraq was considered and discussed. There were two such meetings, on 13 and 17 March. The Cabinet Office refused the request, citing the Act&#146;s exemptions for information relating to policy development and ministerial communications. In keeping with its statutory obligations, the Cabinet Office had considered the public interest in releasing the information, but found twice, on balance, that there was a greater public interest in withholding it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09022444000168">The applicant duly exercised his right to ask the Information Commissioner to investigate the handling of his request. In February 2008 the commissioner reasoned, for the first time, that Cabinet minutes&#151;these ones&#151;should be released. The Cabinet Office appealed the commissioner&#146;s decision to the Information Tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09022444000169">On 27 January 2009, the tribunal published its decision. The tribunal was unanimous in deciding that the informal notes of the Cabinet meetings should be withheld. But, by a majority of two to one, it decided that the public interest balance fell in favour of release of the minutes. It therefore upheld the decision of the Information Commissioner ordering information to be disclosed, subject to some minor redactions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09022444000170">Following that decision, and having taken the view of Cabinet, I have today issued a certificate under section 53 of the Act in an appropriate form and consistent with the Act, the effect of which is that these Cabinet minutes will not now be disclosed. The conclusion that I have reached rests on the assessment of the public interest in disclosure and non-disclosure. I have laid a copy of my certificate, and a detailed statement of the reasons for my decision, in the Libraries of both Houses. My decision was made in accordance with the Government&#146;s policy criteria, which are annexed to my statement of reasons. Copies of these documents have been sent to the requester and are available in the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09022444000171">To permit the commissioner&#146;s and the tribunal&#146;s view of the public interest to prevail would, in my judgment, risk serious damage to Cabinet government&#151;an essential principle of British parliamentary democracy. That eventuality is not in the public interest. Cabinet is the pinnacle of the decision-making machinery of government. It is the forum in which debates on the issues of greatest significance and complexity are conducted. Whether the nation was to take military action was indisputably of the utmost seriousness. However, I disagree with the reasoning of the majority of the tribunal. In their decision, they refer to the &#147;momentous&#148; nature of the decision taken and to the public interest in understanding the approach to that decision and in the accountability of those who took the decision. They then say:</p>
<a name="90224-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09022444000857"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the view of the majority&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09022444000172">of the tribunal&#151;</p>
<a name="90224-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09022444000173"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the questions and concerns that remain about the quite exceptional circumstances of the two relevant meetings create a very strong case in favour of the formal records being disclosed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09022444000174">But in my judgment, that analysis is not correct. The convention of Cabinet confidentiality and the public interest in its maintenance are especially crucial when the issues at hand are of the greatest importance and sensitivity. Indeed, the minority view of the tribunal&#151;that the minutes should be withheld&#151;was formulated on this basis. It stated:</p>
<a name="90224-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09022444000858"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The minority view seeks to reach the decision most likely to support continued confidence that Cabinets can explore difficult issues in full and in private&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09022444000175">It continued:</p>
<a name="90224-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09022444000859"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;publication would, in the minority view, be more likely than not to drive substantive collective discussion or airing of disagreement into informal channels and away from the record. This would over time damage the ability of historians and any inquiries, if constituted, to reconstruct and understand the process Cabinet followed in any particular instance. And it would not be conducive to good government.&#148;</p>
</ul><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09022444000176">Responsibility for Cabinet decisions is with the Government as a whole, not with individual Ministers; that remains the first principle of the ministerial code. The conventions of Cabinet confidentiality and of collective responsibility do not exist as a convenience for Ministers. They are crucial to the accountability of the Executive to Parliament and to the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09022444000177">The concomitant of collective responsibility is that debate is conducted confidentially. Confidentiality serves to promote thorough decision making. Disclosure of the Cabinet minutes in this case jeopardises that space for thought and debate at precisely the point where it has its greatest utility. In short, the damage that disclosure of the minutes in this instance would do far outweighs any corresponding public interest in their disclosure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09022444000178">What the minutes principally record is the deliberations of Cabinet in reaching its decisions. The actual decision that was made at the later Cabinet, on 17 March, was made public straight away, when I as Foreign Secretary conveyed it to the House in an oral statement within three hours of the Cabinet coming to that conclusion. In that statement, I recounted the recent history leading up to Cabinet&#146;s decision, and I brought to the House&#146;s attention the information that had that day been made available to the House, in order better to inform the following day&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09022444000179">Despite the powers under the royal prerogative, we put the use of force to a debate on a substantive motion the next day. In opening that debate, our then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, spelt out in considerable detail the reasons for the Cabinet&#146;s decision. The debate ranged across the history of non-compliance of Saddam&#146;s regime, the negotiating history of the two UN resolutions in the run-up to military action, our discussions with allies, and much else besides. I ended that debate by fully setting out the factors that the Government and Parliament had considered and should bear in mind in voting on the substantive motion before them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09022444000180">The Government subsequently released the Attorney-General&#146;s legal advice. Furthermore, on 25 May 2006 a full disclosure statement was published by the then Attorney-General which set out in considerable detail the considerations taken into account as he reached his opinion on the legality of military action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09022444000181">A number of inquiries have been conducted. There was the Hutton inquiry into the death of David Kelly, and there was the Butler review of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction. Both those inquiries published detailed reports on aspects of the decision to take military action, and we have acted on their recommendations. There has been yet more scrutiny of the decision by Parliament itself, including by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which published its report on weapons of mass destruction, and both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Defence Committee have investigated the matter on a number of occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09022444000182">In summary, the decision to take military action has been examined with a fine-toothed comb; we have been held to account for it in this House and elsewhere. We have done much to meet the public interest in openness and accountability. But the duty to advance that interest further cannot supplant the public interest in maintaining the integrity of our system of government. The decision to exercise the veto has been subject to much thought,  <br>

and it will doubtless&#151;and rightly so&#151;be the object of much scrutiny. I have not taken it lightly, but it is a necessary decision to protect the public interest in effective Cabinet government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09022444000183">Shortly after he became Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister established a high-level inquiry into the 30-year rule under the chairmanship of Mr. Paul Dacre of the <i> Daily Mail</i>. That report, published last month, proposed a reduction from 30 to 15 years of the time after which Cabinet minutes and other papers would automatically be released. I have already told the House that the Government favour a substantial reduction in the 30-year limit. In that context, the report also recommended that we consider protection under the Act for certain categories of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09022444000184">There is a balance to be struck between openness and maintaining aspects of our system of democratic government. This tension is recognised in the fundamental framework of the Freedom of Information Act&#151;and that Act, and much else that we have done, stand testament to the far greater openness and accountability secured under this Government. I commend my statement to the House.</p>

The public have had their expectations about openness raised by Labour&#146;s spin and propaganda, only to be brought down to earth by the intrusion of the realities of government.

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90224-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09022444000188">One must have some sympathy for the Secretary of State. He was, after all, the architect of the Freedom of Information Act, which he is now trying to circumvent. As Foreign Secretary, he was a party to the decision to go to war.

Given what the Secretary of State has resorted to today, would it not be sensible to reintroduce that rule? In view of the principles that he has enunciated on the need for confidentiality at the heart of government, why did he have to string the applicant along through an internal review, an appeal to the Information Commissioner and a counter-appeal to the Information Tribunal&#151;all at considerable public and private expense&#151;when it was plainly a foregone conclusion that the Government would block the release of the information anyway?

Why did the Prime Minister hold a review of the 30-year rule, if not to get the records available for public inspection more swiftly than is currently the case? Did he do so because he hoped that that review would conclude that the limit should be set so that the papers of the Conservative Government would be affected, while the background to the Prime Minister&#146;s own decisions as Chancellor would remain concealed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90224-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09022444000194">We accept, however, that the Secretary of State&#146;s decision is the right one&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> Yes, indeed. I am forced to disagree with the Information Commissioner when he says that such requests will have little impact because they will be rare. Quite the opposite. Because Ministers will not know in advance whether it will be deemed in the public interest to release their discussions, all discussions will be treated as though they could be released. It is clear from the Secretary of State&#146;s statement that he agrees that if that were the case, officials would feel unable to give impartial advice freely, and Ministers would feel unable to discuss matters candidly, which would lead to even more sofa government than we have already suffered from him and his colleagues. May I therefore ask the Secretary of State when this damascene conversion by him, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to those high principles of collective responsibility first took place?

The Secretary of State half concedes that point when he tries to gloss and explain that certain inquiries have already taken place. In the absence of the release of Cabinet minutes, is there not now an overwhelming case for an inquiry along the lines of that held into the Falklands war?

 As the hon. and learned Gentleman blustered, I assumed that at some stage he would get to the point where he expressed agreement, not disagreement, with the issue of my certificate. Perhaps I should have said in my opening statement that we have been grateful for the bipartisan support we have had from senior and distinguished Conservatives, including Lord Hurd of Westwell, who gave evidence to the tribunal, Lord Heseltine and, quite separately, the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind).</p>

No, I am not trying to circumvent it; I am trying to apply an essential component of it. The Government would never have agreed to the Act, and would have invited the House to vote against the Bill, had it not been for the inclusion of section 53. I see one of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s colleagues on the Benches behind him nodding in assent at that.</p>

This is not a simple matter, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, despite his desire&#151;not all that successful&#151;to have it both ways in his bluster. Section 53 is in place precisely to express that tension and to ensure that in certain circumstances, which are very clearly set out, it is possible for a particular Minister to exercise a veto in appropriate and specified cases.</p>

The hon. and learned Gentleman also asked why it was I who made the decision. I made it because it falls under my responsibilities, and I would have been accused of ducking it if I had not. It was also subject to deliberation in Cabinet. He asked me when I finally came to my decision. It was yesterday afternoon, after the final Cabinet discussion of the matter. He asked me what right of appeal there would be. There is no direct right of appeal prescribed in the Act, but it is perfectly possible that some interested party may attempt to secure a judicial review of the decision.</p>

 Can the Secretary of State confirm that the Freedom of Information Act is not to be used like Wikipedia, which people can add to and subtract from, and to which any fraudster can introduce themselves and distort the record? Will he reconfirm what he has just said&#151;that 78,000 documents have been released under the Act? Is it not in accordance with our constitution, going back to Bagehot and others, that we have Cabinet Government and an Executive accountable to this House?

 I agree with my hon. Friend in both respects. The Freedom of Information Act is a package deal. The House would not have been able to have the first establishment of the right of direct access to information without there being some concomitant balancing measure such as section 53. I think that that the House will confirm that, as this is the first time that that section has been exercised in more than four years of the Act being in force, we have kept our word and ensured that its use is exceptional.</p>

In the other 1,500 cases that have been before the commissioner, and the 50 before the tribunal, the decision has been accepted in each case as final, however much the Government might have objected to it in the first place. That is the position, and I am proud that we have ensured that freedom of information is subject to a far more open regime than existed under the previous Administration.</p>

 I also thank the Secretary of State for an advance copy of his statement. I am fascinated that the coalition that supported the Iraq war seems still to exist in the House. The decision to go to war in Iraq was momentous, controversial and disastrous. It was especially disastrous for the rule of international law and for this country&#146;s reputation as an upholder of international law. It marks the point when the Government decisively endorsed the destructive doctrines of military neo-conservatism.</p>

There has never been a full, comprehensive inquiry into the decision to go to war in Iraq. Will the Secretary of State give his full support for an inquiry, not as and when the Prime Minister decides, but now? We need to learn the lessons of that time as quickly as possible. That is why the Cabinet minutes should be released much earlier than normal.</p>

The argument against disclosure is that it might undermine full and frank discussion in Cabinet and mean that discussion will take place informally, outside the meeting. However, is not that precisely what happened under Mr. Blair, with the rise of sofa government? At least the prospect of disclosure in exceptional circumstances&#151;the tribunal made it clear that it is not a matter of disclosing Cabinet minutes all the time, only in exceptional circumstances&#151;might persuade future Cabinets to remember that Cabinet discussion should matter.</p>

 Well, certainly not the latter. There have been plenty of occasions to discuss the nature of the decision to go to war. I profoundly disagree with the hon.

Anybody who had months of intensive negotiation, as I had, about the line-by-line, word-by-word structure of what became resolution 1441 would know its legislative history and why we were justified in making the decision within international law.</p>

had served in a Cabinet&#151;is that the degree of detail, which is properly and essentially given in Cabinet minutes, is such that if those minutes were published, not least in respect of very important issues and discussions, they would undermine, in the manner that I have described, the whole principle and basis of collective responsibility.

The answer is this: an appeal to the High Court would arise on a point of law. There is no suggestion whatever in the structure of the Act that one should wait for an appeal to the High Court under section 59 before exercising a veto, effectively, under section 53. Under section 53, the accountable person is essentially substituting his or her judgment for the judgment made by the commissioner or the tribunal.</p>

However, he will also recall that on Report in the Commons&#151;a very long stage&#151;he identified what he regarded as three ingredients for what he described as a compromise veto: first, there should be a collective Cabinet decision in respect of the veto; secondly, the scope should be narrower; and thirdly, such a veto should not apply to local authorities.

the tribunal has come to decisions that are inappropriate, to ensure full compliance with those decisions, because we are very committed to the spirit as well as to the letter of the Act.

 Surely the tribunal was right to recognise that there is no more momentous a decision made by a Parliament than to take its country into a war of choice.

The Justice Secretary and all Members will remember that at that time, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, frequently told the House that if we only knew what he privately knew, we would understand that the threat was real, that the war was necessary and the action was legal. We had to accept as ordinary Members that we were not privy to the information that was available at a Cabinet level through private security briefings. Cannot the Justice Secretary see that exercising the veto at this point will send out precisely the opposite message that he has tried to convey to the House and that the public will believe that in refusing to clarify whether the Cabinet were among the deceivers or the deceived, nothing is being protected other than their own interests?

 I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he has said. He has the benefit of being correct and also consistent about this for more than 10 years. So far as an opportunity to look at the Act is concerned, recommendation 8.8 of the Dacre review said, as I indicated in my statement, that if the minimum period for the release of documents generally was reduced, as he recommended, from 30 years to 15, but even if it came down to, say 20, there would need to be consideration of changes to the Freedom of Information Act provision in this respect.

If the principle of preserving the sanctity of Cabinet discussions is so important, which I agree with, why did the Secretary of State not exempt it entirely from the Freedom of Information Bill when it went through the House, and why is it that 99 per cent. of the time he is happy for officials and the judiciary to make decisions on freedom of information requests, but on this one occasion he has chosen to use his veto?</p>

Notwithstanding all the bluster from those on the Opposition Benches, it seems to be a mechanism that has been supported in all parts of the House. As for the nature of Cabinet government, the hon.

There are three characteristics to this Bill: it is motivated by concern about climate change; it is motivated by concern about the democratic deficit and for the rights of this House, as balanced against the authority of the Executive; and it is genuinely cross-party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09022444000273">I just wish to mention the timing. My introducing this ten-minute Bill has partly been triggered by proposals for a third runway at Heathrow and the Government&#146;s decision not to allow a full debate in Government time with a vote that will matter so that this House can exercise its genuine opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09022444000274">However, the Bill is about far more than that. Hon. Members will know that an additional runway is proposed for Stansted airport&#151;that issue is being addressed in the High Court today. The constraints on an additional runway at Gatwick expire in 2019, and Hochtief, one of a number of bidders for Gatwick airport, which is up for sale, has expressed its interest&#151;other bidders probably have, too&#151;in an additional runway at Gatwick. The Mayor of London has proposed a new estuary airport which, from the current discussion, would involve four additional runways, in addition to Heathrow, and the potential for expansion to six runways&#151;those would be operated 24 hours a day. In addition, a number of regional airports up and down the country have proposed an expansion of their capacity&#151;the airports at Manchester, Bristol, Bournemouth and Birmingham all have various plans to add various amounts of capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09022444000275">When Heathrow was debated on 28 January, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change told us that it was an issue about &#147;half&#148; a runway. I suggest that he was being disingenuous, because this is a far broader issue. We are facing one of the biggest expansion plans for aviation capacity ever considered in this country, and we are doing so exactly when climate change is supposed to be somewhere near to the top, or at the top, of our agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09022444000276">May I say a word or two about climate change? This House is overwhelmingly convinced of the importance of climate change as an issue&#151;there may be one or two hold-outs, but in every region, and across every party, this is a major issue of concern. The House has also accepted that we have only an extremely limited time in which to act. Virtually every report that we receive&#151;whether it is on the disappearance of Arctic sea ice, the rate of melting of inland ice in Greenland or the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted&#151;suggests that the past scenarios have woefully understated the problem and that the urgency is far greater than we thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09022444000277">As for the consequences of climate change, we have seen a little of the impact of extreme weather conditions in the UK and the rest of the developed world, but we know that the impact on Africa and the developing world will be far more extreme. The potential for conflict across the globe grows, as climate change leads to issues of disappearance and allocation of resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09022444000278">The House has accepted that aviation is a significant contributor to climate change. At the moment, some 13 per cent. of the UK&#146;s contribution to climate change emissions comes from aviation, including some 6 per cent. of the UK&#146;s CO2 emissions. We know that that figure will rise to 25 per cent. by 2038 unless we drastically change the direction of policy. Given the role that aviation plays in climate change, are we really saying that we will never again allow Members of Parliament to have a vote on such a significant issue? In effect, that is where Government legislation has left us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09022444000279">We talk about the democratic deficit, but the Government say, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. We will require that aviation brings CO2 emissions back to 2005 levels by 2050.&#148; But the question is how that will be achieved. The technologies do not exist and the science is not in place, never mind the investment. The Government have also said that aviation is a special case. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has said:</p>
<a name="90224-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09022444000869"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We must all accept the principle that aviation will not bear as big a burden as other sectors in the economy.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 28 January 2009; Vol. 487, c. 404.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09022444000280">Must we really accept that without knowing the impact on other industries, on our regions, and on jobs in our constituencies? Indeed, must we accept that without a vote? On an issue that is crucial to the future of our country and our planet, and when every strategy is untried and uncertain, what are we doing giving up our right, and the right of this House, to decide?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09022444000281">This is a genuinely cross-party Bill. In fact, it is a Back Benchers&#146; Bill. It has three Labour sponsors, three Conservative sponsors, a Plaid Cymru sponsor and four Liberal Democrat sponsors. If I were able to add more sponsors, the list would continue to reflect the make-up of this House very directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09022444000282">I carefully read the speeches made on 28 January in the debate on Heathrow introduced by the Conservatives. Fairly or unfairly, some Labour Members could not bring themselves to vote for an Opposition motion. This Bill is not an Opposition motion, so that inhibition disappears. Some Labour Members thought that the 28 January motion was not clear enough, even though it was based on the early-day motion tabled by the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan). The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) said:</p>
<a name="90224-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="09022444000870"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I will go home because there is no motion for Members of Parliament like me who want to halt the expansion of aviation&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 28 January 2009; Vol. 487, c. 388.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09022444000283">That does not apply to this Bill. Indeed, I suspect that Members who favour airport expansion but care about the rights of this House can see a way to support this Bill, because it is about the democratic deficit as much as it is about climate change and aviation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09022444000284">There are times when we have to delegate our responsibilities, but when we are facing the biggest challenge of our lifetime, when our knowledge is so  <br>

uncertain, and when the cost of a wrong decision is so high, we cannot say, &#147;Oh, the Climate Change Committee will decide.&#148; We cannot say, &#147;The Infrastructure Planning Commission will decide.&#148; We cannot even say that the Government should decide, unchallenged and unchallengeable by any vote. Our constituents expect us to shoulder crucial responsibilities, and on that basis, I ask hon. Members to support this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o155"><a name="09022444000285"><a name="90224-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="09022444001058"><b>Mr. David Wilshire (Spelthorne) (Con):</b>
 Like the majority of my constituents who live along the boundary fence at Heathrow, and like my local borough council, I support the building of another runway at Heathrow. However, as you will rightly remind me if I carry on in this vein, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is not yet another debate about Heathrow, so I shall avoid that subject for the moment; there will be plenty more opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09022444000286">I oppose the Bill for four reasons. First, I want to ask people to consider whether it is really necessary. For heaven&#146;s sake, we have already had two debates and two votes recently on the questions of aviation and building new runways. How many more do we want?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09022444000287">The second reason why I ask the House not to support the Bill is that it refers only to airports. I would go along with the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) in that I, too, think that successive Governments have undermined the power of Parliament and I believe that it is right and proper for us to debate whether Parliament should take back some of its power. The time has come for that debate. However, that is a general matter, which we should discuss in the overall pattern of things rather than simply picking on airports. Do I really need to remind the House that going after special issues and using them to make general law results in a dog&#146;s breakfast? The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 proves the point only too well&#151;to go after one subject and end up with a general law does damage. I would use that argument about why it is wrong simply to pick on airports, even though I support the principle of more power for Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09022444000288">The third reason why I invite people not to support the Bill is that, as the motion is worded, it is about major airports and the extension of runways at major airports. It states that we have to have a vote if the Government want to build or to expand a major airport. Why pick on major airports? If more flying and more runways are wrong, surely we should include all airports? If we leave out minor airports, the principle of the Bill is undermined. Let us just suppose that instead of having a debate about a third runway at Heathrow, which is undeniably a major airport, we suddenly had a debate about a second runway at Northolt, which is a minor airport and would not be covered by the Bill? Another runway at Northolt would in fact be a third runway at Heathrow, so the Bill as it stands is not sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09022444000289">The fourth reason why I think that the House should not contemplate such a Bill is that we should reflect, just for a moment, on the consequences should the Bill become an Act. If we introduced yet another debate, yet another vote and yet another procedure into the system, we would simply have even more delay in our planning process. It would make it even harder for British airports to respond to foreign competition, and there is enough  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Feb 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>24 Feb 2009 : Column 173</b><br>
of that at the moment. We are already suffering from foreign airports&#146; taking business away from us. That is dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09022444000290">The second consequence would be that that delay would fatally undermine the fact that the United Kingdom has Europe&#146;s No. 1 hub airport at Heathrow. We would damage Heathrow beyond repair if we allowed that to happen. If that were to happen, the next consequence would be serious damage to the national economy. I doubt that anybody in the House wants to vote for a Bill that would make matters worse for the national economy. Over and above those consequences&#151;I refer to the people who sent me to this House&#151;would be massive unemployment in my constituency. I was not sent here to support that or to vote for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09022444000291">The hon. Lady spoke about global warming and climate change. If the Bill became an Act, it would do nothing to help the local environment. All it would do is divert flying to some other airport somewhere else. We would achieve nothing except shooting ourselves in the foot as far as the economy is concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90224-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09022444000292">As I have said, I support the principle of more power for Parliament, but the Bill is not the way to do it. All the Bill would do, if it became an Act, is deepen and lengthen the economic crisis that is facing this country and cause even more financial suffering for my constituents and everyone who lives around Heathrow airport.</p>

It was told to me by the father of one of our soldiers serving in Afghanistan. The soldier was home on leave and out in his local town centre when he became the victim of an unprovoked attack from behind by two youths. He was able to hold them off and the police were called, but he was left badly bruised by what had been an unpremeditated attack. The two young men were arrested, but then, extraordinarily, they were let off with a caution. After 11 years of this Government, we have become a nation that appears so used to a violent assault of that kind that the police deem it fit only for a caution; we have become a nation in which such attacks are sadly routine and not a rare exception. There can be no clearer example of the fact that our society desperately needs change.</p>

We have a Government who have simply failed to deliver; they have been soft on crime and soft on the causes of crime. We have another snapshot of a broken society, where antisocial behaviour is endemic, violence has become a norm, offenders do not seem to give a damn, carrying weapons is just routine, families can be terrorised by teenage gangs and many of our older people are in fear for their safety. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I am glad that the Minister for Borders and Immigration agrees with me and that he recognises the problems that we face.

We have endemic educational failure, with these young men often playing truant as they grow up. We have generational worklessness in their families. There is often the growing problem of addiction to drugs or alcohol, which destroys family life and immunises the consciences of many of those people out on our streets when they come to cause the trouble that they do.</p>

 My hon. Friend, with all his legal experience, knows more than most the root causes of many of the law and order problems that we face among our young people. He is absolutely right. Yesterday, I visited Feltham young offenders institution. What comes over loud and clear is how many of the people who end up in such institutions have profound educational failings in their background. That is certainly an issue that we need to address. It is a scandal that after 12 years of this Government&#146;s rhetoric about all the things they were going to do&#151;&#147;My priority is education, education, education&#148;&#151;one in five young people still leave school barely able to read and write.

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90224-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09022444000773">At the heart of this challenge is a simple fact in the lives of many young people: nobody really says no to them, so the misdemeanours of youth go unpunished, and they get away with it and do it again and again. The other consequence of people turning against society and becoming ghettoised is a haemorrhaging of the values that once kept crime in check, particularly violent crime. Too many people just do not care and cannot tell the difference between good and bad, and the Government do not know what to do about it.</p>

 Would the hon. Gentleman therefore applaud this weekend&#146;s Operation Staysafe, which was pioneered by Merseyside police, although I understand that other police forces followed suit? They picked up young people on the streets who were at risk of becoming victims of crime or on the slippery path to becoming criminals themselves. Some 60 children were picked up, 29 of them in my own borough of Knowsley, and taken to safe places&#151;some of them were even taken to hospital because of their consumption of drink&#151;and their parents were involved. Is not that something practical that the Government are doing to address the issue that he mentions?</p>

extensively to police officers. The big problem is that there is nothing between a police officer meeting a gang of young people on the streets and the criminal justice system except for the Government&#146;s clumsy system of antisocial behaviour orders, which take months, and multiple agencies, to deliver. Police officers say that they want something simple and straightforward that gives them some power to deal immediately with the problems that they face. They do not have such powers today, and I believe that my proposals will grant them in a way that is quick, simple and not bureaucratic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90224-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09022444000778">The Government&#146;s record speaks for itself. There has been a decade of failure to get to grips with law and order problems. Violent crime is up almost 80 per cent., robbery is up 27 per cent., criminal damage is up past 1 million offences, with nearly 3,000 committed every day, fatal stabbings are up by a third, and gun crime has nearly doubled, with injuries from gun crime up almost fourfold&#151;and the Government&#146;s response has been to be soft on crime. They have let people out of prison early, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) rightly said. Since the Prime Minister came to power, 47,000 people have been released early from prison, including 9,000 convicted of violent offences. Nearly 1,000 crimes have been committed by criminals who have been released early&#151;and they are only the ones who have been caught. Five out of six offenders convicted of knife possession get off without a jail sentence. More and more offenders are let off with penalty notices, half of which are not even paid.</p>

crime itself. We have to tackle youth antisocial behaviour. Plenty of teenagers stray off the straight and narrow sometimes, but today there are no consequences when they do so. That is what has to change. All too often, when we look at the case of a 15 or 16-year-old who is starting to commit serious offences, we find a story of years of minor misdemeanours that have gone unpunished. That cannot be right. At the moment, things are moving in the wrong direction. In 2007-08, more than 93,000 youngsters aged between 10 and 17 received their first caution or conviction, which is up from 78,000 just five years ago&#151;a big jump in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90224-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09022444000786">ASBOs have become a badge of honour for some, and they take months to impose. The Government&#146;s section 30 orders just move young gangs from the streets that they are on to the next potential hot spot. In the police Bill currently being considered, the Government are even talking about moving 10-year-olds on to the next street. I think that 10-year-olds out on the street causing difficulties should be sent home, not just moved on to the next street. That is where my thinking about grounding orders comes from, because they would give the police a power to send an immediate message to such young offenders that they cannot get away with causing trouble on our streets.</p>

 Taking on board the point made by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee about the need to minimise police bureaucracy, would the hon. Gentleman perhaps consider an alternative to his proposal for grounding orders? Penalty notices could be given by police officers or police community support officers asking young people to clean up things such as graffiti immediately. That would not require the constant supervision that is arguably suggested by the grounding order, and it would be clear and easy to apply.</p>

 There is some logic in having tougher community sentences for young offenders, but the simplicity of the grounding order makes it deliverable quickly by the police and local magistrates. It would be a powerful weapon in the armoury of individual officers in trying to deal with such problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90224-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09022444000789">The second thing that we need to change is the licensing regime. We should be much more robust about binge drinking in our towns and cities. There is a strong case for reviewing Labour&#146;s 24-hour drinking regime, which has not created the continental caf&#233; culture that we were promised. We should deal systematically with retailers who break licensing laws and clubs that allow drug taking on their premises, and there should be powers to do so simply and quickly. We need to take steps to stop unacceptable practices in the sale of alcohol to young people. I have come across the case of an organisation delivering alcohol to a local park, which cannot be sensible or acceptable.</p>

Issuing a caution should not be a case closed, a tick in the box and an extra notch on the list to be sent to the Home Office for the Home Secretary to review. That is not good enough. Giving someone a caution should not be a way of scoring an easy win in the case-closed league table. That has to be a thing of the past. Someone found carrying a knife in a city centre should end up in the courts and then behind bars, not get a caution. Unbelievably, I was told recently of someone getting a &#163;65 penalty notice for carrying a 3 ft-long samurai sword around a city centre. All that has to stop. Someone who attacks a stranger in the street should end up in court and then behind bars, not get a caution and simply be sent on their way.</p>

Still only about 14 per cent. of police officers&#146; time is spent on patrol, compared with about a fifth on paperwork. If we walk into any police station and ask the officers what is their biggest bugbear, despite all the reports, reviews and announcements, they still tell us that it is the paperwork.</p>

They look like a tired Government who have run out of ideas, and they seem to have little idea of how to solve the problems that we all face.

 On the subject of effective policies that the Government have introduced, may I take the Home Secretary back to the time when I revealed to the Committee that considered the Violent Crime Reduction Bill that many thousands of children carried knives into school every day? The Government&#146;s answer then was to introduce a policy allowing head teachers to search children for knives. Has that happened often? Roughly how many prosecutions have resulted from the exercise of that power?</p>

 Yes, it has happened. What has also happened is that scanners have been made available in some schools, along with search arches. It is a good thing that knives are hardly ever found in our schools. The point of the policy, as the hon. Gentleman said, is not to get young people into court, but to deter them from carrying knives in the first place, and that is what we have been doing. Thankfully, Opposition Members have failed in their attempts to undermine our determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with local communities in the fight against crime and antisocial behaviour and to give them the powers that they need to stop daily life from being made a misery.</p>

That order was made possible only because covert CCTV had helped to capture evidence of antisocial behaviour and illegal activities. We know that CCTV is crucial to protecting the decent law-abiding public from thuggish behaviour, but we do not know where the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell and his Front-Bench colleagues stand on the issue these days. If he can bring himself to support the use of CCTV to make our streets safe, and the use of the DNA database to catch criminals, that will indeed be a major step forward in Tory thinking.</p>

 I will be supporting the Home Secretary&#146;s amendment in the Lobby this evening because it is constructive, rather than simply an example of petty point-scoring like the Opposition&#146;s motion. Does she agree that communities will find nothing gimmicky in the use of technical equipment to recognise car number plates, so that they can know that they will be kept safe by the police? The police can see burglars and other known criminals going into communities in their cars and can take defensive action to stop burglaries and other crimes. There is nothing gimmicky about that; it is just a good example of using technical equipment in policing.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, as so often, is absolutely right: that is why police officers who use number plate recognition are five times more effective at making arrests than those who do not.</p>

That is a pity, because it would be a good opportunity to explain his latest thinking on the need for there to be &#147;fewer rights, more wrongs&#148;. I wonder what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), with his solid support for the European convention on human rights, will make of that comment, which we heard this week.</p>

First, since 1997 crime in this country has come down by 39 per cent.&#151;an unprecedented amount&#151;overall. Violence is down by 40 per cent. and burglary is down by 55 per cent. He has only been in his job for a month, but before he opens his mouth to repeat the claim that violent crime is up by almost 80 per cent.&#151;he has done it again today&#151;I hope that he will pause for thought and try to remember two crucial details: the expansion of the &#147;violent crime&#148; category in 1998, and the introduction of the national crime recording standard in April 2002.</p>

 Like my hon.

She is right to say that on an unadjusted basis the figures would be different, because the rise then would be 300 per cent. The figures are in a Home Office statistical bulletin&#151;and I know there is some doubt on the part of the chief statistician about the manipulation of Home Office figures&#151;but on a like-for-like basis, there were 502,778 offences in 1998-99 as compared with 961,188 offences in the last year.</p>

 Let me contribute to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s education. I have just explained the difference made by changes to the violent crime category in 1998 and changes to the national crime recording standard in 2002. That is why the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds subscribed to the British crime survey as being an important way in which we measure violent crime. In the British crime survey, measured on a like-for-like basis, violent crime has fallen by 40 per cent. since 1997. That is due in large part, of course, to the tireless work of the police in bearing down on crime and building up public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90224-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09022444000824">That brings me to fact No. 2. Since 1997, we have seen record investment in the police and record numbers of police officers, police staff and police community support officers: record investment and record numbers, backed up by concrete steps to cut red tape, such as scrapping the stop-and-account form and police timesheets, so that more officers are freed up to spend more time on the beat. The action that we are taking will help us to deliver our plans to save up to 7 million hours of police time&#151;the equivalent of an extra 3,500 officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90224-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09022444000825">Yet we have heard few words of support from the hon.

shyness into plain English. That means 3,500 fewer police officers in this country, including 49 in his local police force alone. The contrast could not be more stark: our plans to free up 3,500 more officers, or the Opposition&#146;s plans to make cuts of the same number.</p>

On Friday night and Saturday night, the police were out doing the very thing that the hon. Gentleman claimed on Monday morning that they were not doing enough of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90224-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09022444000842">The hon. Gentleman also needs to look at the small print of his proposals on the curfew order, which we have heard more of today, to keep troublemakers inside their houses. That is a good idea, which is why the police already have the power to go to a magistrate and ask for a troublemaker to be prevented from leaving their house at night. That is called an ASBO. Since 1999, the police have routinely been able to impose a curfew as a condition of an ASBO, and breaching it is a criminal offence.</p>

 I am most grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way a second time. There is nothing wrong with putting forward new ideas, but my problem with the proposals of the hon.

 I have to say to my right hon. Friend that there are times when police officers should visit the homes of young people whom they are returning to those homes. They should be supported through Government investment in things such as Operation Staysafe to be able to do so.</p>

When we take a tough approach to antisocial behaviour, crime comes down. When we more than double the number of people in drug treatment, crime comes down. When we ensure that parents live up to their responsibilities, and when we invest &#163;25 million in family intervention projects to reach 20,000 of the most complex families over the next two years, crime comes down.</p>

In fact, the &#147;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&#148; tone that he has adopted reminds me not of Tony Blair in 1993, but of someone very different.

There is a clear pragmatic principle, but sadly it seems that the debate is not about that. Both the other parties are locked in a populist battle about punishment&#151;about who can be tougher, who can promise longer sentences, and who can lock up more people. The Government have criminalised a generation of young people. We lock up more young people than any other country in Europe. In 10 years, the number of 15-to-17-year-olds in custody has risen by 86 per cent. Our overall prison population has doubled, and it is also the highest in Europe. The average Crown court sentence has risen from 22 months to 25 months since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90224-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09022468000003">At the same time, we have clearly succumbed to legislative diarrhoea, with 3,600 new criminal offences and 66 new criminal justice Bills. Bills are being used to send signals like press releases. Do we really need a new offence of setting off a nuclear explosion? Would not murder, or even criminal damage, have been sufficient? Is it any wonder that all who try to make the criminal justice system work, from police officers through barristers to judges, are mystified by the results of this legal whirling dervish?</p>

The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) says that he wants &#147;at home ASBOs&#148; for young people, so that they can be marched off and put under curfew. As we have heard, those powers are already on the statute book to cover night-time. If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he wants to extend them to cover all time other than time at school. He wants a presumption that everyone carrying a knife will suffer a custodial sentence. Let us leave aside the completely implausible cost of that proposal.</p>

overall crime looks persuasive, of course, but the comparison does not look so persuasive when we note that the only country in the European Union where crime has risen since 1988 is Belgium. Everywhere else crime has fallen, including in the UK. In Denmark, there was a 9 per cent. fall in crime and a 9 per cent. cut in the prison population, and Finland offers a similar example. Outside the EU, in Canada there has been a 17 per cent. drop in crime with incarceration rates broadly stable.</p>

 Does this not actually prove the point of those who say that prison works? Lots of people go into prison; lots of people suddenly decide it is not a good idea to commit crime; therefore, the number of crimes committed goes down and the prison population falls because there is no need to lock as many people up. That is why prison works, and prison is a bargain for the taxpayer.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has clearly not been listening to my speech, and I suggest he studies it in <i> Hansard </i>tomorrow, because I have given him a lot of international examples of where there are falling prison populations combined with falling crime.

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90224-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09022468000013">Of course the criminal justice system matters.

Of the young men whom we lock up in prison for the first time with sentences of less than a year, 92 per cent. go on to reoffend&#151;prisons are, frankly, colleges of crime. A former Conservative Home Secretary, David Waddington, said that prison was</p>
<a name="90224-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="09022468000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an expensive way of making bad people worse.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90224-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09022468000014">We should use non-custodial means of dealing with young and first offenders far more, not because we are soft, but because it works. The Matrix Knowledge Group recently found that seven alternatives to prison were better value for money for the taxpayer in reducing reoffending&#151;and I always thought the Conservatives were keen on better value for money.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that the number of people who commit crimes after being sentenced to prison for less than a year is very high, but will he concede that the longer people spend in prison, the less likely they are to reoffend? For those who spend more than four years in prison, the reoffending rate drops to about 35 per cent. Is not the answer, therefore, that these people should spend longer in prison, rather than less?</p>

there must be prison for serious offences and for serial offenders, but what matters most in cutting crime is detection. We could introduce sharia law in this country, but we would not cut crime if the detection rate did not improve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90224-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09022468000019">If we take the British crime survey definitions of crime and add in crime against young people under 16 and business crime, we can see that about one crime in 100 leads to a conviction in a court of law, and that is nothing like enough&#151;I hope that the hon. Members for Shipley (Philip Davies) and for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) agree. Detection rates of recorded crime have fallen back from 34 per cent. at the end of the &#146;80s to 28 per cent. according to the latest figures. We can all agree that we need to cut police bureaucracy and to use more information technology, but anyone who thinks that they are the real or only problems has not studied the sharp differences in detection rates between police forces. Even for crimes such as violence against the person, to which the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell has rightly been drawing attention, detection rates vary from a low of 36 per cent. in the case of London&#146;s Metropolitan police to 67 per cent. in North Yorkshire. Of course, rural areas are easier to consider in this regard, but even like-with-like comparisons show big gaps in performance: Merseyside and Greater Manchester police manage rates of 54 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively, which are far higher than the figure for the Metropolitan police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90224-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09022468000020">What if we narrowed the differences with best practice? Some 400,000 more crimes would be detected if the average detection rate were close to that of the top 10 per cent. We need more police on the beat, which should be done by curbing prison costs and by scrapping the identity card scheme. Equally important, at a time of scrimping on budgets and real hardship for so many families, is the need for better and more effective policing.</p>

Then we had the Green Paper, which sensibly suggested getting rid of targets and establishing serious local accountability instead. Unfortunately, the Home Secretary has now bottled the local accountability, so we are back to the system we had before 2002, which was found to have failed.

We should also put public faith back into the crime figures by ensuring that we do not have repeats of today&#146;s rather unedifying spat between the Conservatives and Labour on whether or not the British crime survey or the recorded crime figures are correct.

I was pleased to hear about the real success story of the Government&#146;s policy on law and order over the past 12 years. I was also pleased to hear from the Home Secretary about the following: the work of the neighbourhood policing teams; the record level of investment that has been made; the overall fall in crime&#151;she put that at 40 per cent., and although my figures show that the fall has been even better, we will use her figures; and the fact that this country&#146;s police funding is the highest among the OECD. I welcome the decision taken only last week by Ministers to implement the rest of the recommendations of the Flanagan report. I believe that of the 59 recommendations to cut police bureaucracy 19 have so far<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> I do not wish to interrupt the discussion going on between the two junior Ministers on the Front Bench, because I know that they have important things to discuss&#151;</p>

 It is kind of the Minister to say that, but as I was lavishing praise on the Government I would have thought he would wish to hear it. I was pleased that 19 of the 59 recommendations made by Sir Ronnie Flanagan have been implemented and that only this week a written statement from the Home Secretary told us that the so-called Normington review and the first tranche of work by Jan Berry are to be accepted by the Home Office and that therefore bureaucracy will be cut even further.</p>

figures, there are 15,805 police community support officers that we never had before and we have an extra 15,000 police officers&#151;their number has increased from 125,825 to 140,230 this year.</p>

 As always, I am listening with great interest to the right hon. Gentleman, and he makes a lot of sense. The Government&#146;s answer to a question put by me suggests that the number of police officers on patrol has fallen by 30 per cent. in the last three years. We may be getting more police officers, but they are certainly not out on the beat.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right, but the Government have sought to make amends. The problem is the targets that were imposed on police officers at every level. Those targets are now being removed. I do not understand why we would impose targets on local police forces in an attempt to make them more efficient and cost-effective, and then five or six years later decide that targets do not work and there is no point having them. But let us give the Government the benefit of the doubt. They have recognised that the targets that were imposed were not necessary and they are removing them. That will result in an extra 260,000 hours of police time. If we accept what the Government have said this week, police officers will have an extra 30 minutes a day out of the police station and out on the beat, in Northampton, in Leicester and in London&#151;where we would like to see them and so that we can justify all the additional money that we have spent on the police service. If that is the Government&#146;s direction, I welcome it wholeheartedly. If it means more officers on the beat and not filling in forms, hooray for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90224-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09022468000037">My concern, as I raised with the Home Secretary, was the report in <i> The Times</i> today and the comments made by Dr. Timothy Brain, who is supposed to be the leading expert&#151;and with a name like that, one would imagine that he would be&#151;for the Association of Chief Police Officers on finance. That chief constable told the newspaper that, as a result of what the Government have done over the past few years, he will have to cut the number of police officers in his force in Gloucestershire by 60. The newspaper telephoned other chief constables to ask them what the reduction will be in their area. In Suffolk&#151;I choose that county off the top of my head&#151;we are told that the reduction will be 28 officers.</p>

The Government assert that more money has been spent on the police force than at any time in its history. But Dr. Brain and other chief constables readily tell newspapers that they will have to reduce the number of officers as a result of what the Government have done. These are serious matters, and they go to the heart of the point made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. Let us be clear about those statistics. Let us monitor them independently, so that we can have a real debate about substance and policy, rather than about whose statistics are correct.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the situation that he sets out is of particular concern at a time when we know that we can expect&#151;and are beginning to see&#151;a rise in acquisitive crime because of the impact of the recession? This is not the time to remove police officers from the front line.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. This is the worst time to do that, and I do not think that it will happen. Given the Government&#146;s figures, the introduction of PCSOs and the proposals to reduce bureaucracy, what will police officers do if they do not need to fill in unnecessary forms and will be resourced as they have never been resourced before? In those circumstances, there should be no reduction in the number of police officers.</p>

I welcome what the Government have done in making a commitment to put in an extra &#163;18 million for new technology, and that is precisely what the Home Affairs Committee called for&#151;I see two members of the Committee in their places. &#147;Policing for the 21st Century&#148; was a unanimous report. We took evidence for over nine months from witnesses including Sir Ronnie Flanagan and Ministers, and we came to the conclusion that new technology would save police officers enormous amounts of time. The investment in new technology should be warmly welcomed, with the caveat suggested by Jan Berry in her report about the need for compatibility between police forces. There is no point in Lincolnshire buying one type of equipment if it is incompatible with the equipment that is purchased by Leicestershire. I suggest that Ministers, as well as providing the money, should introduce effective guidelines on procurement to ensure that when police forces buy new technology and equipment, it is compatible with other areas. That matter is connected to the database issue and the need to ensure that when the computers of the 42 different police authorities speak to each other, they are able to understand what is required.</p>

training in using equipment. Without training and support, new equipment is meaningless. However, there are examples of good practice all over the country. In Bedfordshire, the introduction of personal digital assistants&#151;PDAs&#151;meant that police officers spent 46 per cent. more time out of their stations. So there is every reason to support the introduction of better equipment and to give all officers access to it. It is not sufficient to allow some officers to have such equipment. If it is decided that it will be useful, everyone should have it.</p>

I am saying that we need to be very careful about how we use such powers.

I am not against the principle of curfews, but we should consider their use carefully to ensure that police time, although not necessarily the money, is costed. If we are saving the police time in terms of cutting bureaucracy, we need to ensure that that time is used effectively. I hope that when the proposals are fleshed out, we will know the result of that analysis. If the proposals turn out to be good, the Government should accept them&#151;we should be able to build on fresh, new ideas that will benefit people.</p>

It is important that we consider the huge issues that we do not want to tackle, because we are politicians, and the Home Secretary, in particular, has to make instant decisions and provide the public with an instant panacea to deal with the huge problem of the underlying causes of crime.</p>

Perhaps we should have tried to work on this problem sooner, but it is incumbent on the Government and on Ministers, who are listening carefully to what I am saying, to consider the long-term solutions even at this stage, with a year and a bit to go until the end of the Parliament. They should set in stone the values and principles for the future. We are all against an increase in crime, we all want to see more bobbies on the beat and we all want to get value for money. Those issues unite everyone, but communicating the fundamental values to the public so that they can be discussed is important. That is why one of the overlooked recommendations of the Select Committee was that we should have a royal commission into policing to consider why we have police officers, what they do, Parliament&#146;s vision for them and how they fit with the law and order issues that we discuss. In grappling with the short-term problems of crime&#151;those problems are clearly short-term, as crime happens daily, hourly and every minute&#151;will the Government also use the opportunity to consider the long term and to lay the foundation stones that will make this society much safer?</p>

One day 10 or 12 years ago when I was visiting a young offenders institution&#151;in Kent, I think it was&#151;I met a 19-year-old young man, in a cell, looking depressed, tired and drawn. Incidentally, he spent 17 hours a day banged up in his cell. I asked him what he was doing there and he said, &#147;I am here for driving while disqualified.&#148; &#147;What&#146;s the problem?&#148; I said, &#147;Are you a bad driver? Do you speed? Do you drive dangerously? Do you nick cars? What on earth is wrong with your driving?&#148; &#147;Nothing&#146;s wrong,&#148; he said, &#147;My driving is good. I&#146;m perfectly okay, but I don&#146;t have a driving licence so I get disqualified.&#148; &#147;So,&#148; I said, &#147;Get a driving licence.&#148; It was not unreasonable of me to say that. &#147;But I can&#146;t,&#148; he said. I asked why not and he replied, &#147;Because I would have to take the theory test.&#148; &#147;What&#146;s the problem with the theory test?&#148; I said. &#147;I can&#146;t pass it, because I can&#146;t read and write.&#148; That got me thinking&#151;and I have thought ever since&#151;about the link between crime and literacy.</p>

When things go wrong, they are excluded because of their poor performance, and they are out on the streets, where they commit crimes, which leads to their being locked up. There is a link between levels of literacy and school exclusions, and between school exclusions and crime.</p>

men in custody&#151;boys up to the age of 21&#151;had been permanently excluded from school. There is surely a link&#151;I hope that the House will understand this&#151;between literacy and numeracy, school exclusions and crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90224-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09022468000054">I want to focus for a few minutes on the young offender estate&#151;the prison estate that holds youngsters aged from 13 to 21&#151;and to tell the House a little about my experiences. I talk to many people who work in the young offender estate and ask about the levels of literacy among the boys who arrive at the ages of 13, 14, 15 and 16. One senior official told me that in his judgment, which is backed by many others at that young offenders institution, more than 80 per cent. of the youngsters admitted at the age of 15 had the literacy and numeracy level of an eight-year-old or of someone even younger. What the devil does that mean? It means that there are 15 and 16-year-old boys who basically cannot read or write. They cannot cope, and that has led to frustration and anger. I am not saying that that covers the whole scene, but it is a problem and it greatly troubles the young offender estate.</p>

The average cost of putting a youngster into the young offender prison estate is &#163;33,000 a year. That is what it costs us. In Feltham A and Feltham B, which are the two young offenders institutions in Feltham, it costs &#163;42,000 for the year. That is a lot of money, and what do we get in value for money? What about the reoffending rates? They are absolutely mind-boggling. Official Government figures show that 16 and 17-year-olds who are released from custody have, respectively, an 80 and 70 per cent. chance of reoffending within a year of release.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful point, but should we not take into account the cost of that reoffending? Would it not often be cheaper, in simple financial terms, to keep somebody in Feltham at &#163;33,000 than to have them committing one offence after another on the streets of London?</p>

 I will to come to that. Value for money, for me, means that people come out of Feltham, or anywhere else, and do not reoffend. That, I think, is what will save money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90224-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09022468000058">Worse still, Government figures show that the 80 per cent. of those released who reoffend within one year do so, on average, four times in that year. Given that people are caught only once in every eight crimes that they commit, nobody can doubt the fact that, in effect, those youngsters are coming out and committing 30 or 40 crimes in their first year. At a cost of &#163;33,000 a year, that is failure on a grand scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90224-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09022468000059">What are my remedies and solutions, if any? I have a few, which I want to draw to the attention of the House, and the first relates to literacy and numeracy. When someone arrives at a young offenders institution, on day one&#151;I do not mean month one; I mean day one&#151;a complete assessment of their educational position hitherto and their achievements should be undertaken. If they have been statemented, a full copy of the statement, binding on the prison, should be provided, and the prison should act upon it. Straightaway after that, a plan for that individual offender should be drawn up, showing what he or she must achieve in their time in that young offenders institution.</p>

No, I am talking about sport, out on the field in the open air. I met a young man who had not seen daylight in four months at a young offenders institution. Where is the sport?

 Does my hon.

Here is my nuts-and-bolts idea: in the last quarter of the sentence, all youngsters should be moved into a specific resettlement wing. What will happen then? The family will get more involved. Huge amounts of work will be done to arrange housing on release. It is no good leaving a young offenders institution in Surrey and being sent off to bed and breakfast in Slough at the age of 16. What is going on? Resettlement is the name of the game, coupled with the absolute requirement of going into a job. Education on release, housing on release, job on release&#151;those are the things.</p>

Oh yes, we can lock them up for ever if we want, but let us get the children literate, get them numerate, get them adding up and subtracting, get them to have a bit of pride, get them fit and well and give them a purpose. Let us give them a little remission, but it should be based on positive, excellent behaviour and real achievement, not just on sitting on their backsides or joining a gang. Let us focus on resettling them into the community, not back where they came from, but into a job or education. Let us put money into that. If we put money into it, we will save quite a lot of money in the long term, and we will be doing absolutely the right thing.</p>

But even Home Office Ministers now admit that crime is likely to increase over the next few years as a result of the recession, so we are certainly agreed on that. I personally think that it is very difficult to trust the statistics, whether one uses the recorded crime figures or the British crime survey, which is little more than an opinion poll. It does not take into account crimes committed on people under the age of 16 or property offences, and drug offences are unlikely to show up. So a gamut of offences is unlikely to show up, and the people behind the survey are simply asking a small sample of people, rather than the entire population, to give their opinions about crime, so it is as accurate at best as a political opinion poll. Recorded crime statistics are no real gauge either, because much of the violent crime that takes place on Britain&#146;s streets is carried out between young people, who very often do not report it, even if they are the victims.</p>

However, most of those crimes will not be reported to the police, because there is no obligation on hospitals to do so.

 The Government are right to publish those figures. Some good work is being done by the Government at the moment, and I will come to that before I make too many criticisms, but I shall first return to the picture of crime and follow some of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09022468000076">All sorts of reasons are given about why crime is so high&#151;as another hon. Member said, it is certainly too high&#151;but I do not accept that poverty is one of them. Of course, one can find a statistical link between poverty and crime, but simply not having money does not cause people to commit crime. Happily, I come from a reasonably comfortable background, although perhaps not as privileged as some. My mother was a miner&#146;s daughter. She grew up in relative poverty. She says that there was hardly any crime in her community. My wife is from a family of agricultural labourers in eastern Europe. They live in a block of flats, where there is no crime, no graffiti and people are nice to one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09022468000077">What causes crime? Although this sounds a little old-fashioned, I think that the cause in many cases is a lack of proper family structure, but I take issue with people who talk about single-parent mothers. Such comments are lazy and an insult to the vast majority of people who do an excellent job in bringing up their children. I would never use that term, and I hope that other Members would not use it either. However, we ought to be honest enough to admit that there is a problem in some estates that have high levels of poverty with young people who become pregnant. If we ever talk about single-parent mothers, let us admit that it takes two to tango; there is a single father somewhere who has behaved in an irresponsible fashion.</p>

How much harder will that be for somebody with very little education and money who lives on a difficult estate? It will be impossible. Sadly, children who grow up surrounded by crime, drugs and benefits are likely to fall into the system. I do not know whether I put that tactfully enough, but it is true and we all know it. We should be able to address that.</p>

measures against pupils&#151;and not just pupils who walk in carrying knives, or who assault teachers, but pupils who walk in without their top button done up, or not wearing the proper uniform. That way, children will know that there are boundaries and things that they cannot do, and that if they transgress those boundaries, there will be consequences. That message does not get through at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09022468000080">I have some experience of the police, and experience of some of the good things that the Government are doing. I do not want to be critical all the time; there are Government initiatives that I fully support. For example, I support greater use of the Taser. I saw the most ludicrous Liberal Democrat press release this morning. It refers to &#147;Taser guns&#148;. Clearly, the Liberal Democrats are not aware that a Taser is not a gun at all; it is not a firearm, in the sense that it does not fire a projectile bullet. A Taser is far less dangerous than the baton that all police officers carry. That is why it is possible for police officers to fire a Taser at each other to experience the effects. Nobody in their right mind would stand there while somebody hit them with a police-issue baton, which could be absolutely lethal if it caught somebody in the wrong place. I notice that the press release refers to &#147;children&#148;. In their inconsistent fashion, the Liberal Democrats refer to &#147;children&#148; whenever somebody aged between 16 and 18 is involved in the criminal justice system, but to &#147;adults&#148; when coming forward with other ludicrous policies, such as giving voting rights to 16-year-olds, a subject that we will not go into now.</p>

 I could not stand it any longer; I had to intervene. May I recommend that the hon.

 I have looked at the Amnesty report, which deals, I think, with America. America has a very different system of policing from the United Kingdom and any other western European state. It is not a system of policing that I would recommend. If Amnesty were to consider the issue in context, it would have to look into how many people would have been shot dead with a bullet by American police officers had Tasers not been available to them. If a 16 or 17-year-old armed with a knife, and possibly high on drugs, came towards the hon. Gentleman, and the only person in the way was a police officer, I think that the hon. Gentleman would prefer the police officer to have a Taser than to rely on gas or anything else.</p>

In any case, Tasers all have microphones, which means that the chances of them being misused in this country are very slight indeed. The Government are absolutely right on the issue, and they went about things in the right way; they used a pilot study, and have allowed chief constables to decide on the subject for themselves.</p>

 I would be happy to do so if the hon. Gentleman let somebody wallop him over the head with a baton; that is the alternative that police officers have at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09022468000089">What the Government have done on forms is quite good. The stop-and-account form is going, but there is more that they could do. The stop and search form is still very lengthy. I accept that there are situations in which it needs to be fully filled in, but when members of the public are stopped and subjected to a random search under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, often the problem is not so much that they find the search intrusive; it is more that they are irritated about the fact that they have to stand around for five or 10 minutes while the police officer takes down all sorts of information, which is often unnecessary. That delays them in getting to where they want to go. The search that is usually carried out is no different to the one that we all experience when we go into an airport. The public are getting used to the idea that a quick frisk is sometimes necessary for their own safety. The issue is the length of the form and the fact that the public are not aware that they do not have to wait for the police officer to fill it all in. Police officers should be encouraged to say, &#147;You don&#146;t have to wait, but if you want a record of the search, I am happy to get it for you.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09022468000090">As I have mentioned before, it is inconsistent that police officers who stop people who are committing offences, who simply wish to talk to a person, or who detain a person so that they can be summonsed for a revenue offence, cannot carry out a quick search. Very often, those people are involved in criminality, and I would change the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to allow that to happen. If the Minister for Borders and Immigration wants to make a quick hit and get rid of a whole load of paperwork, he could give the British Transport police the power to issue penalty notices for disorder for revenue offences. Transport for London can do so, but the police cannot, which means that they have to get through a whole load of paperwork if they want to prosecute somebody for such an offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09022468000091">To return to the big picture, the problem is not the number of police officers. There are adequate numbers of police officers. The problem is that a small number of people commit so much crime that they take up all the time that should be available to police officers. In 2003, the Carter report suggested that half of all crime in this country is carried out by about 100,000 people, of whom only 15,000 are in prison at any particular time. Every police officer meets those people almost daily. They are arrested; two officers take them to a police station; a whole laborious process is gone through; the  <br>

person is bailed and is then back out on the streets, and carries out further offences on the following day. That is why we need not more police officers, but more prison officers and prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09022468000092">I do not accept the comments made about the cost of keeping people in prison. The cost of keeping somebody in a category D prison is about &#163;25,000 a year. Most of the people who go to those prisons are on benefits. It was not I who brought up the issue of cost, but other Members have done so. The net cost of keeping somebody in prison is far cheaper than people realise. I believe that the net cost to the taxpayer of keeping somebody in a category D prison is not more than about &#163;10,000 a year. The cost of keeping them out on the streets committing one offence after another is absolutely horrendous. It is also a huge burden on police time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09022468000093">I agree with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. There are two prisons in my constituency, which I have visited. I have also visited other prisons with the Home Affairs Committee. There is nothing like as much work going on in those prisons to help offenders as there could be. What I propose is not dissimilar to what my hon. Friend suggested. Yes, we should put people in prison, and make it clear to them that they should serve their sentence in full. It is a disgrace that somebody given four years in prison could be out in one year and seven months under some sort of early release scheme, and that somebody sentenced to a year in prison will be out after just three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09022468000094">One of the reasons why reoffending is so high is that prison is not seen as any sort of deterrent. A Faustian pact is made; because people are usually in prison for only a couple of months, the authorities effectively say, &#147;Give us a quiet life and you can have your PlayStation and your television. Just don&#146;t cause us any trouble,&#148; so people spend all their time in their cells. We should get people out of their cells and get them working. We should give them practical skills. That is what happens in prisons such as Usk, which deals with special types of offenders. We should get that sort of culture into all prisons, particularly those dealing with younger people. Remission should not be automatic. Indeed, I am opposed in general to any form of early release. However, if we are to have early release, I would make it conditional on people getting rudimentary educational skills, passing exams and getting some sort of vocational skill that could give them a chance to work in the real world. Unless we start to tackle what goes on in the justice system, crime will continue to rise, and the police will find it harder and harder to cope.</p>

The second objective is to provide the funds to ensure that there are sufficient resources for that to happen, for if law is poorly written or insufficient, it can be exploited by criminal elements. If law is too restrictive, it can place limitations on individual freedoms. Aside from the dictatorial tendencies that that can produce, it can hinder the free market and the potential prosperity of a nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09022469000005">With insufficient funding, police cannot enforce the law or train to understand the new challenges that we face&#151;for example, cyberfraud and terrorism, neither of which has been mentioned in the debate. Cuts in front-line policing are likely to take place. We have heard that time and again from the constabularies. The reason is the recession that we are going through, which brings with it a wave of crime. Large numbers of police forces, unfortunately, are planning to cut thousands of officers. That is the case because the Government do not understand the priorities. I understand that 19 of the 43 constabularies are being forced to cut the number of officers, and that is simply to do with money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09022469000006">The budget that has been set for 2009-10 is causing these cuts, with forces having to agree settlements of 2.8 per cent. Twenty of the police forces throughout the country have received only a 2.5 per cent. increase. One of those forces is Dorset&#146;s. If we get only a 2.5 per cent. increase in our budget&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Does the Minister wish me to give way? I shall finish the point and gladly give way. If Dorset receives only 2.5 per cent., but has to meet a pay award of 2.6 per cent., it will clearly have to make budget cuts. It cannot pay the police salaries without a shortfall elsewhere. That is why there has to be a reduction in the police force. Does the Minister wish to respond? Silence.</p>

 I caution the hon. Gentleman about using that tactic. First, if I have understood it correctly, his party&#146;s policy would result in a reduction in public expenditure, so the 2.5 per cent. that he mentions would presumably be less. Secondly, does he not acknowledge that the Government have provided above-inflation settlements for police authorities, including Dorset, and does he not further acknowledge in respect of his party leader&#146;s calls for devolution that there is a responsibility on the policy authority to balance its books?</p>

 I hate to educate the Minister, who is experienced, but he knows that I was prompting him to answer my question. Instead, he posed three of his own questions, so I go back to the point. If the police are given an increase of only 2.5 per cent. when they have to pay salary increases of 2.6 per cent., there will be cuts. That is exactly what has happened in Dorset, which has one of the best performing but worst funded police forces in the country. We lost 13 officers last year and we are about to lose another 50 posts. That is all because of the cuts.</p>

We in Dorset are glad to host the Weymouth sailing events, but has one extra penny been provided to meet the extra security requirements for such events? Not one. That is another source of pressure on our police, making them resort to cuts.</p>

It is also about a way of life and a set of values. Law and order exists to catch those who behave in an unacceptable way, but it should also be about teaching values that prevent somebody from choosing to break the law. Why not prevent criminal tendencies from developing at an early age and stop people committing crime when they get older?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09022469000011">I pay tribute to the Dorset Life Education bus. That organisation goes around schools teaching kids the difference between right and wrong, and good and bad, making them confront issues and talk about challenges that they may face in future which might take them into a world of petty crime and lead to further crime in their later lives. Unfortunately, that great initiative will have its budget cut because there is not enough money coming from Government. I would be grateful if the Minister looked into that, as the organisation provides an important means of preventing crime and teaching young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09022469000012">Role models have changed so much since I grew up, and certainly since my parents and grandparents grew up. In the absence of proper role models, perhaps as a result of broken families, people look at their television screens, see a premier league football player go up and swear at a referee, and they think that that is how to deal with authority. That is appalling. When they are out on the street and see authority&#151;a policeman, for example&#151;they respond in the same way. We need initiatives to prevent children growing up with such bad habits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90224-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09022469000013">Statistics have been bandied about in the debate. Cautions are up by 28 per cent. A gun crime is committed every hour in England and Wales, and a knife crime every half an hour. An ASBO is seen as a badge of honour, and we have one of the highest rates of cannabis use in Europe. We also have one of the highest levels of antisocial behaviour, and the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe.</p>

Davies) spoke about the importance of prisons and rehabilitation, and the fact that so many people are going to prison and not getting the rehabilitation that they need. It is a horrifying statistic that 92 per cent. of those who go to prison for less than one year reoffend immediately, and about half of all prisoners reoffend. That suggests that they are not being rehabilitated and given the opportunity to do something better with their lives. They are not particularly good at crime as they keep getting caught, but they are never given the chance to do something else. The Government must address that. Instead, they are locking more people up in Titan prisons. There is not enough talk about what happens when prisoners spend time behind bars.</p>

crime between 3 am and 6 am. Our police have to stay on duty for longer hours and do overtime. That costs Dorset constabulary more money, which is why there is pressure to cut the number of posts. We have heard a lot about the statistics, but I would like to see greater clarity instead of the two systems that we have&#151;police reported crime and the British crime survey. Let us agree on one set of statistics, rather than the embarrassing interchange of statistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09022469000016">We have heard about the important role of police community support officers. I do not doubt that they play an important role, but in Bournemouth, as in every other part of the country, they go to bed at 10 pm. They go off the streets at just the time that Bournemouth starts to get quite vibrant. When our town centres start to pick up, extra eyes and ears are needed. Police community support officers are fine, but why not encourage more special constables? I was in the Regular Army, and I was delighted to see my companions coming from the Territorial Army to boost us when we required support. Why not emulate what my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth is doing? Constabularies should be allowed to have as many special officers as they like, because on the big nights&#151;Friday, Saturday and football nights&#151;they need extra police officers, and that is when they could use people who serve part time. Such people need to make ends meet and cannot serve on a voluntary basis, as special constables are made to do at present.</p>

We have heard that 66 pieces of legislation have been introduced, yet there has been little public confidence in the criminal justice system; there is certainly little faith in our prison rehabilitation system.</p>

How ironic that, 10 years later, the current Prime Minister said in a conference speech that we should punish crime and prevent it by dealing with the root causes. That is saying exactly the same in different words, and it shows that 10 years later the Government are still saying the same thing. The job has not been done.</p>

Let us for the sake of argument ignore the fatuity of the slogan &#147;broken society&#148;, which belongs in the same glossary of meaningless political slogans as the &#147;war on terror&#148;. Let us concede that society is broken: who broke it? It was the recently acknowledged heroine of the Leader of the Opposition. When in government, she said that there was no such thing as society and pursued policies based on that premise which had the effect of damaging the lives of the very citizens who make up society. We are still living with the consequences.</p>

What did the hon. Gentleman offer to tackle the problems? Not a word. What we need is action, and action requires resources. The Conservatives, of course, are committed to cutting resources. The hon.

They have offered more police community support officers, antisocial behaviour orders, social exclusion orders, spot fines and curfews. In my area, all those measures are being used to effect.</p>

It can help to identify reasons for the young person being on the street late at night and intervene where necessary to protect our most vulnerable.&#148;</p>

 In the few short minutes that I have, I should like to draw the Government&#146;s attention to Flycapture, a well-thought-out initiative that has unfortunately not been well executed. The Minister is frowning&#151;perhaps for the same reason why many in my community have been frowning. Flycapture involves the central recording of fly-tipping in various constituencies. Fly-tipping blights many rural constituencies. With National Farmers Union representatives, I went to my local police county headquarters and attended a summit on this very matter. I find it disturbing that the county council, the police, the district council, the Gypsy and Traveller liaison officer and others involved in dealing with various aspects of fly-tipping clearance were unaware of the Flycapture system and unaware that there was central recording. Will the Government look into the system, roll out it out further and agree that local authorities need to come to a co-ordinated approach, so that we can crack down on rural crime and fly-tipping?</p>

I am concerned that many in prison should have had much more care in the community and help with their mental health problems before they ended up there. When such people leave prison, they are often in a worse state than when they entered it. The Government should address that problem and ensure that resources go into communities to make sure that, as far as possible&#151;as far as it can be controlled&#151;it does not happen in future.</p>

They are setting up Ummah UK, a community group to pull together Muslim groups, teach them about terrorism and extremism and how to resist it, and encourage them to resist the increasing use of drugs and alcohol that, unfortunately, dogs some ethnic minority communities. The group aims to work with the community to give a positive role model and promote positive activities. I congratulate the Muslim community in my area on looking to help policing in my community and on keeping its young people actively engaged with others there and with keeping their lives on track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09022469000042">We have heard in this debate the sorry catalogue of the Government&#146;s failure to deliver on law and order after nearly 12 years in office. Sixteen years after a young and ambitious shadow Home Secretary set out his analysis of the need to tackle crime and its causes, we see a society in which youth disorder is rife and violent crime up by a staggering 88 per cent. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is not untrue. The Lord Chancellor should not intervene from a sedentary position, because these are his own Home Office statistics, about which there was an intervention on the Home Secretary. Perhaps he might choose to explain why more than 50 knife crimes are now being recorded every day, and fatal stabbings are up by a third, at an all-time high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09022469000043">Tony Blair&#146;s most famous pledge&#151;the one that marked him out as new Labour and helped him ride to the Labour leadership&#151;was never delivered. What a contrast with the inheritance that Labour received. Tony Blair&#146;s then opposite number, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), was the first Home Secretary in decades to reverse the trend on rising crime. By force of will&#151; and, of course, with the benefit of some pretty special advice&#151;he changed the culture of the Home Office. In much the same way as, 10 years earlier, Baroness Thatcher challenged and changed the assumptions of the British establishment that their job was simply the civilised management of Britain&#146;s relative decline, my right hon. and learned Friend challenged and changed the perception of those at the Home Office that their job was simply to try to manage, as best one could, inevitably rising crime levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09022469000044">These lessons we have learned. That is why I suggest that right hon. and hon. Members pay careful attention to the comments of my hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary, not only in introducing this debate but in the speech that he made yesterday to the Local Government Association. The remarks introducing him made by the Leader of the Opposition&#151;the former special adviser to the last Conservative, and last successful, Home Secretary&#151;also bear examination. Change is coming. Focus will be given to the Home Office and the police. Addressing the causes of crime will belong to the rest of Government; the Home Office will address crime. The police will be transformed from the centre, with a straightforward mission to fight crime and empowered by clear local accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09022469000045">We have also learned what is not the answer. If legislative activism, money, eye-catching initiatives and bureaucratic accountability were the answer, it is inconceivable that the trend of falling crime inherited by this Government would not have continued. There have been 25 policing or crime Bills since 1997, with the latest major Bill, the Policing and Crime Bill, making its way through Committee as we speak. This endless stream of legislation might keep shadow Ministers engaged as they try to meet the challenge of getting up to speed with the latest legislative ideas in the much reduced time available to Parliament to examine them properly, but the overall effect has been highly doubtful. Such has been the blizzard of new legislation that it is well known that the judges are struggling to keep up. They are spending more time on legal refresher courses than ever before, with courts having to close as a result. If judges are struggling with this legislative blizzard, what on earth do Ministers think it is like for the police, who are expected to police the 3,000 new offences thus created?</p>

The gloomy economic outlook that we face today means that the challenges facing the police over the coming months will get worse. Indeed, as the then Minister of State at the Home Office, the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), said in response to a leaked Home Office document, it is &#147;blindingly obvious&#148; that some aspects of crime increase in a period of recession. It was reported in <i> The Guardian</i> yesterday that Superintendent David Hartshorn, the head of the Metropolitan Police&#146;s public order branch&#151;Britain&#146;s most senior police officer with responsibility for public order&#151;raised the spectre of riots, with people who have lost their jobs, homes or savings becoming &#147;foot soldiers&#148; in a wave of potentially violent mass protests. Today, <i> The Times</i> highlights the fall in police numbers as the ugly reality of Government finance starts to make itself felt. The mismanagement of the economy, like the mismanagement of the police and criminal justice system, has left people more vulnerable to crime and left our society more vulnerable to social disorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09022469000047">The Government are no closer to delivering on crime today than when they first came to power. Whichever way Ministers spin figures on crime, it is clear that violent crime is up, robbery is up, gun crime has nearly doubled and knife crime is on the rise, with fatal stabbings at an all-time high. Labour has failed to empower the police to tackle the criminals, and has left some of our town centres virtual no-go areas for law-abiding citizens. Instead, despite years of criticism from the police and from the Opposition, the police are still spending a fifth of their working day dealing with paperwork. Talk about wasting police time! The huge growth in the use of discretionary cautions means that when police officers do encounter criminals, it is far less likely that the criminal will ever end up in a court, let alone a prison cell. Despite all the rhetoric on knife crime, the Government still refuse to apply a presumption that carrying a knife will mean a prison sentence. Despite initiative after initiative and an unprecedented volume of criminal justice legislation, the net result after 12 years of this Government is that people feel less safe, in parts of our country antisocial behaviour has become the norm, and the innocent citizen feels that his own liberties have been curtailed to no useful purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90224-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09022469000048">It is time for a Government who are serious about tackling crime head on by releasing police officers to deal with the criminals, and time to mend the broken society that has allowed criminal behaviour to become endemic in our towns and cities. I commend the motion in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell, who, in speaking to the Local Government Association yesterday and in the House today, has demonstrated that he will be a worthy successor to the last Home Secretary who turned back the tide on crime&#151;another inheritance that has been so scandalously squandered by this wretched and unhappy Government.</p>

Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell) who could not be at the Dispatch Box because of Committee duties. That is why you will have to put up with me this evening, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09022469000050">I was looking forward to this debate because I thought that I would find out about the views of hon. Members across the House, and the views of those on the Opposition Front Bench. We did achieve the former, and we heard some very thoughtful speeches, to which I will respond in a moment&#151;but sadly, what we heard from the Opposition Front Bench was a repeat of a speech that was delivered yesterday. I do not know what the rules and procedure of the House are concerning informing the House first, but if we have an Opposition debate it is important that we find out something new, instead of the single transferable speech that we heard, not from the Liberal Democrats, but from the hon. Member for the front page&#151;sorry, the Front Bench.</p>

 Yes, and it was funny then, and it is funny now. I am going to keep on using it, because it is obviously hitting home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09022469000053">The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) made a thoughtful speech. He described our procedures as a legal whirling dervish. He described the shadow Home Secretary as dangerously Napoleonic and Caesarist&#151;language often heard in &#147;The Dog and Duck&#148; in Eastleigh, I am sure&#151;and he accused my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary of populist punitiveness. I can assure the House, having worked closely alongside the Home Secretary, that she does not go in for populist punitiveness. She has yet to tell me what it means, but I am sure that it was well intended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09022469000054">The right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, made a thoughtful speech on the analysis&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My right hon. Friend is in his place, as he always is. He made a thoughtful analysis of the figures on police numbers, and got behind those figures to the issue of the allocation of police time, which is the really important point. The figures that he pointed out with regard to Gloucestershire and other police authorities were important. He talked about equipment compatibility, and I assure him that the National Police Improvement Agency is looking at that issue. He raised the case of Lincolnshire, in particular. We also thank my right hon. Friend for his Committee&#146;s report, and his work on early intervention is important. This was one of the biggest gaps in the speech of the shadow Home Secretary. I was looking forward to his analysis of the causes of crime, but detail on that subject was thin on the ground. The Chairman of the Select Committee, on the other hand, gave us a thoughtful analysis of early intervention.</p>

He put forward practical solutions focusing on how people in custody, particularly young men&#151;he was right to refer to them&#151;should be given more instruction, education and opportunities when they leave custody. There was a strange coming together of his ideas and those of the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), who spoke from his experience of being a special constable.

applaud him for that, despite our party political differences. It is good for Parliament that Members undertake such duties, and there are Members in our party who do so as well. There was an interesting coming together of the two analyses. They were different in their premises, but similar in their conclusions, and they concerned what more can be done to give young men&#151;not just young men, but those young men in particular&#151;that added work experience. The hon. Member for Monmouth was good enough not to play yah-boo politics, which some have done in this debate, and to acknowledge the good things that have taken place. That gave his criticisms greater force, and we take those points on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09022469000056">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) stood up for his constituency by calling for more resources for Dorset, and I now turn to that point. The resources provided to Dorset police authority have gone up by 47 per cent. since 1997, which is a 12 per cent. increase in real terms. I will come to this morning&#146;s report in <i> The Times</i> in a moment, but police numbers in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s authority area have increased by 179, to 1,463 officers, under this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09022469000059">My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara), given his family experience&#151;his sons are police officers&#151;quite rightly pointed out the rather trivial nature of the Opposition slogan &#147;the broken society&#148;, which simply serves to talk down our country. This Government have never claimed that there are no problems in our society; of course there are&#151;but my hon. Friend pointed out the end result of the Opposition&#146;s policy. Opposition Members should look in the mirror in the morning and ask themselves a question. If they talk about reining in the horns of the public sector and reducing public expenditure, they cannot in all credibility come to this House and call for measures that would involve more resources, or criticise us for not providing them&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> From a sedentary position, the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) says that they can do that, because they are in opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09022469000060">In a brief speech, the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) made three or four important points. I will certainly ask my colleague the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing to look at the point she made about the fly-tipping project in her area. She made some important points about mental health, and the Government&#146;s initiatives in that area should be commended, but it is right that we recognise that issue. She also praised the Muslim community, and she was right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09022469000061">The hon. Member for Reigate read out his speech extremely well, which is all I can say about it. I was disappointed that he did not respond to the analysis that hon. Members in various parts of the House had put forward. The Opposition should think hard about this point. They take the slogan &#147;Tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime&#148; from Tony Blair, but they need to provide an analysis based on the facts of the situation. Just briefly, let us look at the resources. I assume that the article in <i> The Times</i> is coincidental to  <br>

this debate, but again I congratulate the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) on his front page this morning&#151;well done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09022469000062">Let me read out the figures for the seven forces that were criticised in the papers this morning. The article refers to Durham; I remember signing off a 30 per cent. increase for Durham police authority when I was a local government Minister; I think that the Prime Minister had some interest in that at the time. There has been a 49 per cent. increase in the number of Durham police, with 288 extra police staff. In Gloucestershire there has been a 52 per cent. increase, with 228 extra police staff. In Gwent there has been an increase of 91 per cent., with 415 extra police. In Hampshire, there has been an increase of 79 per cent., with 1,045 extra police. In North Yorkshire there has been an increase of 101 per cent., with 527 extra police staff. In Surrey, in the local county force of the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell, there has been an increase of 136 per cent., meaning 994 extra police staff. In South Yorkshire the increase was only 59 per cent., with 764 extra police staff. The Opposition call for more resources, but condemn the very Government who have brought them about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90224-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09022469000063">I come to the analysis put forward by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell in the speech that he was kind enough to read out to the House following his speech to the Local Government Association yesterday. It really is not good enough to come along and bandy about statistics when every independent authority and every independent provider of statistics has shown that crime has fallen under this Government. It is not true to say that because we have changed the methodology of reporting violent crime, violent crime has gone up. That is the politics of 1984, and I condemn the Opposition&#146;s motion and commend the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09022469000619">We have called the debate today because of a simple principle: people have a right to know where their food comes from. Currently, meat that is processed here, but imported, such as bacon, sausages and meat in ready meals, can be labelled &#147;British&#148;. We believe that that is a dishonest system, which misleads consumers, undermines attempts to improve animal welfare and disadvantages our farmers. Nothing in current food labelling regulations defines how much British involvement is required before food can qualify as British. A combination of European Union directives, United Kingdom legislation and domestic regulations has created an environment in which consumers are confused and misled by the labelling of their food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09022469000620">Last week, my office visited some major supermarkets and found several products with no country of origin information. Many others were simply labelled, &#147;Produced in the UK&#148;, which might lead somebody to believe that the meat was from this country. We found a Birds Eye Great British Menu roast beef meal, which admitted on the back that the beef was imported&#151;that is not very British. We even found a Marks and Spencer sandwich, emblazoned with the &#147;nation&#146;s favourite sandwich&#148; and a Union flag, which admitted on the reverse, in rather smaller print, that the corned beef came from Brazil. Those buying a Tesco Disney-branded children&#146;s roast dinner, labelled &#147;Produced in the UK&#148;, would not know that they were feeding their children with chicken from Thailand. They would know that only if they took the time to call the customer helpline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09022469000621">If people wish to eat imported chicken, that should be their choice. Consumers should be free to choose food from any country. We are in Fairtrade fortnight, and we acknowledge that many people choose to support producers in developing countries. After all, British farmers have important export markets, too. However, real choice requires real information. Clear labelling would empower consumers, not restrict their options. Two thirds of pigmeat imported into this country might have been reared in conditions that are banned here. The current rules force our farmers, who have high welfare standards, to compete against cheaper meat products that can still be labelled as British. Shoppers who wish to endorse higher animal welfare standards by buying British may end up unintentionally backing  <br>

more cruel methods of production overseas. That is why we think that a system of clear labelling is essential, and it is overwhelmingly supported by the public.</p>

 We on the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have looked into the issue a great deal. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if he went to the car park of the Arundel Co-op&#151;if there is one&#151;on Saturday with a petition urging people to endorse, for instance, higher welfare standards for pigs, they would be pushing him aside to sign that petition, but that seconds later the same hands that had gripped the pen to sign the petition would be reaching into the chiller cabinet for the cheapest cut of pork, almost no matter what it was? Labelling is important, but it is not the only part of the equation, is it?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman should know that there is indeed a Co-op in Arundel, which I have been into. People should exercise choice. If there is a section of the public that wishes to buy cheaper meat, those people should be free to do so, but they should know where that meat comes from. However, at the moment they do not necessarily know that. Last week we conducted an opinion survey through ICM, a reputable pollster, which found that a majority of the public would support British production if it produced food that was either the same price or even more expensive. Only a minority said that it would prefer the cheaper produce. Nevertheless, it is quite understandable, particularly in the current economic climate, that people may wish to exercise the option of cheaper food, but they must know where it comes from. Of course they should be free to choose. The same survey conducted by ICM showed that 87 per cent. of voters agree that the Government should ensure that the country of origin is displayed clearly on food.</p>

 There is not a great deal in the motion with which I can disagree; indeed, I have supported cross-party attempts to get better labelling, so I would support that. However, the one thing that is missing is something about the sourcing of food locally. One way that the public can definitely know that whatever they buy and subsequently eat is what they believe it to be is by knowing that it is produced locally. Should there not have been something in the motion about locally produced food and the way farmers&#146; markets have shown us the way on what people can expect?</p>

 We on the Conservative Benches are strong supporters of locally sourced food. In fact, there is a farmers&#146; market in Arundel as well. Many people choose to support such markets and to buy food from such outlets, because they wish to support local producers. I strongly endorse that choice, which is good for our domestic producers and local farmers. That choice would be exercised more if there were more transparency about where our food comes from generally because that would raise public consciousness about the origin of food, which is important.</p>

 I am not sure that I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but I will come to the extent to which a labelling scheme would be lawful under EU law. We on the Conservative Benches believe that it would be. I cannot believe that sensible legislation would get in the way of transparency in labelling. That is surely what all of us, in all parts of the House, should want. Indeed, it should be a fundamental consumer entitlement.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is being very generous in giving way. It seems to me, looking at the motion and the Government&#146;s amendment, that this is a bit of a non-debate. The issue is important in respect of consumer information, but it seems odd for a debate in the House of Commons. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that a much more important issue in relation to food is food security, particularly with climate change in the world. We are not doing enough about security of supply in the United Kingdom. That is the debate worth having in the Chamber, not this one.</p>

 I note that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s judgment about whether the motion is worth while did not stop him from making one of his customary interventions. I will turn to the issue of food security, but the two issues are, in fact, linked. If we have rules that effectively discriminate against British farmers, that affects our ability to produce more from our own resources. That is an important link.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09022469000630">I fundamentally disagree that the issue is not important. Not only is it important for consumer confidence in food; it is extremely important for the interests of British producers, who have suffered a great deal. That is particularly true of pigmeat producers, who have suffered declining sales in recent years because the public are, frankly, being duped into believing that they are buying British when they are not. There has been a strong public response to the campaigning on the issue by people such as Jamie Oliver and others. The hon. Gentleman would find that there is public interest in the issue not just in rural areas, but across the country. I therefore do not accept that it is not important.</p>

 In view of the Conservatives&#146; enthusiasm for transparency in the food chain, I would be interested in the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s view on the Competition Commission&#146;s inquiry last year, which found that supermarkets transfer excessive cost and risk to suppliers and which recommended the establishment of a grocery sector ombudsman. If such transparency were introduced in the food supply chain, surely that would assist him and his party in achieving the kind of objectives that he is advocating today. Will the Conservatives therefore support the recommendations of the Competition Commission inquiry into the supermarkets?</p>

major supermarkets needed to treat British producers with more respect, and that proposal would be one way to make that happen. However, I do not see the direct link, which the hon. Gentleman sought to draw, between that proposal and transparency. A sensible scheme for transparency will require the supermarkets to participate. Indeed, I will make the case that a voluntary scheme has not proven possible because of the unwillingness of the major supermarkets to participate. That is why a compulsory scheme is, I regret to say, now necessary.</p>

 I pay due tribute to my friend in this regard, the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George). The Competition Commission inquiry into the grocery trade was hamstrung by the unwillingness of suppliers to give evidence, even in camera. That indicates the unfairness of the system. All parties ought to be standing up to the supermarkets to get greater fairness and a genuinely level playing field. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree to that.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but he should be directing his comments to the Government and asking them what action they propose to take in response to the commission&#146;s proposals.

 My hon. Friend is being very generous in giving way.

He mentioned the pig industry just now, but hardly any British pork is bought by the Ministry of Defence for the Army. Does he agree that the public sector&#151;the MOD, the health service and the education sector&#151;could do much better in its efforts to purchase British food?</p>

<a name="90224-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="09022469000672"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Consumers win as... retailers agree on labelling&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09022469000645">The following year, the Minister came to the House to proclaim his three objectives, and said:</p>
<a name="90224-0015.htm_brev4"><a name="09022469000673"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want to give clear unambiguous information on the real place of origin, not place of processing or place of slicing; I want to clamp down on misleading place of origin descriptions; and I want to make further progress by lobbying the European Commission and other member states for a system of clear country of origin labelling.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 28 October 1999; Vol. 366, c. 1126.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09022469000646">That was 10 years ago; 10 years on, Ministers are saying exactly the same thing. Despite repeated promises, there is no adequate voluntary agreement and there is no acceptable deal in Europe. It is disappointing that the Secretary of State has now decided that the way forward is a reheated voluntary agreement at home and yet more negotiations with the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09022469000647">The Secretary of State told last week&#146;s National Farmers Union conference that he had met representatives of the supermarkets to discuss this voluntary agreement. Perhaps the Minister of State will update the House about the progress of those talks, as there is little sign of any action. What of the stores outside the big four supermarkets, which account for around &#163;40 billion-worth of grocery sales every year&#151;some 35 per cent. of the total? Any voluntary scheme that includes only the major supermarkets would cover less than two thirds of sales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09022469000648">I am afraid that after 10 years of promises, we on the Conservative Benches are sceptical&#151;a view shared by the farming industry&#151;about the chances of meaningful voluntary agreement with the retailers, because those retailers are not willing to provide the information that the public want. The Irish pork scare last year showed the drawback of unclear labelling. Supermarkets withdrew Irish meat in case it had been contaminated, but there was no guarantee that it had not been processed somewhere in this country and was sitting in our fridges with a British label on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09022469000649">We live in an age of consumer choice and transparency. Anyone who stands in the way is on the wrong side of the argument. The British Retail Consortium has claimed that in the labelling of food,</p>
<a name="90224-0015.htm_brev5"><a name="09022469000674"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it&#146;s the process rather than the origin that&#146;s important&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09022469000650">I completely disagree: the production is important, but consumers expect to know the origin of meat, not just where it was last processed. A recent survey found that an overwhelming majority of the public&#151;89 per cent.&#151;felt  <br>

that a meat product labelled as British or produced in the UK should mean that it was from an animal reared in Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09022469000651">There is no suggestion that food retailers are systematically attempting to mislead the public, and the FSA guidelines exist to prevent that, but unclear labelling that is perfectly permissible under current rules does, in fact, allow consumers to be misled. That is the effect, whether it is intended or not. It is because the retailers&#151;or I should say, some of the retailers&#151;do not accept the need for country of origin labelling that voluntary agreement has proved impossible. It is noticeable, for instance, that Marks and Spencer has accepted the need for compulsory country of origin labelling.</p>

<p><a name="st_o280"><a name="09022469000652"><a name="90224-0015.htm_spnew18"><a name="09022469001254"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b>
 There is a further point to consider. Does my hon. Friend agree that the retailers will accept country of origin labelling when they think it will give them a premium, as sometimes happens with English milk, but they will not when they want to sell an own-brand product and they want to disguise the fact that the meat comes from Hungary or Brazil, for example?</p>

<p><a name="st_o281"><a name="09022469000653"><a name="90224-0015.htm_spnew19"><a name="09022469001255"><b>Nick Herbert:</b>
 Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend that there is evidence that some retailers have been willing to move towards more transparent labelling in respect of premium products, but on the value labels, they have not been so willing. I hope that our survey will give them more confidence that people would support British production across their product ranges, but in any case, I do not think that we should resile from the principle that the consumer should know where the meat comes from, irrespective of the price, and then make a choice. We should stand by that principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09022469000654">Opposition Members thus believe that the only course now is to adopt compulsory country of origin labelling. In the first instance, we believe that it should apply to meat and meat products, where the instances of misleading labelling, and their effects, are particularly serious. Beef labelling regulations first introduced in 1997 in reaction to BSE have proved workable. In general, all beef and veal must already indicate the country of origin, by reference to the place where the animal was born, reared and slaughtered. The time has come to extend that practice. So last week, my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) and I launched the honest food campaign to ensure that imported meat cannot be simply processed in this country and then labelled with a British flag. We propose to introduce a food labelling regulations (amendment) Bill to make honest labelling of all meat and meat products a statutory requirement. It echoes a number of similar private Members&#146; Bills that have been promoted by Conservative Members over the past few years, most recently by my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90224-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09022469000655">To date, the Government have resisted those proposals. I urge them to reconsider and to join a growing consensus in the belief that change is needed. As well as the farming industry and trade associations representing the livestock sector, animal welfare groups such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Compassion in World Farming are also supporting the objectives of the honest food campaign. Let us be clear: those organisations are not supporting another voluntary scheme; they are calling for compulsory country of origin labelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90224-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09022469000656">Our plans would follow similar approaches taken in America and Australia. Both countries recognised that their consumers were being duped by the existing packaging and the natural demand for the correct information required labelling rules that had legal force. Their experience shows that the cost of better labelling will be negligible. In the United States, a study put the increased cost of origin labelling for poultry at as little as 0.01 per cent., while the EU has said that small businesses consulted would expect a positive impact from compulsory origin labelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90224-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09022469000657">Of course, new regulations need to be proportionate. That is why we are proposing in our own draft Bill that the regulations will require the labelling of meat ingredients when they represent 10 per cent. or more of a product. So, for example, a typical ready meal would be covered, as most consumers would expect, but not a pepperoni pizza&#151;unless the manufacturer decided otherwise. I believe that this proposal strikes the right balance between the consumer interest and what is practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90224-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09022469000658">In their amendment for tonight&#146;s debate and elsewhere, the Government have claimed that what we are proposing, even if desirable, is not possible under EU law. We disagree. Our Bill is not about restricting trade. It will simply require UK processors and retailers to label their products appropriately. Under EU regulations on the marketing of foodstuffs, member states can require the labelling of origin when the absence of such information could mislead or confuse the consumer&#151;and our consumers are being misled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90224-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09022469000659">Ministers claim what we are proposing has been tried already. They point to a recent attempt by the Irish Government to introduce country of origin labelling for poultry, pig and sheepmeat, which the European Commission rejected. The Irish Government may not have been able to convince the Commission, and they were not helped by the fact that the British Government did not support them, but we can produce the evidence that UK consumers are being misled. The latest surveys of public opinion show that. For that and other reasons, we have received legal advice and we are confident that what we propose is permissible. I would be grateful if the Minister explained why the Government believe that it is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90224-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09022469000660">The Irish Government went to the Commission and at least made the case; they stood up for the interests of their consumers and their farming industry, while other countries have succeeded with labelling schemes within the EU rules. The Commission approved the mandatory origin labelling for Spanish asparagus in 2003 on the ground that consumers would otherwise be misled. This is about political will. The job of a Government who care about their farming industry and consumer choice is to do everything possible to put the case and, if necessary, to challenge and change the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90224-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09022469000661">Under this Government, our nation&#146;s reliance on imports has increased by 8 per cent. There have been major declines in the production of cereals and meat. There has been a widening food, drink and feed deficit, which stands at more than &#163;14 billion. The pendulum has been allowed to swing too far away from domestic production. Using imports as a substitute for produce that could perfectly well be grown here is a waste of potential. Increasing self-sufficiency in the food we can produce ourselves should be a strategic priority.</p>

They cannot do that effectively if the rules governing labelling leave them disadvantaged in the marketplace.

The Conservative party passed the key welfare standard change&#151;the abolition of sow stalls. We implemented that change, which means that our pig farmers are right when they say that they are at a disadvantage.

 I am grateful to the Minister. She has cited legal advice which I hope she will publish, but why have the Government not proposed a country of origin labelling scheme to the European Commission? That would enable us to hear the Commission&#146;s view on the merits of such a scheme. Is it not clear that EU legislation enables a country of origin labelling scheme to be adopted domestically when consumers are being misled? Surely the Minister agrees that consumers are being seriously misled, so why is she not trying to put that point to the Commission?</p>

I think it is clear from all the evidence that he has seen, from the evidence that the Jamie Oliver programme uncovered and from the experience of anyone who shops in supermarkets that British retailers know the value of the Union flag as a selling point for food. Precisely because it is of such value to them as retailers, British customers ought to be able to rely completely on the fact that, if it is being used to market in such a way, they understand what they are purchasing and are not being misled.</p>

 Does the Minister accept that a simple way out would be to put to the Commission the point that although it claims that there should not be country of origin labelling unless consumers might be misled, the possibility of consumers being misled would be reduced to zero if all products across the EU were clearly labelled by country of origin? Should that not be a compulsory, EU-led scheme, driven by the British Government?</p>

 I am not sure that that is the case. If we were to have all country of origin information on all products, what would we do with, for example, a pizza that is entirely made in the UK but that might be made with imported wheat or cheese or pepperoni sausage? How much of that would have to go on the label? I do not agree that in all cases all the products need to be  <br>

The Spanish asparagus case was mentioned. I understand that that was tinned Spanish asparagus, and that the European Commission has allowed it as an exception&#151;as a demonstrably very narrowly drawn exception. Therefore, if we are to make progress and persuade the European Commission that there is something that we can do in the UK because of the danger of consumers being misled, we must be much smarter in how we do it and not use the blunderbuss approach suggested from the Conservative Front Bench.</p>

 May I just finish this point? Given the Conservatives&#146; famously robust view of Europe, how do they propose to get their new law through such scrutiny?

On that key policy, they are supported by the Dutch animals party, the French hunting, fishing, nature, tradition party, Sinn Fein and some communists. <i> [Interruption.] </i>On renegotiating the treaty of Amsterdam regarding the social chapter, they have no support from any quarter&#151;<i> [Interruption.]&#151;</i>and they do not like it when they are reminded of it.

 One thing that has not been mentioned is genetically modified food and its labelling.

 My hon. Friend is right to point out that it is possible for consumers unknowingly to buy meat products of animals that have been raised on GM feed.

 Speaking of a debate to which we may return on another occasion and given that this one is about British agricultural production and food labelling, can the Minister say a little about security of supply? As I have said, that is a growing issue, given that climate change is accelerating worldwide and will adversely affect food production both in countries from which we have hitherto received food and in this country.

 My hon. Friend is right to mention security of supply, which covers at least two areas. One is the need to ensure that we farm in a way that is environmentally sustainable in the long term&#151;that is one way of ensuring food security. A second is the need to understand what is happening in some of the sectors to ensure that, as we mentioned when discussing the Competition Commission&#146;s concerns, there is not an undue level of power and that the risk in a food supply chain is not borne disproportionately by one part of it.</p>

The farmers, in particular, tell me that they fear that confidence levels are not as good as they should be. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The representatives of the British pig industry also tell me that it is a very vibrant industry where a lot of good work is going on and that we should be careful not to talk the industry down to the point where new blood is reluctant to come into it because people do not have confidence about security. <i> [Interruption.]</i> All the points being raised from the Conservative Benches are precisely why we need to examine that detail.</p>

 It is important to know the truth about what we buy. The description on the outside can be technically accurate, but a million miles from reality. For instance, in 1997, some people thought that they had elected a Labour Government. If I may pour some opprobrium on myself, I can say that in 1995 I led my then 11-year-old younger brother along the righteous path of supporting Blackburn Rovers on the prospectus that they were premier league champions and therefore the best team in the country&#151;all technically true at the time. It has since led to significant disappointment, albeit character building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90224-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09022470000074">Accurate labelling of British meat produce, however, actually does matter. It matters because consumers have the right to know what it is that they are eating. As things stand, lambs imported from France but slaughtered in the UK can be passed off as British produce. Pig carcases brought in from Ireland and processed into sausages in the UK can be sold as British sausages, and milk from Belgium that has been churned in the UK can be sold as butter from Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90224-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09022470000075">When consumers make their choices, they should do so with the fullest possible range of information. The current situation is not acceptable, because it effectively allows shoppers to be conned into believing that they are buying British when they are not. It is not simply a matter of wanting to buy British for the sake of it. Indeed, many consumers use buying British as a reliable proxy for shopping ethically. That is the case because British standards of animal welfare, and of environmental impact in farming, are among the highest in the world. Of course, buying genuinely British produce means reducing food miles, and significantly cutting the carbon emissions involved in food production.</p>

Of course, investing in the best possible animal welfare standards and in the highest environmental specifications is not cheap, as has already been pointed out. Even with mandatory labelling, we still face the problem of the produce of other countries gaining a competitive advantage from lower standards. Equalisation of standards across the EU to British levels is crucial if we are to tackle climate change, improve animal welfare standards and give our farmers the benefit that they deserve for taking the lead in ethical food production. But the Government are wrong if they think that that is all we need to do. If I were permitted to merge the Conservative motion with the Government amendment&#151;taking out the odd word, of course&#151;we would have a perfectly presentable proposition, but even combined, those solutions would be weak and inadequate.</p>

If we are to empower consumers, we must ensure that they have information on environmental impact, such as the carbon, energy and water use impacts of the produce, as well as country of origin. Given that British produce incurs fewer food miles and has a more benign environmental impact, environmental labelling would also be a boost for British farming. We surely do not want some kind of complicated, expensive and bureaucratic multiple scheme. The answer must be a simple and straightforward labelling system that incorporates all that information.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. We are talking about farm gate prices and the exploitation of the farmers whom the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) claims to represent and to stand up for.

The problem then, and now, is that without a regulator to enforce such a scheme, it would have limited impact. British farmers struggle because of the economic system in which they operate. Clear labelling would give consumers choice and allow British farms to take proper advantage of their high standards, but it would not change the reality, which is that our food market is dysfunctional and hopelessly unfair.</p>

In response to this situation, others have called for a relatively passive market ombudsman, as we have already discussed. The person in that position would oversee the market and investigate complaints. Like the motion, that is okay as far as it goes, but I want to see something far more powerful. In other words, I want to see the introduction of a supermarket and food market regulator that will ensure fair prices and fair practice with regard to all produce&#151;a strong and enforceable code covering the full range of grocery outlets, backed by a robust and proactive enforcement mechanism that would allow a labelling scheme such as the one suggested by the hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) has quite properly raised the subject in every Member&#146;s contribution, so I want to declare that I will address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90224-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09022478000002">It is important to acknowledge that across the world, virtually every political party in every Government has attempted to shelter behind a misleading definition of country of origin. In some respects, the origins of that definition are to be found in the rules of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and the WTO. That definition describes the country of origin as the last place of substantial change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90224-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09022478000003">The public are well aware that if, for instance, someone buys a Vauxhall car that is claimed to have been made in Britain, it should not surprise them if the spark plugs in the car come from somewhere else. That would not mean that the substantial change in the construction of the car did not make it British. However, if a product such as a Cumberland sausage is marketed as a British Cumberland sausage, the substantial change, as far as the public is concerned, is not to be found in the origins of the recipe or the origins of the assembly, but in the origins of the meat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90224-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09022478000004">We have allowed ourselves to be caught in a confusion which is exploited by those parts of the international food processing chain which seek to dominate and exploit food markets, rather than to pursue sustainable food markets. The misleading of the public is incorporated into the global rules that are creating much of the chaos and food insecurity that we urgently need to address. It is wrong to blame a Labour Government for 10 years of inactivity and an absence of progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90224-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09022478000005">The absence of progress goes back at least 42 years.

In 1966&#151;the last time an English football team won the World cup&#151;the Food Standards Committee was asked to examine the abuse of the words &#147;fresh&#148;, &#147;natural&#148; and &#147;pure&#148;. In the discussions and deliberations that followed, from that time until last year, the matter was bounced backwards and forwards in a series of consultations that sought to secure a voluntary agreement on the meaning of the words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90224-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09022478000006">In 1987, a trading standards survey looked at how supermarkets and shops were treating those labels. It found that 79 per cent. of the shops were downright misleading and 11 per cent. were extremely dubious. Only one in 10 of the marketing claims had any truth in them. That illustrates the difficulty with the voluntary path. It has taken a prodigious amount of time to get next to nowhere. We must recognise the urgency of the matter, not only because the public have a right to know, but because outside the House there is a drive and desire on the part of the public to shop ethically and sustainably where they can. In many cases that means a relocalisation of their food agenda. I welcome that, but we should be aware how far we are from such a process.</p>

The newspaper had put a trail on the locally, organically grown carrots from his farm in mid-Wales, which were purchased by Sainsbury&#146;s supermarkets for sale. It found that the carrots had been taken to a super-packer in East Anglia and that by the time they finally reached the shops back in mid-Wales, they had travelled 230 miles&#151;which stretches the notion of &#147;local&#148; beyond credibility. The same applied to carrots bought at Waitrose, which were labelled as having been selectively chosen from &#147;local growers&#148;; those growers happened to be local in Italy. So, too, with bags of parsnips: they were labelled &#147;Organic English&#148;, but sourced in Scotland. Watercress, labelled as having been grown by the sparkling chalk streams of Hampshire, had been imported from Portugal.</p>

Supermarkets compete with each other for volume of sales, and when one starts to cheat, the pressure for others to join them increases. We have to engage with the case for mandatory labelling&#151;not only for UK meat, but for UK food produce in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09022478000016">I want to go on to a second report, about a bigger issue. The Soil Association has just produced &#147;An inconvenient truth about food&#148;, which takes us into the most difficult and challenging food security issues faced in the UK. Historically, UK Government policy, as espoused by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Treasury, has been fundamentally ill conceived on the issue. The problem goes back not 10 years, but to 1817, when David Ricardo wrote &#147;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&#148;. He set out the theory of comparative advantage; the example that he used was the trade between the UK and Portugal. Since then, the UK has hidden behind a presumption that it did not really matter what we produced ourselves, because there would always be plenty of food &#147;out there&#148;&#151;wherever &#147;there&#148; was. Britain was a trading nation, we should make a virtue of that, and if that meant a decline in UK farming and food production, well, &#147;C&#146;est la vie&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09022478000017">We are now faced with a fundamental change in the economics and politics of world food supply. Since 2006, there has been a steady escalation in global food prices. There have been food riots in 14 countries, from the tortilla riots in Mexico to the pasta protests in Italy. We are seeing a fundamental shift in the notion of food security and self-sufficiency. Even UK supermarkets are starting to acknowledge that they can no longer move their purchasing plans around from country to country, hopping between continents, because of countries&#146; increased reluctance to export food when they cannot feed themselves. Since June 2008, the consequence of that in the UK alone has been an increase in staple food prices of 13.7 per cent. That is felt in the wallets and on the kitchen tables of households across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09022478000018">What we are being asked to address as a Parliament, and what the country will have to address, is the word &#147;resilience&#148;. What food resilience is there in the UK? Resilience means the ability of our country to deal with food shocks and long-term changes in food supply. I want to list the weaknesses in our current position that make us non-resilient. We are massively dependent on nitrogen fertilisers. Last year, we imported 1 million tonnes of nitrogen fertilisers, which are 310 times as damaging to the environment as carbon dioxide. We are heavily dependent in that we do not source our own fertilisers but have to import them from abroad. Sixty-nine per cent. of the pesticides used in the UK were imported from outside. Ninety-five per cent. of UK food is oil-dependent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09022478000019">Most worrying of all is the question of UK soil. Twenty years ago, the country was warned that almost half of the soil in the UK was vulnerable to erosion. The Environment Agency estimated that in the years 1995 to 1998 we lost 2.3 million tonnes of agricultural soil to erosion, directly as a consequence of our reliance on intensive farming. We have at various times discussed in this House our dependence on peak oil, but we have had no discussions on peak food or peak phosphate. Phosphate is a finite mineral resource that will be under huge pressure, given the increasing demands from China and from India. In the past few months, phosphates have increased in price by 700 per cent. to over &#163;185 a tonne.</p>

 I can keep some of my remarks brief, on the basis that the case for improved food labelling in this country has been made very cogently by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert). My job is made easier by the fact that the Minister did not even attempt to say why the do nothing policy of the last 10 years was justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09022478000022">Normally, when talking on this subject, I start from the point of view of those whom I represent in Eddisbury&#151;the farmers, producers and those allied to food production in a constituency that is at the heart of the largest and most productive dairy field in Europe. I pay tribute to all those who participate in the farming sector in my constituency, dealing with meat, potatoes and all the other foodstuffs that Cheshire is famous for. I introduced a food labelling Bill very early on as an MP, following my entry after a by-election in 2000, and I did so again in 2002. The matter has since been taken on by others, not least my hon. Friends the Members for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) and for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon). Every time, we have come up against this Government, who have mouthed warm words. They have been determined to see us off, but nothing has happened. We have had 10 years of sclerosis over this law, which is needed as much now as it was then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09022478000023">Instead, I have decided to start with an attempt to interpret the thoughts and motivations of Labour Ministers and the Labour party in government. They came into office very suspicious of farmers&#151;even despising them to some degree. I do not think that was just to do with the fact that farmers were landowners, but because, as they saw it, farmers did not represent consumers, and consumers equalled voters. The Government were obsessed exclusively with voters, rather than taking into account the interests of the whole nation. They got rid of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and got rid of producer representation at the Cabinet table. They introduced the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and then subsumed agriculture and the farming interest into something far more focused on the consumer interest. That was followed by the Food Standards Agency, which began with DEFRA&#151;indeed, it was prayed in aid by the Minister&#151;but as soon as they could, they offloaded it from DEFRA, and gave accountability for it to the Department of Health. It is at arm&#146;s length to such an extent that we have not had a Health Minister talk about that subject for as long as I can remember, and I have been a shadow Health Minister for three years. There is an absence of Government accountability for producers. They have put everything on a consumer basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09022478000024">That helps us to understand why something has gone seriously wrong with food labelling. The Government&#146;s instinct is to recognise that our arguments are sound  <br>

and well based, and much of the Government&#146;s amendment to the motion, and the Minister&#146;s speech, shows that they agree with many of our arguments. But when it comes to the nub of the matter, what has to change to take us from inaction and ineffectiveness? We still have the same problem. There are examples of Union Jacks on Thai imported chicken stuffed with hormones. There are examples even today&#151;there certainly were 10 years ago&#151;of pork pies coming from Brazil. They are not the problem as far as traceability is concerned. The example I gave 10 years ago was of something called the &#147;swine stamp&#148;&#151;people knew exactly which pig was the source of which product because in Brazil they have traceability down to a fine art. The problem was that it was packaged with a Union Jack on the front once it reached these shores to be processed and sold. The same is true of Swedish meat products, where traceability is provided through swedishtasty.com&#151;which is interesting nomenclature.</p>

We have heard the Government using the same words that they use in the motion today, which is distinct from the mandatory introduction that we propose. They are simply calling for better food labelling provisions, and they are calling on the EU to do something. That has not worked, and in the context of the commoditisation of food production of premium products in this country, our farmers have been left in an unfair position. That is why we have to argue strongly for food labelling. This is not just a narrow point, because it brings to a head many of the issues that give us a fair position in the marketplace, give our farmers a fair chance to compete, and above all, allow the consumer to make an informed choice. That informed choice will ensure that consumers can give the support to the British farmers that they often want to give, but it will be a choice.</p>

In last November&#146;s pre-Budget report, they increased them by a further 8 per cent.

That does not sound like an enormous amount of money to lose, but when it is multiplied by the number of piglets produced, it suddenly becomes a six-figure sum. I was shocked to hear my constituent&#146;s comments because he was one of the first farmers I met when I became Member of Parliament for South Norfolk and he has made an enormous contribution to the industry, as recognised by the award that the Minister&#146;s predecessor, Lord Rooker, presented to him only two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09022480000012">That is only one indication of what has happened in the industry in the past 10 years, during which we have not had the protection&#151;perhaps &#147;protection&#148; is the wrong word and I should say that we have not given consumers the information that compulsory country of origin labelling would provide. I believe that such labelling would have resulted in a greater market share for British producers. The Minister said that the use of the Union flag is known to be a successful marketing device.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09022480000013">I was pleased that, at the Oxford farming conference in January, the Secretary of State said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09022480000014">That sounded remarkably familiar. Indeed, it could have been lifted from a speech that my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) made many years ago when he introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the subject. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), I tried to introduce a Bill&#151;most recently, last October and before that, in 2004&#151;along the same lines. I welcome the fact that the Government are now on the same page in recognising that labelling is important and that it contributes to better consumer information. However, I cannot understand their reluctance to take on&#151;or at least argue the case with&#151;the Commission more forcefully than they have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09022480000015">It is important to nail one thing clearly. It is logically impossible to suppose that providing greater transparency to consumers in a given market could, in itself, favour one product over another. It would not do that; what it would do is improve the operation of the market. Personally, I hope that that market improvement would occur through more consumers, knowing the accurate origins of the food, choosing to buy British-produced food. I make no bones about that; indeed, it is one of the reasons why I would like clearer food labelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90224-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09022480000016">However, clearer food labelling might not have that result. There might be people who wish to buy Italian salami or French bread. In the days of apartheid, people avoided, for perhaps good reasons, buying South African apples or oranges, which were clearly labelled. They avoided buying them because they wanted to express a consumer choice, and they were entitled to do that.

I was talking to a DEFRA official recently who seemed to wallow in his powerlessness. He said, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s occupied ground, there&#146;s nothing we can do.&#148; I say to the Minister&#151;she is not in her place now, but I hope that she reads this debate afterwards&#151;that if she cannot get the right advice, she needs to get new advice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury said, it is notoriously true&#151;of both lawyers and economists&#151;that if someone cannot get the advice that they want, they should find a new lawyer. That is what the Government did over the Iraq war, so why can they not do it over food labelling? They should find the right advice, get in the lead and push hard in the European Commission.</p>

Things have moved on, but the Government need to push much harder than they are currently prepared to.</p>

The hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) referred to the bovine TB crisis. Only last night, very late on, I received a message that one of the farmers in my constituency was facing repossession. The blame for the problems that he has experienced, which are also obviously connected with other financial issues, can be laid at the door of the bovine TB crisis and the Government&#146;s inaction. Fortunately, I heard this morning that, following the small contribution that I was able to make and, I am sure, the excellent representation that he received, a deal was struck and that farmer is able to continue on his farm. However, many farmers throughout the country face great difficulties, so I was pleased that the hon. Gentleman raised the issue. I also echo his comments about the Government needing to tackle the problem and act on the recommendations of the report by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, of which I am pleased to be a member.</p>

Indeed, I was grateful when I heard yesterday that labelling would be the topic of debate this evening. Along with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency, the Government need to address issues connected with the nutritional information with which people are provided. I should probably put on record the fact that I chair the all-party group on cheese&#151;indeed, there are other members of the group in the Chamber this evening.</p>

For example, a product such as cheese&#151;a product that has been produced for thousands of years in western Europe; a product that has been not only a core part of our diet through all sorts of experiences, but a part of our culture; a product that is rich in protein and high in calcium, which are vital, particularly to women, who may suffer from osteoporosis later in life&#151;can be ruled out by having red lights all over it, owing to its fat and salt content, yet those red lights are based purely on comparing 100 g of cheese with all sorts of other products.</p>

 Of course, one can actually get the right solution by completely ignoring the stubborn FSA approach&#151;the traffic light wheel&#151;and going for something like McCain oven chips, because that company has demonstrated that by putting GDA amounts on labels with some colour coding, it is possible to get readable and correct information so that, rather than stigmatising suitable foods, people get a good diet.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) has asserted with absolute confidence that the finest beef in the world comes from his constituency. I am pleased to assert with similar confidence that the finest lamb in the world comes from my constituency. Generations of farming families in Clwyd, West have applied their hard work and expertise to creating a unique, high-quality product. It is therefore entirely understandable that those farmers should feel incensed that the laws of this land are so haphazard that they allow meat products from other parts of the world to be described quite legitimately as having been produced in Wales or in the UK when the only acquaintance of such meat with these shores is that the animal has been brought here for slaughter and processed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90224-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09022480000031">That is, in a very real sense, theft. It is the theft of the good will built up by generations of British farmers in producing a high-quality product that people want to buy. They want to buy it because it tastes better, because they know that it has been produced in clean conditions without undue suffering to the animal, and has not been stuffed full of growth hormones and antibiotics. They also know that it has been produced reasonably locally and is not contributing to excessive carbon emissions by being flown half way across the world. Under present arrangements, however, those consumers are being cheated. The label says one thing, but the truth may be entirely different. Under the present arrangements, the consumer does not have a clue about the true origins of the meat being put on his plate. That, on any analysis, is an outrageous state of affairs.</p>

I have no way of telling how true to the Wiltshire curing method that bacon is, but that is irrelevant.

They may not say the same about us, but that is by the by. That charm, however, cannot disguise their ineffectiveness in dealing with some of our crucial issues.

If the Government really want to promote agriculture in this country, they must use other methods, one of which is to make the market work. If we expect farmers to operate in the free market&#151;and I think most Members believe that that is the right way forward&#151;it is incumbent on Government to make the market work effectively, and one of the key factors in that is ensuring that the consumer is properly informed and able to make a free choice.</p>

On the contrary, there is a need for regulation when the market fails, and this is a clear example of the market failing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90224-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09022482000010">That is why we have proposed a Bill to deal with the problem. That is why we support the proposals of the Competition Commission on supermarkets, why we supported the abandoned merger of two milk groups, and why we want all public procurement to specify British standards. We want regulation only where it is necessary, but, as our motion says, in the instance of food labelling the market has failed, and regulation is therefore necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90224-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09022482000011">The Minister referred to her constant meetings. The issue of the Jamie Oliver programme has cropped up several times, and she rightly mentioned our participation in it. The recording took place on 3 November, only a few days after the Minister had taken office. She could therefore be forgiven for not having all the answers that I, and others, wanted at the time. That was over four months ago, however, and we still have no answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90224-0020.htm_para30"><a name="09022482000012">What was disappointing about the Minister&#146;s speech was that, although she was critical of our proposal for a statutory approach, she was not able to identify the right way forward. Four months since that recording, when she was exposed to a deceit which she recognised and called a disgrace, we have seen nothing. If our proposal is too broad, and the Minister would rather limit Government action to pigmeat, that is a start, but let her take the proposal to the Commission. If 10 per cent. is too low a threshold for the proportion of ingredients, let the Government ramp it up to 20 or 30 per cent., but let them take it to the Commission. The point is that they have not done that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90224-0020.htm_para31"><a name="09022482000013">It is more than 10 years since the present Chief Whip, the right hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown), proclaimed, as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that he had secured a voluntary agreement. He then talked out my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien). Although the Minister may have been in office in this Department for only a few months, for most of the past 12 years she has been a member of this Government. She cannot deny the Government&#146;s failure to address the issue for all that time.</p>

Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) made a tremendously thoughtful speech, much of which I agree and sympathise with. I do not go all the way with him, however. He is a strong supporter of the organic movement, and it has a great part to play, but what he did not do&#151;I would welcome a debate on  <br>

this on another occasion&#151;is address the fundamental dilemma that organic production has lower yields than conventional systems. If we are worried about food security and total production, that crucial dilemma must be dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09022482000015">The hon. Gentleman also rightly referred to the abuse of words such as &#147;fresh&#148;, &#147;natural&#148; and &#147;pure&#148;. I am reminded of the recent Cardhu whisky case involving the difference between pure malt and single malt whisky, which eventually had to be resolved by legislation. There is clearly room for a lot more work there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09022482000016">My hon. Friends the Members for Eddisbury and for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), both former promoters of similar legislation, made clear their understandably intense anger that the Government have not taken the matter forward. My hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk referred to the operation of the market and the need for the Government to push much harder in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09022482000017">My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) put forward a number of other issues, including tuberculosis, regulations and the cider tax, all of which need to be addressed. The TB issue was also referred to by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09022482000018">Finally, my hon. Friends the Members for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) and for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) again emphasised the importance of local food and proper labelling, and my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury made a pertinent comment about the export of cruel and lower standards to other countries if we operate ahead of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09022482000019">Much has also been said about food security, and I hope the Minister who responds to the debate will answer some fundamental questions. The Secretary of State has been in post for more than one and a half years, yet all that seems to have changed is the rhetoric. His predecessor, the current Foreign Secretary&#151;presumably until the present Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs gets promoted, as seems to be the fashion in this Government&#151;said in this House that food security was achieved by importing from many different countries. That was met with laughter and astonishment. We have had new rhetoric from the current Secretary of State, at the Oxford farming conference and last week before the National Farmers Union, that he wants to increase domestic production&#151;no ifs, no buts. That is what he said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09022482000020">What are we to make, however, of DEFRA&#146;s website? We find pages dedicated to further reform of the common agricultural policy and to the document published in December 2005, &#147;A Vision for the Common Agricultural Policy&#148;, which was signed off by the then Chancellor, now Prime Minister, and the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, now the Minister for Housing. That document is still published on DEFRA&#146;s website as the Government&#146;s vision for the CAP, and I quote, as I have before in debates in this House, the following statement:</p>
<a name="90224-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="09022482000567"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;domestic production is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for food security.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09022482000021">Nobody pretends it is sufficient, but not necessary? Who do we believe: the Secretary of State with his new rhetoric or the Prime Minister himself?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09022482000022">The Secretary of State&#146;s argument is to increase domestic production, no ifs, no buts, as long as the consumer wants it and it is environmentally sustainable. We support that. Who in their right mind would not support it? However, the Secretary of State left out in his proclamations of the last couple of weeks a number of other ifs and buts: &#147;If you can comply with all the regulatory burden; if you can afford the extra storage to comply within the nitrate vulnerable zone regulations; if you can find time to do any farming after you have filled in all the Government forms.&#148; There are also a few more buts: &#147;But the Government won&#146;t help you to combat TB; but they will charge you for disease control; but you still won&#146;t get your money when other countries do; but we will demand repayment if we overpay you&#151;you&#146;ll pay up at once; but we won&#146;t demand British standards for public-procured food; but you will have to face increased integrated pollution prevention and control or IPPC, you will have to face electronic identification or EID, and you will have to face the availability of pesticides.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09022482000023">There are a lot more buts that the Secretary of State left out, one of which is that we are at the butt end of this Government. They are content to remain in office until the very last moment, but we have learned from this debate that they are prepared to let farmers and consumers suffer while they twiddle their thumbs. The final but is that it is time for the Government to butt out.</p>

 I thank the House for a generally balanced and interesting debate. Once again, I welcome the Opposition spokesmen&#151;with one exception&#151;to their new roles. Comment was made that this Front-Bench team was charming. I was going to begin my remarks by saying that the Opposition Front Benchers were charming and a little disarming, although those last comments were not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09022482000025">The debate has covered an issue that is of concern not only to all involved in the food sector, but to consumers in this country. Rightly, food and how it is produced has never been so high on the public agenda. Why is that? It is because the food market is changing rapidly, and people want and rightly demand healthy, nutritious products produced with a low environmental impact, from sustainable sources and with high standards of animal welfare, clear provenance and environmentally sound distribution. Many of those factors have been raised in this debate. We must also be cognisant of the fact that people also want their food to be convenient and good value. That is a challenge, but for those across the supply chain it is also a unique opportunity. We want to support producers, farmers and everyone in the supply chain to take advantage of this opportunity. That is the only way in which we will build a healthy, thriving agricultural sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09022482000026">Opposition Members provided some interesting examples of where they feel that labelling has gone wrong&#151;indeed, there was almost product placement of Marks and Sparks, Birds Eye, and the Co-op and the farmers market in Arundel, which I know we shall all be visiting&#151;but I think that we all agree on the main principle: that we should do all that we can to help British consumers make an informed choice about what they buy and to buy British and support British farmers by choice.</p>

Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) made a speech that was very thoughtful in places, but he seemed to be urging us to go back to the sixties a bit, with price fixing at farm gates. His contribution was well-meaning and thoughtful, but consumers will take note and will probably panic at the idea of a Lib Dem Minister pricing the pork off the dinner table in times of economic downturn. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), who I believe is in his place, in an intervention urged him to think again, but in another re-run of decades ago suggested that the solution was getting out of Europe. Both approaches&#151;turning our back on Europe or turning our back on the hard-pressed consumer&#151;are a retreat from reality.</p>

That would come as a surprise to the chair of my local farmers union. In 1997&#151;I know that the hon. Gentleman arrived in this place two years later&#151;there were 120 Labour MPs representing rural seats, all advocating hard on behalf of their constituents. He also urged us to show leadership. Is that leadership to get out of Europe or into isolation in Europe? Which would be the better for farmers and which would be the better for consumers?</p>

The hon. Gentleman also spoke up for Hereford beef, which is indeed world class. Together with Welsh Black beef and others, it is recognised for its quality and how it is produced.</p>

He made some thoughtful comments, but in an apparent Freudian slip he said that it has not had the &#147;protection&#148;. He instantly corrected himself, saying that that was not the right word, and he was right. I hope that the House agrees that the last thing that would be in the interests of our farmers, producers, retailers and consumers would be to withdraw into some sort of protectionist mentality. The hon. Gentleman insisted that we will not argue the case with the Commissioner&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We will argue the case with the Commissioner, but let us do so on a case with which we have a scintilla of possibility of success, as opposed to the wording of the Conservative motion.</p>

succeeded in overcoming many obstacles by clearly identifying its origin as a mark of quality and integrity. That is why people search it out. The hon. Gentleman and the hon.

Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), in an intelligent and cogent analysis of the issue from the common-sense perspective of the consumer. His speech was wide ranging: he managed to combine the car industry and the Cumberland sausage&#151;I hesitate to say it, but they are two good examples of British bangers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90224-0021.htm_para19"><a name="09022482000034">My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South argued for a mandatory system to counter the exploitation of labelling and the consumer. There are several ways to do that. We can do it through working with the EU, as we are doing. We can do it by working with producers and the food chain in the UK, as we are doing. We can also explore what else can be done on mandating, but not as in the proposal in the Opposition motion, which would be bound to fail. The question for the Opposition is whether they want us to ignore the ways in which we can make progress now&#151;in Europe and with British retailers and farmers. The problem is that sitting here as legislators, they see legislation and regulation as the only answer. It is the classic issue of a workman who has only a hammer in his toolbox, so everything looks like a nail. We need to use all the tools at our disposal.</p>

 On behalf of the residents on both sides of the River Humber, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing this debate to take place tonight. The Humber bridge tolls affect constituents across the whole of east Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0902254000008">I shall begin by explaining a little of the bridge&#146;s history before I move on to its current financial predicament and the impact on local people. In the short term, the Humber bridge board has proposed an increase in the existing toll&#151;already the most expensive toll in the country&#151;of 20p per crossing. Having discussed that, I shall move on to the growing calls from all areas of the local community and all political parties to scrap the debt currently owed on the bridge; it now stands at a remarkable &#163;334 million or more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0902254000009">Plans for the bridge were originally drawn up in the 1930s, but work on it did not begin until 1972. I am glad to see so many Members from the other side of the bridge in the Chamber tonight. They will remember the infamous Kingston upon Hull, North by-election; it is good to see the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) in her seat today. During that 1966 by-election, in a desperate attempt to save an ailing Labour Government&#151;there may be echoes today&#151;Barbara Castle sanctioned the building of the bridge. At the time, it was estimated that the bridge would cost &#163;28 million to build. However, as a result of Government procurement and mismanagement, for which both sides of the House bear some responsibility, the figure trebled to more than &#163;90 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0902254000010">Over the years, in the hands of Governments of both parties, the debt grew in Government books, and it stood at &#163;334.5 million as of April 2006. By 1992, the debt had grown to a whopping &#163;439 million. It was recognised that the bridge board&#146;s financial situation was unsustainable and that action was needed. Without Government assistance, the debt would have risen to more than &#163;650 million by 1997. As a result, the last Conservative Government passed the Humber Bridge (Debts) Act in February 1996. That allowed the Secretary of State to reorganise the bridge&#146;s finances and write off debts payable to the Government by the bridge board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0902254000011">Consequently, in 1998 a new loan agreement was signed with the Humber bridge board; &#163;64 million of debt was written off and the rest was suspended and rescheduled. The interest owed on the bridge was reduced from about 12 per cent. to 7.75 per cent. with the aim that the debt would be paid off by 2032. Had the 1996 Act not been passed, the total interest charged would have come in at tens of millions of pounds a year, placing an unacceptable burden on local taxpayers. As it was, interest charges were reduced to &#163;10 million, which was paid for from the surplus of income produced by the Humber bridge board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0902254000012">In 2007, the Department for Transport reduced the interest rate to 4.25 per cent. following the Humber bridge board&#146;s advice that it would simply be unable to  <br>

service the debt if it remained at more than 7 per cent. It is my constituents, and those of colleagues on the Labour Benches&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o376"><a name="0902254000013"><a name="90224-0022.htm_spnew2"><a name="0902254000046"><b>Mr. Greg Knight (East Yorkshire) (Con):</b>
 And mine.</p>

<p><a name="st_o377"><a name="0902254000014"><a name="90224-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="0902254000047"><b>Mr. Stuart:</b>
 I also include the constituents of my right hon. Friend, whom I am glad to see behind me. All those constituents are paying for that colossal debt. Since the 2006 toll increase, it has cost &#163;5.40 for a return journey across the bridge&#151;&#163;2.70 per trip&#151;and more than &#163;18 for a single lorry crossing. Last year, however, the Humber bridge board made an application to the Secretary of State for Transport for the toll to be increased by a further 20p to &#163;2.90 for a single car crossing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0902254000015">That decision has caused consternation on both sides of the Humber. The Department for Transport received more than 950 objection letters in just a few months, and the planned increase has been criticised by MPs, councillors, community activists, businesses and community groups. The Hull and Humber chamber of commerce has said:</p>
<a name="90224-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="0902254000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The tolls are a barrier to trade, recruitment and investment. They effectively split the Humber area into two separate markets. Any increase would make things more difficult for businesses and their employees&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0902254000016">The four councils in the area all formally objected to the increase. The strength of public opinion has been such that the Department for Transport has been forced to call a public inquiry into the proposals. I myself have sent an objection by way of a written submission, and will give evidence at the inquiry next Tuesday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0902254000017">The Humber bridge tolls are already the most expensive in the country. For those who travel across the bridge to get to work each day or travel from the south bank to Hull to receive regular treatment at Hull royal infirmary or Castle Hill, where a major and very welcome new cancer hospital is located, &#163;5.40 for a return crossing is a significant financial burden. Increasing the cost of crossing the bridge at a time when unemployment is rising and household budgets are being squeezed would be completely the wrong thing to do and fly in the face of other Government policies that supposedly aim to stimulate the economy. What is the point of making the VAT cut if the Government are going to make the cost of personal travel even more expensive? Many families are struggling to cover the cost of keeping their car on the road and cannot afford such increases at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0902254000018">The main problem is that even if it were decided not to allow the increase in the coming week, there would still be a shortfall in the board&#146;s finances. As it states on its website, as part of the refinancing arrangement agreed with the Government in 1998,</p>
<a name="90224-0022.htm_brev3"><a name="0902254000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Board compiled with the Secretary of State a series of financial projections to show how it would meet debt repayments in the future. In order to meet its obligations in respect of these projections, the Board needs to increase tolls at regular intervals. Current projections necessitate increases every two years.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0902254000019">It is ridiculous to visit this on our constituents at this time. How much will users of the bridge be paying in 10 or 20 years&#146; time under these present arrangements?</p>

 The abolition of the tolls clearly has all-party support. Is it not a fact that if the tolls were removed, the stimulus to development and growth in the area would generate more taxes for the Treasury than it is currently getting through the tolls?</p>

<p><a name="st_o379"><a name="0902254000021"><a name="90224-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="0902254000049"><b>Mr. Stuart:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman, as ever, puts his finger on the nub of the issue. I will come to those points later on, but I welcome his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0902254000022">The only long-term sustainable solution to the problem is the removal or substantial reduction of the tolls. Next week&#146;s inquiry should be a starting point for a much broader inquiry into the whole issue of the bridge debt and the impact that the tolls are having on the local economy. The bridge cost just over &#163;90 million when it was first built, and in the years since more than &#163;300 million has been paid in tolls, yet we are meant to accept that in the Government&#146;s book the board should still owe &#163;330 million. That makes no sense. It is a burden imposed on the local economy, and it makes a mockery of the whole purpose of putting the bridge up in the first place, which was not just to help the predecessor of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North to get elected but to help the economy of the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0902254000023">The Humber bridge board makes two debt repayments to the Exchequer every year. On 31 March 2009, the interest payment alone will be more than &#163;7 million. More than 80 per cent. of the money made from the Humber bridge toll goes towards the interest on the debt. As a result, the total debt outstanding on the bridge has been reduced by just &#163;26 million in the 11 years between 1998 and 2009. This situation cannot continue. The Humber area is the only city region in the country divided by a toll crossing with charges levied at such a rate. The Government have focused on city regions as being the most sensible economic units within which to develop Government policy. To have this bridge dividing our city region rather than bringing it together is madness, as I am sure that the Minister will recognise when he responds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0902254000024">It has to be said that the Humber area suffers from relatively low incomes and high levels of unemployment. To investigate the economic impact of the tolls, the four local authorities in the region&#151;East Riding of Yorkshire, Kingston upon Hull, North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire&#151;commissioned a report into their impact on businesses and jobs. Many people have said to me, &#147;What is going to be different today when MPs from around the area make the case to the Minister?&#148; I think that that report, entitled &#147;Humber Bridge Tolls Impact Assessment&#148;, makes a great deal of difference. It was published late last year by Colin Buchanan Consultancy&#151;the consultants who developed the methodology that was used to look at the economic impact of Crossrail. The methodology that they used in their report has been accepted by the Department for Transport, so it is not to be lightly dismissed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0902254000025">The report concluded that the abolition of, or a marked reduction in, the toll would improve the region&#146;s productivity, lead to greater employment opportunities, facilitate better networking between business, and increase local competition. Moreover, the bridge allows movement of employees, goods, knowledge and information, providing a deeper pool of resources from which the city region can draw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0902254000026">The report showed that with the abolition of the tolls, the total economy would benefit to the tune of &#163;1.1 billion over the next 25 years. Even reducing the toll to &#163;1 would produce a benefit of &#163;580 million over the same period. The study further showed that the benefits of abolishing the tolls would be felt on both sides of the Humber. Hull would see a 3 per cent. increase in retail spend, adding an extra &#163;45 million to the city economy, while the south bank would benefit from an increased labour catchment area making industrial development there much more appealing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0902254000027">At the moment, as the 2001 census showed, those living on the north bank of the Humber are overwhelmingly choosing to work in either Hull, the East Riding or, in many cases, in the city of York. They are not keen on travelling across the bridge twice a day to work in Grimsby or Cleethorpes, which is depriving the south bank of a huge labour resource. Moreover, in the current recession, unemployment is expected to increase markedly. The report makes it clear that for a significant number of unemployed people, the toll payments, rather than the time or distance, involved in commuting across the Humber are a barrier to seeking work across the Humber, and toll reduction could increase their scope for job search and job opportunities. What more could a Minister in this Government, at this time, in this current economic crisis, want to hear than such unequivocal, categorical advice on how to boost the local economy of that area?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0902254000028">The caravan industry&#151;a key local employer&#151;has been badly hit, and thousands of jobs have been lost in East Yorkshire, not to mention North Lincolnshire, in recent months. Restricting the number of jobs that people can apply for, which the bridge toll essentially does, is not the best way to get them back into work. Business opportunities are also severely limited by the tolls. Businesses competing for contacts across the bridge find that they are sometimes unable to compete because of the cost of tolls and the exchange of ideas and networking are also severely limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0902254000029">There is a real desire on both sides of the Humber to take this issue forward. More than 10,000 people recently signed a petition organised by the <i> Hull Daily Mail </i>and <i> Scunthorpe Telegraph </i>calling for the tolls to be axed or reduced to &#163;1 for cars. More than 81,000 people signed a similar petition on the No. 10 website. When tens of thousands of people take the time to use a facility provided through the Prime Minister&#146;s office at No. 10, Ministers need to listen. There is no point in having these channels of communication if the Government are not prepared to listen to the voice of the people concerned.</p>

 My hon. Friend is on to the interesting and important point that Ministers should listen.

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0902254000032">The Humber Action Against Tolls campaign group, led by Jenny Walton, has been a tremendous influence, as have the region&#146;s MPs, together with local parliamentary candidates Andrew Percy in Brigg and Goole and Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes, and local council leaders. Earlier this month, the Humber bridge board acknowledged the strength of local feeling by announcing that it was considering asking the Government whether it could slash the cost of the tolls to &#163;1 for a 12-month trial period. Under the proposal, the board would ask the Government to suspend or cancel interest payments for 12 months. That would allow it to charge just &#163;1 for cars and two-thirds less for other vehicles to cover maintenance costs only. After the proposed trial year, a study of traffic levels would be carried out to discover the impact of reducing the tolls.</p>

<p><a name="st_o382"><a name="0902254000033"><a name="90224-0022.htm_spnew8"><a name="0902254000052"><b>Mr. Ian Cawsey (Brigg and Goole) (Lab):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. Does he agree that the proposal from the bridge board should be taken very seriously? We have had the Buchanan report, which he has referred to, and we have had previous reports that have not always given a consistent picture. Sometimes they are played off against each other. If we had a trial period, there would no longer be any academic argument or any need for consultants&#146; reports. We would be able to see the figures, and I think that the case would become completely indisputable.</p>

<p><a name="st_o383"><a name="0902254000034"><a name="90224-0022.htm_spnew9"><a name="0902254000053"><b>Mr. Stuart:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. He will be aware that in the 1980s, when the bridge board&#146;s staff were involved in industrial action and the toll was suspended, there was a huge increase in the number of people crossing the bridge. I ask the Minister to take that on board. We are confident that a new toll holiday would achieve the same effect. Irrespective of what happens at the public inquiry next week, I urge the Minister to consider that proposal carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0902254000035">The Government cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, they place tremendous emphasis on city regions and their ability to further economic growth, and indeed they have said that they will do &#147;whatever it takes&#148;&#151;I think that that is the right phrase, but the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;to help this country fight the recession. They should not on the other hand continue to restrict economic growth in our city region by continuing to profit from the bridge debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90224-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0902254000036">I call upon the Government to give two commitments. First, I ask them to commit to working with the Humber bridge board to agree a toll holiday on the bridge, reducing the toll to &#163;1 as I have outlined. The debt is fairly notional, but if money has to be found from general funds to allow that, what better money to use than that which has been set aside to help fight the recession to see whether the idea works and put it to the test?</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that research undertaken on the south bank of the river about the possibility of reducing the toll or abolishing it altogether showed that an overwhelming number of people were in favour of paying a token toll, perhaps of &#163;1? That is by far the quickest way to reduce the tolls, instead of going down a lengthy and protracted legislative route.</p>

I am sure that the Minister will want to do so, and I look forward to his response.</p>

 At the outset, I congratulate the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) on securing this debate on an important issue. I ought also to take this opportunity to congratulate Members of all parties on their hard work, including the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) and those who are sitting behind me&#151;my hon. Friends the Members for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) and for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). I congratulate them on the work that they have been doing on this matter, which is dear to their hearts, on behalf of their constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para0"><a name="0902255000002">I shall set out a brief history of the development of the bridge, which is an important link between parts of the city region. Perhaps it can be seen as bringing it together rather than dividing it. The Humber bridge was promoted as a local road by the local authorities of Humberside. Approval for the construction of the suspension bridge was given by the then Transport Minister, Barbara Castle, although it was not until 1973 that work finally began. Right hon. and hon. Members will know that the running of the bridge is undertaken by its board, which is made up of the local authorities that promoted the project&#151;Hull city council, East Riding of Yorkshire council, North Lincolnshire council and Lincolnshire county council. The board is made of up 22 members from those authorities. It financed the construction through loans from the Secretary of State for Transport and the Public Works Loans Board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0902255000003">As the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said, the bridge took longer and cost more to build than was expected. However, the amount of traffic was lower than forecast because the expected population growth on the south side of the Humber never materialised. The original cost was some &#163;28 million, increasing to &#163;98 million throughout the construction period, with price inflation caused especially by the ground conditions that were encountered. The Humber bridge board charges tolls to cover that debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0902255000004">By the time the bridge was open to traffic in 1981, loans were charged at a rate of 11.62 per cent. compared with the Bank of England rate of some 15 per cent.; many of us remember those awful times. Every year since opening, the bridge has made an operating profit. However, initially, that was not sufficient to cover the loan charges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0902255000005">As the hon. Gentleman recognised, the Government have done more to assist with the finances of the Humber bridge. The debt was restructured in 1998, when a reduced interest rate of 7.75 per cent. was set, with interest suspended on part of the total debt. The Humber bridge debt, which then amounted to &#163;421 million&#151;&#163;359 million of which was owed to the Secretary of State, and &#163;62 million to the Public Works Loan Board&#151;was restructured. Indeed, we wrote off the &#163;62 million that was owed to the Public Works Loan Board, and we suspended interest payments on &#163;240 million of the debt that was owed to the Secretary of State. We also reduced the interest rate on the active part of the debt. The suspended debt was added back, beginning in the next financial year, in annual amounts, starting at &#163;11 million and rising by 4 per cent. per annum to reintegrate it all. Those arrangements were set out in the 1998 loan agreement and the Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0902255000006">In 2007, we again revised the interest rate on the debt to reflect more closely the rates that prevailed then, and to allow the Humber bridge board to repay the debt in the agreed loan period&#151;until 2038&#151;without recourse to levying a precept on taxpayers. Such recourse would mean that, ultimately, the taxpayers of Humberside would have to pay the debt, as set out in legislation. The interest rate was reduced to 4.25 per cent. until 2011, when the matter will be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0902255000007">The money saved through lower interest and the repackaging that we introduced in the latest development in 2007 is available to the Humber bridge board to repay capital and establish a maintenance fund. Under the remit of the agreement, the board is expected to manage the financial position until 2011, without recourse to the Department for Transport. That clearly sets out the steps that the Government have taken and the listening that we have done about the issues that must be faced. We have done that in dialogue with the Humber bridge board and through listening to hon. Members who have made representations about the financial position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0902255000008">The Secretary of State&#146;s role in relation to the bridge is restricted to approving or rejecting the proposed revision of tolls by the bridge board. As hon. Members know, there is an ongoing application to revise the tolls. That includes increasing toll charges from &#163;2.70 to &#163;2.90 for cars, from &#163;4.90 to &#163;5.30 for goods vehicles under 7.5 tonnes, and from &#163;10.90 to &#163;11.90 for goods vehicles that exceed 7.5 tonnes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90224-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0902255000009">The application is to be considered at a public inquiry. After listening and taking on board the representations made through several channels, including the No. 10 website, calling on the Government to cancel the Humber bridge debt and reduce the tolls, a public inquiry will begin on 3 March at the Willerby Manor hotel in East Yorkshire. Let me put it on record that the location of the inquiry is a matter for the board, which has made its decision, not the Government. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s website suggests that the Government refused to hold a public inquiry on the south side of the river. He knows that it is not a matter for the Government.</p>

 The Minister might be feeling combative, but let me share with him the fact that at least the Humber bridge board was listening and has agreed to waive the crossing costs of those who come from the south bank. I congratulate the board on listening to our campaign to make that happen.</p>
