 As I am sure my hon. Friend would agree, the best route out of poverty remains the prospect of work, which is why we have been so determined over the past year to take combined action on monetary policy and fiscal policy, which together are now supporting about 500,000 jobs. However, in addition, we realise that some communities need targeted help, which is why the future jobs fund will seek to create more than 6,000 jobs in his region. On top of that, of course, is the important role of tax credits, which are now supporting 20 million people and helping the poorest families in this country to the tune of more than £4,500 a year.</p>

 The truth is that the recession is hitting different countries differently. If we look at the United States, the unemployment rate is 10 per cent; if we look at France, the unemployment rate is 10 per cent; and if we look at Germany and Japan, the fall in their respective gross domestic product is greater than ours. The fact that we have been able to put in place a fiscal stimulus worth 4 per cent. of GDP, as well as keeping interest rates low-together supporting up to 500,000 jobs-is in part because we went into this recession with the second lowest debt in the G7.</p>

 My hon. Friend has put his finger on precisely the point. Over the course of this year, the Opposition have said consistently that we cannot afford a fiscal stimulus. That was repeated month on month, until the shadow Chancellor's recent speech, when he began to nuance their position. The truth is that without the support that we have put in place over the past year, the jobs that we are now supporting, such as the 150,000 jobs supported by the future jobs fund, would be in jeopardy.</p>

 Again, it might be helpful if I make the point that the mortgages that will be held by the Northern Rock mortgage asset company are not all what we might characterise as bad assets. There will be some-there is no doubt about that, given what happened at Northern Rock, especially towards the end-from which the company will not get its money back. However, the majority of the assets in that company are performing-that is, the people who have them are meeting their loans. In other words, they are perfectly good loans. The reason that we have divided Northern Rock up is that, otherwise, we would have had to put even more capital into it. What I am proposing means that we can sell off the Northern Rock bank-in the not-too-distant future, I hope, when it is right to do so-and get it back into the private sector. The other assets will need to be managed over a longer period of time. As conditions improve, however, I hope that many of those loans will come good again and we will be able to get our money back.</p>

 But what is the hurry? As I understand it, the European Commission has set no timeline for this process-unlike with the Royal Bank of Scotland. Our experience of other countries, such as Sweden, is that this problem could take 10 years to sort out, so why are the Government putting forward this proposal now? They run the risk of getting very bad value for money for the taxpayer in a premature sale.</p>

 I have said on many occasions in this Chamber and elsewhere that we are in no hurry to sell at all. Indeed, we will not sell these assets in relation to Northern Rock until the price that is offered is right and we can get our money back. It is also worth bearing in mind that, of the original £29 billion that was lent to Northern Rock, the amount outstanding is now £14 billion, so we are on the right track. We are in no hurry to sell at all. I recall having said that to the hon. Gentleman on at least two occasions at previous Question Times, and it is not entirely clear why he seems so reluctant to accept that assurance.</p>

 Is it not the case that about 90 per cent. of the mortgages held by the Northern Rock management asset company, while having risky characteristics, could come good in the long term? That being the case, will the Chancellor take on board the issue of competition? We know that the British banking system suffers from too little competition. In the process of disposing of Northern Rock-at the Government's leisure-will he not rule out the possibility of the mutualisation of the company?</p>

 My right hon. Friend is right about the first point: payments are being met on the majority of these loans, and there is every reason to suppose that they will be redeemed, so they will not be a loss to the company. Inevitably, as I said to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), there will be some cases where, because of what Northern Rock was up to towards the end when it was getting into difficulties, there may be continuing difficulties, but perhaps they can be managed out in time.</p>

Friend's second point about competition when I shortly make my statement on banking reform. I want to see more competition on the high street for mortgages and for loans to small and medium-sized businesses, and I believe that Northern Rock will form an important part of that policy. We are not in an immediate hurry to sell, as I said, but I hope that the proposed split will take place sooner than would otherwise be the case-it might be several years.</p>

I have always wanted to support the building society sector. I would just say in relation to Northern Rock that we cannot put any more public money into it. It is just not possible-state aid rules would preclude it-to do so. Of course, anyone seeking to take over Northern Rock would need to have regard to the fact that it is necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is repaid. I have no difficulty with the concept of a mutual, certainly in principle, provided that funds for that came from outside Government sources.</p>

 The liabilities in respect of both Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley have been taken on by the taxpayer because the elected British Government formed the view that this was the best course of action. The Chancellor has previously taken a robust line on the issue of fiscal sovereignty, insisting that decisions on bank bail-outs that impose a burden on the British taxpayer can be made only by the British Government. Unfortunately, the draft proposals under consideration in the European Council do not reflect that view, so will the Chancellor take the opportunity today to reiterate that red line and to confirm that under no circumstances will the Government agree to a structure that could allow an unelected European regulatory body to order a British taxpayer-funded bail-out of a bank?</p>

 That is a bit rich on the day when the Conservative party is throwing in the towel on its key promise on Europe, but there we are.

Indeed, most informed commentators take the view that what we have done is right. It is a view that is accepted by the OECD, the International Monetary Fund, the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses. The Conservatives alone took the view that they would do absolutely nothing, and I believe that they did so on the entirely cynical calculation that if what we did did not work, they would say they were right, and if it did work, they would say the recovery would have happened anyway.

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right, in the sense that one of the key things that many of the poorest countries in the world face today is not just the challenge of getting out of poverty, but having to adapt to climate change, which will hit some of them the hardest. That is why it is vital that we do agree on climate change financing in the run-up to Copenhagen. This will be discussed by G20 Finance Ministers at the weekend; however, it is important that it be seen as separate from the funding that will be provided to help some of the poorest countries out of poverty.</p>

We have said that we will meet our interim target of 0.56 per cent. by 2010. We are on track to do that, and we will also, as my right hon.

We expect people in public services, particularly those who work at senior levels, to show a degree of leadership. That is why the evidence that we have submitted to pay review bodies calls for a 0 per cent. increase for senior groups and for increases of between 0 and 1 per cent. in 2010-11 for other public sector work forces who are not covered by three-year deals.

 With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the banks in which the Government have shareholdings. This morning the Treasury, Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland issued market notices in the usual way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para0"><a name="091103125000199">In October last year, I set out a range of measures designed to prevent the collapse of the banking sector. Those measures are working, and countries across the world took very similar steps over the following weeks. But the uncertainty in global financial markets had a very serious impact on confidence, resulting in a world recession. That in turn worsened the outlook for our economy, leading to higher losses for UK banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para1"><a name="091103125000200">It was clear that further action was needed to strengthen the banks, and in January we announced an asset protection scheme to prevent a further shock to confidence, and to ensure that lending could continue. We continued to support the economy through fiscal and monetary policy, and we co-ordinated a global policy response at the G20 London summit in April. Those measures are working, too: fears of a global depression have receded and market confidence has started to return. As a result, we are now able to achieve our objectives on financial stability and banking reform at a lower overall cost to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para2"><a name="091103125000201">The asset protection scheme that I announced in January has played a vital role in supporting confidence in financial markets. Let me remind the House of the key features that I set out back then. The scheme provided insurance against losses arising on a pool of bank assets, and in return the banks paid a fee in the form of shares. The effect of the scheme is to strengthen the capital position of any bank taking part in it, but that of course carries a risk of exposure for the taxpayer. The scheme was open to all major UK banks, but in the event, improved market conditions meant that only two banks decided to participate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para3"><a name="091103125000202">Since then, further improvement in market conditions means that Lloyds has been able to develop a better plan. It now does not need to participate in the scheme, which will significantly reduce the cost and exposure for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para4"><a name="091103125000203">I will now explain in detail our proposals to restructure the banks better and also to make them stronger. Turning first to Lloyds, following the recapitalisation last October, the Government owned 43 per cent. of the bank. In March we reached an agreement in principle with Lloyds on its participation in the asset protection scheme. This would, through the fee, have increased its capital by over £15 billion, increasing the cost to Government, with our stake in Lloyds rising to 62 per cent. We agreed then in principle to insure £260 billion of assets, giving us a very large contingent liability. But now that market conditions have improved, we have agreed a better proposal for Lloyds, to bring in substantial private capital and reduce taxpayer exposure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para5"><a name="091103125000204">So Lloyds has announced today that it will raise £21 billion in the open market. This capital raising is fully underwritten by commercial banks. As a shareholder, the Government have the option to take up part of the newly issued equity. If we did not do so, the value of the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 Nov 2009">

<notus-date day="3" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>3 Nov 2009 : Column 718</b><br>
existing taxpayer shareholding would be diminished. To protect the value of our shares, we have therefore decided to take up our share of this new capital, investing £5.7 billion net of an underwriting fee. By raising capital in the markets, Lloyds will begin its transition from state support to private finance, and no longer need the insurance of the asset protection scheme. Because Lloyds has benefited from the existence of that scheme since March, it has agreed to pay the Treasury a fee of £2.5 billion and to reimburse our costs. Today's decisions make Lloyds a stronger bank and provide better value for the taxpayer, ending the exposure of the taxpayer through the insurance scheme, with a substantial fee in return for the insurance provided to date, and a substantial capital contribution from the private sector, while maintaining our shareholding at 43 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para6"><a name="091103125000205">I now turn to the Royal Bank of Scotland. It is a bigger bank than Lloyds, with a more complex balance sheet and a greater exposure to losses, mainly due to its purchase of the Dutch investment bank ABN Amro. Under February's agreement in principle, the Government said that they would insure £325 billion of assets through the asset protection scheme, as well as providing an additional capital injection of £13 billion, a second tranche of capital amounting to £6 billion, and a further £6.5 billion-worth of capital support through additional shares issued to pay the fee. Together, this would have increased RBS's capital by £25.5 billion, taking the Government stake to 84 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para7"><a name="091103125000206">Before we could reach a binding agreement, we needed to carry out due diligence on the assets and to ensure that the final terms were consistent with the then emerging European Commission guidelines. The restructuring guidelines were published in July, following extensive work with the UK and other countries. We have also now completed, with the Financial Services Authority, due diligence work on the RBS balance sheet. As a result, we are making a number of changes to the terms of the scheme, which will improve incentives and share risks better with the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para8"><a name="091103125000207">Although market conditions have improved, RBS still needs to do more to be able to stand on its own feet. So we will continue with our plan to invest £25.5 billion of capital in RBS-but there are three key changes. First, there will be a £43 billion reduction in the pool of assets covered by the insurance scheme, which reduces the Government's contingent liability. Secondly, the first loss on these assets-payable by RBS-will be increased from £42 billion to £60 billion, which further protects the taxpayer. Thirdly, in return, RBS will pay an annual fee of £700 million for each of the next three years, and £500 million per year thereafter, which gives it an incentive to leave the scheme as conditions improve. When it does leave the asset protection scheme, it must have paid a minimum fee of £2.5 billion, or 10 per cent. of the actual capital relief received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para9"><a name="091103125000208">To reflect the increase in the first loss, amounting to £18 billion more payable by RBS, we will no longer require RBS to give up its tax losses, which it estimates at between £9 billion and £11 billion. In the unlikely event of a severe downturn, it may be necessary to provide up to £8 billion contingent capital, but this will be triggered only if there is severe stress, taking its core capital ratio down to 5 per cent. Again, in return for that, RBS will pay an annual fee of £320 million for as long as the contingent capital is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para10"><a name="091103125000209">In the case of RBS, the overall level of Government support will remain broadly the same as I announced in February, but this revised deal is better structured, with better risk sharing and greater incentives to exit. There is a higher first loss payable by RBS-£60 billion, up from £42 billion. There are better incentives, with a fee of £700 million for three years and £500 million thereafter, and fewer assets to be insured-£282 billion instead of £325 billion. I will provide the House with full details of the operation of the scheme when the final agreement is signed and approved by the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para11"><a name="091103125000210">As part of these restructured deals, we are also pushing forward reform at the banks, with improved lending and remuneration policies. Both Lloyds and RBS will be in a stronger position to continue lending. Lloyds will increase lending capacity this year and next, with an additional £11 billion for businesses and £3 billion for home buyers in each year. RBS will continue to meet its lending commitments of £25 billion this year and next, as I indicated earlier this year. Both will publish customer charters on good practice, particularly on small and medium-sized enterprise lending, increasing transparency and improving loan conditions for business customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para12"><a name="091103125000211">On pay, all major retail and investment banks in the UK need to meet the G20 principles and Financial Services Authority rules, so that bonuses are transparent, variable and with no multi-year guarantees. Between 40 and 60 per cent. must be deferred over a number of years, not paid out immediately, and they must be subject to clawback to ensure that pay is aligned with long-term performance. However, we have agreed with RBS and Lloyds that they will go further than that. For this year, there will be no discretionary cash bonuses, except for staff earning less than £39,000 a year. The executive boards of both banks will have their bonuses deferred in full until 2012. That goes much further than the G20 agreement, and further than any other banks in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para13"><a name="091103125000212">I will continue to strengthen the supervisory regime, building on the proposals that I set out in July, by adopting the recommendations of the Walker review on corporate governance for banks, reforming the mortgage markets and legislating to make banks put in place "living wills", as well as providing enhanced powers and objectives for the FSA, to strengthen regulation further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para14"><a name="091103125000213">I believe that those steps are better for the taxpayer, better for the banks and better for the economy. As a result, the likely cost to the taxpayer and the risks faced by the public finances have reduced markedly. The total assets protected have been reduced by more than £300 billion, there is more private sector investment and the fees received are better structured. I expect, subject to wider factors, to revise downwards the provision for financial sector interventions in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="91103-0004.htm_para15"><a name="091103125000214">As I said in my statement in July, our second objective is to encourage greater banking competition in the high street and for small and medium-sized businesses. Since the financial turmoil started in 2007, the banking industry has become more concentrated in most advanced economies. Over the course of this year, we have been working with the Commission to agree on how to restructure the banks while meeting state aid rules.</p>

Northern Rock lending, and when the time is right it will facilitate a return to the private sector. Lloyds will sell Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the Intelligent Finance internet bank, the TSB brand, Lloyds TSB Scotland and some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales-altogether, more than 600 branches by 2013. RBS plans to sell its insurance businesses, including Direct Line and Churchill, as well as its commodity trading arm and its card payment processing operation. It will also divest itself of more than 300 branches across the UK, again by 2013. Together, those businesses could amount to about 10 per cent. of the retail banking market in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para1"><a name="091103125000216">In each and every case, we will insist that those institutions should not be sold to any of the existing big players in the UK banking industry. Lloyds and RBS will each be required to sell their retail and SME businesses as a single viable package to a smaller competitor or new entrant to the market. That, together with Northern Rock, will potentially create three new banks on our high street in the space of five years, which will increase diversity and competition in the banking sector, giving customers more choice and a better service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para2"><a name="091103125000217">The financial services sector will remain an important part of our economy. Yesterday's job losses announced by RBS and today's job losses announced by HSBC are a reminder that for many employees, these are difficult times. We will do everything we can to work with the banks to help them find new jobs for those affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para3"><a name="091103125000218">My proposals today will ensure that we have a strong and vibrant financial services sector in the future. They will mean strong and safer banks that are better able to support the recovery, and more competition and choice for people who use them. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 Once again, Mr. Speaker, the Chancellor tells the House of Commons what he already has spun to every national newspaper-last night, long before any market notices were put out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para4"><a name="091103125000220">Let us separate fact from Government fiction. First, we welcome the modest break-up of some of those large banking conglomerates-a break-up that the Chancellor wholly opposed when the Conservatives proposed it six months ago, and which everyone knows was wholly imposed upon him by Commissioner Neelie Kroes. We also welcome the ban this year on all significant cash bonuses in these major retail banks-not least because we proposed that a week ago. Again, the Treasury and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury wholly opposed us. Yet again, the Conservatives are setting the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para5"><a name="091103125000221">However, is not the real story the sheer size of this bail-out? The Chancellor could not bring himself to give us the actual figure in the House of Commons-£39.2 billion, equivalent to £2,000 per family. It is bigger even than the bail-out last autumn, and with the Royal Bank of Scotland, it now breaks a new world record as the single biggest bail-out of any single bank anywhere in the globe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para6"><a name="091103125000222">Of course, the Chancellor presents this as positive Government action, but he had little choice, because the alternative was seeing RBS unable to fulfil the basic requirements of a solvent bank. However, it results in a bail-out bigger than that of Citigroup and that of Bank of America. Indeed, all of that is going into a bank the former chief executive of which, we must remember, was knighted for banking services by the Prime Minister.</p>

The Chancellor wants us to believe that this is a new era for British banking, when in truth the British people are being presented with yet another enormous bill to try to clear up the mess from the old era of irresponsible banking supervision over which this Labour Government presided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para8"><a name="091103125000224">Let me press the Chancellor on the details-first on the enforced sale of branches and bank businesses. Why did he oppose that when we first suggested it six months ago? He dismissed it out of hand. Is that because-perhaps he could confirm publicly what everyone is saying privately-although he did not want to do it, it was imposed on him by the actions of the European Commission, right up until the weekend? Indeed, during their time in office, this Government have never made any secret of the fact that they have actively promoted the policy of creating a small number of large banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para11"><a name="091103125000229">Secondly, let me ask him about the details of this £39 billion bail-out. He said that it was broadly the same as the deal that he put before the House of Commons in February, and presented the various numbers involved in that deal. Of course, what he was actually doing was comparing apples with pears. In February he told us that RBS would get a £13 billion capital injection and a £6 billion contingency reserve-he just added to the total today-and today he says that it is going to get £25.5 billion capital injection and an extra £8 billion in reserve. Will he confirm that this is not the same as the deal he announced in February?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para12"><a name="091103125000230">The Chancellor talks about the asset protection scheme. Again, will he confirm in public what everyone involved in these negotiations is saying in private-that the asset protection scheme he announced in January proved to be unworkable, impossible to negotiate and incompatible with European state aid rules, which is why he has had to go back to the drawing board? When did he realise that the asset protection scheme would not work? Why does he think that the United States has been more successful with its public stress tests in leveraging private capital into its banking system so that, unlike Britain, it is not turning to the taxpayer for further large-scale capital injections?</p>

Meanwhile, credit and confidence remain in desperately short supply, and still the Chancellor and Prime Minister have no plans to provide either. Indeed, as Treasury questions have just demonstrated, they do not have the simple answer to the simple question of why Britain is still in recession while the rest of the world is in recovery.</p>

that one of the things that we had to do as we stabilised the banking system was to get more competition in the system. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned what I said last year about Lloyds-HBOS. Yes, we did support that merger, because at that stage financial stability was important. I remind him that he agreed with that as well, and he went out of his way to say that he had spoken to the people involved on both sides and assured them of the Conservative party's support. There is not too much between us on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para23"><a name="091103125000242">As for the point about bonuses, it is not true to say that our position is the same as his. I remind him that on Sunday night, when he put out his press release in anticipation of the statement on bonuses, he said that it would apply to British retail banks. By Monday, when the wind started to blow the other way, there was a subtle change and the investment banks were included. It was still only British banks though, while our measures affect all major banks based here. With RBS and Lloyds, we have gone further than any other country in restricting the amount of bonuses that executives can receive, and that goes far further than he or anyone else has suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para24"><a name="091103125000243">The hon. Gentleman asked some specific questions about RBS. Yes, it is a large sum of money-there is no doubt about that-but RBS was one of the largest banks in the world. Indeed, by some measures it was the largest in the world. Unfortunately, however, it got itself into huge difficulties-partly, as I said, because of the acquisition of ABN Amro, and partly because, frankly, parts of its operations had taken on risks that it could not manage, and it did not have enough capital. As he correctly recognised, our choice is whether to support it. If we did not, however, not only would RBS fail, but the knock-on effect would be catastrophic. I appreciate the point about these being large sums of money, but they are unavoidable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para25"><a name="091103125000244">As for the £25 billion, I went out of my way in my statement to break down how the figures are calculated, so that the House could see what the position is. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the £8 billion contingent capital is new-that will only happen if the core tier 1 ratio falls below 5 per cent., or there is a severe downturn-but stress tests have been carried out, and the FSA believes that the £25 billion that we have put forward today is sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para26"><a name="091103125000245">The hon. Gentleman asked about the asset protection scheme rules. He is right to one extent: they were not consistent in January with Commission rules-but that is because there were no rules from the Commission in January, because this is all new territory. The Commission has had to work up rules during the course of this year. While those were being worked up, obviously we found out more about the assets, and the Commission found out more about what is going on in other banks in other parts of Europe-and yes, that has developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para27"><a name="091103125000246">The hon. Gentleman asserted that in America there is no public money. Tell that to the US Congress! The then American Administration had no end of difficulty in getting the legislation through, because it involved public money. It is simply not true, therefore, that America is managing to do this without involving the public. That simply is not right at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para28"><a name="091103125000247">The hon. Gentleman also asked about lending. It is important to consider closely what is happening in the economy. In September the stock of gross lending to businesses was £492 billion, which compares with a  <br>

gross stock flow of £478 billion in September two years ago-just before the crisis. So money is being lent. At the same time, however-this is the point that Lord Myners made in the interview on "The World at One"-undoubtedly one thing that happens during recessions is that businesses repay their money as well. At the same time as more lending, therefore, money is also being repaid. That said, everybody agrees that there are still problems with lending and cases of businesses not getting money when they probably should get it, and that there are still problems with pricing. The difference between the Government and the Conservative party is that we propose to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para29"><a name="091103125000248">In conclusion, I very much welcome the support of the hon.

 I thank the Chancellor for giving us good notice of this statement, but may I check the numbers involved? We have the £25.5 billion for RBS, the £3.3 billion after the fee for Lloyds, the £8 billion contingent capital commitment and the £282 billion insurance for the RBS toxic assets. Why did he not also mention that-as I understand to be the case-RBS has been given an additional £10 billion in tax write-offs, which were not previously accounted? Can he explain that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para30"><a name="091103125000250">On remuneration and bonuses, will the Chancellor explain in simple terms why state-or state-supported-banks are still paying bonuses at all? A bonus is surely a bonus, whether it is paid now or in three years' time. Why do he and the Conservatives think that it is a great discipline and hardship for the bankers to be asked to wait three years for their Ferraris? The Walker report on remuneration says that banks should declare their remuneration packages. Given that the Government have adopted that proposal, will the Chancellor be clear about whether that will be compulsory or voluntary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para31"><a name="091103125000251">On lending, is it not true to say that if we take into account net lending, which the Chancellor has just mentioned in relation to repayments, the banks are falling well short of their obligations to lend to solvent British companies? Is it not also true that Lloyds has been trying to wriggle out of its lending obligations by opting out of the asset protection scheme? Can the Chancellor therefore clearly explain the nature of the banks' lending obligations? Are they binding and what sanctions are applied if the banks fail to meet them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para32"><a name="091103125000253">Finally, I want to raise the issue of the breaking up of the banks through the sale required by the European Commission, which I welcome, in order to stop the process by which banks have long been ripping off their customers. Is it not true that the break-up relates purely to 10 per cent. of the banks' assets?

from those guarantees should compensate the taxpayer for the considerable benefit that they thereby derive? We should not today simply be discussing transferring public money from one pocket to another, but discussing how the remaining private sector in the banking system continues to benefit enormously from the guarantees that the Government continue to give it, in the event that it should fail.</p>

Gentleman, in that I do not think that they are wrong in themselves. There is everything to be said for rewarding good behaviour or ensuring that the interests of the executives are the same as the public interest, which is what we are trying to do by ensuring that they cannot get bonuses for three years. Also, there is a distinction to be made between, on the one hand, somebody who is paid large sums of money and, on the other, the many bank employees who work in branches or back offices who are not on large salaries, and who in some cases are paid pretty modest incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="91103-0005.htm_para35"><a name="091103125000257">That is why we said that people earning less than £39,000 could get bonuses, but individually we are talking about several hundred pounds, or perhaps up to £2,000, which is nothing like the large figures that are commonly thought of as bank bonuses. That is especially important at a time when, as I said in my statement, there are many bank employees who are understandably worried about what is happening, but who never got the great bonuses. I am thinking of the many constituents of mine who were employed by RBS and, in particular, HBOS who were paid in shares that are now worth an awful lot less. We must ensure that we treat people on lower, modest incomes properly.</p>

He has said again today-and on the "Today" programme at 10 to 9 this morning-that Lloyds has got out of its lending conditions. No, it has not: as I said in my statement, both Lloyds and RBS have to stick with the lending agreements that they have already reached. I do not want to labour the point that I made about lending, because I accept that there are still problems, but it is important to look not just at the net position, but at what is happening in lending and accept that during a recession it is understandable that businesses with big exposure to the banks might want to reduce that.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is right. It is important that new entrants to the market lend not just to the mortgage market but to the SME sector.

 What it shows is that, given the nature of RBS and the fact that it may need more capital, we and the FSA believe that the £25.5 billion-worth of capital that we are putting in is the right thing to do. On the more general point, we are trying to get a safer, more stable banking system, because that is the only way in the long run to get back to a situation in which people realise that there is inevitably a degree of hazard in the industry.

 I think that we need to develop this further. In my statement, I said that the lending commitments will continue. Net lending is a measure of how much additional lending is going on, but it does not give us the whole picture, particularly during a recession when firms that can afford to do so are inevitably paying down their money. The key point will be when the economy begins to recover. When firms start to grow, and to go to the banks for money, we must ensure that there is credit for creditworthy customers.</p>

The difficulty we have is that, as I said, RBS is one of the largest banks in the world and a lot of what it did was overseas.

 The Chancellor has made it plain in respect of the restructuring of Lloyds and RBS that bids will be confined to the smaller competitor or new entrants to the market.

 As I have said before, it is important that we get money back for the taxpayers. However, if all the parts of the banks that were divested by RBS and Lloyds were swallowed up by Barclays or Santander or HSBC, we should end up with only half a dozen people in the business of lending. That is not enough. We already have too few loan providers in this country. Of course, potentially, we have the building societies and some of the smaller banks, but at present, for obvious reasons, they are fairly quiet on the lending front.</p>

Will he ensure that if institutions such as Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and, perhaps, TSB in Scotland are sold to other lenders, their standard variable rates will not increase, given that there is every prospect of their being bought by an institution with a higher SVR?</p>

 It is important that when the disposals take place and new companies come in, there is as much communication as possible with people who have mortgages, so that they can see what the position is and what choices are available to them. For example, I know that Northern Rock is about to write to all its savers and mortgage holders explaining what is happening and people's options. To some extent it is inevitable in any competitive market that different providers offer different rates. As we go through this process, people need to be told that they have a choice. Equally, if somebody does not want to go to a new bank, they always have the option of staying with the bank they came from. As much as is possible, people must be able to make those choices.</p>

 The country will be grateful that we have a Chancellor who puts the national interest ahead of tomorrow's press release. Companies involved in high science and high technology are finding it difficult to obtain money from the current banking system.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right about a lot of high-tech investment and the need to encourage it. That is one of the reasons why I announced measures in the Budget and the Prime Minister has announced measures through the innovation investment fund to try to help to fill the gap where the commercial banks are not operating. It is very important that we support that. Regardless of whether it is done through the commercial banks or through Government help, I want to keep the issue at the forefront of what we are doing because our future depends on it.</p>

 The Chancellor did not mention Bradford &amp; Bingley, which might indicate his lack of interest in it, but he did mention Northern Rock and measures to keep it lending and to facilitate its return to the private sector. Will he explain the following to people in my part of the world? Whereas Northern Rock was a basket-case organisation that had been taking emergency funding for months and months and is still a going concern, Bradford &amp; Bingley, which he must admit was not in any way in as bad a shape as Northern Rock at the time, was dismantled and is being wound down.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is not quite right about that. If Bradford &amp; Bingley had been doing all right, it would not have reached the situation where its directors believed that it was no longer a going concern. The Financial Services Authority had to step in because Bradford &amp; Bingley got into difficulties; I am afraid that that fact is incontrovertible. We took prompt action to ensure that the part of the bank that was viable-the front end of it-was transferred to Santander. The rest of it and the management of the mortgages is something that we will have to handle in the longer term. How the hon. Gentleman can claim that there was no need for the bank to have any assistance whatever is very difficult to fathom.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to repeat a statement made by my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills about "Higher Ambitions: the future of universities in a knowledge economy", which we are publishing today and placing in the House Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para0"><a name="091103125000314">The last 10 years have been a decade of outstanding achievement for higher education in this country. Talented people and enterprising institutions, backed by public investment and reform, have delivered the twin objectives of widening access and creating excellence. When the Government reformed the universities' fees, we were told that students, especially poorer students, would be put off applying. The exact opposite has occurred. A record number of students now attend university, and the gap between socio-economic groups has narrowed, not widened. For the first time, 1 million students will start their studies this year, and the quality of student academic achievement is high. Drop-out rates have fallen by a fifth, and the number of firsts has doubled. This demonstrates that wider opportunity is not the enemy of excellence, as opponents of change have alleged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para1"><a name="091103125000315">We have a disproportionate share of the world's leading research universities. With just 1 per cent. of the world's population, we achieved 12 per cent. of the world's scientific citations. Institutions across the sector have contributed to this success-the newer universities, alongside the older ones. Public funding for both research and teaching has increased by more than 50 per cent. in real terms since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para2"><a name="091103125000316">Universities have also developed new sources of income, and tuition fees are bringing £1.3 billion a year to boost the quality of a student's education. We should thank universities and their teaching staff, administrators and students for their outstanding record of achievement over this last period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para3"><a name="091103125000317">The strategy we are publishing today aims to set a course for an equally successful decade ahead, but new times and new conditions require some fresh policy choices and judgments. The coming decade will see public expenditure inevitably more constrained. Attracting the best students and researchers will become more competitive. Above all, it will be a decade when our top priority is to restore economic growth, and our universities need to make an even stronger contribution to this goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para4"><a name="091103125000318">Able people and bright ideas are the foundation stones of a thriving knowledge economy. Producing both is what universities are all about, so in the next 10 years we will want more, not fewer, people in higher education, and more, not less, quality research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para5"><a name="091103125000319">Our first objective, therefore, is to ensure that all who have the ability to benefit can access higher education; there should be no artificial caps on talent. Our goal remains for at least 50 per cent. of 18 to 30-year-olds to enter university. We have made great progress in the number of people beginning a three-year degree at 18 or 19, but the challenge for the next decade is to offer a wider range of study opportunities-part-time study, work-based study, foundation degrees and study while at home-to a greater range of people. So we will  <br>

encourage the expansion of routes from apprenticeships and vocational qualifications to higher education, and offer more higher education in further education colleges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para6"><a name="091103125000320">Inadequate information, advice and guidance at school still bars too many young people from fulfilling their potential. We will work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families to rectify that. To meet the social mobility goals in Alan Milburn's report, all young people must be encouraged to strive for challenging goals by teachers with ambitious expectations for them. Universities should also do more to reach out to young people with high potential. I want to make it clear that this Government will not dictate universities' admissions procedures, nor undermine excellence. All students must continue to enter higher education on merit, but I believe that merit means taking account of academic attainment, aptitude and potential. Many universities are already developing their use of contextual data, and we hope that all universities will consider incorporating contextual data into their admissions processes to assess better the aptitude and potential of those from less-privileged backgrounds. We are also asking Sir Martin Harris, who heads the Office for Fair Access, to consult vice-chancellors on improving access to the most selective universities, and he will report back in the spring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para7"><a name="091103125000321">The Government's second objective is for universities to make a bigger contribution to economic recovery and future growth. Knowledge-generation and stewardship in all subjects has public value and is important in its own right. It is vital, in particular, to creating wealth, through the commercial application of knowledge and preparing our people for employment. We have, therefore, decided to give greater priority than now to programmes that meet the need for high-level skills, especially in the key areas of science, technology, engineering and maths. New contestable funding will provide universities with the incentive to fulfil that priority. Areas where the supply of graduates is not meeting demand for key skills will be identified, and we will seek to rebalance this by asking the Higher Education Funding Council to prioritise courses that match the skills needs. We will look to business to be more active partners with our universities. Employers should fully engage in the funding and design of university programmes, in the sponsoring of students and in offering work placements. We believe that that is possible without compromising the universities' autonomy and educational mission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para8"><a name="091103125000322">Our third objective is to strengthen the research capacity of our universities and its commercialisation. The investment of the past decade has greatly strengthened the public science base, and we will continue to protect its excellence. That will require a greater concentration of world-class research, especially in the high-cost scientific disciplines. Research excellence is, of course, spread across a wide number of institutions and subjects. The challenge now is to develop new models of collaboration between universities and research institutions, so that the best researchers, wherever they are located, co-operate, rather than compete for available funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para9"><a name="091103125000323">The Government's fourth objective is to promote quality teaching. The quality of education provided by our universities is generally good, but it needs to be higher. I welcome the action that universities are taking to raise standards in teaching and to strengthen the external examiner system. Students deserve nothing less. They will rightly expect to be better informed   <br>

about how they will be taught and about their career prospects. We want the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education to provide more and clearer information to students about standards in our universities. Students' expectations and actual experience should be central to the quality assurance process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para10"><a name="091103125000324">Our fifth objective is to strengthen the role of universities in their communities and regions as well as in the wider world. Universities provide employment, enhance cultural life and offer many amenities to their surrounding communities. They shape and communicate our shared values, including tolerance, freedom of expression and civic engagement. We will support universities in safeguarding these values.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para11"><a name="091103125000325">We will ask universities to continue to develop their role in local economic development with the regional development agencies and with business. The Government will also do more to champion the international standing of our universities as world leaders in the growing market for higher education across borders and continents, including by e-learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para12"><a name="091103125000326">In the decade ahead, we will expect more from our universities than ever before. They will need to use their resources more effectively, reach out to a wider range of potential students and devise new income sources while maintaining excellence. As we look to our universities to do more, we will also need to look afresh at securing the funding that excellence requires and at how all who benefit from higher education-taxpayers, students and the private sector-should contribute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para13"><a name="091103125000327">It was agreed in 2004 that the new fees structure in England should be reviewed at this stage, and the Government will make an announcement about that shortly, but I should stress that we will seek a properly and fairly balanced approach without placing an unreasonable or counter-productive burden on any single source of funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para14"><a name="091103125000328">At the heart of the framework published today is a strong and creative vision of higher education, with strong, autonomous institutions with diverse missions and a common commitment to excellence, a shared framework for extending opportunity to all who can benefit, and our universities as a cornerstone of our country's cultural and social vitality and a centre of our future economic prosperity. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o175"><a name="091103125000329"><a name="91103-0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="091103125000653"><b>Mr. David Willetts (Havant) (Con):</b>
 We welcome the publication of the document and I am grateful to the Minister for giving me advance sight of it. It has, of course, been a long time coming. The whole exercise began in February 2008, so its gestation period matches that of a slightly premature elephant, I gather. Meanwhile, not only has the Secretary of State who launched the exercise moved on but the whole Department from which it was supposed to originate has been abolished. We are rather relieved to see the document at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para15"><a name="091103125000330">We should thank the experts from the world of higher education who have contributed their reports to this exercise. I very much agree with what the Minister said about the strength of our universities, in which we can all take great pride. The next step, of course, is the funding review. Will the Minister confirm that all parts of the higher education sector, including students, will have an opportunity for their voices to be heard in that  <br>

exercise? Will he confirm that the funding review need not be limited to the framework set out in the document published today?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para16"><a name="091103125000331">The Conservatives particularly welcome what the framework document says about the importance of teaching and of information for students and prospective students. Students are not just consumers, but when they are paying so much for their university education, we can well understand that they become consumerist and want information about what they will get in return for the fees that they pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para17"><a name="091103125000332">We, of course, have been working with Microsoft on a pro bono basis to ensure that such information is easily accessible for prospective students. Indeed, I called for it to be available almost two years ago now. We are relieved that Ministers in the Department have caught up with this agenda, which is extremely important. But why is the QAA to be put in charge of releasing the information? Students' demand for more information may not be best met by that quango. Surely we need to use far more imaginative ways to make the information available to students and prospective students-such as via websites and social networking sites, or third sector and other organisations. I very much hope that the information will be available in a wide and accessible way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para18"><a name="091103125000333">There also need to be strong incentives for good teaching, to match those that already exist for research. I want to ask the Minister about research and the STEM subjects. Of course, STEM subjects make a very important contribution to the growth of our economy, but it was disappointing that, in the context of research, the Minister referred in his statement to those subjects only. Is he not aware of the dynamism of our creative industries, and of the crucial role also played by the arts and humanities? Does he recognise that a dynamic and well-balanced economy needs to draw on the dynamism and research capacity of university departments in the arts and humanities as well as those in STEM subjects?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para19"><a name="091103125000334">A key theme in the statement was broadening access to university. We recognise the importance of that agenda, to which the Minister said reference was made in the excellent report from Alan Milburn, whom we think of as the right hon. Member for Darlington. However, I think that the Minister has ignored some of the very sensible ideas in that excellent report, and embraced some rather risky ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para20"><a name="091103125000335">The report calls for a proper independent careers service to take the place of Connexions. The Conservatives strongly support that proposal, which we have advocated as well. The Minister came to the House to talk about open access to university and social mobility, so it is a great disappointment to find that his Department and the DCSF have failed to embrace the proposal for an independent careers service. Many people believe that it would improve access to information, and hence access to university, for people from a wider range of backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para21"><a name="091103125000336">Meanwhile, the Minister flirts with contextual data for university admissions. I warn him to be very careful in this territory. There are, of course, excellent initiatives, such as the one that links King's college London with Guy's and St. Thomas's hospitals. It takes students from poorer backgrounds who have less good A-level results and gives them a high-quality medical education. Does the Minister agree that that excellent initiative should be repeated?</p>

We need to hear from the Minister how he believes that this contextual information will be used. Today, it is students from households on modest incomes who are suffering the most from problems such as those afflicting the Student Loans Company. The Minister tells the House about broadening access to university, but does he not recognise that it is students from the poorest backgrounds who are most desperate when they cannot get their maintenance grant or loan? Disabled students are having particular difficulty accessing their grants at the moment. Will the Minister take this opportunity to give us an update on that situation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="91103-0007.htm_para23"><a name="091103125000338">The Minister talks about progression from FE to HE, which is also very important for broadening access.

Government will only fuel suspicion that the two parties are set to raise fees, doing nothing for widening participation and driving up social mobility in this country. The Minister talked about widening participation and universities being engines of social mobility, which is welcome. However, it should be remembered that his Government's record on widening participation is woeful, with only a third of first-time entrants to higher education coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The use of contextual data in the selection process will be a step in the right direction, but any plans to raise fees will have a huge impact on whether many young people even consider applying to university in the first place.</p>

 The QAA has sought to underpin one of the key values of higher education, not only in this country but in the world, and that is the principle of independent learning. A sixth former is different from an undergraduate student in the sense that the latter's learning is, yes, about teaching, but it is also about what they engage in independently as they make their path towards research. Across higher education, different mission groups and institutions place different emphasis on that, and I think especially of those institutions that bring the best out of students who might not have recognised that higher education was for them. The journey is about independent learning, and I disagree with the caricature that gives the impression that higher education is the same as school. That is why we reject a national curriculum and the idea that it is about contact with lecturers and academics: it is not.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As you know, we have a very busy afternoon. We have just had two statements. In the first, the exchanges between the Front Benchers took more than half an hour. That is perhaps excusable and understandable on a complex area of policy. In the second statement, the exchanges between the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman and the Minister alone took 27 minutes, and I have to say that it was mostly the Minister to whom we were listening, until you helpfully intervened. Is there any way of reminding Ministers that a leisurely approach is not always appreciated when a statement is being made to the House?</p>

 Some spokesmen from the Front Benches have a learned approach to matters, which may take a little longer. The Chair is conscious of time, and Mr. Speaker has underlined to Ministers on numerous occasions that there is an informal tariff-it applies equally to Opposition Front Bench spokesmen. Today, one in three managed to conform. It is important that we ensure the maximum time for Back Benchers, especially on a crowded day like this. I will not take up any more time, therefore, in repeating the obvious.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="91103-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="091103125000444"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to specify the minimum distances permissible between onshore wind turbines of certain dimensions and the nearest habitation; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para1"><a name="091103125000390">When Oscar Wilde wrote that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para2"><a name="091103125000391">he obviously had not anticipated the controversy that onshore wind farms would generate. Bearing that in mind, I hope that any hon. Member planning to oppose this Bill will listen carefully to what I am about to say, and not base any remarks that they may have planned on false assumptions. In that spirit, at the outset I must make it clear that this is a bipartisan proposal: the sponsors of this Bill therefore reflect the political balance of the House, with more Government than official Opposition supporters. However, it does not, as far as I am aware, represent the official position of any major party-but obviously I hope that that may change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para3"><a name="091103125000392">Secondly, at this late stage in the Session the Bill has no chance of becoming law. I introduce it simply to stimulate an important debate. Thirdly, the Bill is deliberately modest in scope, and deals simply with the minimum distances that wind turbines should be away from houses. It has a simple purpose. Settling the issue would help local communities, planning authorities and, paradoxically, the wind energy industry itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para4"><a name="091103125000393">At the heart of our politics we should place the ethic of reciprocity-the idea that everyone has a right to just treatment, and a responsibility to ensure justice for others. Put more simply, that means "Do as you would be done by". Sometimes, of course, we have to balance the different rights of competing groups. For example, a new high-speed rail line will be fought by communities close to its route, whatever the wider benefits that it brings. It is then that politicians have to choose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para5"><a name="091103125000394">A visit to the home of two of my constituents in the small settlement of Sheriffs Lench in the vale of Evesham started the process that led me to this Bill. When I saw just how close to their home ScottishPower Renewables plans to put a 125-metre wind turbine, as part of a larger wind farm plan for the area, I realised that I would not like that done to me. The turbines proposed are among the largest ever constructed in England. They will be half as high again as Big Ben and only a little lower than the London Eye-and in the open countryside that is huge. It is roughly equivalent to a 40-storey building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para6"><a name="091103125000395">In the case of this wind farm, the closest of those massive structures would be only 508 metres from the nearest home, with many more homes about 600 metres from a turbine. That is too close. I ask myself whether the wider social good is served by building such enormous renewable energy sources so close to the homes of hundreds of my constituents, or whether the sacrifice being asked of them, and the damage to be done to a beautiful part of the vale of Evesham, is too great.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para7"><a name="091103125000396">I also noted that the turbines in Worcestershire would not be allowed in a similar location in Germany, or in large areas of Spain and Italy. Denmark is one of the most successful countries in the development of onshore wind power-and I understand that if Danish rules applied, the turbines in my constituency could be built, but many householders would become liable for compensation for loss of property value. England and Wales stand apart from the developing pattern of regulation of onshore wind on mainland Europe. Indeed, in Scotland, too, guidelines specifying what is acceptable are already in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para8"><a name="091103125000397">I concluded that the disadvantages of the wind farm proposed for my constituency outweigh the likely benefits. If I felt that way, I had to do something, and the Bill that I am asking leave to present today is that something. My Bill has extraordinary levels of support around the country. Communities from the west country to Cumbria, from Gloucestershire to Derbyshire, from County Durham to East Anglia, and of course from Worcestershire, have bombarded me, and their own MPs, with e-mails.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para9"><a name="091103125000398">I emphasise that the Bill is not a covert attack on any renewable energy technology, nor does it have its roots in any doubts about the causes and consequences of global warming. I am convinced by the consensus that human activity has at least added significantly to the scale of climate change, and has been the major driver of it. In any event, even the most sceptical critic of the climate change consensus would have to admit that the world's fossil fuels are running out, and that they are coming from increasingly unstable areas of the globe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para10"><a name="091103125000399">In the short run, there is probably enough reliable gas to see us through, if we build enough gas storage in the UK. Investment in new nuclear power can also make a big contribution to keeping the lights on over the slightly longer term. However, diversity is the key to our energy security, and that diverse generating portfolio must include a significant proportion of renewable sources. The UK is extraordinarily well placed to exploit other renewable technologies, as well as wind, such as the power of the oceans-tidal, wave and tidal flow, for example. In my view, we have foolishly underestimated the role that solar-thermal technology can play in providing hot water in homes, and we are late in introducing smart meters to reduce demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para11"><a name="091103125000400">We must now invest in every available renewable technology and see which will work best for us in the future. That includes onshore wind turbines, but only in the right places. If other technologies can help us to meet our challenging renewable energy targets, and if wind power itself is still the subject of innovation-with smaller, more powerful, less visually intrusive turbines in development-it is right that we take, in the short term at least, a precautionary approach to the siting of onshore wind turbines very close to homes in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para12"><a name="091103125000401">There are different concerns about wind farms. Noise, especially low-frequency noise, the flicker effect and the resulting health implications are just some of those concerns. I have been impressed by the personal accounts of such concerns in many of the hundreds of e-mails that I have received. However, although the science may not yet be settled on those matters, the visual intrusion of wind turbines is a matter of objective fact. It is that visual intrusion that my deliberately narrow Bill seeks primarily to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para13"><a name="091103125000402">My Bill would specify minimum distances between turbines of certain dimensions and the nearest house. I propose that there should be no specific restriction on turbines below 25 metres in height, while wind turbines up to 50 metres high should not be located closer than half a mile to a home. Larger wind turbines up to 100 metres high should be at least a mile away, and the largest-those above 100 metres-should be at least one and a half miles from any home. There would be an important exception where the residents of homes within the buffer zone agreed to the construction of the turbines. They might do so because they stood to gain financially from the construction-something that the industry should look at more carefully-because they had received compensation for loss of amenity or the reduced value of their homes, or simply because they supported the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para14"><a name="091103125000403">I agree that the figures that I have proposed are arbitrary, but all rules are to some extent arbitrary. Why not have a speed limit of 75 mph on motorways? Why have different ages for the legal purchase of different products or for beginning certain activities as young people grow up? We have to draw the line somewhere, and the limits that I have set out are where I propose the line should be drawn for wind turbines. I am a traditionalist, hence the use of miles. However, I would happily accept an amendment to make the distances 1 km, 1.5 km and 2 km respectively, if that is the price of making progress. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I apologise to my right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para15"><a name="091103125000404">However, my Bill would also make possible a different approach, which is used in some European countries and which some hon. Members might prefer. That would mean specifying set-back distances from turbines in proportion to their total height. In other words, the distance from the base of the turbine to the nearest home should be at least a fixed multiple of the height of the turbine to the tip of the blades. The distance would then depend on the multiple. The 125-metre turbines proposed for my constituency would have to be set back 16 times their height to achieve a separation of 2 km, while a smaller 100-metre turbine, using the same multiple, would be set back 1.6 km. A smaller multiple would produce smaller distances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para16"><a name="091103125000405">I am clear that there must be a reasonable space between such giants and local communities. That is the simple and, I hope, uncontroversial, purpose behind my Bill. It would add to planning law, not detract from it, and all the other tests and protections, whether they relate to noise, environmental impact or sites of special scientific interest and so on, would remain in place, so we would not see a wind farm on top of the Malverns, or Bredon hill in Worcestershire, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para17"><a name="091103125000406">I have heard the simplistic objection that my Bill is intended to kill onshore wind development in England. That argument is an Aunt Sally, and is simply untrue. Indeed, by being much clearer about an important aspect of planning requirements, my Bill would enable developers to bring forward proposals for more appropriate locations with much greater confidence. My Bill would mean that arguments about distance and local acceptability could be dealt with more objectively and speedily by local planning authorities. Currently, only around a quarter of all onshore wind farm applications succeed. That proportion could increase significantly if there were clear guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para18"><a name="091103125000407">My Bill is designed to help communities that feel threatened and powerless in the face of intrusive planning applications, but it would also speed up the planning process for well-sited wind farms. The Bill should help householders and communities, local authorities-which currently lack adequate guidance on wind turbine locations-and the wind farm industry to pursue the right sites. My Bill represents an opportunity to stimulate, and more importantly to resolve, an important debate. I commend it to the House.</p>

 I oppose the Bill, although I should make it clear that I do so in a personal capacity as an environmentalist, not as a spokesman for my party-<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> ]</i>-as is the requirement with ten-minute Bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para19"><a name="091103125000409">Although it looks at first sight like traditional Conservative opposition to wind power, the Bill that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) proposes would in fact achieve the perverse result of increasing the pressure on rural areas, including areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks, to accept wind turbines that local people oppose. It is a Bill that would harm the prospects for wind energy in many places where it is supported by local people, and it would deepen the undermining of democratic local planning procedures. In the end, local people should decide. We in this place should not commit our usual error of creating inflexible and-in the hon. Gentleman's own words-arbitrary rules that will do more harm than good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para20"><a name="091103125000410">Let me illustrate the problem with an example that is literally close to home. Cheltenham's first wind turbine is likely to be placed in Springfield park, in the Springbank area of my constituency. Planning permission is being applied for. It will not be big-a bit less than 18 metres tall, to the tip of the highest blade. It will generate 9,500 kWh of electricity a year, and save more than 4 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year. Perhaps more importantly, it will follow the good example of Danish wind energy by being owned by a community organisation, the Hesters Way Neighbourhood Project. The project was set up to support regeneration in one of the least well-off parts of Cheltenham, and the wind turbine will shave the best part of £1,000 a year off its electricity bill, allowing it to spend more money on its other work in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para21"><a name="091103125000411">The turbine will be safe and virtually silent, with no noisy gearbox. It also has a rather striking design. I concede that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but in general, I think that most wind turbines are rather graceful, and easily more attractive than the average pylon. The Springbank wind turbine has so far encountered very little opposition, but whether it receives community support should surely be a matter for the people of Springbank and their elected representatives. We should not contemplate a Bill that would rule out the project at a stroke-</p>

 It would, because it would impose on planning law-not on planning guidance, local area partnerships or local area policy-a rule that that turbine should not be allowed, because it is about 60 metres from the nearest dwelling. That is well inside the hon.  <br>

Gentleman's proposed limit for a small turbine of 800 metres-I have translated that-away from any dwelling. So the Bill would kill that project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para22"><a name="091103125000414">Our local and national carbon emissions reduction goals would remain intact, however. Our carbon budgets, newly agreed in the Climate Change Act 2008, which was supported by those on the Conservative Front Bench, would still be there. If the Bill were to cut off wind turbine projects such as the one for Springfield park, and doubtless many others all over the country that were anywhere near people's houses, that would increase the pressure on rural areas. Where would we put the displaced wind power if we wanted to maintain the contribution of wind power to achieving our renewables targets?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para23"><a name="091103125000415">No part of Springfield park is less than 800 metres from a dwelling; in fact, I think that we would be pushed to find any part of my constituency that is. The only part that might achieve that condition would be in the Cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty, where even I would hesitate to support a wind turbine. But those are exactly the kinds of areas that would qualify for approval if the Bill were ever to see the light of day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para24"><a name="091103125000416">I can cite many examples of local Liberal Democrats supporting wind power, from Leeds to Lewes, from Cornwall to the Orkneys, and from Cheltenham to Islington, but I would never lecture local Liberal Democrats, who know their area best, on whether they should support every proposed wind turbine everywhere. I am sure that many hon. Members could cite examples of insensitive energy companies trying to push through wind turbines in inappropriate locations. However, I can see the supporters of such companies rubbing their hands with glee if the Bill became law. "Surely local campaigners shouldn't be allowed to get away with opposition to this wind farm," they would argue. "After all, it complies with the Onshore Wind Turbines (Proximity of Habitation) Act 2010, which was promoted by the Member for Mid-Worcestershire in his attempt to, as he put it, settle the matter." Ironically, the hon. Gentleman's name could end up being used in planning inquiries more in support of insensitive wind power applications than against them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="91103-0009.htm_para25"><a name="091103125000417">Why does the hon. Gentleman think that these inflexible distance limits are required? In his speech, he was rather vague. He spoke again and again about visual intrusion. Unlike him, however, I do not think that that is an objective fact; it is subjective and it ought to be up for discussion by local people. He also mentioned flicker, but that is a very short-range phenomenon. It is not even an issue in Springfield park, where the turbine will be only 60 metres from people's houses.</p>

This programme motion provides more detail, hopefully for the convenience of the House. It proposes that part 1 be debated today.

A draft Bill was then published, which went before the Joint Committee on the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, as well as before the Public Administration Select Committee. The Government have taken both those Committee reports very seriously, and their comments are reflected in the drafting of the Bill. The same applies to the other parts of the Bill. The issue of Somerville arises from concern expressed-not least by the Scottish Executive-about the anomaly that had been created.

constitutional debate concerning Wales and, indeed, Northern Ireland, I have observed that sometimes it is only when legislation has been implemented that we perceive deficiencies, weaknesses and aspects that we might wish to improve. Has the Lord Chancellor considered allowing further debates once the Bill has been implemented-should it become an Act-to ensure that any unforeseen or unintended consequences are rectified in the future? I think that that is very important when it comes to constitutional changes.</p>

 I entirely accept the Secretary of State's comment that the House did not divide on the programme motion at the end of Second Reading, but he can see for himself what has already been tabled for consideration over the next two days, and it clearly shows that there will be insufficient time for full consideration. Moreover, this is a constitutional Bill, and not such a long time before the Labour Government were elected in 1997 not only would such a Bill have been considered on the Floor of the House, but that would have been without any guillotine or any end date for its coming out of Committee, and therefore all Members would have had the opportunity to participate and say what they wished about what is, even in its curtailed form, a very important piece of legislation.</p>

 Is not one way of dealing with this the commencement of proper discussions between the Government and the Opposition?

One way of avoiding lengthy debates on the Floor of the House about programme motions is to have proper constructive discussions between-<i> [Interruption.] </i>I agree that such debates are important, but on measures of this kind, where the political parties are prepared to have a discussion, surely such formal discussions should not take place on the Floor of the House and thereby curtail the debate that is necessary on the Floor of the House.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I, for one, am always happy to have informal discussions with the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State on these matters-and I enjoy them-but it is important that we do not circumvent this House. The reason for holding these debates on the Floor of the House is precisely so that we do not have a Committee upstairs which can be packed with the nominees of the Government-and, for that matter, of the Opposition-and so that every Member of this House can participate in debate on this constitutional measure, including those who may disagree fundamentally with any proposal, even one brought forward jointly by the Secretary of State and myself.</p>

our opportunity-and, if I may say so, the Secretary of State's opportunity. He has had the chance to see the sort of amendments that have been tabled, and it is pretty clear that a debate is developing over a wide range of issues. None of the amendments appear to be spoiling ones that do not merit consideration, and it is becoming plain that there is insufficient time for consideration. Even today's business will end, I fear, with large chunks having not been properly considered.</p>

Secondly, the way the knives have been placed guarantees that when we finally get to day four and probably have to consider the Bill's most important clauses, it will be even more apparent than it is today that we do not have the time to do so, especially when the business has not been protected, as it has not this afternoon.

It does-in its limited remit, which is far more limited than the Government originally envisaged. For those reasons, I hope that, by listening to this afternoon's debate, the Secretary of State will have an opportunity to reconsider his position.

It certainly does not go nearly far enough in many directions for my liking; nevertheless, it does contain matters that we ought, quite properly, to debate in this House.

Perversely, what we have before us today is a programme motion that puts us in a worse position than if we had been in Committee upstairs. It is normal practice not to have knives until such time as it is clear that progress will not be made without them. I have served on countless Committees dealing with Bills of a constitutional or criminal justice nature over the years. Normally, we have managed to discuss, between ourselves, appropriate ways of progressing business to avoid knives, wherever possible, and ensure that every single clause is given proper weight and proper consideration. That will not happen on this occasion, despite the fact that many more Members may wish to be involved. This might be a modest Bill in what it sets out to achieve, but it is hardly that modest in its physical size-it contains 56 clauses and nine schedules-so it is reasonable that we take a little time in considering it.</p>

 That is precisely the point, and I am glad that the right hon. and learned Gentleman makes it. He describes the substance of many of the amendments and new clauses that have been tabled and that are on the amendment paper. The Government, with their majority, blithely pass though this House proposals for carry-over because they do not think that they can get things through in this Session, but they will not allow carry-over in debate-even carry-over until tomorrow of matters that we will not reach in debate this evening. When we reach the knife tonight, any matters that we have not debated will simply disappear-they will not be debated by this House-and that is not a satisfactory position.</p>

Even if it were the same Bill, what difference would that make? Today, we are making law-we have the duty to consider the Bill line by line-so it does not matter what discussion has gone on before. It may be helpful to our discussions in this Chamber, but it does not replace them.

The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) has tabled some excellent new clauses for discussion, but of course we do not reach new clauses until the very latter parts of our consideration in Committee, so it is almost certain that we will not be able to discuss the matters of huge constitutional importance that he has raised.</p>

 Although the hon.

 I should make the position clear. I believe I said that the mountain moved and brought forth the mouse, and that is very much how I view this Bill. However, I also made it clear that elements of it, including the extremely important civil service reform and the proposals on the House of Lords, which are also extremely important and are a departure from the Government's previously stated position as to how they intend to carry out the reform of the other place, will require detailed scrutiny and, I suspect, are likely to excite a lot of participation. The question then becomes: how long should this Bill have for consideration? If the time were open-ended, the Bill would resolve itself-heaven knows we have not got much business in this place at the moment. For those reasons, the Government have got off on the wrong foot. Here is an opportunity to correct their position.</p>

We need to find a consensus on House of Lords reform. I, for one, do not believe that we have to wait for the next election and for the next manifesto to be written in order to make another commitment about such reform, because we have done that for the past three terms. I hope that that discussion will take place. If he gives me that undertaking, that will satisfy me that there is no need for additional time to be given to discuss this Bill.</p>

new clauses and, as the House will know, the new clauses are for the most part grouped right at the end of day four, and therefore in all probability will not be reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para6"><a name="091103145000019">It is perhaps quite useful to remind oneself of the nature of some of those new clauses, which seem to me to be of fundamental importance and well worthy of discussion in this place. Those to which I will refer are all tabled in my name-I hope that I will be forgiven for that. The first would allow Ministers who are not Members of this House to appear in the House and to answer questions and participate, though not vote. That would have the advantage, would it not, of the right hon. and noble Lord Mandelson's being able to come to this House? I would welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para7"><a name="091103145000020">There is a second proposal, also tabled in my name, that we should have fixed-term Parliaments. I know that that is a matter of considerable interest to a lot of right hon. and hon. Members. On the point made by the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) about life peers' being appointed for fixed terms, I could see considerable advantages if peers were to be created for a period less than life-for five or 10 years, or whatever. Whatever the merits of that proposal, it is surely sufficiently important to attract a debate in this place. Although we might not be able to agree that proposition in the next four days or whenever, that this House should have the ability to ventilate and express that view seems quite plain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para8"><a name="091103145000021">There is another proposal that I venture to make. War-making powers should be entrusted to this House and should not be part of the royal prerogative. Again, that seems to me to be a matter that is very much in the interests of the House. I have tabled a new clause that has the effect of making the selection of the Prime Minister dependent on an address moved by this House to Her Majesty. That again seems to be an issue that is well worth considering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para9"><a name="091103145000022">There is the further question of Mr. Speaker's having the right to recall Parliament in exceptional circumstances rather than leaving it to the Government of the day. That again seems to me to be a matter of considerable importance. The business committee, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, should be set up by the Standing Orders of this House so that we, and not the Government, determine, for example, the business surrounding a constitutional Bill such as that which we are now debating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para10"><a name="091103145000023">There is also the question of referendums. I tabled an amendment to the effect that when there is a treaty between the European Union and the United Kingdom that abrogates the sovereignty of the United Kingdom or in any way significantly curtails the relationships in an adverse way, it should be subject to a referendum. The House might not agree with that, but that it should be the subject of debate seems to me to be quite plain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para11"><a name="091103145000024">The truth is that all these proposals, some of which have been on the Order Paper in the names of other right hon. and hon. Members for some time, are all matters of substantial constitutional importance. If we were not to have this timetable motion-or, alternatively, if we had more time-the House would have the opportunity to debate them. I venture to say that no right hon. or hon. Member would say that those new clauses were unworthy of debate, but the Secretary of State's timetable motion will deprive the House of such an opportunity.</p>

 Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman explain something to me? I understand his argument about the knives, but a large part of everybody's argument tonight has been over the fact that four days have been allocated.

 The Secretary of State is being less attentive than he normally is. The truth is that one has to determine a timetable motion in the context of the amendments and new clauses that were on the amendment paper when the timetable motion came to be considered. No doubt when this motion was first debated, the House had not determined the exact character of the new clauses and amendments. Now we have; we can see the amendment paper, and it will expand. Nobody, not even the Secretary of State, has argued that the points that I have just made are unworthy of debate. The House should therefore extend the time available for debate.</p>

 Does my right hon. and learned Friend also agree that the merit of not having knives is that, as the days progress, it might become apparent that there is insufficient time to consider the business within the Government's timetable? We could therefore make powerful representations that we needed extra days if necessary. The mischief of the knives is that we lose chunks of business at the end of each day and we are never able to recover it.</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend is quite right. The knives are even more mischievous when we have two important statements taking up part of the time for debate. Moreover, the principle of the knives is incompatible with carry-over motions. As the hon.

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman will also be aware that there is a very high expectation of a statement tomorrow-the second day in Committee-so we will lose yet more time. That is again something that could not have been factored in when the programme motion was first considered.</p>

 Indeed. I have no doubt that when we come to the third and fourth days, whenever they might be, we will find that yet more important business has been shuffled into the programme. The truth is that this House is being denied an opportunity to make very important changes to the constitution, or, if it is not ready to make them, at least to debate them. I am afraid that this Government like to shut out debate and I regard that as quite lamentable.</p>

(Mr. Hogg). As the years have gone by, I have wondered more and more what the real duties of a Member of Parliament are. Today, they seem to be to attend to e-mails every five seconds and to respond on diverse subjects to constituents on matters about which I know very little. Our real duty, which is to scrutinise legislation-to look at it line by line-seems no longer to be important or the part of our lives that it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para12"><a name="091103145000032">I remember, in the days when I was in Committees upstairs, time after time the habit crept in of putting in the knives and the guillotine motions, which meant that whole chunks of Bills that I was taking through Standing Committees were never debated, neither in Committee nor in this House. That is a tragedy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="91103-0011.htm_para13"><a name="091103145000033">We all need to ask ourselves what is the role of a Member of Parliament now and what it will be over the next 10 years. Will it simply be instantly to react to a news story or can we please get back to the days when we examined legislation line by line and made our own arguments and amendments? The truth of the matter is that if I have an amendment or argument, I want to make it and I want the views of all hon. Members to be heard. If I lose the argument by a vote or because I have made it badly, that is that, but at least I have made it. Day after day, the trend continues that the opportunities for Members of this House properly to do the job for which they were elected, in my judgment, are gradually disappearing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="091103145000048"><a name="91103-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="091103145000622"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 I see that there is approbation for that. A knife is proposed to fall today after debate on the proposals in respect of the civil service, and another on the second day-tomorrow-after debate on a number of important issues. Once we get to the third day, no knife will fall for two days. So the quicker that we can deal with the proposals on treaties and protests, the sooner we can get on to those on the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para1"><a name="091103145000049">My judgment is that the proposals on treaties and protests need not take a huge amount of time, as there is general agreement about them. There will be a debate about the House of Lords proposals, but we will have two days for it. The motion protects that debate, rather than running it into the buffers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="091103145000050"><a name="91103-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="091103145000623"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 I am sure that the Secretary of State can see how much things have changed. On Second Reading, he quite reasonably presented a picture of a number of days being set aside for debate. That may not have been perfect, but then he comes along today, as the debate is about to begin, and changes the rules with internal knives. That guarantees that large chunks of today's business alone will never come to be considered. It also means that he has lost the option of being able to offer the House a further day if he thinks that it has genuinely sought to make progress and yet has been unable to do so. That is the problem with his proposal.</p>

<p><a name="st_o249"><a name="091103145000051"><a name="91103-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="091103145000624"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 The hon. and learned Gentleman knows very well that the business of the House is in the hands of the business managers. Of course I take account of what has been said today, and I shall pursue the matter with those business managers, but I cannot offer undertakings as to what will follow. I want these matters to be debated properly-</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para10"><a name="091103159000009">Clause 1 simply relates to the scope of the civil service part of the Bill, following on from the draft Civil Service Bill in 2004 and the draft of this Bill in 2008. The first question that arises from our amendment is whether the Bill should apply to GCHQ. The Bill excludes the coverage of all the security services, the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service and GCHQ, but, in the case of the latter in particular, there is a history that suggests that the Government, at least, have not always been of the opinion that GCHQ should be excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para11"><a name="091103159000010">In the 2004 consultation on the draft Civil Service Bill, the Government said that there were no obstacles to including GCHQ within the scope of the statutory basis of the civil service. They then said:</p>
<a name="91103-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="091103159000409"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Government has no objection in principle to having civil servants who work in the field of intelligence covered by the draft Bill. Because there is no operational impediment to their inclusion, GCHQ staff will be within scope of all the provisions of the draft Bill."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para12"><a name="091103159000011">But, in the 2008 draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, GCHQ was quietly removed, and the Bill before the House today retains that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para13"><a name="091103159000012">From what the Government have said to the various Committees that have discussed the Bill before us, I gather that their justification for excising GCHQ from this legislation is that GCHQ should be treated</p>
<a name="91103-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="091103159000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">"in the same way as the other Security and Intelligence Agencies."</p>

 I am concerned about the exclusion of GCHQ from the definition of what is a civil servant for the purposes of this part of the Bill. It is hard to see why GCHQ employees should not be covered by such provisions. Why should GCHQ not be managed by the Minister but by a civil service employer? Why should there not be a code of conduct that requires integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality? Why should the Civil Service Commission be unable to set appointment rules that mean that appointments are on merit? Why should an employee who feels that he is being asked to do something that is in breach of the code of conduct be unable to go to the commissioners and ask for redress? It seems odd that the Government would want to exclude that particular institution from the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para18"><a name="091103159000021">I can understand that slightly different considerations apply to the Secret Intelligence Service-MI6-because it has its own statutes that provide similar protections, and it might seem inappropriate to want to legislate to repeal completely those provisions, which are presumably, for these purposes, adequate. However, GCHQ is not in the same position, as the Government recognised in 2004. What has changed that makes the Government suddenly feel that GCHQ must be treated differently from the rest of the civil service? I am sure that if somebody who works there was asked, "Who do you work for?", they would say either the Ministry of Defence or the civil service; they would not want to call themselves employees of anything else. Given that it is logical that GCHQ should be covered by the Bill and given that there is no real reason why the prerogative powers should be used instead of management being exercised under this legislation, I would be therefore be interested to hear the Minister's explanation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="91103-0012.htm_para19"><a name="091103159000022">I am worried that this may be one of those cases that we get from time to time when Ministers and civil servants say, "We don't want to fetter GCHQ in any way", and that what is proposed is just the product of a defensive approach that is against the spirit of the age, which is to be as transparent as possible. In that case, I believe that there is no real reason why the amendment should not succeed.</p>

GCHQ was to be included in these provisions back in 2004 and why it is now excluded; I do not know what thought process or consultation has produced that change. I do not know why it would be thought appropriate that promotion on merit would not apply to the employees of GCHQ. I do not know why it would be thought that it was not appropriate for those employees to have the right to appeal to the civil service commissioners. I do not know whether the staff who work at GCHQ have been asked where they would like to sit. There may be good reasons for those exclusions, but none has yet been produced, so I anticipate the Minister's answers to those questions.</p>

 I was recently privileged publicly to welcome Her Majesty the Queen to GCHQ, along with the mayor of Cheltenham. I would not like to inflate my own importance in that, given that the mayor and I were almost the only people present who could be publicly photographed. During that visit, I jokingly asked whether Her Majesty needed security clearance, and was told, I think equally in jest, that she did not, because by definition GCHQ was almost part of her household. Although that might have been said in jest, it highlights the anomalous position in which the secret agencies find themselves, which was identified by the Joint Committee on the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill.</p>

In his evidence to the Joint Committee, the Cabinet Secretary gave some absurdly extreme examples of how those rights might be applied, suggesting that GCHQ might have to place equal opportunities job advertisements in <i> Pravda</i> or that the civil service commissioners could be allowed public and unlimited access to personnel files at GCHQ, which would be equally inappropriate. It is equally possible to imagine circumstances in which a proper complaints procedure, with statutory force, to bodies such as the civil service commissioners might be helpful to GCHQ employees. Better that disgruntled staff have the right to appeal in confidence to the commissioners than that they take their complaints to the media, for instance. An intelligence agency is different from the rest of the civil service, but it cannot be beyond the wit of Government to propose amendments that might accommodate the concerns of the Cabinet Secretary and others while still bestowing on my constituency workers at GCHQ statutory rights very similar to those of other civil servants.</p>

 Can the hon. Gentleman give us a clue as to why the Minister would not indicate what the exceptional circumstances would be in which someone was not promoted on merit? Why does he believe she did not let the Committee know that?</p>

 I do not know, and that point is by far the strongest case for the amendment that has been established in the debate. Appointments to positions at GCHQ must be on merit, because they are technical jobs. What does it mean for an appointment not to be made on merit?</p>

 A central issue in this Bill is the question: to whom does it apply? Who counts as a civil servant? There has been debate for many years on the merits of a civil service Bill, and about the importance of giving statutory protection to civil servants, so that they do not rely simply on the good will of the Government of the day in important aspects of their working lives. Obviously, once one accepts the principle of statutory protection for civil servants, the question of who counts as a civil servant becomes very important.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="3" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>3 Nov 2009 : Column 779</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para3"><a name="091103160000006">In this Bill, the Government have simply not attempted any definition, or even any description, of what counts as the civil service. The Minister may be able to point me to a part of the Bill where I can find such a definition, but I have not been able to find it. Clause 1(1) simply states that:</p>
<a name="91103-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="091103160000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">"this Chapter applies to the civil service of the State."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para4"><a name="091103160000007">It makes no further attempt to say what that means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para5"><a name="091103160000008">In contrast, in the Government's consultation on the 2004 Bill, they said:</p>
<a name="91103-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="091103160000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Because there is no satisfactory, authoritative and comprehensive definition of the term 'Civil Service', in order to achieve the necessary clarity and certainty about coverage, the draft Bill proposes that there should be a comprehensive listing of every part of the Civil Service to which the Bill is to apply."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para6"><a name="091103160000009">Then, the Government accepted the fact that it is difficult to define the civil service in abstract terms, so the solution was to list in the Bill the organisations and bodies that would count as part of the civil service for the purposes of the Bill. The 2004 Bill included that list in a schedule. That is an important list, because it includes organisations that, if the only definition in the Bill was</p>
<a name="91103-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="091103160000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the civil service of the State",</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para7"><a name="091103160000010">could be defined as being in or out of the civil service.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_16"><a name="91103-0014.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="091103160000054"><h5 align="left">7.15 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para8"><a name="091103160000011">For example, is ACAS in the civil service or not? Are the people who work for ACAS civil servants or not? The 2004 Bill included ACAS. I do not want to go through the entire list, but there is ambiguity about other similar bodies. For example, does the civil service include regulatory organisations such as Ofwat, the Office of Rail Regulation and Ofsted, or the various inspectorates such as Her Majesty's fire service inspectorate, or the Health and Safety Executive? Are the people who work for those bodies civil servants or not? In every case, the answer according to the 2004 Bill is yes. All those organisations were covered. Are they covered by the present Bill? The problem is that we do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para9"><a name="091103160000012">This amendment asks the Government why, if in 2004 they thought that it was not satisfactory to leave the question alone and that we needed not only a vague general definition but a list of the organisations to which the Bill would apply, they have now suddenly changed their mind, and say that the lack of an authoritative and comprehensive definition is satisfactory. This is not an abstract point. It is important, because on this question turns who counts as a civil service employer-and that is important because it is the only way we have of telling whether the various rights in the Bill apply. In particular, clause 9 includes the right to an investigation by the Civil Service Commission. How can it possibly be a matter of dispute whether someone is entitled to invoke that right?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para10"><a name="091103160000013">I hope that at some stage in our discussions we will consider the duties of civil service employers and Ministers to act impartially towards their employees. We do not know whether that will apply to some sets of employees unless we know who counts as a civil servant. The important issue of appointment on merit was raised in the previous debate. Does the requirement of appointment on merit apply to a particular job? If we cannot tell whether that is the case, the Bill collapses into unacceptable uncertainty and vagueness.</p>

 Many of the bodies that the hon. Gentleman mentions, over which questions as to whether they are part of the civil service may arise, perform functions that can be controversial-such as regulators or the Health and Safety Executive. It is all the more important that it should be clear whether civil servants working in those organisations will have the protection of the Act, and can make complaints if an attempt is made to interfere with a controversial decision.</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="091103160000015"><a name="91103-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="091103160000060"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 That is an important aspect of the question. Are civil servants protected from improper pressure, for example? Do they have the protection of the code? If they do not, what is their protection? The hon. Gentleman is right. Many of the bodies concerned are charged with making judgments with which the Government of the day might not agree, which makes it even more important for us to know whether they are covered.</p>

 I apologise, Sir Alan, for being a little previous in attempting to intervene during the last grouping. I have worked out that I last led for my party during the Committee stage of a Bill in 1992-so perhaps I am a little rusty. However, I hope that I shall get the hang of it before long.</p>

Friends, goes further. The Bill has been in gestation for 150 years: it has taken a long time to get here. It does some very good things, and we support its purpose of putting the civil service on to a statutory basis-but it is deeply eccentric that after 150 years, we have a Bill to put the civil service on to a statutory basis that does not say what the civil service is. This is a moveable feast-and one that is broadly at the discretion of the Government. It seems to be almost at the whim of the Government, too.</p>

The question is referred to the Office for National Statistics, as if the number of civil servants were an external phenomenon that the Government tried to track out of interest, but they had no concept of its being a crucial management tool. In truth, at this stage, it is a management tool of considerable bearing on reducing Britain's ballooning budget deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para14"><a name="091103160000020">The fact is that the numbers of civil servants have varied enormously. The Government claim that they have reduced the size of the civil service. They claim to have "achieved 86,700 work force reductions" as part of the Gershon programme. Civil service employment was 522,000 in 2008. I accept that that was down from the 2004 peak of 570,000, but it was still higher than the 516,000 level of 1997.</p>

has been a growth in the number of quangos classified as public corporations, rather than as part of the civil service. In 1996, 89 such bodies were classified as public corporations, but by 2008 that number had doubled to 178. Staff in public corporations are generally not classified as civil service employees for civil service head-count purposes. No fewer than 568,000 staff are now employed by public corporations, compared with 525,000 civil service employees. Mysteriously, only 31,000 of those public corporation staff are included in the civil service head count.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para16"><a name="091103160000022">There has also been a shift of bodies from the civil service into public corporations.

In the last year for which there are numbers, there were more than 200,000 NDPB employees. Furthermore, a series of what are effectively public bodies are not deemed to be part of the public sector at all-the Carbon Trust, Envirowise, the Energy Saving Trust, Network Rail and UK Financial Investments Ltd are not counted as civil service, central Government or even the public sector, yet all are funded by the Government.</p>

The ONS's own figures show that between 1999 to 2006 there was an average fall of 0.7 per cent. per year in education productivity and a decrease of 2.1 per cent. per year in social care productivity, and that between 2001 and 2005 there was a decrease of 2 per cent. in health care productivity.</p>

Many extremely capable people, imbued with a public service ethos-we value that enormously-work in the civil service, but morale is very low. That is partly the result of a lack of transparency, efficiency and productivity. Public accountability is crucial, which is why we think that there should be a civil service annual report clearly laying out the definition of the civil service. That is what new clause 33 would achieve. We support amendment 10, which was moved by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), but if that does not proceed to a vote, we will want a Division on new clause 33 at a later stage.</p>

on the basis of the precise points that the Secretary of State made in reply to my intervention on Second Reading, that the issue has arisen to some extent as a result of the differentiation over time, and substantially so relatively recently, of what one might describe in common-sense terms as the civil service. Hon. Members have already given examples of boards and bodies that one might consider to be part of the civil service in common-sense terms, but which turn out not to be. There are also examples of bodies that one would think were not part of the civil service, but which turn out to be just that. It is therefore important to find, one way or another, a mechanism for the Bill to perform that service of defining who is and who is not a civil servant for the purposes of the rest of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para29"><a name="091103160000038">Incidentally, a little while ago I tabled a written question that sought to define that point in terms of NDPBs, agencies and various other things. I regret to say that my question has not yet been answered, but perhaps any answer that might be provided in the fullness of time could provide some illumination of what we are discussing in connection with the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para30"><a name="091103160000039">Amendment 10 might not quite fit the bill in that respect. However, at the very least, I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to provide in her reply to this debate an assurance that the definitions in the Bill will be urgently considered, and that some thought will be given to introducing some mechanisms, whether in the Bill or associated with it, to clarify what we are talking about in the rest of the Bill as it proceeds through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="91103-0014.htm_para31"><a name="091103160000040">I am not sure that new clause 33 fits the bill. Although it says that the Minister for the civil service</p>

entirely lost in this legislation. The removal of the clauses on the Attorney-General, among many other things that have been referred to today, is a reflection of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para1"><a name="091103167000003">However, Lord Falconer was wrong about one thing: civil service reform, as embodied in clause 1. The clause applies part 1 of the Bill to the civil service of the state, on which new clause 33 would give us an annual report. Clause 1 is radical, but in a curious way: it is a triumph for the status quo. Indeed, in places it even offers the possibility of restoring the status quo ante for the civil service. The clause entrenches the principle of an independent, impartial and permanent civil service recruited on merit. In doing that, we need to recognise that, by comparison with the civil services of many other major democracies, we are at one extreme in our levels of impartiality and impermanence. It is on such issues that I am at my most conservative, and I welcome this triumph of the status quo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para2"><a name="091103167000004">We have had-and to a large degree we still have-a civil service that works. The history books suggest that since Northcote-Trevelyan dealt a blow to patronage, we have been well served by the people who have come into the civil service, and we are still well served. Anybody who has worked there will know the sense of duty, commitment and loyalty that the civil service can show to the Government of the day. There is still such a thing in this country as a public service ethos, and the best of them in Whitehall have it in bucketfuls. If clause 1 makes a contribution to reaffirming that ethos, the Bill will have been worth while. The civil service is an important pillar of our constitution. This legislation will strengthen that pillar, if only a little.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para3"><a name="091103167000005">In this triumph of what I have described as the status quo, we need to realise that we are setting aside many other approaches to the relationship between elected Ministers and, on the one hand, Parliament and, on the other, the appointed civil service. One of those approaches, which has often been discussed, would be to make the civil service more directly accountable to Parliament, as the Institute for Public Policy Research has suggested. Another approach, favoured by the think-tank Reform, would be to give Ministers more say over the direction of the permanent civil service establishment. That would take us in the direction of the United States. A third approach would be to keep most of the civil service as it is, but to superimpose at the top a cabinet system in each Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para4"><a name="091103167000006">I will not linger on those approaches, except perhaps briefly on the third one. My guess is that one reason that support for civil service legislation has gathered pace in many quarters, especially in Whitehall itself, is that we have, de facto, tried the cabinet system over the past decade and, having tried it, found it wanting. I wonder whether that is why Lord Butler, among others, changed sides on this issue. He was a former opponent of a civil service Bill; now he is a supporter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para5"><a name="091103167000007">When people refer to the growth of presidentialism under Tony Blair, what they mean is the growth of a cabinet of advisers, largely temporary and party political, right at the heart of No. 10 and No. 11. Their position was reinforced by Orders in Council in 1997, giving advisers direct authority over civil servants. That was a profound mistake that has rightly been reversed. Cabinets should not be allowed to become part of our political culture. The bypassing of the civil service that came with that, and the impact of sofa government, were both disastrous for us. Clause 1 and its companions do  <br>

not guarantee that that will not happen again, but they send a clear legislative signal that that is not how our civil service should operate. That is why I said earlier that this chapter of the Bill will entrench not only the status quo but, to some degree, a status quo ante.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para6"><a name="091103167000008">When I was in Whitehall, I was not a supporter of proposals for a civil service Bill. I thought that such legislation would be a waste of parliamentary time. However, I then sat on these Benches in the early years of the Blair Administration watching the new Labour Government bypassing officials and prejudicing the ability of the civil service to offer impartial advice to the Government, and that led me to conclude that we might need legislation to protect the civil service from the new culture of advisers and to signal Parliament's support for the ethos of public service set out in the civil service code of conduct, which had recently been improved prior to the arrival of the Blair Administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para7"><a name="091103167000009">This part of the Bill lays the ground on which a proper relationship between the civil service and politicians can be maintained for the future. That relationship requires Ministers to provide strategic direction to the civil service. It also requires the civil service, led by permanent secretaries, to implement that direction, having warned Ministers-and having been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard by Ministers, a point that Robin Mountfield has made on numerous occasions-if those officials think that the direction of a policy is deeply flawed or would result in a failure of delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para8"><a name="091103167000010">I do not pretend that the lack of leadership that we have seen from time to time recently is a uniquely Labour disease. It has afflicted previous Governments as well. It is, however, reasonable to ask how things have operated recently. For example, how much strategic direction can have come from the merry-go-round of ministerial reshuffles that we have had? I think that we have had four Secretaries of State for Transport in three years, four Defence Secretaries in four years, and four Home Secretaries in five years. The right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid) takes the record, having held seven Cabinet posts in eight years. He described the Home Office as "not fit for purpose", but it was ministerial leadership, not the civil service, that was not fit for purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para9"><a name="091103167000011">From what I have seen, the civil service aches for good leadership. It wants to implement the plans of elected Governments, not to thwart them. It is when politicians fail it-and only then-that some civil servants are transmogrified into a caricature of Sir Humphrey. This is not just about a failure of strategic leadership, however. Ministers have also used the civil service in ways that they should not have. The Neill Committee warned, as early as 2000, that Ministers were pushing senior civil servants to the margin in the provision of advice, while interposing their own advisers. The role of the adviser was being transformed into that of a spin doctor, a fact reflected most notoriously in the Jo Moore affair at the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Imagine the state of morale when the permanent secretary in that Department was quoted as saying-I shall not use his exact language; I shall just use the first letter of some of his words-the following:</p>

I shall be doing that not out of spite, however, but because I want the Bill to be successful. It is an enormously important Bill, and we have waited an awfully long time for it. That is why I rise to support amendment 10 and new clause 33. I accept the point made by the hon.

We have heard that earlier legislation specified all the way through which organisations were part of the civil service. That was excellent for Parliament, as well as for the employees of those agencies and Departments, who knew exactly where they stood. On the day before an important report is due to be published on MPs' expenses, the need for trust in this Chamber and in the Government is paramount.

Under Gershon, the civil service should have shrunk; actually, however, we find that it has not. Perhaps the Government are worried that if they build the numbers into the Bill, we would all know just how big the Government payroll is within the civil service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para18"><a name="091103167000021">We know that there has been a huge increase in the number of consultants in the civil service and Departments. Do they fall under the remit of the Bill? Do they have its protection? Some of them have very senior roles in Departments. Senior consultants are working in the Department of Health, for instance, with civil servants working below them. Such people do not have civil service contracts; they are consultants in a Department. Are they covered by the Bill? If they are not, how do the civil servants working below them know where they stand?</p>

There is some evidence of that. We need to know the exact costs involved in the civil service-new clause 33(3)(b) would make the Government come forward each year with those exact costs-but how can we calculate them if we have no idea which Departments, which quangos, which arm's length organisations are part of the civil service?</p>

 I want to follow the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) in saying how welcome it is that chapter 1 applies to the civil service of the state and that there is protection for the impartiality and objectivity of our civil service, which I believe to be precious. During the early years of the Labour Government, that was damaged by a change in the way in which the Government did their business. Some of the traditional, formal methods by which we had ensured good government came to be damaged during that period. It is right to say that there is a different climate for the civil service generally today, with more people entering it at a later stage rather than trained civil servants moving up the grades. That also impacts on why it is necessary to have a civil service Act.</p>

In their response in July 2000, the Government confirmed their commitment to a civil service Act. In 2001, the Committee on Standards in Public Life asked whether the Government were going to go ahead, and Sir Richard Wilson, giving evidence, said yes.

Needless to say, nothing happened. The Public Administration Committee produced its excellent report towards the end of 2002 or early in 2003 and subsequently a draft Bill, but again nothing happened. In fact, I promoted the Bill and presented it to the House. We had a debate on 21 January 2004, in which the Government again said that they had given a commitment and would produce their own Bill-the Chairman of the Committee may well remember this-before the end of the Session.

The issue of who is a civil servant and how the problem should be dealt with was raised in a debate on 21 January 2004 by the then Member for Milton Keynes, North-West. The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) might well have been involved in that debate. The point has been made repeatedly since, so it seems extraordinary that when a Bill is before us, we find no full definition of civil servants of the state. The Minister may well tell us that it will be left for the Civil Service Commission to decide in every case whether a person who is making a complaint is a civil servant, although it may be that the Government are expecting the courts to sort it out. That is clearly unsatisfactory after this long period of gestation.</p>

 My hon. Friend's point about the courts is an important one. As I understand it-I am not a learned gentleman-the courts look at Parliament's intent when an Act is brought into being, but we do not know what Parliament's intent is because it is not built into the Bill. How, then, will the courts be able to judge it, when we do not know the Government's exact intentions?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes the point exactly-what are the courts to make of it? That is worrying if we look at the problems of recent years, which my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester mentioned. Let us take the concern that Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell had executive authority over civil servants, were more powerful than the Cabinet and were able to tell civil servants right across Whitehall what to do-the key concern that they had executive powers. The concern about the inquiry into Dr. David Kelly is another example, as Lord Hutton found it difficult to piece together exactly what had happened because there were no records or minutes kept of meetings with civil servants, as they had been conducted in "sofa government" ways.</p>

Certainly when I was a Minister, the idea that a civil servant would fail to make a note of a meeting, or even of a ministerial telephone call, did not occur; civil servants would listen in and make notes of the discussions. A record was kept and everyone was protected by it. By the time we get to the Hutton report-this is also true of the Butler report into the war in Iraq-there had been a breakdown in those traditional ways of doing things, which had previously safeguarded the impartiality and objectivity of the civil service, while also being for very good for Ministers, because they provided some formal structure and pattern to the way in which they carried out their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="91103-0015.htm_para29"><a name="091103167000035">It is the breakdown in standards, together with some further changes in the civil service, that led senior former civil servants to say that some form of legislation must be enacted. It is welcome that the Bill is where it is, but it is sad that we have not been able to find in it a definition of a civil servant that is capable of holding water. We want to see protections enshrined in statute partly because, as I alluded to earlier, the nature of the civil service is changing.</p>

In a world where many people are now rightly coming into the civil service without that background, it is important to have more structure than we had before. Over the years, it has been said that we need a provision that clearly defines the role of Ministers' special advisers and the formal civil service. I am glad that the Bill does that, but I also want a proper definition of what a civil servant is, so that we do not end up with a lot of court cases and a mess instead of what should be a major reform.</p>

The Government have done that on numerous occasions since 2004, which is why we are in our current position. After consideration, it was felt that more frequent amendment of primary legislation would be required if we were to ensure the maintenance of an accurate list. The Bill therefore lists the parts of the civil service to which the provisions do not apply, a move that was supported by the Joint Committee.</p>

The Office for National Statistics is responsible for publishing, each quarter, the number of civil servants employed by each Department and agency.

The FSA was included in the 2004 draft Bill, but the other FSA-the Financial Services Authority-was not, so the question is this: which FSA are we talking about? The answer to that is unclear.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the courts will use Pepper <i> v. </i>Hart? They will look at what has been said here, and they will find what I think was the only clear definition, which is that anybody who has signed the civil service code is a member of the civil service. That seems to suggest that anybody who decides they want to sign it can then call themselves a civil servant.</p>

 I am glad the hon. Gentleman raised that point, because that appeared to be the import of what the Minister said. Since the civil service code is on the web, I presume anyone can print it off and sign it, and thereby define themselves as civil servants. This does not make any sense at all.</p>

 As I understand it, a consultant working in a Department has to sign the civil service code, but they are a consultant rather than employed by the civil service. Will they fall inside or outside the definition?</p>

 That is a very good question. Judging by the Minister's account, it depends on whether the person wants to sign it, and if they do want to sign it, then they are a civil servant. This is not at all satisfactory. The problem in terms of the courts is that they will try to work out the intention of Parliament and we are trying to get the Minister to put on record what her intention is, but she seems entirely incapable of doing so. She gives the impression that she has some sort of definition to hand, but we cannot work out what it is. She gives examples, but if one attempts the normal case law technique of joining them together to produce a rule, one cannot work out what the rule is that lies behind those examples. This seems to me to be entirely the wrong approach, and if the Joint Committee supported that approach, it could not have been in a position to work out what it was doing.</p>

 If the distinguished Select Committee Chairman is saying that the only way to deal with this is to leave it to the courts, that is a counsel of despair, especially in circumstances such as these in which we are not offering the courts any guidance. The approach in the 2004 Bill seems to me to be better. If one cannot offer a coherent definition, the next best thing to do is not to do nothing, which is what the Government are doing, but to provide a list. The 2004 Bill did that, and amendment 10 would require the Government to go down that road. It would also give them the power to change the list from time to time.</p>

We have a similar arrangement with the parliamentary ombudsman, who is a servant of this House. We ask the ombudsman to produce reports on cases and to produce an annual report, but we explicitly give that office the ability to make special reports to the House where there are particular issues it wants to bring to the House's attention. It is entirely sensible and straightforward that we would give a similar provision to the commissioners. They want a provision of this kind and it seems sensible for them to have one, and I am sure the Government cannot think of any reason why they cannot have it.

"Exceptional circumstances" could mean something completely different to me, to the Minister, the courts, to the civil service or to the commission. What does "exceptional circumstances" mean?

 I was going to raise exactly the same point, and would simply add this. Who decides whether a case is "exceptional"? If the commissioners decide what is exceptional, the amendment of the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) does not achieve very much, because it is purely within the commission's discretion to decide. If Ministers are to decide, that would obviously be completely objectionable. Ministers should not be able to make such a decision; that would undermine the commission's independence.

phrase "exceptional circumstances". Actually, the term in the Bill is "exceptional cases", which is slightly different. It is easier to define "exceptional circumstances" than it is the "exceptional cases" that must be brought to one's attention by the report.

 It is really very difficult to keep a straight face, Sir Nicholas. What is really disappointing is that when the process of this Bill began, all the Front Benchers were saying, "Of course we will be open to amendments. This Bill is not fixed in stone, and we will bring it forward in a spirit of taking sensible amendments." Indeed, when the Cabinet Secretary was in front of our Committee just last week, the same was said when we raised a similar issue with him, so I am afraid there is a mismatch here with the spirit in which we all engaged upon this Bill. There is a genuine desire across the House to get the Bill done.

 I wish to raise two points and ask two questions about the schedule. Both points relate to the independence of the commission and both were raised by either the Joint Committee or the Public Administration Committee in their deliberations on the Bill. The first point is about the power of the Government-in this case, presumably the Minister for the Civil Service-over the commission's budget. Can this Minister explain what the procedure will be for setting the commission's budget? Will the Government of the day-the Minister for the Civil Service, in particular-have the power to set conditions on the way in which that budget is spent or to limit the content of the commission's activities using a budgetary mechanism? If that is the case-some concern was expressed on this point by the two Committees-that will, of itself, undermine the commission's independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="91103-0017.htm_para8"><a name="091103168000038">The second point relates to the appointment of the first commissioner, which is obviously an important matter. I understand that the Bill says that the first commissioner is appointed by the Government, after consultation with various other people. A proposal was made-I believe by the Public Administration Committee-that as that was not enough to ensure the independence of the first commissioner, the appointment should be subject to the agreement of someone outside government; one suggestion was that the agreement of the Leader of the Opposition should be required in order to ensure the complete independence of the first commissioner. I have not heard from the Government as to why they rejected that particular proposal, and I wish to ensure that the Civil Service Commission should be as independent as possible.</p>

 Schedule 1 contains provisions relating to the membership of the new Civil Service Commission-the hon. Gentleman mentioned that-and the other issues relating to the appointments that I referred to a moment ago. He asked about the commission's financial independence. Provisions provide for the commission to publish and lay before Parliament an annual report, as has been discussed. As now, that can include a summary of information on the funding of the commission. That is an obvious vehicle for the commission to bring forward any concerns that it might have about the adequacy of its funding or any comments that it wishes to make on the funding. Indeed, an exceptional or special report could be prepared to address those particular concerns.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that assurance, although I am not sure that it is enough to ensure the independence of the commission, especially if it will get into trouble for complaining about conditions governing its own budget or, at the very least, be worried about whether making a complaint would make the problem of its budget worse the following year.</p>

That is an important and influential safeguard for the commissioner's role in regulating the Executive. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, the Joint Committee recommended two amendments to the draft Bill's schedule in respect of commissioners. The first was for a requirement that the commissioners should be appointed on merit, on the basis of fair and open competition. The second was that compensation for loss of office should be extended to all commissioners, rather than just the first commissioner. The Government accepted both those recommendations, and the published schedule to the Bill incorporates those amendments. In addition, the Minister for the Civil Service must consult the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the relevant Opposition leaders.</p>

We would, quite obviously, prefer to see a properly devolved civil service accountable to Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament, much like those that we observe in normal legislatures around the world-in normal, self-respecting Parliaments. That is what we seek in terms of a civil service for Scotland, but it is not what we intend to seek when it comes to the appointments of senior civil servants. We would prefer that decision to be made by the First Minister of Scotland, and we would see him as responsible for making those key appointments.

I thought that the Labour and Conservative Whips Offices would have tried to outdo each other in a stampede to be the first to the Public Bill Office to table this amendment. But we have not heard a peep from them, and it is left to a humble Back Bencher from the Scottish National party to get to his feet and try to ensure that we get some progress on this matter-to try to advance the agreed position of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal parties.

I am hoping to enlist her support in getting it through, although the crucial difference between the Calman process and the Scottish Government's national conversation is that we trust the people of Scotland to make the choice. We are prepared to take our proposal to the Scottish people, but the hon. Lady rejects that.

This evening, with this key piece of legislation, there is an opportunity for the House to enact one of his recommendations, but he will be observing our debate and wondering, "What on earth is going to happen to the rest of them?"

Given the history of prime ministerial interference in senior civil service appointments that we suspect has been going on at United Kingdom level-at least under a previous Prime Minister-that seems an entirely sensible thing to do. It raises the question why the Bill retains the power of the Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil Service, to interfere with senior appointments at United Kingdom level-an issue that seems to have disappeared from the Bill, in comparison with previous drafts. Perhaps that is the reason why the Government are nervous about the amendment.</p>

It seems perfectly reasonable to have a different system even on that question in Scotland, compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. I do not think that threatens the unity of the civil service, and it provides a sensible way forward.

The proposals from the Calman commission, which the SNP did not take part in, were wide-ranging and significant, and there is widespread agreement, including from Kenneth Calman himself.

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para5"><a name="0911041000049">The amendment is a modest measure, and I tabled it to try to be helpful. It is about being constructive and making gentle progress towards securing what we believe is a greater ambition for Scotland. I thought that by discussing the agreed position of the Labour party, the Conservative party and the Liberal party, we could start to move the traffic in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para6"><a name="0911041000050">The Minister went on about some nonsense to do with our commitment to Calman. May I say to her-she is not listening, but I will say it anyway-that where there is agreement on Calman, for goodness' sake let us act on it? There are several parts of Calman that we have absolutely no problem whatsoever about implementing, such as its recommendations on the devolution of firearms legislation and on drink-driving. If the Unionist parties-the London-based parties-think that it is a good idea and we think that it is a good idea, let us do it; there should be no problem with that. But for some reason, Calman has been presented as an all-or-nothing package, so we cannot do the good things and leave aside some of the nuttier suggestions that he mucked about with at the edges. Where it is useful, where it is constructive, and where it takes things forward, let us get on and deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para7"><a name="0911041000051">The Minister's response has not been satisfactory, and that is disappointing and unfortunate. We are now going to see the ridiculous spectacle of Labour Members walking through the Lobby voting against their own position and their own proposals. I am very much looking forward to witnessing that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o357"><a name="0911041000052"><a name="91103-0018.htm_spnew11"><a name="0911041000526"><b>Mrs. Laing:</b>
 I have a lot of sympathy for what the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) said, as I often do when we take part in the same debates. He has highlighted an important issue. However, as the Minister says, the whole Calman report has to be looked at as one entity, and it would be wrong to press a small part of its recommendations in the Bill. Having said that, I, like the hon. Gentleman, look forward to the Government's responding to Calman soon, so that we can get on with these matters, because we believe in power resting in Edinburgh where it should do so.</p>

 I want to ask the Minister a simple question that relates to an obvious omission from this part of the Bill. In the 2004 draft Civil Service Bill, there was an explicit statement in clause 4(4) that</p>
<a name="91103-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="0911041000490"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Nothing in this section confers...power to recruit, appoint, discipline or dismiss civil servants, or...any other power for the day to day management of civil servants."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para10"><a name="0911041000406">Ministers have the power to hire and fire civil servants, but that provision made it explicit that they should not do so. This Bill does not repeat that explicit assurance, but it should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para11"><a name="0911041000407">The Public Administration Committee made that point in its response to the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, when it said:</p>
<a name="91103-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="0911041000491"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Giving Ministers the general power to appoint and dismiss civil servants does not seem in keeping with the Government's commitment to a civil service recruited on merit and able to serve administrations of different political persuasions."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para12"><a name="0911041000408">I agree with that. The Joint Committee on the draft Bill said:</p>
<a name="91103-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="0911041000492"><ul><p class="tabletext">"While Ministers can legitimately be consulted about particular moves within the civil service, Ministers should not be involved in appointment or dismissal of individual civil servants without the express approval of the Prime Minister. We invite the Lord Chancellor to follow up on his offer to look again at the drafting...to reflect this."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para13"><a name="0911041000409">I do not agree with the Joint Committee, because I do not think that the Prime Minister should be able to give explicit approval either.

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para14"><a name="0911041000410">The Minister may reply to my points by saying that the clauses on recruitment mean that Ministers cannot intervene except within the very narrow tramlines of the recruitment process that is set out, but I do not think that that is sufficient and I would like an explicit exclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para15"><a name="0911041000411">If Members want a rationale for such an exclusion, we have been provided with one in the past few days, with the sacking of an independent scientific adviser. Although he was not a civil servant, the incident raises exactly the sort of issues that are relevant to this debate. Indeed, my colleagues tabled new clause 42, which addressed the point. It had the great advantage of topicality, but the great disadvantage of not being timely. Because the circumstances arose over the weekend, it could be tabled only yesterday and therefore could not be selected for today's debate. I shall not speak in detail about it, therefore, but it would have given protection to independent scientific advisers to do their job as independent scientists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="91103-0018.htm_para16"><a name="0911041000412">However, I shall press the question with the Minister about why Ministers will not be expressly forbidden to hire and fire civil servants. That should be a basic principle that is enshrined in the Bill. Otherwise, there is the possibility of abuse and people being removed for political purposes. If we are to give proper protection to civil servants, we can do it only through a provision of the kind proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para0"><a name="0911041000413">The Minister has been asked repeatedly, even during the debates on the first three clauses, to explain what has changed between the time of the draft Civil Service Bill in 2004 and the Bill before us today. I must say that the explanations given by her advisers have not always been convincing. I hope that, on this occasion, we will at least get some sort of explanation of why a provision that was felt necessary in 2004 is not felt necessary in 2009. In the absence of such an explanation, it is hard to give any credibility to the clause.</p>

 The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has got his priorities a bit mixed up. It is touching that he wishes to protect civil servants, but I believe that it is the duty of the House to require the accountability of civil servants. That accountability is derived through ministerial accountability to Parliament. There has to be a chain of accountability, therefore, from civil servant to Minister to Parliament. That is what the Conservative party, in other circumstances, has proposed. In so far as the clause brings that about, to a certain extent, we support it. I am disappointed to see the hon. Gentleman get his priorities so mixed up. I hope that the Minister has not got her priorities mixed up.</p>

 Of course not; that is already protected. The Liberal Democrats should not be quite so touchy; my criticism of them does not mean that I am saying that everything that they have said is wrong. They ought to calm down. I am merely saying that the real issue is accountability. It is a pity that clause 3 does not go further in respect of the accountability of civil servants and Ministers to the House, which is then accountable to the people. That should be the principle on which we work.</p>

 I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) talking about why his new clause was not selected. I put it to him, however, that it might have had the advantage of topicality, but it had the disadvantage of not being relevant to the civil service-it was not about civil servants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0911041000418">The Government made it clear in their response to the Joint Committee that the provisions in the Bill do not alter the current power to manage individual civil servants.

 Because they do not have a civil servant contract. They have not signed the terms and conditions of a civil servant. They have not signed up to the ministerial code. The case to which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred did not involve a civil servant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0911041000423">I understand the hon. Gentlemen's concerns, but the provisions in the Bill do not signal a change in ministerial involvement in individual appointments. The power to appoint is constrained by subsequent clauses that require recruitment to the civil service to be based on merit, following fair and open competition. That is regulated by independent civil service commissioners in accordance with recruitment principles. Civil servants are protected by statutory legal protection and employment laws. It is right that the power to manage remains with the Minister for the Civil Service and the Secretary of State, who are, as the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) made clear, ultimately accountable to Parliament for the management of the civil and diplomatic services respectively, including for the setting of terms and conditions overall.</p>

I do not think it unreasonable for the Committee to be given an explanation about that. Simply to assert that something that the Government said was necessary is now not necessary is an insufficient argument.

 I must therefore conclude that the ministerial code will not be statutory and will not have the same degree of protection that the civil service code will have, as it is the purpose of this clause to entrench that protection in law.

term generally means that someone trusted with the assets, wealth or well-being of a third party has a responsibility to manage them in the best interests of that third party. We believe that that is essentially at the heart of much of what the civil service does, and we would like to see it enshrined in the code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0911041000462">We believe that all employees in the public sector should abide by the principles of fiduciary responsibility, but the proposed code does not cover the full spectrum of people employed by the state. We discussed in the context of clause 1 the lack of a definition about who is covered. Many contract workers, agency temporary workers or employees of non-departmental public bodies are not covered by the civil service code. We propose that a separate code should be established for those employees, stressing the same fiduciary responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para21"><a name="0911041000463">I stress that we do not propose this fiduciary responsibility in any hostile spirit to civil servants; rather, I would say, the reverse. I believe that this provision would provide protection for civil servants, especially if it were backed with the amendments and new clauses grouped together on clause 9, which would place an obligation on Ministers-building on a point made previously-to respect the civil service code. Of course, the ministerial code already does that, although it is not, as the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) rightly pointed out, entrenched in statute, but nor would the Bill achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0911041000464">Ministers have a duty to respect the civil service; they should respect not only its code of values, but its role in providing advice. Of course Ministers are not obliged to accept the advice of their civil servants, but they should surely always seek it, listen to it and make judgments after assessing it. When public money is spent badly or inefficiently, it is very often the consequence not of civil servants being lax, careless, inefficient or hopeless, but of them being forced to do things by unwise ministerial decision, often in the face of civil servants' advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="91103-0019.htm_para23"><a name="0911041000465">I cited on Second Reading the example of the introduction of tax credits. It is now well attested that the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, was strongly advised by civil servants in both the Revenue and the Treasury that the way he proposed to proceed with tax credits would introduce serious risk of fraud and error, all of which came about. The advice was ignored and the result was a grave misuse of public money, not to mention the enormous human misery caused to hundreds of thousands of low-paid, hard-working people who found themselves required to pay back money that they had received in good faith. Those people thought that they were doing the right thing and obeying the law. The point about incorporating this fiduciary responsibility into the code of conduct is that if in those circumstances a Minister tells civil servants that they must go ahead and implement the policy regardless, against their own advice, there is at least some protection for those civil servants.</p>

It did not happen when tax credits were introduced. Arguably it should have, because it is understood that robust advice was given to the Chancellor to which he refused to listen. There is a strong case for saying that, given the circumstances, the chairman of the Revenue and the permanent secretary to the Treasury should have put in writing to the Chancellor that they needed to be directed, because their advice was that such action would be very harmful.</p>

We think that Ministers should have a statutory obligation to respect the impartiality of civil servants. We have a good deal of sympathy with a Liberal Democrat new clause, which we hope will be reached later. In the meantime, however, this amendment-which reflects the central importance for the whole Executive of respecting and acting in the interests of taxpayers-would provide an extremely valuable additional discipline.

 I sympathise very much with the intention behind the amendment. I do not think that it would do any harm to include a responsibility in the code and the Bill to ensure that public money is spent wisely. My only worry relates to the use of the word "fiduciary", which gives the impression that the relationship between civil servant and Government is similar to the relationship that used to exist between local councillors and their authorities in the days of surcharging.

 I say at the outset that I do not intend to press my amendments to a vote. One good reason is that, unfortunately, there are some slight technical errors. However, they are important amendments and I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues will at least consider incorporating their spirit, and even some of their wording, into the Bill at a later stage. They are about special advisers and seek to replace the term "special" with "ministerial", so that we know precisely to whom the advisers are addressing their advice. It is a more accurate word and it would clarify the role of special advisers in future if they were called "ministerial advisers".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="91103-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0911044000032">The Public Administration Committee, of which I am delighted to be a member, has discussed the role of special advisers at some length. Perhaps other Members have also discussed this issue during the debate, but there is a history to special advisers with which I have some familiarity. In the 1970s, I knew Tony Benn and his special advisers. However, the famous Francis Cripps and Frances Morrell operated strictly as his political advisers; they did not have a role in advising or instructing civil servants. What they did was useful and legitimate, although it did not please the civil servants at the time. Tony Benn's habit was to speak first thing in the morning to his personal political advisers and then later to the civil servants, so that he was well prepared for debating with them later in the day. That was seen then by the civil servants as untoward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="91103-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0911044000033">However, under Tony Blair the power of special advisers went way beyond that; they took on a much more powerful role. They were effectively directing civil servants, acting as an Executive layer between Ministers and civil servants. This was something new, and it looked as though it was politicising the civil service in an unacceptable way. I was critical of that at the time, and I think we have rowed back from that arrangement to some extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="91103-0020.htm_para30"><a name="0911044000034">At the time, however, things went even further than that. Some of the special advisers in Downing street were actually giving instructions over the heads of Ministers. At least two former senior Ministers are on record as complaining that their role was being marginalised. They were being kept out of the picture because policy was being passed from Downing street direct to the civil servants by special advisers, almost making the Ministers irrelevant. I am glad to say that that has changed.</p>

 Well, it concerned me at the time. I have been a member of the Public Administration Committee for seven years, and we have discussed these matters on a number of occasions. I have made very strong criticisms of that mode of operating, which changed the nature of our constitution and the relationship between Ministers and the civil service. It was a great mistake. I have used stronger language than that many times, which I will not use now-my hon. Friends who are also members of the Committee have heard me use it-when talking about authoritarian regimes and the techniques they use to exert political control at every level. However, to an extent, we have rowed back from that position, which I very much welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="91103-0020.htm_para31"><a name="0911044000037">I want to divide the role of ministerial adviser again. As my amendments point out, ministerial advisers come in two types: specialist advisers, who are experts who can give advice on technical matters that will help a Minister to do his job better; and political advisers or hacks-the sort of job that I might have done in a different regime. Long before I came into this place, I worked as a political adviser within the trade union movement. I used to use every opportunity to twist and turn politics as I wanted; that is what political advisers do. They act as advisers to Ministers-to one side; they do not instruct civil servants. That is why we want to use the term "ministerial adviser". Such people give advice to Ministers-they do not act as civil servants-and they are divided into those two categories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="91103-0020.htm_para32"><a name="0911044000038">If I may say this, it is a good day to bury special advisers, to coin a phrase. We should restore the proper role of the civil service as independent, impartial, neutral and equally able to serve Governments of all persuasions. Also, I hope that within the civil service there will be a range of views, so that good advice can come from all sides-in fact, from different sides of the argument-within the service itself. That is how it operated in the past and that is how it should operate again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="91103-0020.htm_para33"><a name="0911044000039">These amendments would restore the proper status of Ministers, whose role has been played down.

 I do not wish to speak for too long, although I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention.

and Shirley Williams, on the other, with several others in between. Within such Cabinets a real debate on policy took place, representing a spectrum of opinion. I am sure that the same was true of the Conservative party in times gone by, but our party certainly had genuine debate in Cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="91103-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0911044000042">It has also been pointed out that in times past the Cabinet would, typically, see some 200 policy papers a year-that is four a week, on average. Cabinet would debate those papers and reach some kind of consensus on them. I understand that in one of the more recent years, two policy papers went to the Cabinet. Considering two papers compared with 200 represents a change. I like to think that we should have a genuine debate in Cabinet, with strands of opinion, whichever party is in power-that should certainly happen when my party is in power. Those strands should represent the broad range of opinion within the large parties in our, essentially, two-party system-I apologise to the Liberal Democrats.</p>

I know that the Lord Chancellor would agree with my comments-were he in the Chamber-and those of the hon. Member for Luton, North, because he was one of the first special advisers when he worked for the then Mrs. Barbara Castle.

It is a pity that we cannot have a full debate on that this evening.

 Before I get on to the main substance of the debate, this is a fitting opportunity to pay tribute to a police officer, Sandy Padgett, who died only last month. She was a thoughtful, intelligent police officer who was the senior officer responsible for the half of Somerset within which my constituency lies, covering Taunton Deane, Sedgemoor and west Somerset. She died very unexpectedly at the tragically young age of 41, and her loss is still mourned and noticed not just by police officers but by people in all walks of life in my constituency and across Somerset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="91103-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09110410000024">The context of the debate is a decision by the Conservative-controlled executive at Somerset county council to reduce the budget for police community support officers, with effect from April 2010, by £129,000. Before I get into the details of precisely what arrangements are planned and why I feel so strongly that we should resist the budget cuts, I shall paint a background picture of why this is a matter of wider concern for people living right across Somerset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="91103-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09110410000025">Like people everywhere else in the country, my constituents are affected by violent serious crime, but it is fair to say that that is not the typical everyday experience of most people in most communities in Somerset. What causes a great deal of anxiety for those people is more routine-some people would describe it as lower-level-crime and antisocial behaviour, which often blights their lives. It is things such as graffiti, litter and late-night noise that make people feel that their quality of life is compromised. That public concern is real, and it is the responsibility of all interested parties-political parties, the police, local councils and others-to address the anxieties that my constituents and those of other Somerset Members feel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="91103-0022.htm_para18"><a name="09110410000026">Various councils and interest groups have put in place good arrangements to try to address those anxieties about lower-level crime and antisocial behaviour. Even before I was elected there was a good scheme of wardens in a large village in my constituency called Bishops Lydeard. They had a distinctive uniform and were visible out on patrol in their community. Similar schemes operated throughout Somerset and throughout the country, a lot of them under the auspices of local authorities rather than the police. The decision was taken, on balance rightly, to bring all those disparate groups and different efforts to address public concern under one umbrella and make them part of the overall police family. That was the genesis of the idea of PCSOs.</p>

In all those areas, I was particularly interested to observe how well police neighbourhood teams are working in their communities. They have been a success in many parts of the country.</p>

not want PCSOs to replace the regular police officers or be a substitute for them. However, they can play a complementary role as part of neighbourhood teams. That is what I have observed in Taunton and elsewhere: police have worked closely in conjunction with PCSOs and the different roles have made them a more effective and responsive force as a consequence.</p>

<p><a name="st_o414"><a name="09110410000029"><a name="91103-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="09110410000092"><b>Mr. David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b>
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. As a former chairman of the Avon and Somerset police authority, I am delighted that we have had more police officers in Avon and Somerset recently, although I must say that that is now in decline: we are losing officers, and have fewer now than we had a year or two ago. However, PCSOs are playing an essential role in supporting our police officers. They not only provide a uniform presence in many of our villages, but in towns such as Frome, they form a very strong bond with local young people, and work in a way that is simply not possible with modern policing. PCSOs nevertheless provide a complementary service, exactly as my hon. Friend says.</p>

<p><a name="st_o415"><a name="09110410000030"><a name="91103-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="09110410000093"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. Perhaps I can break down the role of PCSOs as part of the neighbourhood teams into three categories. The first role is visibility. How many times have we heard-not only in towns, but in small villages and more remote populated areas-how much people value having a visible police presence on the street? People often complain that they do not see the police, or that the police do not properly engage with them, so the uniformed presence of PCSOs is valued by a great number of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09110410000031">Secondly, PCSOs can play a role in ensuring that the function of the police reaches down to community level-for example, by holding regular advice surgeries in community centres, or by visiting victims of crime or people who have made complaints about the level of police activity in their area and talking to them about their concerns. They might go and see older people and advise them about home security, or visit primary or secondary schools to talk to children about crime and police-related matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09110410000032">Outside the Asda store in Taunton there is what is called a police pod. The public can drop in to that and do not have to go to the length of visiting the main police station. There they can get some advice on security-making their house, car or bike safer-or report a crime to the police or the PCSOs. In all those different ways, PCSOs, precisely because they are not engaged in dealing with criminals in the same way as police officers are, can spend more of their time out on the street, in the community, visible, at the same time as having those regular community functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09110410000033">The third role of PCSOs is something that often surprises people, because it sounds slightly counter-intuitive. Quite a lot of police time is spent on activity that is not to do with combating criminal activity. For example, the police might be asked to help divert traffic following a road accident, but PCSOs are perfectly capable of performing that task, ensuring that more regular police officers are not taken away from other tasks. Somerset MPs know that at this time of year carnivals are very popular, and PCSOs have a role in ensuring that public safety is maintained when thousands of people come on to the streets to enjoy such community events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09110410000034">I remember once going on patrol with the Taunton town centre PCSOs. A child was lost, having turned round to find its parents gone during a shopping trip. Understandably, the parents were panicking. PCSOs, through their radio links and co-ordination with the CCTV operators, were able to locate the child and reunite child and parents. No criminal act had been committed. Some people would want the police out and about catching criminals, not performing that type of function, and PCSOs are ideally suited to such work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09110410000035">To summarise, people value the visibility of PCSOs and like them as part of a neighbourhood team with the regular police; and the police can have greater flexibility and perform more of a community role as a result of PCSOs working in concert with them. But because of the historic funding legacy-the PCSOs were brought in under the police umbrella but were not originally part of the police family-it has been recognised for some time that councils and others contribute to their funding. An agreement was made in 2008 between Somerset county council, Sedgemoor district council and Taunton Deane borough council to make a contribution to the funding of PCSOs in partnership with Avon and Somerset police. Sedgemoor and Taunton Deane have much smaller budgets so their contributions were relatively modest, at between £20,000 and £30,000 annually. However, Somerset county council agreed an annual contribution of £418,000, a substantial sum. Between them, the councils were funding an additional 17 PCSOs to work with local communities across Somerset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09110410000036">At the time of the agreement, the spokesperson for Somerset county council said:</p>
<a name="91103-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="09110410000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">"These three Councils have funded PCSO's because they recognise the improvements to community safety which can be achieved by PCSO's working at a local level."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para7"><a name="09110410000037">That is precisely the type of activity that I have mentioned, and the council cited others, including making our communities feel safer and reducing antisocial behaviour; reducing crime; limiting the damage caused by alcohol to our communities; preventing young people from entering the criminal justice system; safeguarding vulnerable people; and improving safety on Somerset roads. So the undertaking was given by Somerset county council and others to maintain funding to achieve those objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para8"><a name="09110410000038">It is in that context that I was genuinely shocked to discover that the new administration at Somerset county council had decided to make a cut of £129,000 in the budget for PCSOs from April 2010. That is a cut in the existing budget contribution of almost a third.-</p>

That appears to offer complete confirmation that those cuts are in no way fictitious. If they were, he would not need to support my campaign against his colleagues at county hall.</p>

People might have been entitled to expect that if there was a plan to cut the county council contribution to this important police community support work by almost a third, it would have been one of the issues that we discussed, in a grown-up and sensible way, at that election. The Conservatives could have said, "Here's our plan to slash the budget for PCSOs," and we could have had a debate about whether that was a good plan. The Conservatives clearly thought that people in Somerset would not be keen on the idea, which is why it was kept secret during the election campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para18"><a name="09110410000050">That is the type of feedback that I have been getting from people who are extremely concerned about the budget cuts proposed by the county council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09110410000051">I understand that all local authorities, and indeed central Government, face difficult budgetary issues. We are in a situation in which decisions will have to be made, and sometimes those decisions will not be popular. However, we must remember that the county council has just spent almost £50,000 on advertising to recruit a new chief executive. That, for me, represents an extraordinary priority, given that the budget for PCSOs is being cut. If the Conservatives in the council had decided that they would rather have a lower budget, they would, as I said, have been well-advised to put that proposal forward at the elections a few months ago.</p>

It is my view-I hope that it is the Minister's as well-that a cut of £129,000 in the annual Somerset county council contribution to Avon and Somerset police to fund PCSOs would be a backward step. It would make the public's understandable concerns about crime in Somerset all the more acute. I look forward to hearing his comments, therefore, and I hope that he will join me and say how strongly committed he is to neighbourhood policing.

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para23"><a name="09110410000056">The key point that has been put across today is that PCSOs have a vital role to play in neighbourhood policing. If I look, as I did only an hour ago, at the figures for the west Somerset basic command unit, which covers the hon. Gentleman's constituency, I see that there are clear advantages in driving down crime to be gained from police and police community support officers working together. Indeed, crime in the area that the hon. Gentleman represents has fallen by 6.2 per cent. over the past year, with vehicle crime falling by 22.4 per cent. If I may make a plug, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I got those figures from the crime map that we launched a couple of weeks ago which shows the position in every area and BCU area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para24"><a name="09110410000057">As part of the policing pledge, we want such engagement with the community. The hon. Gentleman made a strong case for the synergy between PCSOs and neighbourhood policing in driving down crime and increasing confidence. Indeed, confidence in policing has increased, and not just in Somerset but across England and Wales, from 45 per cent. a year ago to a record 50 per cent. in the last British crime survey two weeks ago, our target being 60 per cent. in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para25"><a name="09110410000058">That will have something to do with the record numbers of police officers in Somerset and elsewhere-Somerset now has 3,303 formal police officers, which is 314 more than in 1997-but it will also have a great deal to do with the focus of PCSOs, working alongside police officers, on tackling lower-level, but highly visible antisocial behaviour and other issues of high concern for the community at large. One of the main themes of the policing White Paper that we will bring forward shortly will be strengthening and embedding that role further, because it is only through effective partnership work between the police and police community support officers, working alongside councils such as Somerset and Taunton Deane, that we can make a difference on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para26"><a name="09110410000059">Funding is a key issue, but let me give some context. The Home Office is providing some £332 million to police authorities in the current financial year to support neighbourhood policing. That constitutes 70 per cent. of the funding for some 16,000 police community support officers nationwide. The Home Office now provides some £7.16 million of support for Avon and Somerset constabulary to ensure provision of 346 PCSOs, who are funded this year by that direct grant from this Labour Government. There are 381 PCSOs in Avon and Somerset constabulary overall. The difference between those figures-346 and 381-is because of funding such as that provided by Somerset county council and other agencies. Home Office funding increased last year by 2.7 per cent. and by a similar amount this year. In 2010-11, for the last year of this comprehensive spending review, we are committing to ensuring that that central Government support to fund the large bulk of PCSOs is in place for the future.</p>

The 346 PCSOs funded directly by this Government were funded last year, will be funded this year and will be funded next year, pending the CSR, which will take place after the general election whatever the outcome. That funding for neighbourhood policing is a central part of our partnership approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para28"><a name="09110410000061">For me personally, match funding and community buy-in to PCSOs are extremely important. That is why I have welcomed past commitments made by local authorities in the Avon and Somerset area to supporting those additional community support officers. I think that they represent very good value for money given the activities that they can undertake to prevent crime, build confidence, support communities and help to reduce crime on the ground. Partnership in policing is extremely important. If it does not exist, and if crime rises, local authorities such as those in Somerset will have to suffer the consequences, including more social dysfunction and difficulties on the streets. Those issues would affect the future budget headings of places such as Somerset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para29"><a name="09110410000062">The 11 neighbourhood police beat teams that operate in the Taunton constituency, and the PCSOs who support them, are extremely valuable in helping to drive down crime and, ultimately, reduce the burden on ratepayers as a consequence of that crime downstream.</p>

Gentleman's concern that Somerset county council is considering a reduction of some £129,000 in it funding for PCSOs from 1 April 2010. Like him, I have seen the newspapers and heard what colleagues representing other parts of Somerset have said about the fact that this is still a plan in progress. That is a matter for the council, as I have said. I was interested in what the hon. Member for Yeovil said about the cabinet papers, but I have to say that this is a decision for the council. I would, however, be disappointed-as would Avon and Somerset police-if that cut took place.</p>

 A point has just occurred to me, and I wonder whether the Minister can help me with it.

Would not that reduce yet further our ability to police Somerset properly?</p>

 My understanding is that it would, because those PCSOs would be employed by the police authority rather than the county council. I will check on that, however, and if need be, confirm it or otherwise after the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para31"><a name="09110410000066">I want to put this matter into context, because it is a serious issue relating to Somerset county council's contribution. I would be disappointed if it were to reduce that contribution. I know that the police authority would also be disappointed. I need to put this into context, however, because the £129,000 would equate to about 4.5 PCSOs from the present Avon and Somerset contingent of 381-346 of whom are funded centrally by the Home Office. So, while this is an important issue, I would not wish people in Avon and Somerset to think that the decision would lead to the loss of PCSOs on the ground in Somerset, or indeed in Taunton. The Home Office is committed to that funding and will continue that funding. We will ensure, as we have done to date, that the 346 are in place for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="91103-0023.htm_para32"><a name="09110410000067">The Avon and Somerset force faces considerable challenges to meet its joint police and local authority public confidence target, which is currently at 46 per cent., rising to a final target of nearly 60 per cent. by March 2012.

achieving that, and they will have a particular role to play in that regard. Any reduction in their numbers, outside the Home Office contribution, would be regretted, but I have to emphasise again that that is a matter for Somerset county council, and I hope that it will take on board what has been said in the House this evening.</p>
