 Since 1997, long-term youth claimant unemployment has fallen by over 70 per cent. Independent research published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research confirms that the new deal has contributed significantly to that improvement. It found that long-term youth unemployment would have been twice as high without the new deal foryoung people. As a result, the Department is spending &#163;5 billion per year less on unemployment benefits than in 1997.</p>

 We are looking to improve the delivery of services under the new deal and we will make announcements about that shortly, but there is no doubt that the new deal for young people has been a success, as I described. It has helped over 700 young people in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency. Without this Labour Government putting that investment in, they would have been looking at years of unemployment, as they did under the previous Conservative Government.</p>

The activity agreements that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget will help us, too. It is important, however, to keep the matter in context. In 1993, one in four 16 to 25-year-olds was not in education, employment or training. Now the figure is closer to one in six.</p>

 The first and perhaps most important thing that we can all do is to make sure that there is a strong and enduring consensus around the policy itself. I believe that that is the case after the excellent work that Lord Turner did. The key responsibility, of course, will be in this House. We have legislation to enact inthe next Session, as I said. It will be important thatthe personal accounts delivery authority, the new independent board that will be set up to oversee the introduction of the new policy, has the right remit and produces the right guidance, information and helpfor millions of workers who are not familiar with occupational pension schemes, but who, like many people in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, are keen to start saving. It is the responsibility of Ministers, the delivery authority and all of us in the House to continue to make the case for additional workplace savings.

 Does the Secretary of State agree that, alongside encouraging personal accounts, the Government must do all they can to keep good-quality defined benefit schemes in operation? If so, why have the Government chosen explicitly to ignore the recommendation of the Government Actuary in relation to the level of the contracted-out rebate that applies from April this year? Is not that decision essentially another back-door tax on pensions? Will the Secretary of State review that decision in April 2008, which the right hon.

 If we are to succeed in doing that&#151;as my hon. Friend and I both wish us to do&#151;we must continue the discussions that we are having with the pensions industry, employers and trade unions.

We can continue to ensure that the policy works in the way that my hon. Friend and I want by making sure that there is a cap on contributions, that there are restrictions on transfers in and that there is a simple scheme exemption process.

all subscribe to that idea. However, the point is that relationships break down, and it is then up to the separating couple to decide how they will maintain their relationship with the child or children. Some couples will do that voluntarily and others as a result of being forced to do so by an agreement that is arrived at in court. However, what should not happen is that a dispute between parents results in the child or children becoming a pawn in the settlement of maintenance. The two issues are linked, but in establishing a system of determining maintenance, it is important that they are not linked in the way in which the hon. Lady suggests.</p>

 I say to my hon. Friend respectfully that it is not a bad idea to consider that issue as part of the review and reform of the child support process. In doing so, will he consider the case of one of my constituents, Frances Lyttle, who has had a nightmare 10 years since her husband left her with two children? She was in court today, trying to resolve divorce issues. The Child Support Agency is absolutely incapable, and it is so inflexible that its actions are creating an injustice while the courts try to bring about a just settlement.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is, I think, talking about contact orders, which are not the responsibility of the Child Support Agency, nor will they be the responsibility of its successor body. She may be aware that the Government have already taken action in the Children and Adoption Act 2006 to try to reinforce contact orders. I repeat that we would not want a tussle between parents over contact to drag in the children and make them a pawn in the argument. That would not be right, which is why the issues are quite properly kept separate. The matter was reconsidered in the context of David Henshaw&#146;s review, and there was no consensus among the groups that were consulted for any change in the arrangements, which is why we have decided to persist with them.</p>

However, I hope he also recognises that we lifted the age barrier on entitlement to carer&#146;s allowance so that people could carry forward their entitlement to the allowance past the state pension age.

We lifted that to allow carers to claim the extra entitlement through pension credit that gives them an extra &#163;27.15 a week, to recognise the caring element of their work.

 The carer&#146;s allowance was introduced by a Labour Government in the 1970s as a recognition of carers&#146; commitment to their caring responsibilities. It was never intended to be a carer&#146;s wage, and that has rarely been challenged in this House. We want to look at the wider issues relating to support for carers and, as the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) allowed me to point out, we are working with carers organisations to look across the issues, not just at the benefits system. I reiterate that even carers who receive the full carer&#146;s allowance may earn up to &#163;87 a week, after deductions, to ensure that they enhance their income. We are working closely with carers organisations to examine the wider strategic issues relating to carers.</p>

 If the hon.

That is why we came to the view that there had to be a fresh start, and a different way of doing things and of offering a system of child maintenance. The scheme set out for the new commission is fundamentally different from that of the old CSA in many respects. The hon. Lady will see just how different the scheme is if she carefully studies the White Paper, the proposals and the Bill that is to be introduced shortly.

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0706042000183">I am absolutely delighted that, at last, after much debate in the other place, the Bill has finally reached this House. It is an especially important Bill because above all it puts consumer interests at the heart of legal services provision. The consumer focus, as the volume and nature of amendments in the other place show, was clearly forgotten during the Bill&#146;s long and drawn-out six-month passage there, so I now look forward to this House reacquainting the Bill with its real purpose.This is our opportunity to give voice to the needs and aspirations of consumers as opposed to providers of legal services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0706042000184">Before I deal with the Bill, let me pay tribute to Citizens Advice, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Consumer Council, the Office of Fair Trading and Which? and particularly to the members of those organisations who have worked tirelessly on the Government&#146;s consumer advisory panel to inform and shape the Bill and to ensure that it properly reflects the consumer interest. I am, of course, also gratefulto leaders and members of the legal profession who have welcomed our agenda for reform and who have engaged with the Government, sometimes very constructively, in the development of the Bill. I also want to acknowledge the hard work and foresight of Sir David Clementi, whose independent review and report in December 2004 set very solid foundation stones for our proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0706042000185">For too long, regulation of legal services has focused on the suppliers of those services at the expense of the consumer. It has been the consistent message from consumers, who have told us loud and clear&#151;as, indeed, did Sir David Clementi&#151;that their needs are simply not being met. In particular, they told us that they were not satisfied with the way that legal services were delivered, as the focus was on what suited the provider as opposed to the consumer; that they had lost confidence in self-regulation alone; and thattheir experiences of poor complaints handling had undermined their confidence in the system as a whole.</p>

Problems with the quality and speed of the handling of complaints about solicitors are well documented: it isa headline story, but it is not just a problem with theLaw Society. In fact, based on figures from the officeof the legal services ombudsman, we can see that a higher proportion of the total number of consumer <br>

complaints against barristers over the last three years were found to have been handled unsatisfactorily than when compared with complaints about solicitors.</p>

 I will just acknowledge that I am a barrister, though not a practising one. Would not the Minister accept, however, that if we look at the legal services ombudsman&#146;s annual reports of the Bar and how it deals with complaints, we find that it has been praised the whole way through, whereas when it comes to solicitors, the ombudsman actually fined the Law Society &#163;250,000?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right about the ombudsman&#146;s report, but my point is that while there are many more complaints against solicitors in comparison with the Bar, the percentage of complaints going from the Bar to the ombudsman is marginally higher than the number of complaints about solicitors going to the ombudsman. In other words, I do not believe that either house&#151;the Law Society or the Bar Council&#151;can afford to be complacent about their responses to consumers.</p>

 Does the Minister agree that the key thing that comes through from the deliberations of the other place about the Bar Council is clearly the self-interest of wanting to keep its independence? Does she further agree that, if we are to build confidence in the complaints procedure and also make it independent, the Bar Council must come within the remit of the legal complaints service?</p>

<p><a name="st_o129"><a name="0706042000190"><a name="70604-0004.htm_spnew14"><a name="0706042000533"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes the vital point that the only body to argue for the Bar Council to retain the right to deal with complaints is the Bar Council itself. I suppose that that tells us something about its response to the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="st_o130"><a name="0706042000191"><a name="70604-0004.htm_spnew15"><a name="0706042000534"><b>Mr. Heald:</b>
 Does not the hon. Lady recognise, however, that when the Bar Council disciplines someone, the people who do that work are barristers, who are effective in finding out exactly what happened in court or the circumstances of complex cases? The way in which they do that has been praised to me by, for example, Which? It would not be good if we lost those skills to wheedle out exactly what had happened in particular cases and punish those who had not met the standards.</p>

 Of course we should not lose those skills. I am sure that the office for legal complaints, to which I shall refer later, will be able to call in some of those skills should it feel it necessary to do so. Some33 per cent. of complaints dealt with by the Bar Council go to the legal services ombudsman, compared with about 10 per cent. of those dealt with by the Law Society. The point of the Bill is to reduce the numberof complaints made in either sector of the legal profession, so that the consumer gets a better deal.</p>

her divorce. There was a big question mark over whether barristers needed to be employed in the first place. Dealing with them separately would mean that one body would deal with the complaint against the solicitor, while the other, the Bar Council, would deal with the barrister. In that case, for example, would not it be common sense for one body to deal with the single complaint?</p>

<p><a name="st_o133"><a name="0706042000194"><a name="70604-0004.htm_spnew18"><a name="0706042000537"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. He is right: the purpose of the office for legal complaints is to have a one-stop shop to make a judgment as to who, if anyone, is at fault. Time and again, consumers have raised with me the issue that it is difficult for them to tell whether the fault is the solicitor&#146;s or the barrister&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0706042000195">To get beneath the skin of some of the less obvious issues, we have undertaken long, thorough researchand wide-ranging consultation. Concerns about the competitiveness of the sector began with the OFT&#146;s 2001 report, &#147;Competition in Professions&#148;. That identified a number of potentially unduly restrictive rules of the legal profession, which had the potential to drive up costs and prices, limit access and choice, reduce value for money, and inhibit innovation in the supply of services. To a Government committed to delivering a better deal for the consumer, that is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0706042000196">Following the OFT's report, the Government consulted publicly throughout 2002, and in July 2003 concluded that the current regulatory framework was</p>
<a name="70604-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0706042000369"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;outdated, inflexible, over-complex and insufficiently accountable or transparent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0706042000197">It was clear that the existing regulatory frameworkwas more like a &#147;regulatory maze&#148;, with a wide range of oversight regulators who had overlapping responsibilities and few clear objectives. The problems were not restricted to oversight regulators. The legal professional bodies contributed to the &#147;maze&#148; by failing to separate the exercise of their regulatory and representative functions. All of that drove the Government to the inescapable conclusion that reform was not only necessary but long overdue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0706042000198">We therefore immediately appointed Sir David Clementi and charged him with the task of identifying a new framework that would be independent in representing the public and consumer interest, comprehensive, accountable, consistent, flexible, transparent and no more restrictive or burdensome than is clearly justified. He published his report in December 2004. I want to put on record that he lived up to that challenge and produced an excellent report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70604-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0706042000199">The model that Sir David proposed was one of strong oversight regulation under which legal professional bodies would carry out day-to-day regulation provided they separated their regulatory and representative functions. He also proposed that there should be a clear set of statutory objectives and, importantly, that complaints handling should be taken away from the legal professions. The Government broadly accepted Sir David&#146;s recommendations and in October 2005 published the White Paper &#147;The Future of Legal Services: Putting Consumers First&#148;. I leave it to hon. Members to work out from the title exactly where the Government stand on the issue.</p>

Does the Minister accept the concern raised by the Joint Committee about the limited time given for it to consider what at that time were 159 clauses in the draft Bill, which has grown exponentially as the matter has been considered? Perhaps less time could have been given to the amendments if further time had been given to the Committee. Is there not a concern for Parliament that such a time limit has been extended to the Joint Committee on human embryo research? There is profound concern that we should give proper time for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

 One of the benefits of allowingthe Lord Chancellor to make the appointments isthat, as well as their being made independently of Government, there will be clear lines of accountability to Parliament. That is one of the reasons why we enshrined the functions in the Lord Chancellor rather than the Secretary of State. The fact that public appointments made by Ministers are subject to supervision by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, and to the commissioner&#146;s code of conduct, will help to ensure the board&#146;s independence. Another point that may give succour to my hon. Friend is that no Lord Chancellor would make such an appointment without paying attention to the views of others, including the Lord Chief Justice, consumer councils and others. Therefore, I am not minded to leave the clause in as it presently stands, but I will be happy to hear further representations about whether there is a more appropriate way for the Lord Chancellor to go about making appointments.</p>

self-inflicted scandal in relation to miners&#146; claims, particularly hearing loss claims? A claims handler called Vendside Ltd&#151;non-solicitors&#151;was allowed to bring forward claims on behalf of consumers, but the consumers then found that there were no regulatory powers in relation to any redress, other than using the civil courts.</p>

 My hon. Friend has been robust in his pursuit of Vendside and others over the appalling way in which they have handled matters with regard to his constituents. He, and others among our hon.

 The answer to that question is quite straightforward. If a trade union wishes to give other advice or to spread its wings more widely, it will have to be licensed. If the shop steward on the shop floor is giving advice to that union&#146;s members, I do not think it appropriate for it to have to be licensed. If it wants to go beyond that, it certainly would have to be licensed.</p>

As part of our investigations, the Trade and Industry Select Committee came across such a firm in India and in Brazil.

Although I understand why the Government are proceeding as they are, if the devil is in the detail, it is a matter of some concern that Members will see that detail only after we have decided whether to approve the Bill.

Alternative business structures, the office for legal complaints and so on will not be up and running until 2010-11. In the period before the legal services board and the OLC are set up, the details will be considered, and there will be an opportunity for everyone to see them.

 I do not think that &#163;20,000 is a high enough limit. May I give the Minister an example? Mrs. X, from Stanley in my constituency, recently complained to me about a firm of solicitors called Mark Gilbert Morse, which handled a miners&#146; compensation case on her behalf and rejected an offer of &#163;42,000 from the DTI without even consulting her. Subsequently the offer was reduced, and it was only through the legal services complaints service that we shamed the company into paying her the original figure of &#163;42,000. If it had been pinned down at &#163;20,000, my constituent would have lost in excess of &#163;22,000.</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point, which is why the Bill allows for the amount to be increased. We set it at &#163;20,000, which is still above the Law Society&#146;s present level of &#163;15,000, which was increased only recently. It will be not for me but for the OLC to determine whether to recommend that the amount be increased.</p>

 No doubt the matter will be gone into in more detail in Committee. However, is the Minister aware of the significant number of services awards for miners&#146; compensation claims which solicitors appear not to have put in for, and which, on the balance of probabilities, are all liable to be higher than &#163;20,000? They include the case of one of my constituents, in which the solicitors concerned had to pay back &#163;23,000. Many such detailed potential claims will go forward as complaints against solicitors, and all are liable to be in excess of &#163;20,000. Should not that figure be reconsidered at this stage, to avoid the absurdity of having to change it within days of the Bill becomingan Act?</p>

 Yes. As I said, under part 3 we will exempt the trade unions when they provide services to their members. However, when lawyers&#151;perhaps in-house lawyers&#151;employed by trade unions provide reserved activities, they will be regulated in exactly the same fashion as any other lawyer. I was talking about lay members of trade unions who give advice in their workplace. Lawyers who are employed by trade unions will be regulated in the same manner as any lawyer working in any other firm.</p>

 No, that is not what I am saying. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman&#146;s lack of knowledge of the trade union movement is rising to the surface. The work that lay officials of trade unions do on behalf of their members, whether in employment tribunals and elsewhere, is generally of a very high quality. I do not want trade union members to be any less well-off than anyone else, and I want to ensure that they are not. We have been working with the TUC and the Law Society to deal with that matter, and I think that we have agreed an appropriate way forward.</p>

Before the Minister goes on to discuss the OLC&#146;s objectives, will she pay at least some tribute to the midlands-based Legal Complaints Service?

 No, the hon. Gentleman is wrong. We have accepted a number of amendments in the House of Lords. For example, we have agreed that the public interest is different from the consumer interest. We have substituted the term &#147;Lord Chancellor&#148; for &#147;Secretary of State&#148;. We have amended the threshold for action on financial penalties. We have accepted the requirement for the ABS licensing authorities to issue policy statements. We have given the board a specific duty to cover ABS in its annual report. We have accepted a number of consumer-focused amendments, a power for ombudsmen to enforce the determination on a complainant&#146;s behalf, and a narrowing of the circumstances in which complainants can be ordered to pay costs, and so on. We have accepted a number of amendments that were proposed in the Lords, and I pay tribute to my noble Friend Baroness Ashton, who worked very closely with others in the Lords in getting the Bill to its current position.</p>

However, it is also vital that lawyers should be free to act for their clients without Government interference. The Government should not be able to use consumer rights as a cloak to attack people&#146;s basic civil liberty of having a genuinely independent lawyer acting on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70604-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0706042000280">Legal services make up a major economic sector that is valued at about &#163;20 billion and they generate almost 2 per cent. of the UK&#146;s gross domestic product. It is estimated that UK legal services exports amount to&#163;2 billion a year. London is a major centre for international commercial litigation and arbitration, and English law is widely used as the basis for many international business transactions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70604-0006.htm_para15"><a name="0706042000281">The legal profession is large. There are 14,000 practising barristers, 97,000 practising solicitors, thousands of legal executives and hundreds of licensed conveyers, registered trade mark attorneys and public notaries. Not-for-profit organisations such as citizens advice bureaux and law centres also provide much-needed legal advice. An independent legal profession provides legal services to some of the most vulnerable in our society. Indeed, many lawyers enter the profession with a vocation to help to right wrongs. It is an important check on government that lawyers in Britain will take on public authorities and the Government in court without fear or favour, often in cases that are not popular with the public. Indeed, it was reported only today that prisoners were taking the Lord Chancellor to court to ask not to sit around in prison idly all day, but to be able to work purposefully towards their rehabilitation.</p>

Surely that scandal shows that self-regulation involving the Law Society has not worked and that people need the protection offered by the Bill to get legal redress from such lawyers.</p>

 Yes, I agree absolutely. The hon.

However, he and the Government must recognise that having a strong legal profession, independent of Government, is an important constitutional issue and improvements to the regulation of the legal profession should respect that. It is not in the consumer interest to have Government control over lawyers, because many consumers of legal services are taking cases against public authorities and the Government.</p>

However, I would say that the area of most concern was how consumer complaints against solicitors were being dealt with. There were concerns about efficiency and the overlapping powers of the oversight bodies. Sir David described the current regime as</p>
<a name="70604-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="0706042000377"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;outdated, inflexible, over-complex and insufficiently accountable or transparent&#148;,</p>

It seems odd that today the Minister has said that it would be all right for a trade union official who is not a lawyer to appear in court, to give legal advice and to carry out other activities associated with the work of a lawyer and there would be no regulation of that person, but someone who works for a law centre or citizens advice bureau would be regulated. That may be something that trade union leaders want, but trade union members should not be treated in that second-class manner. Trade union members are consumers every bit as much as any other person and I believe that they should be treated equally.

able to do that. The Bill will protect trade union members because if a union offers reserved legal services, those services must be carried out by qualified lawyers, who will be subject to regulation by an approved regulator. The exemption applies only where the union provides legal services by virtue of membership, and not in any wider sense. I hope that the hon.

I have on many occasions attended tribunals where there has been a trade union official&#151;often, I must say, expert in the law&#151;on the other side with a right of audience. If she looks at clause 12, she will see that the reserved legal activities are set out there. They include exercising rights of audience, conducting litigation and giving legal advice in connection with any of the activities listed.

There were only two sets of proceedings that I used to appear in: one was industrial tribunals, and the other was county court proceedings, in which anyone can represent themselves. In terms of the scope of the legal services, one has to be legally qualified to represent people at a higher level&#151;for example, if a case goes to appeal.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will see in the Bill the list of activities for which, if undertaken by a trade union official, there should be no regulation. Yet if a person from a citizens advice bureau did one of those activities, the situation would be different. There are tribunals where trade union officials appear, but of course he is right that not every tribunal would allow that to happen. I do not see why members of a trade union should not have the protection that the Bill would give someone from the citizens advice bureau or a law centre doing the same work. We can pursue the subject further in Committee, but that position seems to be all of a piece with the exemption that applied to trade unions as regards their activities as claims handlers. My view on that is that what is good for one group of people doing a particular job should be good for all groups that do that job.</p>

The Committee found that the Bill gave the Secretary of State too much power, and recommended that that should be re-examined. It also expressed concern about alternative business structures, highlighting the potential for conflicts of interest, and about access to justice. It felt that the office for legal complaints should be not just a &#147;rebrand&#148;, but a genuinely new start, particularly for complaints relating to solicitors. In that connection, how does the Minister justify simply moving the office to Coventry from Leamington Spa&#151;a move that is deliberately designed to ensure that the very staff whose work has been criticised would continue to deal with complaints against solicitors&#151;and how can she assure us that that constitutes something good for the future that will tackle the problems that have bedevilled that part of the law since the 1980s?</p>

should be reconsideration of the Secretary of State&#146;s role. In the other place, the Government tabled amendments that dealt with many of those issues, but given the issues on which they lost votes, whether the amendments were tabled by a Cross Bencher, a Liberal Democrat or a Conservative, they seem rather unbending if the Minister&#146;s tone today is anything to judge by. That is a pity, because the process has been relatively co-operative and progress has been made. For example, an amendment was passed that meant that the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s concurrence would be required before the appointment by the Lord Chancellor of the chairman of the board. That was a means of securing for the board some independence from Government. The Minister&#146;s comments suggest that she has some sympathy with that idea, although she has made it clear that the Government will reverse that decision. We must find a way that ensures that it would not be possible for the Lord Chancellor to appoint friends of his to the board without any check. It would be intolerable and unprecedented if it was possible to put friends of the Labour party or friends of the Lord Chancellor on the board, and that would not give us the independent, free legal profession that we are entitled to expect in this country.

Under the former arrangements, the Lord Chancellor used to span both pillars: he was part of the Executive and the most senior judge. However, it seems appropriate that under the new arrangements there should be appointments by the Executive, but with the concurrence of, after consultation with, this very important figure in the other pillar. Let us not forget that the legal profession gives us our judges, so if it was not truly independent, that would have very worrying implications for our constitution. By having the most senior judge involved in the process, the constitutional position would be subject to a proper check. That is my view, although I am willing to accept that there may be other ways in which to achieve the objective and that we can discuss the matter further in Committee. However, doing nothing is not acceptable and simply reversing the amendment would be intolerable.</p>

 That is better than nothing&#151;we would be prepared to debate it. However, there is little to criticise in consulting the most senior judge. The Under-Secretary said that she did not want to do that because it gives consumer groups the wrong impression. However, if it is the right thing to do, surely we should do it.</p>

Is not it a concern that there is little on the face of the Bill to guarantee independence? There is no guarantee, beyond the Under-Secretary&#146;s assurances, that the appointments process will follow Nolan principles. The independence, accountability and openness that Nolan guarantees is not enshrined in the Bill.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes the point clearly. I agree that he outlines a concern. We should not trifle with the legal profession&#146;s independence, which is as important as the consumer interest. They are both important principles, which need to be respected. Indeed, the Government have accepted that because they included the public as well as the consumer interest in the Bill. That was the right decision, but further work remains to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70604-0007.htm_para6"><a name="0706042000320">The other place made changes to the ground on which the board could take action against an approved front-line regulator and to clarify that the board is to act only as a supervisory regulator. The Under-Secretary said that she wanted to refine that. Does she mean a drafting change or a substantive change to what was agreed in the other place? Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar, could comment on the matter in her winding-up speech. If the regulator is only supervisory and acts as a backstop, that is clearly what Clementi proposed and what we all expect. However, if the Under-Secretary intends to change the Lords proposal, it is important to know the exact reason for that because the protection is important.</p>

The Under-Secretary says that she wishes to overturn those changes, but does not she agree that the Clementi model is that of a supervisory regulator and that the provisions will set the tone for whether regulation is light touch or heavy handed? I understand that she has examined various ways in which to suggest appropriate intervention and I welcome her proposal to reconsider ensuring that the oversight nature of the board is included in the Bill. May I invite her to continue in Committee the search for the right words to describe the threshold for intervention? Heavy-handed regulation is in no one&#146;s interests&#151;I know that she agrees.</p>

They responded positively to protecting and promoting the public interest in the regulatory objectives. Limits were placed on the discretion of the office for legal complaints, and that is welcome. However, the other place made a change to provide that charges for the complaints process should not be levied when the complaint was unfounded and the matter was handled properly in-house. I understand that the Under-Secretary proposes to abandon the principle that the innocent do not pay for a complaint against them and that the polluter pays. I find that surprising given that she said that she agreed with the thinking behind the amendment in the other place. Surely there is a compromise to be found there: if she agrees with us, surely we can find words to express that agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70604-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0706042000323">Lord King also persuaded their lordships of the need to delegate complaints handling to an improved regulator by direction of the board.

An amendment was passed in the other place whereby the licensor has to make an investigation of the access to justice implications when determining an application to become an alternative business. If the Minister accepts that that is a vital issue&#151;that is what she said&#151;and if she is happy that her proposals will not damage access to justice, why does she object to the amendment? She seems determined to reverse something that simply provides for what she claims to want, so perhaps she can find some way of squaring that circle, too.

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70604-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0706042000326">The Joint Committee noted that the public interest and the consumer interest do not always equate, particularly in matters of law, and it is good thatthe Bill now reflects both interests and that the Government have agreed that it should do so. Although it is vital for consumers to be able to remedy wrongs done to them by lawyers, it is also important that they have access to lawyers who are independentof the Government so that they can pursue the Government for the wrongs that they do. There is therefore no conflict between protecting the consumer and protecting the independence of lawyers. A fair and just system works to the benefit of all. Indeed, it is very much in the public interest. We believe that it is vital to consumers to protect access to justice. Legal services are sometimes commercial in nature, but they often amount to an important part of the welfare state.</p>

As the Minister knows, that is a classic area for burying one&#146;s mistakes because problems often come to light after the death of the person who made the will. Some standards should be set, but I am not suggesting that only solicitors should be able to write wills. In some ways, this area falls into the same category as claims handlers, so perhaps the Minister will consider whether similar provisions should apply.</p>

When an injustice is prevented or put right later, and the case attracts a lot of attention, it is noticeable that the person who was the victim of the injustice&#151;or about to be threatened with it&#151;turns to their legal team and expresses their heartfelt thanks for their skill and dedication in defending them. It is important to bear that in mind, and to preserve the talent and success of legal services in our country.

Often, consumers think that the system lacks independence, and that it looks as though lawyers are judging their friends&#151;other lawyers. In many cases, the processes of dealing with complaints are far too slow. All that adds to an air of dissatisfaction, which has led to the pressure for change from consumer groups. If we also take into account doubts about the openness to competition of legal services, investigated by the Office of Fair Trading in 2001, we start to see the powerful case for change.</p>

The various professional bodies have appeared to act in silos&#151;barristers, solicitors, legal executives and the like. It has not even been possible for different legal disciplines to form businesses together. Clearly, if it is not possible even for different kinds of lawyers to form businesses together, it has not been possible for different kinds of professionals to form businesses together and provide services in one business unit. If neither of those are possible, it is certainly beyond the pale at present for a banking or retail business to offer legal services with common owners and managers.</p>

For the financial services sector, the FSA was created to be a single, powerful regulator. In the case of legal services, however, Sir David came up with a design of greater subtlety. He recognised that thereis value in continuing to utilise the expertise of professional bodies such as the Bar Council, the Law Society and so on. He made it clear, however, that they could not continue to act as representative and regulator at the same time. For the professional bodies to be regulators, he said that they must effect a  <br>

complete separation of the two roles. The Government accept that proposition and, through the Bill, envisage that front-line regulators will be formed out of existing professional bodies. In fairness to those professional bodies, they have not waited for the Bill to become law to act. Most recently, both the Bar Council and the Law Society have separated out their regulatory arms and made them more independent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0706042000335">To provide oversight and knit together a seamless, consistent regulatory regime, Sir David also recommended, as the Government accepted too, that an overarching legal services board should be established. The danger of that approach is the inherent duplication of two regulators where one might otherwise suffice: perhaps the legal services board second-guessing the front-line regulator; perhaps one regulator being played off against another; perhaps gaps opening up in regulation because each of the two regulators thought that the other was acting in a particular situation; and certainly, a danger of two sets of costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0706042000336">Achieving an effective value-for-money regulatory system through the structure of front-line regulators and the legal services board requires us to give careful attention to the architecture of regulation and the powers and duties of the different regulators. In the case of the legal services board, it needs to be small, light touch and strategic, with the power to act decisively when called on. In the case of the front-line regulators, they need to be allowed the freedom to operate effectively within their spheres of operation. Even with that balancing act successfully established, there is still the tricky business of identifying when and in what circumstances the legal services board must intervene if a front-line regulator is failing&#151;what should be regarded as a sufficiently serious failure to warrant intervention by the board. My advice is that decisions about the timing and manner of an intervention&#151;be it a public reprimand or fines, through to the most serious power of withdrawing authorisation from the front-line regulator&#151;should be guided by the best interests of the relevant consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0706042000337">Handling complaints relating to legal services is often separate from, but obviously relevant to, the regulation of legal services. As Sir David recommended, the Bill establishes an independent office for legal complaints. The intention is that there will be a single point of contact for all aggrieved consumers of legal services. Where complaints relate solely to poor service, the office for legal complaints will be able to investigate, conciliate and determine the complaints. It can order redress, the equivalent in the legal services area of what the financial services ombudsman scheme does in the financial services sector. Where the complaint points to potential professional misconduct, the front-line regulator&#151;for example, the Solicitors Regulation Authority for solicitors&#151;takes over. In reality, however, many complaints will not neatly fall one side or the other of such a divide. There will, therefore, be a need for co-operation between the regulators and a free flow of information.</p>

and who have fallen short in their duties professionally. That would provide an alternative route to taking each case to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal, which the authority thinks should be retained for the more severe cases. Hearing about the delay in cases coming before that tribunal, I can well see that it would be desirable for some of the less serious cases to be dealt withby different routes. The other representation fromthe Solicitors Regulation Authority refers to sole practitioners, with the authority wanting to be able to regulate sole practitioners in the same way as a business entity, to prevent there being a possible gap in the regulation between the two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0706042000339">The aim is for the office for legal complaints to be the one clear place to take complaints, offering a quick, fair and accessible way to put matters right, and ensuring transparency and independence both for consumers who make complaints and for the legal service providers who are being complained against. Alternative business structures have the capacity to transform the landscape for the delivery of legal services in England and Wales. Parliament&#146;s role in defining the arrangements will be crucial: too little detail, and loopholes will open up to render regulation ineffective; too much detail, and regulation may be overbearing, complex and costly. Consider the difficulties that arise when one business organisation provides a range of services, each of which is currently separately regulated. Who will license the business to provide the legal services? Will there be one lead regulator? If so, how will the one be chosen above the others? Will different regulators have in place agreed common approaches to the exercise of their respective powers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0706042000340">Such concerns led the Joint Committee, of which I was a member, to propose a step-by-step approach to introducing different forms of alternative business structure. However, evidence that I have seen since the Committee reported leads me to think that that is too strict a way of dealing with the problem. I have in mind, first, evidence from the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys and the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys. Admittedly, they are small in terms of their membership and operate in niche markets, but nevertheless they have considerable expertise andsome international significance. They already have experience of mixed-practice firms, and they say that such a structure can operate without adverse effects on consumer interests. I am also impressed by the briefing that Members received for the debate from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which argues convincingly&#151;in my view&#151;that some multi-professional businesses which bring together lawyers and professionals such as accountants and surveyors offer considerable benefit to consumers, along with low risk for regulators.</p>

consumers retain their present ability to choose between providers, or will that choice be reduced?The Bill&#151;rightly, in my opinion&#151;requires the Legal Services Board to have regard to that issue. One of the regulatory objectives is &#147;improving access to justice&#148;.</p>

She referred specifically to the requirement for research to be carried out before the first licences could be issued. I agree with her that that goes too far, but I think it right to require the Legal Services Board to monitor the operation of alternative business structures in the market, to evaluate the effect on the market of the first issues of licences, and to consider, following that monitoring and evaluation, whether and at what pace to grant further licences in the future.</p>

I ask the Minister to consider carefully, as the costs continue to rise, whether it is fair to expect only legal professionals to bear that burden, given that some elements of today&#146;s supervision are paid for by public funds.</p>

Clause 1 sets out what the legal services of this country should be about. In parenthesis, I am going to have a slight carp. I always have a complaint about the way in which Bills are set out. It is frustrating that even now Bills are not written in the ways in which the public read things. To start a Bill with definitions, without saying whom one is defining and who has that obligation, strikes me as the wrong way around. I hope that we will be able to tidy that up, so that the Bill starts by saying, &#147;This Bill sets up the legal services board&#148;&#151;that comes in clause 2&#151;&#147;which has responsibility for making sure that the following are achieved&#148;, and then sets out the objectives.

We all wish that more people would end up going to organisations such as mediation centres and ACAS, rather than to lawyers. One of the frustrations in our world is that we are producing a society in which people have increasingly to use lawyers. It is a reflection of the sort of society that we live in that the number of lawyers and accountants&#151;those who make legal and financial interpretations&#151;increases but the number of people who actually make things decreases. However, the fact is that there are more lawyers and there is more law&#151;not least because we pass more law.</p>

recent years we have, for example, taken complaints against the police out of the hands of the police, and I strongly supported that; that is a public service and police officers are public servants and they should not investigate themselves. There is a halfway house in respect of doctors&#151;how to deal with them was controversial for a long period. Doctors are generally independent but are contracted to the state. The body that regulates them is the General Medical Council&#151;and there are similar bodies for nursing and dentistry. Therefore people working in the NHS&#151;paid for with public money&#151;are regulated by part-independent organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para22"><a name="0706042000363">The question in the current debate is how to deal with lawyers. The hon. Member for Stafford made the point that a few years ago we addressed the same question in relation to the financial services industry, which is a private sector industry. We asked whether it should just be left to regulate itself, or if there should be some form of legislative control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para23"><a name="0706042000364">We are asking ourselves the same question in this debate. There is a sound logical argument&#151;especially for someone who is a liberal by conviction&#151;that we should allow the market and those working in this field to regulate themselves. However, it is clear that that is unsatisfactory in relation to the public. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and others have pointed out over the years how unsatisfactory that has been. People abused their private-market position. Therefore we as a nation&#151;or the nations of England and Wales in this instance&#151;have come to the conclusion that we need a regulatory system.</p>

Member for Bassetlaw made it indirectly in relation to miners&#146; compensation claims. It has often been the case&#151;and it frequently remains the case, I think&#151;that when people go to find a lawyer they do not know the professional qualification of the person with whom they end up dealing. People have often said to me, &#147;I went to see a solicitor&#148; when they did not see a solicitor; instead, they might have seen a legal executive or a clerk, or someone in training. I hope that we will address how to ensure that everyone who practices these professions or works in their organisations must identify their status and qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70604-0008.htm_para25"><a name="0706042000366">That point is of relevance to the following conundrum, which has already been posed. If someone goes to a legal firm and they are dealt with by a person who is not a solicitor&#151;by a clerk or legal executive, perhaps&#151;and that person then instructs a member of the Bar, who is by definition independent, and the case then goes wrong, who takes responsibility? To be blunt, the solicitor&#146;s firm&#151;the senior partner or managing partner&#151;should take responsibility for all their staff, and in the past the Bar Council would have taken responsibility for the discipline of its member.</p>

However, we need to make sure that people know who they are dealing with. It is therefore right that when people want to complain,  <br>

That was not too long a period, and I am extremely grateful that the Bill did start in the Lords. The Lords did a fantastic amount of work on it, and as the Minister said in answer to one of my interventions, the work done with her noble Friend Baroness Ashton, who was very helpful, in the end produced an agreement toamend the Bill. Many of the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations were accepted, and I pay tribute to colleagues who worked to make sure than the Bill is much better than when it started.</p>

The Minister rather cleverly avoided a direct answer to my earlier intended direct question. Where there were votes in the Lords and the Government were defeated&#151;according to my calculations, there were seven of those&#151;we Liberal Democrats and, I think, the Conservatives, by and large, believe that the Lords made the right decision. Such amendments were sometimes proposed by independent, Cross-Bench Members of the Lords, sometimes by Conservatives and sometimes by Liberal Democrats, and they were all moves in the right direction.</p>

For example, he said the following on Second Reading about the alternative business structures proposal:</p>
<a name="70604-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07060412000069"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are widespread worries about conflicts of interest, which will&#151;not may&#151;be created if Ministers press ahead with the ABS reforms.

The provisions in the Bill are very weak and will have to be strengthened considerably, but that will be a matter for Committee stage.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6 December 2006; Vol. 687, c. 1181.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70604-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07060412000008">On Third Reading, where the Lords supported an amendment providing a sunrise clause and other provisions for ABSs, Lord Hunt said:</p>
<a name="70604-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="07060412000070"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;My Lords, I should explain how strongly I support Amendments Nos. 3 and 13. It was the unanimous view of the Select Committee that amendments should be tabled,</p>

We should work on the basis that that is the right starting place, and that the burden is on the Government to make the case for any changes. I am troubled that the Minister appears in most cases to be rejecting such amendments completely, and in one or two cases to be saying that she will reject them at least in part. I hope that there will be a debate on that, and that we can win the argument. If we do, I hope that the Government will be flexible and will not stubbornly hold on to a position that clearly did not win the confidence of the other place.</p>

They therefore, for example, have an obligation to ensure that there is no conflict of interest, and an obligation not to state things that they know to be untrue. <i> [Interruption.] </i>That is the professional obligation. One may be given instructions that sound incredible, but one has to put the case, because that is the way in which the adversarial system works. One is certainly not allowed to put forward something that one knows to be untrue, or something that reveals a conflict of interest without it being public.

A tally was made of the Secretary of State&#146;s powers: it started off at 100 and ended up at 288. However eminent the Minister and however grand their title&#151;such as Lord Chancellor, which goes with the title of Minister of Justice under the new system&#151;we should ensure that decisions are made not only by the Government.</p>

 I think that I understand the legal services complaints system quite well. Will the hon. Gentleman explain what costs are placed on a solicitors firm that is being complained about?

 The Government&#146;s proposal, which is generally supported, is that there should be a legal services board, which will be a new organisation.

 That is an entirely separate debate, but certain costs are met&#151;for example, those associated with certification officers&#151;and other regulatory agencies are also part-funded by the taxpayer.

 I am anxious to follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point because he speaks as though public input into the costs and the problem of firms bearing the cost of vexatious litigants with nuisance applications are almost the same thing. As configured before the Lords amendment, the LSB will have discretion&#151;it will no doubt exercise it properly, subject to judicial review&#151;over whether it awards costs against the firm. That point was satisfactory before the amendment. The hon.

 I absolutely understand that point. We have debated how we do not want a health service in which people go to their general practitioner to get referred for an X-ray, for example, and are then shuttled between 19 different providers, even though they are getting one service. Of course, some local solicitors might not have the competence to deal with matters that are beyond their expertise, yet do not say so. The situation has improved because solicitors can now say what their expertise is and it is easier for people to work out the solicitors who are specialists in such areas as family law.

There is a danger that big companies will cherry-pick the easier work for bigger profits, while the less fashionable and straightforward cases will go to the wall. That is why we strongly support the amendment that says that access to justice should be a special considerationwhen granting business structure licences and the amendment that states that there will need to be a review.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about access to justice, but why should people in rural communities get a second-class service because their firm of solicitors is a cosy family firm with no expertise in some matters? I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is wrong that solicitors say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, but I&#146;m not expert in this, so can you go somewhere else?&#148; Instead, they take cases on, and people who do not understand the way in which solicitors operate think that they are getting a good service when they clearly are not. The hon. Gentleman is deluding himself if he thinks that small family firms in rural communities are turning people away when they do not have relevant expertise. They take the cases on and the clients become disappointed in the long term when they find that they are getting a poor service.</p>

 I am not generalising at all. There are some extremely good local firms of solicitors that deal competently with the work with which they can deal and take on work that others might not because of their loyalty to a community and its residents. Such solicitors will often and perfectly reasonably send off work that they are not competent to carry out to a colleague or another firm. There may be firms&#151;I am sure there are&#151;that seek to do work that they are not competent to do. What I know is this: if small firms are faced with competition from a catch-all company that does everything&#151;insuring clients from the cradle to the grave and providing legal services for everything, allegedly&#151;that underprices and takes the business, the result will be that some of those firms are no longer viable. When those smaller firms have gone, if the big international provider decides not to have an outletin that village, town or city, there is nothing to takeits place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07060412000051">That is the danger of the predatory market and it is the reason why, in a capitalist society, checks and balances are always necessary. That is why, in this debate, the big issue is what the correct balances are. Yes, we need a more customer-oriented, consumer-oriented service; but, no, we do not need an untrammelled free market that suddenly says that everybody can come, irrespective of tradition, practice, competence and so on. Let us proceed carefully&#151;the amendments made in the Lords allow us to do that. They do not prevent alternative business structures; instead, they say that we should proceed carefully and in a way that protects the best and protects access to justice. That is the test. This is a justice Bill and the outcome should be judged by whether it gives best access to justice and legal services in the smallest villages and the biggest cities in our land.</p>

Members on both sides of the House agree that the consultation process has been very thorough, and I think that part of the reason for that agreement across the House is that the majority of participants in the debate have a legal connection. The ad hoc Committee comprised&#151;not entirely, but largely&#151;people with legal backgrounds. Not all but most of those who contributed to the debate in the other place have legal backgrounds, and so far a high proportion of those who have contributed to today&#146;s debate have legal backgrounds, or have operated with non-legal qualifications.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important and valuable point, which underlines my next observation, which is that had the consultation process been so dominated by representatives of consumer organisations, we might have a rather different Bill and heard different comments today. Notwithstanding the praise that has been given, we have to recognise that overall, the debate has been legally driven and legally dominated. It is interesting that those who have been so complimentary toward the ad hoc Committee are largely solicitors and lawyers who agree with those who participated in the Committee. The amendments that have been accepted are those that were proposed by them, and they have been complimented by them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07060412000056">My perspective is that of a non-lawyer consumer. Listening to the debate, I have at times felt like an atheist at a Council of Churches debate, because the nature of this debate has been arcane and sometimes almost theological. I do not pretend to understand all the arcane structures and processes of the legal services industry, but I have a general understanding, from a consumer&#146;s perspective, of how that industry appears not to be meeting the needs and concerns of the general public. I hesitated to speak at first, but then I thought that, as a representative of constituents who are mainly on low incomes and do not readily run to the courts, I am perhaps better placed, and in some respects better qualified, to participate than are some others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07060412000057">My constituents have little confidence in the law. There is a pervading suspicion of lawyers, and given the cases that have been brought to me, I can understand that. That feeling was reinforced in me three or four years ago, during the Carter review of legal aid, when I was asked to attend a meeting of solicitors in Birmingham. When I got there, I was stuck on a chair in front of a great group of solicitors and told that the big issue in my constituency was the absence of legal aid. I was puzzled, and my response to that statement was fairly robust. I said that I had been an MP for four or five years and had held hundreds of surgeries, but not one person had come to me to complain about the inability to get legal aid. However,  <br>

<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>4 Jun 2007 : Column 63</b><br>
many people had come to me to complain about the services that they had received from solicitors. Needless to say, that did not go down too well. What struck me was the ability of the profession to redefine self-interest as public interest. That experience clearly demonstrated to me how exclusive the profession was, and how it perceived the outside world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07060412000058">As I see it, there are two big issues: first, lack of accountability, and secondly, cost. Reference has been made to the number of complaints that have been dealt with unsatisfactorily by the Bar Council and the Law Society. One third of Bar Council complaints endedup with the ombudsman, as did more than 17,000 complaints made to the Law Society. There is a general feeling that complaints are being judged and determined by members of the legal profession, and that they run a closed shop. Looking at the number of complaints and given the prevailing perception that there is little point in complaining, I cannot help but wonder how many complaints there would be if we had a process that commanded public trust.</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="07060412000059"><a name="70604-0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="07060412000107"><b>Mr. Jones:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the biggest problems is that many people do not know how to complain about the poor service that they get from some solicitors?</p>

 I agree absolutely. Many people in areas such as the one that I represent want as little as possible to do with solicitors. They do not know how to complain and they do not believe that they will get value for money, so they avoid solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07060412000061">The one time when the great majority have some association with the legal profession is, of course, when they buy a house. I shall not bore the House by repeating the litany of complaints that I have heard about the service that people have had from solicitors carrying out conveyancing on their houses. I am sure that other hon. Members have had similar experiences. I would summarise the complaints by saying that they relate to slowness, lack of response to telephone calls, and indifference to the stress of purchasing a house and to the implications of slowness on the part of the legal profession. I am the first to accept that there are many dedicated solicitors who take a professional approach, but overall the perception is that there is a culture within the profession that is not responsive or accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07060412000062">There has been a lot of debate about the independence of the legal services board. Other key regulatory organisations&#151;the Financial Services Authority and the Office of Fair Trading, among others&#151;have independent chairmen appointed bythe Lord Chancellor or by other members of the Government. The funny thing is that when the appointment is made, the debate is always about whether the chairman will be independent, but once the person is appointed, the nature of the debate usually changes. We start hearing people complain, &#147;Why don&#146;t the Government interfere in the decisions being taken by that independent organisation?&#148; That is a reflection of the fact that the process is legitimate, robust and can be trusted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07060412000063">I shall talk briefly about whether regulation should be light-touch or heavy-handed. In an ideal world,we would want light-touch regulation, and that is appropriate when there are regulatory organisations that function appropriately. However, if they are not functioning appropriately, light-touch regulation is no good. There has to be the capacity to be more intrusive if the regulatory bodies do not deliver according to their purpose. Although I certainly subscribe to the principle that regulation should be light-touch, it must also be appropriate. I hope that when the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), devises the regulations, there will be a process to make sure that the level of regulation is appropriate to the effectiveness of the organisation being regulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07060412000064">Another issue to consider is cost, which in turn is affected by competition. That brings me on to the so-called alternative business structures. I have never understood why only lawyers can employ other lawyers; that strikes me as the ultimate in restrictive practices. To take up and extend a point made bymy hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), if that practice was applied in other contexts&#151;for example, in relation to trade unions&#151;there would be a reaction against it. It is quite possible for single practices, or groups of practices, comprising excellent lawyers to have a deficient business organisation. A practice that delivers a very good legal service might carry out that service in a far more cost-effective manner if it were organised differently and were subject to more business discipline&#151;and that way, it would get far more public support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07060412000065">I have listened to the objections to the alternative business structures, and they fall into a number of categories. One objection is that companies will cherry-pick cases. Looking back to the Carter review, and issues to do with the cost of legal aid, the argument for extending funding for legal aid, and against some of the Carter proposals, was that companies were cherry-picking and were no longer providing legal aid, and legal aid deserts were being created. These issues are by no means new. I would argue that opening up the profession to competition from other organisations will force companies to look again at their business practices and to deliver a service more effectively and cheaply, thereby possibly making legal aid more profitable. Of course, that would enable other organisations with tried and tested business practices to use them to deliver the same service more cheaply. The point needs to be made that there are organisations, such as those in the co-operative movement, that have found a market niche through ethical trading and targeting communities that have hitherto been marginalised or excluded. If those organisations took part in providing legal services, it is hardly likely that they would adopt the practices that some hon. Members have criticised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07060412000066">I agree that the change will have to be monitored. Obviously, whenever a market is opened up competitive advantages arise, but there is scope for abuse too, and there must be a monitoring process that ensures thatwe benefit from competition and do not lose out. However, on balance, I think that the change will be a force for good. It will act as a business discipline on a range of solicitors and lawyers who have hitherto never had to consider the issues that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07060412000067">Another objection concerns the conflict of interest between shareholder return and quality legal services. I do not understand how anybody working for a big corporation could have a more direct interest in enhancing shareholder value than a lawyer working on his or her own, or in a partnership, in terms of the profitability of the company. There is a far greater relationship between profitability and the individual for lawyers working on their own, or in a partnership, than there is for lawyers who work for a large organisation, which may be a public limited company. Under the current framework, there is far more incentive for individuals to maximise their profit at the expense of quality legal services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70604-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07060412000068">I conclude by acknowledging the contribution that many good lawyers make, and I accept that many members of the profession are dedicated to the public good and work for a relatively low income on behalf of the public. However, there is a culture that prevails in the profession that is at odds with that dedication, and it fails to project the real value that some solicitors bring. The Bill, by enhancing the complaints procedure and reinforcing trust in the profession, will go an enormous way towards dealing with that. It should not only create more confidence, but enable more people to access legal services. As is the case with alternative business structures, legal services could well be provided by organisations that are skilled in developing markets, and which have access to constituencies that solicitors currently do not provide for. There is a real prospect that more people, with greater confidence in the profession, will use those services. If they do, they will enhance the industry, not just for themselves, but for the whole profession. When a complaints procedure that reinforces public confidence is combined with a business structure that gives people more options when selecting who provides their legal services, there will ultimately be a positive impact on the profession, and on the public.</p>

That raises suspicions in my mind and in the mind of others that the Government have begrudgingly recognised independence as the mark of the legal profession in our society. It is important that the legal services board should be demonstrably independent of Government. That matters less for lawyers than for the public. It also matters for professional confidence in the regulation of legal services.</p>

 Not at all. Far be it from me to speak on behalf of the legal profession&#151;I am as much a consumer and as much a lawyer as others. However, an appointment as crucial as this, which involves a supervisory role&#151;a real break from the past&#151;must be dealt with uniquely, because it raises clear questions about independence that need to be dealt with satisfactorily.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p>

 I want to make some more progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07060418000021">In the other place, arguments were made about areas that I do not think can be advanced as equivalents. The question was asked, &#147;Why should we do this? Is it not the same as the head of Ofcom being appointed by Rupert Murdoch or the chairman of the Competition Commission being the chairman of Tesco?&#148; Those arguments are not well made. The independence of the legal profession is significant: it is a cornerstone of the rule of law and needs to be handled cautiously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07060418000022">The Government seek to give assurance by saying that the appointment process will be conducted according to the Nolan principles and that it will be conducted diligently and transparently. The concern, though, is whether that is enough and whether the Government should have gone further in anotherplace. There are legitimate questions and concerns.Is it significant that the Government resisted the amendment saying that the appointment should be made in accordance with the rules applicable at the relevant time? Why did they resist that amendment so vigorously? Surely a justified concern is properly dealt with by the Lord Chief Justice having the concurrent responsibility for an appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07060418000023">The appointment process also raises other questions. The Government have not yet made clear how it should properly be carried out and where formal responsibility for appointment lies. It will be essential to ensure that the appointment panel is demonstrably independent of Government. Under the ordinary procedures for public appointments, the panel would no doubt have been chaired by a senior official in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but that would not be satisfactory in a context in which independence from Government is paramount for consumers up and down this land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07060418000024">The concern about independence goes further than the appointment process and relates, among other things, to the powers exercised by the legal services board. I urge the Minister to think again as the Bill proceeds to Committee and to take seriously the amendment and the supporting argument that those powers should be exercised only when there is a significant rather than a marginal adverse impact on the regulatory objectives. That amendment referred to the important point that, as all hon. Members have said, the legal services board should have a light-touch role&#151;a supervisory role that could be properly enshrined in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07060418000025">The regulatory structure proposed in the Bill cannot work unless the presumption is that the approved regulators carry out their responsibilities diligently and competently in the public interest.

distinct from the supervisory role of the legal services board. The board should not be able to exercise its powers simply because it would have reached a different decision on the matter concerned and has thus concluded that the regulatory objectives would be better served by a different decision. It is important that the board does not just second-guess the front-line regulators. It must see its role as an important supervisory one that should involve intervention only when it judges that there has been a significant adverse impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07060418000026">Further to the issue of independence, I look forward to the Minister&#146;s opinion on whether the undertaking given to the other place about the power of the Lord Chancellor to increase the size of the board, which could affect the decisions that are made, could givean impression of manipulation. Will there be an undertaking that the powers to increase the size of the board will be achieved by affirmative resolution rather than negative resolution?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raised that issue with the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), when she opened the debate. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee considered that a negative resolution was sufficient, and we are content to accept its advice.</p>

<p><a name="st_o260"><a name="07060418000028"><a name="70604-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="07060418000147"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>
 I am not sure of the order of events relating to the Committee&#146;s advice, but certainly in the other place a clear undertaking was given that the issue would be decided by affirmative resolution if necessary, and that matter will need to be progressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07060418000029">I agree with the concern expressed by the Government in their response to the Joint Committee. They said:</p>
<a name="70604-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07060418000124"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Legal Services Board should exercise its powers only where approved regulators are clearly failing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07060418000030">Unfortunately, that undertaking is not to be carried through, according to the Government&#146;s latest indication. The impact provision needs a qualifying adjective: &#147;clearly failing&#148; were the Government&#146;s words and that is what needs to go into the Bill. I urge the Government to review that aspect of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07060418000031">Independence covers other areas, including costs in relation to the legal services board. In making these comments, I am not just squeaking on behalf of members of the profession, who will have to pay more. I want to look beyond that to the important issue of independence. Is it reasonable to have no contribution from the Government in terms of the supervisory role of the legal services board? Its functions, which I hope we would all agree with, relate to public assurance. When hon. Members have expressed concerns about some activities of the legal profession, is it right that the legal profession should be depended on to be able to fund the supervisory role of the legal services board? Surely it is important to have the independence that is marked by not depending on the purse strings of the legal profession. Inevitably, the high initial costs&#151;we heard the latest figures today and they may well rise&#151;will fall on practitioners, but not only on them. They will not simply take a cut in their salaries. The costs will also fall inevitably on consumers. Consumers have an interest in whether the initial costs should be borne, at least in part, by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07060418000032">The Government say in response that those being regulated should bear the cost of regulation. Why, then, do they have a different approach to claims management and to the accountancy profession? It is important that while the legal profession recognises the full cost of the first tier of regulation, the supervisory tier has a distinct purpose. The supervisory tier of the legal services board guarantees for consumers as much as anyone else that there are ethically sound and competent lawyers who are independent of the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07060418000033">Let me use not my own words, but those of Sir David Clementi, whose work has been widely approved:</p>
<a name="70604-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="07060418000125"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The issue arises as to how the LSB should be paid for. At present a substantial part of the oversight function is paid for by the State: judicial oversight falls to the taxpayer, as does thecost of the oversight function carried out by Government departments. The arguments in favour of the Government contributing to the cost of oversight functions, beyond the fact that it does already, are...that the LSB, in pursuit of its objectives...such as &#145;access to justice&#146;, has a wider role in the public interest than the oversight of practitioners in the legal sector; and&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07060418000034">this is a crucial argument by Sir David&#151;</p>
<a name="70604-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="07060418000126"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that an element of payment by other than the bodies being regulated confirms that the regulator is independent of the regulatee.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07060418000035">Sir David went on to raise the interesting precedent in the proposed funding of the Financial Reporting Council. Its funding is to be split, with two thirds falling to the private sector and one third to the Government. How the split should be made between the private sector and the Government for the LSB would need to be covered in statute and no doubt subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Sir David points to that example of the Government meeting one third of the cost of the Financial Reporting Council. The Government also meet the full cost of the supervisory tier of health care regulation&#151;the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. However, they have not provided an adequate explanation of why they consider it appropriate to meet part of the cost of the supervisory tier of regulation in the accountancy field, but not in respect of legal services. In the case of the CHRE, the Government say that it is appropriate for them to pay because it is important to demonstratethat the organisation is independent of the medical profession. Why can that argument apply to the CHRE but not to the legal profession? The legal servicesboard should be demonstrably independent of the Government and the legal profession. Why is the argument good for the medical profession but not for the legal profession? Are the Government proposing a new constitutional settlement in which they value the independence of the medical profession but not that of the legal profession?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07060418000036">It is important to ensure that the legal profession is not expected to finance the element of regulation that focuses primarily on the public interest. The legal services board will not only deal with the regulation of legal services but consider the interests of legal service providers and others entering the field. That has significant public policy implications. Is it right to expect the legal profession to finance public policy considerations, which the Government currently fund?</p>

profession should pay the costs of the office for legal complaints, part of those of the Office of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner, which the Bill abolishes, and those of the legal services consultative panel. The Government could continue with their current spending commitments, thus ensuring the preservation of the important principle of independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07060418000038">A continuing contribution from the Government may act as an important brake on the legal services board expanding its activities unjustifiably. One would hope that there was no greater brake or check on that than the public purse. The board should not be able to increase its activities and simply pass on the costs to the legal profession unchecked. Many want the board to operate as a light-touch supervisory body, and costs need to be taken on board in that context and in that of the debate on independence.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention. I am the first to admit that I have seen and been frustrated and appalled by the bad practices that occur. However, there are many good local high street practitioners who provide an invaluable service. The baby should not be thrown out with the bath water that has been stained by solicitors who cause problems. In some circumstances, access to justice can be promoted by lower costs and providing services away fromhigh street premises. One should not simply wed the argument about access to justice to the number of offices on a high street.</p>

 I declare an interest, which is different from most of the others that have been declared. I have initiated regulatory action against 45 firms of solicitors. To date, none of them has won. My constituents have won in every resolved case without exception. The numbers that the Law Society records are a tremendous underestimate because, being a moderate man, I have been prepared, when my constituents agreed, to conciliate. Many cases didnot therefore go through the regulatory process for complaints. The 45 firms have been described as a small number of solicitors, but those against which I have taken action had approximately 80 per cent. of the business&#151;the claims and the amount of money that they were paid for handling them&#151;in relation to the coal miners&#146; compensation scheme.

I had to fight some battles to get these questions asked,but the Law Society puts five questions to new complainants and one of them is, &#147;What experience have you had of the legal profession before?&#148; I have seen the answers of my constituents and I can say that the majority, and particularly the elderly, have the perception that people only go to a solicitor if they have been in some problems with the police and require defending. That is their perception&#151;not their experience&#151;of the legal profession. The younger generation have a slightly different perspective because more of them have had experience&#151;not necessarily a pleasant one&#151;of family law courts, for example. As to challenging the high and mighty&#151;whether it be the Government, firms of solicitors or whatever&#151;my constituents do not have much experience of it.</p>

I find that the upper classes always have a family solicitor and always have had one. The middle classes have a mixed experience, but they know what questions to ask. They sometimes get into difficulties, but they come forward and demand justice, and they have some idea that there may be a complaints procedure to go through. The working classes, from my experience, work on the basis that a solicitor is a man or a woman who can be trusted. It is a bit like with a police officer or perhaps an accountant in some vague notion, but a solicitor is someone who can be trusted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70604-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07060418000053">It seems to me to be rather good for a profession to imbue in people the idea that that the profession can be trusted precisely because it is a profession, which is exactly why I break from the general consensus that only my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) has really broken with so far. That is why I say that the cosiness with which both Houses seem to want to go forward does not satisfy me or, I believe, the interests of my constituents. Regulation needs to be highly robust precisely because of the important traditional reputation of the legal profession, as people see it and wish to see it. That must be the case.</p>

The one I welcome is the rolling back of some of the misconceptions about Nolan. Under Nolan, the perception held among the trade unions was that if someone was a trade unionist, it was not possible to speak on issues that were directly relatedto trade unions. One could not advocate or move amendments and all the rest of it. Yet what we have seen here is the ability of members of the various legal trade unions or legal executives, solicitors and barristers to do precisely that, as they did in the House of Lords. Doubtless they wanted to move and support amendments either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I welcome that, because under the Nolan principles the issue always was transparency, not putting restrictions on what people can do. I have not sought to challenge anyone&#146;s right to advocate on that basis and I will not do so as the Bill progresses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07060418000061">My other observation is of an even more historic nature: the final decline of &#147;Liberal&#148; within the Liberal Democrats. I always disagreed with the Liberals&#146; overemphasis on the individual as opposed to society. That was always my perspective on the history of the trade union movement&#146;s shift from the Liberals to the Labour party. Finally, the last vestiges of &#147;Liberal&#148; in the merged party have been put to rest. Given the extraordinary position of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) on the question of the rights of the individual consumer,the only appropriate name change I can suggest for the party is to &#147;Whigs&#148;.</p>

As far as I am aware, there is currently an independent legal services ombudsman. I have here a report that appears to be written by the legal services ombudsman, &#147;The special report by the legal services ombudsman for England and Wales on the miners&#146; cases&#148;. I do not know whether the current post holder is a barrister or a solicitor, but that does not seem to me to be a relevant requirement for the supervisory role being fulfilled, despite the implicit suggestion that a legal professional is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07060418000063">I shall have to study the Bill in greater detail, but a provision that the post should always be filled by a lay person who is not a legal professional might be a suitable way of ensuring the independence of the chair of the legal services board. Clearly, it is invidious for a legal professional to oversee his own profession without independent input. Many skills can be brought to bear, but having the view of a person from outside, who neither has, has had or intends in future to have a pecuniary interest in the profession being overseen, seems to be the essence of independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07060418000064">We can argue about the detail, and it is legitimatefor hon. Members to put forward proposals, test the Government and go further in that regard. My requirement, however, is for an independence that is separate from the vested interests of the legal profession. I do not use the term &#147;vested interests&#148; in a derogatory way; I use it factually. It is perhaps no surprise that some of the improvements in the Law Society&#146;s robustness in dealing with problems have been due to bringing in expertise from outside to take a fresh view. In saying that, I cast no aspersions on anyone in the legal profession, now or previously. It would be similarly absurd were we to appoint a Member of the House&#151;or an ex-Member&#151;to oversee our behaviour. Were that suggested, it would, I hope, be ridiculed in the House, and I would vote against it were it ever proposed. It would also rightly be ridiculed outside the House.</p>

 Does not the Bill provide that the first chairman of the legal services board will be a lay person? Does not that provide the robustness that the hon. Gentleman wants? The concern is that there should be a joint appointment process involving the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

 If it is good to have an independent person at the beginning, it is also good in the continuum. Let me answer the question that I posed to the hon. Gentleman, which he forgot to answer, about current appointments by the Lord Chancellor. I have not heard criticism of those appointments. In relation to the other side of Nolan, the robustness is therefore all to be seen. I am totally against the vested interests of the legal profession influencing such decisions.

The report took a lead&#151;it could have gone further, and other reports might be needed, not just relating to miners, on the way in which the profession has handled itself.

 Does my hon. Friend also agree that one of the problems with the current system is the closed shop operated by the Law Society, for example, in relation to Watson Burton solicitors in Newcastle? They were subject to disciplinary procedures, but the judgment was kept secret from the public. Does he agree that maximum transparency on disciplinary actions and criticism of law firms should be at the heart of the Bill?</p>

 I agree totally with my hon. Friend. I would like the legal services board&#146;s powers over the approved regulators laid down in statute, so that the general public are protected. On the question that he asks about confidentiality, and allowing misconduct cases to go forward and then hiding them away, the Watson Burton case came to light only by accident&#151;a copy of the ruling came into my hands, and I felt it appropriate to give him a copy too, as he had far more such cases in his area. Through that, the issue got into the wider arena, so people could see what was happening.</p>

The Accident Group case, for example, involved enormous mismanagement. The public and legislators have a right to know, and that needs to be built in to ensure full openness. If solicitors have behaved badly, and decisions are made against them through regulation by their profession, those decisions should be made available to the general public, not kept quiet. </p>

I have astonishing cases of people fighting for basic justice, in which the wrong done to them is obvious to anyone looking in from outside.

The example is the conditionalfee agreements and the hearing loss cases, involving miners, textile workers, steel workers and engineering workers, and if it is happening in my area, it is happening across the country. There are two forms of funding for that, which is why we have a case against them. Often, a claims handler grabs hold of the case and sells it on to a solicitor, who sells it on to another solicitor, who gives it to a legal executive, who commissions a private health company to get in aGP, from which the solicitors&#146; firm gets a bit of commission. They take a loan out and get commission from the loan for insurance. The claim goes to a barrister, who writes up the facts, which I could have written up in five minutes&#151;I do not exaggerate&#151;and then charges for writing an opinion, which becomes the case taken forward.</p>

well be something for the Bar Council to consider, but I want one body where I can take the whole job lot and say, &#147;You sort it out,&#148; because I&#146;ve had to fight each case individually. I spend more money on filing cabinets&#151;that is true&#151;than any other piece of office equipment to stick all the files in. There are hundreds of pages in each one, because legal defences arrive, written by counsel on behalf of a solicitor, trying to stop my constituents gaining access to justice&#151;in other words, prolonging the misery when the solicitors know that they are wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07060418000078">Those are the simple cases, not the complex ones that will take even longer. Where is the justice in that? I allege that tens of thousands of industrial deafness cases and tens of thousands of cases that have already been compensated for industrial deafness&#151;in other words, people who are partially or largely deaf&#151;have solely been handled over the telephone. Where is the justice in accessing justice for those people? There has been no face-to-face meeting, and key decisions have been made. That is a scandal that all the regulatory bodies, from the Bar Council through to the Law Society, should be dealing with. The whole profession has operated on the basis that that is perfectly acceptable because the people live in rural mining areas and are not always nearby. Therefore they can grab the case and deal with them over the telephone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07060418000079">Strangely, a 91-year-old with a claim for industrial deafness might not always be able to hear.

If they do not&#151;this is endemic in the profession&#151;who is going to do something about it? That needs to be part of the regulatory role. The LSB should be about ensuring that we have best practice. It comes as a shock to solicitors in other parts of the country who are used to dealing with more matter-of-course matters&#151;although not more mundane matters&#151;to learn about such scams and scandals, and it is a shock when they see the profit involved. Who are the highest paid solicitors? The legal profession, through its own journals, now advertises the fact that phenomenal amounts of money are being made out of those practices. Their powers are not a small side issue.</p>

The legal service makes the claim, including additional things such as not being able to wash up or having to have someone come in to clean or cook. I find that the claims are often not done in full. Why? Incompetence. The solicitor has ticked a few boxes and sent the claim in but has not done the full job. The only way we know that is by looking at the file, and yet despite the fact that we have won more than &#163;20,000 for several people by challenging those claims&#151;although perhaps that is why&#151;firms still refuse to hand over the files.

 Those solicitors think that some of the claims will not be worth a great deal and can be pushed to the back of the queue. I have cases, as I am sure my hon. Friend has, in which people have been waiting six or seven years for progress to be made. They ask to be transferred to a solicitor who might do something about it and are refused. Again, it is extraordinary, but we cannot think that it is a unique Bassetlaw, north Nottinghamshire experience, because the firms are dotted around the country, from Brighton up to the north-east. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham, who represents an entirely different part of the country, has found exactly the same. What a surprise; what a coincidence. This is a national issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07060418000083">I am talking about people who are not used to dealing with the legal profession&#151;about vulnerable clients. Access to justice, and the expansion of justice, should be aimed at such people, whether it involves large firms of solicitors or small local firms. I have no strong view in either direction, but if we are to expand the market, I want access to justice to mean access for those people and many more. I want access to justice for people who have been done over in a range of ways, not just through industrial injuries: people who feel that they cannot proceed further because solicitors and the legal profession are not for them&#151;that they cannot afford such advocacy, and that it is for the middle class rather than the working class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70604-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07060418000084">Those people should not have to come to me to challenge insurance companies that refuse to payout, or house builders when houses fall down, or conveyancers when enormous subsidence holes suddenly appear in the middle of the garden and under the foundations. They should feel confident about going to solicitors to obtain legal remedy, but they do not feel comfortable about it. This debate is about expanding the market, and there is a market full of people with grievances who ought to be making a sensible, coherent, rational decision to use a solicitor, be it a large multinational, a one-man band or a small family company in a town.</p>

I have no strong objection, but I do think it would be unwise to limit a body to one base by statute. If the miners&#146; scam were repeated, a base in Sheffield or Newcastle would make sense, pragmatically and in terms of cost. Hands should not be tied for the sake of ensuring that the organisation is up and running as soon as possible.</p>

Both its remit and its role need to be maintained: it should be both an overseeing body and what some might terma court of appeal. It should be a further resort if regulation and the complaints procedure have not worked, but it should also ensure that there is forward looking as well as retrospectivity when it comes to the regulatory regime.</p>

There is widespread recognition, both in the legal profession and among consumer groups, that the provision of legal services is in need of reform and modernisation.

The move away from allowing the same bodies to carry out both representation and regulation in the industry is also long overdue. The changes in the Bill will help to strengthen the reputation of an already excellent legal system. However, although there is room for improvement, let us not forget that the British legal system is believed by many to be the finest in the world. As we introduce these changes, it is vital that we do not, by accident or design, put that world-renowned reputation at risk.</p>

The amendments made in the House of Lords are not wrecking amendments. They do not seek to change the Bill beyond recognition, and they do not seek to undermine its underlying principles. On the contrary, they seek to improve and clarify specific points, to elucidate where there is uncertainty, and in particular to ensure that the regulation of legal services not only remains but is seen to be independent from political interference. It is clear that the Government seek to overturn at least some of those amendments. That is a short-sighted approach, and I urge the Minister and other Labour Members to think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07060418000099">The independence of the legal system is a matter of serious concern. If the Lord Chancellor alone appoints the board, many will see that as political interference in the regulation of our legal services. That impacts on the independence of the profession and, from an international perspective, it seriously undermines our reputation as having truly independent legal services. To put matters into perspective, the overseas market for legal services contributes more than &#163;2 billion a year to United Kingdom exports. That is a huge sum and we will put it at risk if the rest of the world feels thatthe British legal system is no longer independent. Moreover, in an increasingly global market, where there are multi-jurisdictional transactions, UK law is often chosen as the preferred legal basis. That, too, will be threatened if there is a question mark over the independence of our legal system.</p>

 Is not my hon. Friend&#146;s important point reinforced by the precedent set when Hong Kong was returned to China? The then Government took great pains to ensure that there were significant safeguards to protect the independence of the existing Hong Kong judicial system, recognising that the integrity and international reputation of the Hong Kong judicial and legal system was important for Hong Kong&#146;s future economic viability. Does not the same consideration apply here? It is important that we do not risk having even the perception among the many  <br>

 I am arguing about the Legal Services Bill. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to perpetuate the system and to argue that we should have a system that continues with political appointments, that is his call. The House took on board all that he had to say inhis contribution, which lasted some 40 minutes.I sympathise with the dilemma of many of his constituents, but it would be more useful if he were to make constructive comments as to how the Bill could be improved or be beneficial to his constituents, rather than giving a history lesson about the legal system that the Bill seeks to modernise.</p>

 Are the hon. Gentleman and the hon.

If that is the case, I am sure that the former Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will be spinning in his grave.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is not following what we are saying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07060418000106">It is clear that Britain&#146;s legal services should notonly be independent of politics but be seen to be independent. To that end, the noble Lords in another place amended the Bill so that the Lord Chief Justice also has a role in the appointment of the board. Specifically, as has been articulated earlier, the Lord Chancellor's appointments should have the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice. That is not a wrecking amendment. It is anything but. As well as maintaining the independence of the legal system, the amendment reassures the overseas market that the board appointments are not political. Therefore, the amendment helps to safeguard that huge market of billions of poundsfrom which the UK economy benefits&#151;nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07060418000107">If the Lord Chief Justice alone were to make the appointments, consumers would rightly feel that the legal services were being looked after by their own. In like manner, appointments by the Lord Chancellor alone have an air of political involvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07060418000110">What the Lords amendment does, by asking that the board appointments have the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice, is to reach a fair compromise. It tackles the issue of overt political control, but still allows the Lord Chancellor to take the lead in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07060418000111">There is a contradiction in the Government's insistence that the Lord Chancellor should have an unchallenged right to make the appointments. The very first clause of the Bill rightly includes among the regulatory objectives the need for the independence of the legal profession. It is to be applauded that such a sound and clear statement is made so prominently. Why, then, risk undermining that welcome statement by allowing the Lord Chancellor unfettered powers of appointment to the board? Such an approach is in danger of sending out the opposite signal. I urge the Government to retain that sensible amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07060418000112">I now turn to the provisions that allow for alternative business structures. ABSs will allow more flexibility in the market and that will be good for both consumers and the profession itself. I certainly know of many solicitors firms where the finance director is held in high regard by the firm, but he is not made a partner because he is an accountant rather than a solicitor. Allowing for ABSs will, I am sure, enable many such finance directors to become partners, rather than simply be employees of the firm. However, it is important to ensure that any changes made in trying to improve the system do not lead to unintended negative consequences. The debate on ABSs has been goingon for years and as firms and practices from a variety of professions seek to cut their overheads, it is only natural that they should consider having multi-disciplinary practices. That is fine in principle, but with it will come new challenges, from which we must not shirk, but which must be closely monitored, in the public interest as well as for the benefit of the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07060418000113">For example, if there is a high street solicitor who merges with a high street surveyor, a consumer who requires the services of both professions should be free to go to two separate firms if he so wishes, rather than find himself under pressure to use only one firm. Moreover, with a multi-disciplinary practice, there should be vigilance to ensure that no unnecessary burdens are imposed upon a consumer if he wishes to bring a complaint against a firm where he has used the services of several professions within the same firm. For example, if a consumer has used the services of a lawyer, a surveyor and an accountant in the same firm and something goes wrong, the consumer should not suffer if the professionals decide to engage in a buck-passing exercise between themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07060418000114">To conclude, although there are some areas of concern, I support the main thrust of the Bill. It isright that our legal system should modernise, bemore transparent and be more flexible&#151;fit for the21st century global market. The amendments to which I referred earlier do not compromise the principles behind the Bill. Indeed they serve to strengthen the legislation. I hope that the Government will accept them. By doing so, they will not only protect the consumer and the public interest, but safeguard our international standing in the legal world.</p>

 May I start by saying that I am not a solicitor or legally qualified, but I have a vested interest to declare: for the six years that I have been a Member of the House, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), I have been defending and trying to get justice for hundreds of poor and weak constituents who have been treated appallingly by the legal profession and who need the measures that are in this Bill to protect them from some of the sharp practices to which he referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07060418000116">I will come on to the Law Society in a minute. I congratulate it on cleaning up its act in terms of the legal complaints service. It has improved and is doing a good job in trying to get justice for many of my constituents, but there is still a sense of denial there. I will refer later to the letter from Fiona Woolf and to the view that a minority of solicitors are involved. It is interesting that the majority of hon. Members who have spoken have direct vested interests, being either solicitors or barristers, or connected in some way with the legal profession. The point has been made that a minority of solicitors are involved. I am sorry, but I do not agree. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has mentioned the companies in his area that have been involved, and I do not think that there is a single solicitors&#146; firm in the north-east which has not taken part in the feeding frenzy in respect of miners&#146; compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07060418000117">I was first alerted to this issue almost 5 years ago, when an 86-year-old woman came to see me. She walked into my surgery on crutches. She was a miner&#146;s widow; unfortunately, her husband had died some5 years earlier. She had been to a firm of solicitors in Newcastle called Mark Gilbert Morse, which had touted for business by putting advertisements in newspapers and targeting vulnerable people such as my constituent. She had been awarded a claim for the injustice that her husband had suffered, and Mark Gilbert Morse had taken 25 per cent. of that compensation&#151;some &#163;8,000&#151;even though every single penny of its costs was being paid for by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07060418000120">As a result, there was an avalanche of complaints not only about Mark Gilbert Morse but other firms as well, which were double-charging and therefore taking from people&#146;s compensation. The highest proportion was 25 per cent. and the lowest was 3 per cent. Those firms were already being paid for all their costs. A succession of firms were doing that. As a Conservative Front Bencher mentioned, Thompsons Solicitors was in league with the Durham National Union of Mineworkers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07060418000121">As well as the scandal of double-charging, there is the scandal that poor advice was given to our constituents. There was poor advice not only in terms of how solicitor firms were dealing with their cases, but some companies were taking on claims and sausage-machining them, which is my term for doing nothing at all and not contacting their clients for long periods&#151;  <br>

for many years in some instances&#151;while as the cases plodded through the system they were taking their cut. The greedy individuals involved could not be content with the generous fees paid by the Department of Trade and Industry, but they had also to raid the victims&#146; compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07060418000122">Somebody asked me why I keep going on about this matter. I do so because I feel very angry about howthe legal profession has dealt with many of my constituents. I challenge anybody&#151;such as Fiona Woolf, president of the Law Society&#151;to come and meet my constituents, and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, who have put their faith in lawyers and have been cheated. I know that that is a strong word, but it is the only word that can be used to describe what has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07060418000123">I congratulate the Government on introducingthe Bill, and also on having brought forward the Compensation Act 2006, which regulates a different area&#151;that of claims handling. Again however, the claims handling industry could not have exploited many thousands of people without the collusion of the lawyers involved. Let me give an example to illustrate my point. People ask whether the companies I mention are merely back-street companies. No, they are not. They are companies such as Watson Burton, a solicitor firm in Newcastle. It sells itself as a big commercial law firm; it has a big banner at Newcastle airport. It went in league with a claims handling company called P and R Associates, which did nothing at all apart from getting people to fill in an application and then passing it on to Watson Burton. Watson Burton then deducted &#163;325,000 from victims&#146; compensation and passed it to P and R Associates. I have challenged Watson Burton to explain the contractual relationship between the two companies, and it did not do so. Those companies should pay back that money, but they will not because they are adamant that somehow they were contractually obliged to do what they did. However, what they did not do was tell their clients that they did not have to go through middlemen in the first place.</p>

 On the subject of Watson Burton, my hon. Friend and I have both got money back for those of our constituents whose cases we know about. Does he not think that there should be powers in the Bill to enable the regulator to force companies such as Watson Burton to pay back everybody?</p>

 I am about to get on to that important point. I am pleased that the Minister has stated&#151;not only in her opening remarks today, but in other comments&#151;that the consumer must be at the heart of the Bill. I will not accept any crocodile tears from members of the legal profession saying that it will compromise their independence; I will address that point shortly. It must be recognised that most people have very little or nothing at all to do with the legal profession. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has said, the only time that most clients involved in miners&#146; compensation cases have contact with a solicitor is if they have done something wrong. Many of the clients are elderly and they trust the solicitor. People have said to me, &#147;But I&#146;ve signed that piece of paper. Doesn&#146;t that mean I have to pay the money?&#148; I then have to explain that their solicitor  <br>

should have told them that they should not pay it. That shows how those people have been misled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07060428000012">An education exercise needs to take place. People should be told what different law firms do and what their rights are. The legal services board should undertake that as part of its remit; it should educate the public about the need to ask questions, and what those questions should be. Many constituents of mine have gone along to firms of solicitors and have not questioned what the solicitors have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07060428000013">The key point is that solicitors should act in the best interests of their clients, but it is clear that they are not doing so. I mentioned a good example of that in my Adjournment debate just over a week ago: the Durham NUM and Thompsons Solicitors. Thompsons is due a lot of credit for other work that it has done, but its relationship with Durham NUM has been nothing short of a scandal. Their roles have been mixed up. People go to the Durham NUM and are referred on to Thompsons Solicitors. Thompsons take the case, and a fee of 7.5 per cent. is paid back to the Durham NUM. We ask people why they are paying that 7.5 per cent. We also ask Thompsons why it has not advised its clients that they do not need to pay the money. It replies, &#147;Because we&#146;re acting on behalf of the NUM.&#148; Thompsons should be acting in the best interests of its clients, and in these cases it is not doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07060428000014">The legal services complaints service is doing a good job, but have any solicitors been struck off or been heavily censured? No, they have not, because the current system of self-regulation does not work. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) rightly referred to it as the last vestige of the closed shop. It is interesting that although the Conservatives attacked the closed shop throughout the 1980s&#151;rightly, some would say&#151;they did nothing about this closed shop. Clearly, self-regulation has not worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70604-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07060428000015">How should we move forward? We need a simple system&#151;a one-stop shop where people who have complaints about the legal profession can go. That one body should be the office for legal complaints. However, it must be independent; it must not have any connection with the legal profession. I have taken account of all tonight&#146;s crocodile tears about political interference, but the Law Society and the professional legal services have brought this on themselves by the cavalier way in which they have dealt with my constituents, and those of many other Members.</p>

The issue is whether the Bar should be brought under the remit of the Bill, and all the arguments that we have heard today from barristers in this place were rehashes of those used in the other place. I do not agree with the idea of taking the Bar out of the system. We need a system that enables people to know where to go to make a complaint&#151;be it about a solicitor or a barrister&#151;and it should be dealt with, and seen to be dealt with, independently of the legal profession. A few weeks ago I had to deal with a complaint to the legal services body which, unusually, was about not miners&#146; compensation but a divorce case. It was clear that the lady in question had been given very bad service by the local firm of solicitors, who had employed barristers who did not need to be employed. She wanted one point of contact, which is an important issue. Tryingto separate the points of contact into two is not acceptable.</p>

 I am not unsympathetic to all the points that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07060428000024">A lot of rubbish has been spoken today about how the Bill is somehow an attack on the independence of the law. That is absolute nonsense. Currently, the legal services ombudsman is appointed directly by the Lord Chancellor, with no remit from any outside body.The hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) dismissed that as irrelevant, but it is very relevant. As I said earlier, it is important that the proposed board be seen to be totally independent from any form of legal intervention. I support totally the Nolan commission recommendations in this regard, and I agree with Conservative Front Benchers that the issue should be depoliticised. However, if the board is to have credibility, it should not be tainted in any way by the legal profession.</p>

 For the record, I am not saying that the appointment of the legal ombudsman is an irrelevance. I am simply saying that for the purposes of this debate, I did not find his arguments particularly relevant.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman said in his earlier contribution that the proposal was somehow an attack on the fundamental independence of the law, and he refused to answer the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw and I put to him in that regard. The current body has a lot more powers&#151;to fine, for example&#151;than the legal services board will have, and the ombudsman is appointed by the Lord Chancellor, not the Lord Chief Justice. I am clear that the board must be independent, and be seen to be independent, if it is to have the credibility and teeth that it needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07060428000027">I would like to make one or two other points about the detail of the Bill. I want the legal services board to have more teeth, in terms of the fines that it can impose on solicitors firms. The figure proposed in the Bill is &#163;20,000, but that is nowhere near enough, and I shall give an example that shows why. A woman, whom I shall call Mrs. X, from Stanley in my constituency, came to see me before Christmas. She had the misfortune of having gone to the law firm Mark Gilbert Morse. She was pursuing a miners&#146; compensation case on behalf of her husband, and Mark Gilbert Morse was given a settlement figure of &#163;42,000 for that case by the Department of Trade and Industry. The solicitors rejected it on her behalf, without even telling her. Lo and behold, some six months later they came back with an offer of some &#163;23,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07060428000028">Under the Bill, the maximum compensation figure for that case would be &#163;20,000. Here, I give credit to the Legal Complaints Service. Thanks to the shame that was felt, and how appalled the service was by this case, Mark Gilbert Morse paid the &#163;42,000 that had originally been offered. If the new body is to have teeth, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw said, it must be able to hit solicitors where it hurts&#151;in the monetary award.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07060428000029">Another issue that I am concerned about, and which needs to be examined, is the idea of forcing claimants to pay costs for frivolous and vexatious cases. This is a  <br>

complete red herring, and I resist at all points the idea that anyone should be discouraged from bringing a case forward for fear of a compensation award against them. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said that that would not happen. Unfortunately, it does happen, and people will not come forward if they feel that costs will be awarded against them. In my experience, even the most brazen solicitors who have been taking money left, right and centre will use every means possible to frighten victims into withdrawing their complaint. To judge by my experience to date of the Legal Complaints Service, any complaint that is clearly frivolous and vexatious never gets off the ground. It is for the service to fillet out cases in which there is no case to answer, and that should not involve a threat against the individuals involved, because that would act as a disincentive to their coming forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07060428000030">The miners&#146; compensation cases show that, as even the Legal Complaints Service recognises, we have merely touched the tip of the iceberg of this issue. Many people simply do not know that they have a complaint. They are in awe of solicitors. They sign a piece of paper, and having done so, they think that they are legally obliged to pay the amount in question. As a result, they are not coming forward with complaints.</p>

<p><a name="st_o302"><a name="07060428000031"><a name="70604-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="07060428000248"><b>John Mann:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend not find that, invariably, the solicitors write to the individual saying that they have to pay because they have signed the paper&#151;as if that were a legal document in itself?</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="07060428000032"><a name="70604-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="07060428000249"><b>Mr. Jones:</b>
 They certainly do. Watson Burton&#146;s defence in Newcastle&#146;s <i> The Journal</i> last week was that it had a &#147;legal obligation&#148; to pass the money over to the other side&#151;P and R Associates. That is part of my earlier point about education: we need education on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07060428000033">The legal services board must be seen to be independent, and it must be independent from thelegal profession. I also welcome the creation of the consumer panel to ensure that the administrationof consumer services is properly conducted. It is important that the Minister&#151;in her opening remarks today and in her continuing rhetoric&#151;says that the consumer must be at the heart of the matter. If that upsets the legal profession&#151;tough. From my experience of the way in which it has handled many cases in my constituency, frankly, it does not give a damn. It has created much hardship and heartache for many individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07060428000034">I turn to one final issue: the alternative business model. I welcome it, because I recognise that there are other ways of delivering legal services. However, although I, like my hon. Friend, will not oppose the provision, I think that we should tread very carefully to ensure that we do not maintain the vested interests of the legal profession, about which we have heard tonight. If high street solicitors go out of business&#151;good. In my experience, they provide a second-rate and substandard service, and do not do what the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey says they do, and refer cases that they are not capable of dealing with. They do not do that; they take those cases on, give the impression that they know what they are talking about, and give people a substandard service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07060428000035">However, we need to tread very carefully. We do not want the same situation as we had with the growth of claims handlers, with middlemen and spivs setting up organisations that claim to be solicitors when they clearly are not. I emphasise that if we have alternative business models, the individual consumer must be clear about who is legally qualified to give advice. In the cases that my hon. Friend and I have dealt with, claims-handling companies have knocked on people&#146;s doors and rung people up. If we ask people, &#147;Are they solicitors?&#148;, they say, &#147;Yes, they are.&#148; But if we look at their literature, does it say that they are solicitors? No, it does not. They use language that suggests that they could be legally qualified, when most of them are not. In the worst case that I have come across, their previous company sold double glazing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07060428000036">With that caveat, if the alternative business model is properly set up, with organisations that my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West mentioned, such as the Co-op and others, it could provide added service to the consumer. However, we must tread carefully to ensure that it is clear to the consumer who is, and who is not, legally qualified to give advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07060428000037">I shall finish where I started, and say that I welcome the Bill. It is a great move forward in trying to give legal protection to some of the most vulnerable people in our society. The Law Society has blown hot and cold on the issue, however. I read the <i> Hansard </i>report of the evidence from the other place, in which Fiona Wolfe said that the Bill had been much improved, but it has not; it has been filleted. This is where the Law Society needs to come clean and say that the miners&#146; compensation scheme has clearly demonstrated that huge numbers of its members have taken advantage of the poor and weak in society&#151;but in many cases, the Law Society has stood by and done very little.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07060428000038">As my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has argued, the Law Society should argue for more robust controls over those rogue solicitors&#151;the rotten apples in the barrel. Unfortunately, there are far too many, and I do not accept Fiona Wolfe&#146;s point that only a minority have become involved in the feeding frenzy. If the society did that, it would be doing a service to the consumer, and to its genuine members. Its attempts to weaken the Bill by lobbying in the other place for its vested interests has not brought it any credit.</p>

It is many years since I have set foot in a court, and I hope that it will be many years before I have to do so again.

Scotland, and I gently remind the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara), who talked about a UK legal system, that there is no such thing. There are three separate legal systems within the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07060428000041">The first point of concern is the proposals in part 5 to allow for the creation of alternative business structures. Much has been said about alternative ways of delivering legal services, but in effect, the Bill will allow multi-disciplinary partnerships to be formed, as the hon. Gentleman said. There has been a strong debate about that in Scotland, and from what I understand, in England for many years, and although the Bill affects only England and Wales, there is great concern in Scotland and other jurisdictions about the way in which the territoriality will be contained, because such entities are not allowed under the law of Scotland. There is a fair amount of cross-border activity between law firms and tie-ups between Scottish and English law firms. Some Scottish firms operate in England and some English firms operate in Scotland. Indeed, I am told that there are about 600 Scots lawyers working in London alone, many of them for the type of firms that are likely to be attracted to the alternative business structures. That does not include retired solicitors acting as MPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07060428000042">There is nothing unusual about that situation,as many of the large commercial firms, especiallyin London, operate in many other jurisdictions. Liberalisation of services has been touched upon, and it is one of the sticking points in the current Doha discussions. Those Members who sit on the Trade and Industry Committee will recall receiving evidence on the issue from one large firm of commercial solicitors in London about our reports on trade with India and with the Mercosur nations of South America. It is conceivable therefore that such a practice established in London could in fact operate in several different jurisdictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07060428000043">I am neutral on the question of multidisciplinary practices. The Front-Bench spokesmen from the Conservative and Liberal parties both rightly raised concerns about their local effect, but my concerns are about their cross-border implications. The Law Society of Scotland has raised concerns that the licensing provisions in clauses 71 to 111 and the relevant schedules are only framework provisions and that they lack detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07060428000044">There are concerns about the way in which the new business structures will be licensed, and in particular about the way in which they comply with the law, professional rules and statutory and non-statutory provisions that apply outside England and Wales. That is important, because many people working in those large firms are regulated by others. They could, for example, be subject even within the UK to the professional regulation of the Faculty of Advocates, the General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland, the Law Society of Scotland or the Law Society of Northern Ireland. It is important that any non-authorised person who manages such a firm does not act in such a way as to cause professional difficulty to  <br>

such employees. That detail&#151;the way in which the measures will apply to those new entities&#151;must be teased out</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07060428000045">Indeed, much more prosaic concerns could arise. If, for example, a multidisciplinary partnership includes solicitors, advocates or barristers, architects and surveyors, how will the various professional organisations fit into the structure of the legal services board in dealing with the other non-lawyer members? In Scotland, and I am sure in England, solicitors firms have to pay into a guarantee fund that pays out should a member be found to have had their fingers in the till&#151;to put it succinctly. Firms also have their own professional indemnity insurance. How would such a fund come into play in the event of a non-solicitor member of a multidisciplinary practice default? Would it work in the same way?</p>

 I am following what the hon. Gentleman says. Will he tell us whether the Scottish National party, which now forms the minority Administrationin Scotland, has any proposals on the overarching regulation of the legal profession in Scotland, or on any of the other points that he is discussing, which might interact with what the Government propose?</p>

<p><a name="st_o306"><a name="07060428000047"><a name="70604-0014.htm_spnew8"><a name="07060428000252"><b>Mr. Weir:</b>
 I shall come to that. The Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007 that was passed earlier this year, and the Bill, touch on that point, but multidisciplinary partnerships are a new concept. There has been much discussion about the idea in Scotland, but the debate has not moved forward. Scottish law firms are expanding overseas in the same way as English legal firms. Unlike English common law, Scots law is based on the Roman law, so it is well placed to expand into continental systems that are also based on Roman law. I am sure that as Scotland prospers under the new SNP Administration, many more firms will take up the advantages of expanding into Europe, as Scotland takes a much greater interest in Europe without having to come to it throughthe UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07060428000048">When the Bill was debated in another place, an amendment was proposed that would have provided for those new entities to be monitored in the first few years of their existence. When the Minister introduced the debate, we discussed whether the provision is a sunrise or sunset clause, or something in between. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) made a good point when he said that those organisations should be monitored in their first few years of existence to see how they prosper. I suspect that they are coming and that they will spread to other jurisdictions, and we need to have some information on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07060428000049">I appreciate that the Minister might not be able to respond to these matters in detail in her winding up, but I shall raise some of my concerns so that they can be given some other consideration. The Bill includes two clauses&#151;196 and 197&#151;and two schedules that will have a direct impact in Scotland. They make changesto the system of regulating Scottish practitionersin reserved areas such as financial services and immigration and asylum cases. I have no great points to make about them, as they come under the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007, but I note that those measures make several repeals of provisions in both the 2007 Act and the Solicitors  <br>

 This has been an interesting, albeit sometimes technical, debate on a matter that is certainly of constitutional importance. All hon. Members have made thoughtful contributions and, although there are significant differences in detail, the Bill has generally been welcomed by everyone who has spoken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07060428000051">The report that Sir David Clementi produced on legal services was a visionary one, and we recognise, as do many hon. Members, that the Bill has come a long way since it was first introduced. I pay tribute both to the Joint Committee&#146;s work and its comprehensive review, and not least to its Chairman, Lord Hunt, as well as to the input of my hon. Friend the Memberfor Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), who madea significant contribution to today&#146;s debate. In many ways, they moved the Bill back to the original Clementi vision. That was even before it went to the other place, where it was substantially improved by Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Cross-Bencher Lords, led frequently by my noble Friend Lord Kingsland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70604-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07060428000052">We believe that the Bill is now pretty much there, and are not pleased, therefore, to hear from the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice) how most of the improvements are to be reversed by the Government in Committee. The Minister and the hon. Members for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and for North Durham (Mr. Jones) described the changing mechanical, technical and cultural issues that led to the need for the Bill. There is certainly no complacency among the Opposition about the need to improve legal services, not least given the polls saying that no more than 44 per cent. of consumers have a favourable opinion of lawyers, the evidence on miners&#146; compensation given by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw and the current regulatory framework, which includes some 22 different regulators.</p>

He then spoke of the regulatory maze that baffles consumers and thwarts effective oversight and which even Sir David Clementi&#146;s report agreed was flawed. I shall examine each of those issues in the context of our debate, keeping in mind the fact that lawyers play an extremely important role as a thriving, independent profession in the life and economy of our nation, and we need an appropriate and modern regulator system that reflects that.</p>

There is no argument about the fact that solicitors in particular recognise the need for reform of the complaints-handling system. There are now no fewer than 118,000 solicitors practising which is itself a testament to the success of the profession&#151;having grown from only 31,000 in 1976&#151;and has enabled Britain to become a worldwide centre for legal  <br>

excellence. By the way, all of that occurred despite the Government&#146;s attempt to wreck the infrastructure of our legal system by their swingeing cuts to the Court Service while squandering millions on a new so-called supreme courthouse, their attack on criminal and civil legal aid and their ham-fisted blundering into the new Ministry of Justice.</p>

As my noble Friend, Lord Hunt of Wirral put it, before the amendments were made in the other place:</p>
<a name="70604-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07060428000192"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that the Legal Services Board is intended to act as a supervisory regulator, which would leave day-to-day responsibility with the approved regulators and exercising its powers only when they are clearly failing.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 January 2007; Vol. 688,c. 1040.]</p>

Such moves will not in themselves help consumers&#151;despite the Minister saying that they would&#151;or keep costs down. We are all keen that the measure should not become an expensive rebadging exercise of the legal services ombudsman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07060428000057">As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, the value of the new complaints arrangements for barristers is not as clear cut; the Bar Council has not come in for the same level of criticism and according to most commentators, including the ombudsman, is generally recognised for its responsive handling of complaints. The Minister said that the Bar Council is the only body that wants different treatment, but she did not mention the fact that the Law Society has accepted the Bar Council&#146;s position&#151;for the Bar, albeit not for the Law Society itself. Even if a third of complaints currently dealt with by the Bar are referred back to the legal services ombudsman for reconsideration, two thirds are not, so the proposed changes might not improve consumer satisfaction in relation to such complaints. There are only 9,000 barristers, and their complaints are dealt with by a body made up of unpaid professionalsand lay persons who operate the complaints board reasonably satisfactorily and certainly cheaply. Nevertheless, the Bar Council is also generally supportive of the Bill, as long as the amendments made by the Lords are not removed, especially those in respect of complaints delegation back to the approved regulators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07060428000058">However, most of the current regulators are understandably concerned that without delegation back, the approach will be to bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator. After all, the Joint Committee considered that the cost of the new regulatory system was &#147;speculative at best&#148; and it is conceivable that the costs of reforming the systemwill spiral out of control with no corresponding improvement in quality. The Minister said that the costs would be &#163;32 million, but is that because she separated start-up and first year running costs? We heard that start-up and first year running costs are estimated at about &#163;57 million. Will she clarify what the costs will actually be by the time the Bill is passed?</p>

The Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys typically receives fewer than10 complaints a year, while the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys has received only three complaints since 2001. The Institute of Legal Executives, which has a membership of 22,000, received only 19 complaints against its members in 2004-05. All those practitioners considered it extremely rare for their claims not to be settled amicably through conciliation.</p>

 I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on legal executives, but is not the reason for that low number the fact that solicitors&#146; clients rarely know that legal executives carry out most of the work?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, if a complaint is made, it is firstly made against the law firm, and most complaints are sorted out at that stage. If a complaint goes further, the regulators come into play. That is a pretty telling figure. The Institute of Paralegals and the Council for Licensed Conveyancers also have similar concerns. So a one-size-fits-all approach is not necessarily suitable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07060428000064">Finally on consumer complaints, the Government have referred to Which? and the National Consumer Council, but other consumers should also be represented, not least the corporate consumers&#151;the thousands of in-house lawyers. The Government are not giving enough thought to those consumers, not least in respect of giving them a voice on the LSB. Will the Minister reconsider that? In that vein, the lineof the hon.

The influx of external capital is likely to change the market for the better, by providing greater competition. That point was expressed strongly by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara).

not be rushed into practice without adequate care and thought. The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) noted his caution over the possible pitfalls, although I not sure to what extent he sees the reality of the marketplace. However, the retention of professional values is key, as is how that relates to actual or potential conflicts of interest that might arise in ABSs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07060428000066">As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire identified and as was very well expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire, borrowing from his significant experience, London is now the international legal centre and City lawyers are at the forefront of the boom, earning some &#163;2 billion a year for this country. As a peer recognised, we are the best international lawyers in the world and people come to us and our courts because of our quality. That profit to this country could be put at risk if the images given by the Bill are ones of interference with the independence that leads to our getting so much work from abroad. That is one reason why we should be concerned to ensure that the independence of the LSB remains a priority in the Bill. That point was made very well by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate, whose comments were supported by his extensive legal experience. The Minister replied to an intervention from, I believe,the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) by saying that the views of foreign Governments were not relevant. That goes somewhat against what we understood to be the case, and we will wish to look into that further in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07060428000067">We agree with the recommendation that the Government adopt a careful approach to the ABS system, with a staged plan for implementation. On the basis of the Clementi report, the Joint Committee recommended starting with structures whereby lawyers and barristers could form partnerships and followedby a gradual move to a system of multidisciplinary practices and free-market ownership. Practically speaking, the Government have said that it is not likely that we will see multidisciplinary practices much before 2011. That date was provided by Baroness Ashton in February. Is it still the date? Will the Minister please identify the current timetable and the format envisaged for rolling out ABSs? We might wish to return to that in more detail in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07060428000068">The hon. Member for Stafford made a good point on ABSs in suggesting that other regulated professionals, such as patent agents and chartered accountants, should possibly be dealt with using a more open stance than a non-regulated third party&#151;for example, a non-legal investor in a law firm. I think that was the basis of what he was saying, and I agree that that is worth exploring in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07060428000194">We had concerns that, under the original Bill, ABSs could limit access to justice. Those concerns gave rise to the successful amendment from my noble Friends in the other place. We are therefore truly sorry to hear that the Government intend to go soft on access to justice, by overturning that amendment. However, we also recognise that this should not turn into a case of the Government hindering the development of the legal profession or making it protectionist.

However, we maintain that that should be managed in the wider pubic interest, as much as inthe consumer interest.

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07060428000070">The key to resolving the regulatory maze is how to make an oversight regulator an effective partner of front-line regulators. It is therefore important, as was made clear by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, that the policy statement amendment should remain, so that we end up with light-touch regulation, and that the thresholds that govern when the LSB can intervene are kept sufficiently high. If the intention behind simplifying such relationships was to build consumer confidence, it would be logical if it also allowed lawyers to make appeals against regulatory decisions. Currently, the provisions only allow for judicial review. That is particularly relevant since the Government have stated that they have no intention of paying the costs of setting up or running either the LSB or the OLC. We should ask ourselves who will end up footing the bill. Let us make no mistake that, as things stand, it will be the consumer, as was quite well set out by my hon.

 I thank both Opposition parties for the support that they have broadly given to the Bill. I thank all those hon. Members who have contributed to a good if polarised debate.

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07060428000079">Since the principles are broadly agreed&#151;I hope that I do not claim too much in that&#151;there is much more to be done in Committee than in this closing speech. So I hope that no one will take offence if I propose to take new points and then only to address the amendments that have been discussed. I know that the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) will not be offended if I wrap up their comments in dealing with the amendments. However, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Huntingdon, I can say that the calendar about which he specifically asked has not changed since my noble Friend Baroness Ashton set it out. It is likely that 2011 will be the right date, but of course legal disciplinary partnerships, as opposed to multidisciplinary partnerships, will be available from the time of Royal Assent. I hope that the distinction is clear. The hon. Gentleman was wrong to say that there would be no burden on the public purse. The Ministry of Justice has said clearly that it will pay at least &#163;2.4 million for the set-up costs of the new complaints system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07060428000080">Let me deal with the new points that were made. My hon.

Schedule 22 will allow such an amendment to existing legislation during the transition period.

The set-up costs will be phased, rather than chargeable all at once. There is the question of whether this is fair.I understand that when the new regime is brought together, it will cost less overall than the existing system. Professionals, in addition to getting a bargain, will get the benefit of the consumer confidence that comes from a good complaints system, the opposite of which has been discussed today. There will thus probably be a double bargain.</p>

as did the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. As yet, there is no evidence that we need to regulate them. Clause 24 will allow the legal services board to recommend to the Lord Chancellor that there should be more broad regulation. If that proves to be necessary, it can be introduced.</p>

We agree that that is the right way forward and we will reverse the amendment made in the other place that would put an absolute bar on orders for costs from being put forward in some cases. Such a provision is utterly unnecessary and over-rigid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70604-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07060428000084">The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Huntingdon raised the question of appeals.

He must speak, as he does powerfully, for the working-class lay people whom he and I represent. His idea of a permanent lay chair of the LSB was interesting. However, an interesting point of debate is the question of whether we should fix that for ever, or just establish the culture of the body by ensuring that its first chair is a lay person. The Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), would not mind at all if my hon.

Friend the Member for Bassetlaw that poorer people sometimes have a better guarantee of quality from lawyers than richer people. If people are on legal aid, the Legal Services Commission, which contracts with them, has powers. For example, the commission can issue a specialist quality mark which people need to carry out certain legal aid work. It also has a system of peer review. That system involves other lawyers reviewing the way in which people conduct their business, so I admit that it might not be perfection incarnate, but it is a pretty potent tool that guarantees some quality. When a person is outside legal aid, none of those mechanisms are  <br>

available. In addition, for complex cases, case management is available on legal aid through the LSC, so lawyers cannot send a case on legal aid to an expert who is not needed. Standard cases are carried out for a fixed fee, so there is nothing to be gained by prolonging a case unnecessarily in the way in which his constituents have experienced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07060428000088">My hon. Friend dealt pretty effectively with Liberal Democrat Members&#146; cosy point that local solicitors are universally good and always act in the interests of their communities. Sometimes that is the case, but small firms must not be preferred at all costs. Such firms are not universally bad either, but they cannot possibly have the range of expertise that is needed in this modern world. Larger community legal advice networks are essential, whether they are actual or virtual. Firms in the not-for-profit sector can work together through such networks to ensure that the poor using legal aid can go through one door for advice, rather than going to the only firm available&#151;although it knows nothing about debt because it spends itslife conveyancing and dealing with crime&#151;and thus getting let down. Such a system also means that people do not need to work out what kind of advice they need so that they can decide where to go. If they have a community legal advice network or centre, they can walk through a door and just ask.</p>

If an ABS body operates in England and Scotland, it will have to comply with each jurisdiction&#146;s regulatory rules, unless the rules apply to where the work is being done.

That is the fatal flaw in the rather superficial arguments that have been advanced. If we followed the path advocated by Conservative Members, we would weaken the independence of the legal profession.</p>

 The Minister may not yet have fully appreciated the significance of the change to the Lord Chancellor&#146;s role, or that the Lord Chief Justice now has part of the Lord Chancellor&#146;s former role. Is she saying that she would agree to an amendment that required the Lord Chancellor to consult the Lord Chief Justice, or is that just a red herring?</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="07060428000103"><a name="70604-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="07060428000262"><b>Vera Baird:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman, running backwards as fast as he can without quite falling over, ignores the code that allows the flexibility now for Ministers to consult relevant persons. What is the problem with that? It suffices for every other public appointment. Clementi does not want the Lord Chief Justice to make a co-decision; consumers overwhelmingly do not want it. The availability of consultation is present. The hon. Gentleman has run back up a dead end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07060428000104">Let me deal with the question of thresholds for the exercise of the LSB&#146;s powers, to which the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate referred. It is essential that the board be able to exercise appropriate powers where the acts or omissions of an approved regulator damage the regulatory objectives, but to amend the threshold so that the board can act only where there is a significant adverse impact on the whole of the regulatory objectives is to tie its hands. The board must not stand by and watch while a significant or serious event happens before it can act; that is not in the consumer interest. We will overturn that amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07060428000105">We have discussed the sunrise clause and researching before we introduce ABS activity in England and Wales. If part 5, which brings in ABS, cannot commence until some research has been conducted on ABS, there will be no ABS to research, and the process of bringing it into force will be very circular. The amendment to that effect made in the other place is about delaying unreasonably the positive benefits that ABS will bring to consumers and providers alike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07060428000106">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, among others, raised issues of providers cherry-picking, undercutting, wiping out the competition and not providing services in rural areas because of the power of the open market, and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who is no longer in his place, talked about virtuous local solicitors using conveyancing to subsidise criminal work. Theirs is simply not a realistic position. The most dynamic firms in my constituency, where there are small towns, only do criminal work and they do not subsidise it from anything. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate spoke with pride of being a solicitor who had done legal aid criminal work for the poor on benefits for the past12 years, and he has a decent quality suit on tonight, so I think that he is managing without subsidising that work from anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07060428000107">The licensing authorities will have a clear duty to consider the effect on all the regulatory objectives, including access to justice, when carrying out the licensing functions. That is in clause 28, which covers all licensing functions, not just decisions on applications for alternative business structure licences. That duty is reinforced by the requirements in clause 82 for licensing authorities to issue policy statements about how they will comply with their duty to consider the regulatory objectives when carrying out their functions. Again, that is about access to justice.  <br>

Licensing authorities will be held to those duties through monitoring by the legal services board. Those duties will fully protect access to justice.</p>

 To go back to the Minister&#146;s categorisation of those who want a sunrise clause as people employing a delaying tactic, would she say that Sir David Clementi and the Joint Committee on the Draft Legal Services Bill were guilty of using delaying tactics? They all urged a cautionary approach to the ABS systems.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="07060428000109"><a name="70604-0016.htm_spnew7"><a name="07060428000264"><b>Vera Baird:</b>
 Caution is the Government&#146;s watchword, and we will proceed with monitoring as we go along, but silly research that is intended to support a wrecking amendment will not be tolerated; the Bill will make progress at the appropriate rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07060428000110">Let me turn to the issue of trade unions. My noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has made it clear that we in no way intend the Bill to regulate lay trade union representation in the workplace, whether full time or part time. Nor do we intend it to put additional burdens on unions that provide legal advice to their members. However, contrary to what was suggested, that does not mean that union members will have no protection, for a number of reasons. First, any reserved legal activities that a union undertakes will have to be carried out by lawyers and will be subject to regulation. We are talking about not regulating the union as an entity, rather than not regulating the lawyers who work within it. In addition, the exemption applies only where the union is providing legal services deriving from its membership. If the union wanted to provide legal services to the public at large, it would have to be regulated as an entity and would have to get an ABS licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07060428000111">The Royal Automobile Club, the Automobile Association or any other members&#146; organisation would be in the same position; as long as it provided services only for its own members, and as long as its membership was not so wide that it amounted to a section of the public under clause 15(6), it, too, would not have to be regulated. It is common for members of unions to be referred to outside firms with which the union has arrangements, but where trade unionists have a complaint about the way in which they have been represented, they can of course go to the certification officer, if there is a breach of the rulebook; that remedy is not available to somebody who is being represented by a citizens advice bureau.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70604-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07060428000112">The issue of not delegating complaints-handling to the Bar Standards Board is central to our policy of creating a single, independent complaints body. The office for legal complaints should deal with all complaints of up to &#163;20,000, although that limit can be increased. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw talked about the need for it to be higher. The Law Society&#146;s current ceiling is &#163;15,000, so the provision is better than that, but we will certainly consider the points that he made. The OLC will be free to seek advice or assistance from anybody, including approved regulators; that is important, and it means that the much lauded expertise of the Bar Standards Board will not be lost. It is imperative that the OLC be independent. It is a new redress system; it is not the Bar Standards Board. There must not be the impression  <br>

 The hon. and learned Lady seems to suggest that she fully accepts the comments made by the hon. Members for North Durham (Mr. Jones) and for Bassetlaw (John Mann) to the effect that all lawyers are chisellers and not to be trusted, and that we are in effect talking about an outlaw profession. She has been an honourable member of the profession for a long time; is she just accepting those remarks? Is she not prepared to stand up for a profession full of hard-working, honest people who are trying to do a good job, and who believe that they are following a vocation? Is she not prepared to defend her profession at all?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman does not listen to what my hon. Friends the Members for North Durham and for Bassetlaw are talking about. They have laid a large number of legitimate complaints that have been upheld by disciplinary bodies. They have both made it clear that so far none of those concerned have been found not culpable in those cases. That is entirely right, and I do not understand why the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire wants to make the point that my hon. Friends are misguided in their criticism of those wrong solicitors who shame him, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate and me as members of what should be an honourable profession. Bad lawyers must be dealt with severely, and they will be dealt with severely. The hon.

It will ensure that the regulatory structure within which the legal services operate is flexible and modern. It will strengthen the position and standing of legal services in England and Wales to secure greater public and consumer confidence at home, bring greater independence to the regulation of legal services and retain the sector&#146;s long established and respected international position.</p>

 I see that we have a little more time than usual, so I look forward to my usual one-hour speech, followed by a fabulous response from my hon. Friend the Minister. I am struggling slightly with my voice, so I may speak a little more quietly than usual although the Boots product which is the equivalent of Strepsils seems to be doing a pretty good job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07060428000131">I shall briefly present a picture of the economy in central Scotland. From my perspective the essence of the central region is the old Falkirk, Stirling and Clackmannanshire. It all sounds rather parochial but it is a big chunk of the UK economy. Not unreasonably from my perspective as the MP for Falkirk, I see central Scotland as an area that works outwards from Falkirk as the hub, through a series of spokes which include places such as Stirling and parts of Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire. It includes businesses of all sizes, which will be affected by trade unions and other interests. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to convince me that the economy of Falkirk and central Scotland is a high priority for him and his colleagues in government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07060428000132">When I entered the House and prepared my maiden speech, I reread the maiden speech of my predecessor but one, Harry Ewing&#151;Lord Ewing of Kirkford. It contained much that was of great value. He had a hugely successful career and is still regarded locally in Falkirk, Grangemouth and Stirlingshire as a manwho interpreted the political landscape with great intelligence and had a fine political career. In his maiden speech&#151;I think that he would be comfortable with my saying this&#151;he said, to paraphrase over a series of paragraphs, that Falkirk is, always has been and always will be an iron town. In fact, within about five years, pretty much all of the iron foundries that served the shipbuilding industry of the Clyde had closed and the economy of Scotland&#151;more to the point, as a local representative, the economy of central Scotland and Falkirk&#151;had changed beyond imagination, even beyond the imagination of Lord Ewing, who was well qualified to try to project a dozen years into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07060428000133">Yet, in the economy of my area now, we have manufacturing still: it would not be true to say that it has disappeared. In reality, the economy of central Scotland remains extremely mixed. We have a successful and famous tertiary manufacturing bus factory, which is now called Alexander Dennis. It has always had &#147;Alexander&#148; in its name. Two or three years ago, following the collapse of the parent company, Mayflower, it looked as though we could lose 1,000 jobs and that would be the end of it. Historically, that would have been pretty tragic given the bus building industry&#146;s links to the iron foundries, metal industries and shipbuilding further down the Clyde. All the iron foundries have gone&#151;most of them are now well-appointed houses&#151;but the bus manufacturing company still exists.</p>

existed before. Many are highly skilled and some are less skilled&#151;there is a great deal of metal bashing&#151;but a lot of it is good, solid, practical, skilled, tradesman-like activity. That, to some degree, is what marks out the Falkirk economy from the economies in parts of central Scotland that are some way out from the main metropolitan bases. There is a great story of survival and success. Alexander Dennis now manufactures buses that are sold, sometimes in kit form, all over the world. It still employs 800 or 900 people. Symbolically, that is almost&#151;obviously, not equally&#151;as important as the jobs themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07060428000135">The Falkirk economy, like every regional or local economy in the UK, requires a strong UK economy. It is fair to say that for the past 10 years we have had a very stable economy; the Minister will know more about that than me and will be able to say more about it in due course. The UK economy has not only been extremely stable and well managed but has created an environment where companies such as my local companies in Falkirk can do extremely well. They can compete with the best, not only in Scotland but in the UK and across the rest of the world. Alexander Dennis is a good indication of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07060428000136">A strong economy means opportunities for everyone. We do not want economies to consist only of low-skill, service-based sectors where people do not receive sufficient training, are paid at the bottom end of the scale, and so forth. In my area, we have, to a large degree, a correlation between good employment levels and significant social justice. Falkirk has unemployment levels of just over 3 per cent., as against 7.5 per cent. before 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07060428000137">I declare an interest in the jobcentre in Falkirk because I opened it&#151;and got a plaque on the wall&#151;two years ago when we went through some pain in closing down one or two small jobcentres. The Department for Work and Pensions has done a fabulous job. Other organisations, such as the Shaw Trust, with which we have had a good relationship in the past few years, had a great effect on placing those who are furthest from the job market in employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07060428000138">I have been Member of Parliament for Falkirk for the past six years. In the first couple of years, people would come to me and say, &#147;I&#146;ve just failed my medical. What shall I do about incapacity benefit?&#148; In fact, they had passed their medical and could now work. It has been an education to me to see organisations such as the Shaw Trust and Jobcentre Plus picking up those people, who are now in employment. The relationship between unemployment and employment is more complex because people who were formerly on incapacity benefit are now in employment. That enormously increases the affluence&#151;if I may put it that way; the affluence is not huge&#151;of families who were among the least well off. They can never be raised above the most modest way of life until they are in employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07060428000139">Two or three years ago, there was a strong correlation between a man being unemployed and his partner being unemployed. That may have been due to social or domestic pressure, but it was a fact. We are beginning to break the correlation. That is enormously important.</p>

Plus and the Shaw Trust. I met the great chief executive of Lomond plant hire, which is a medium-sized company that employs between 200 and 250 people. It trains people to operate plant, so the work is not unskilled. The company is entirely organic&#151;it came out of the Falkirk economy. It is based on an industrial estate and, although I had seen the odd vehicle driving around, since such companies are mostly located in the places where they operate forklift trucks, JCBs and so on, one does not have a sense of their public or practical presence in, for example, the building industry. However, when one visits the location and meets the people who run the organisation, it isstriking how enormously successful it has been in the past 10 years under an effective, strong and competitive UK economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07060428000141">Another company, Applied Sweepers, is just around the back. That sounds like parochial stuff to the House, but those companies are multi-million-pound businesses, which effectively came from nowhere and out of the imagination and hard work of the people who created them. They are organic and Falkirk based. Applied Sweepers is famous for the green machine that sweeps our streets throughout the UK and, indeed, the world. It is an enormously successful company, and it is a source of pride that companies such as Lomond plant hire and Applied Sweepers have managed to achieve that success in Falkirk. They are run by Falkirk and central region people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07060428000142">Another famous local company is called Mathieson&#146;s. It makes my sandwiches and those of many other people in Falkirk. It is hugely a successful bakery, which recently bought fabulous premises, helped by Scottish Enterprise. Of course, that is devolved to the Scottish Executive, but it is fair to praise it in this place. The new factory that Mathieson&#146;s operates in Falkirk has made a step change, which means that it can serve major companies such as Asda and Tesco. They have an excellent policy of taking on local produce and using it throughout the region. In the case of Mathieson&#146;s, that means sandwiches, cakes and so on, but there are local providers throughout the country whose products are taken on. We should show Asda and Tesco respect for having the sense to realise that people want to buy local products from places such as Falkirk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07060428000143">There is another angle to which I would not have given much thought in the past. Sometimes people who run thriving companies operate out of industrial estates. On some such estates, one or two people could perhaps be categorised as behaving antisocially. They are not on a housing estate or in a house&#151;they are behaving badly not where they live but where they operate their business. It is not unknown&#151;I have checked it with colleagues across central Scotland&#151;to have enormously successful local ventures on industrial estates, but to see people at the margins who are, or are bordering on, being antisocial in carrying out their activities. Ultimately, I suppose it is a matter for the police, but it is interesting from a business perspective. If colleagues with constituencies in central Scotland or perhaps even the Minister visited a local industrial estate in the area, they might find germs of companies that they had not even heard of before. They are profitable, turning over a great profit and treating their staff extremely well by training and paying them well&#151;miles above the national minimum wage. There is  <br>

aspiration all around, but sometimes these companies are plagued by a couple of people or a couple of businesses at the margins on those estates, which we really should be taking a very close look at because it can affect the way that business is done&#151;parochial point now made, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07060428000144">It is true to say that Falkirk is in a pretty unique position and location when it comes to business. We have three motorways surrounding us: the M876, which is the wee one that takes us up to Kincardine bridge; the M8, which takes us down to Glasgow; and the M9 up to Edinburgh. There are five stations in the constituency and it takes about 25 minutes to get to Edinburgh or Glasgow. Most people go to Edinburgh, but a good chunk go to Glasgow. Anyone standing at Falkirk, High in the morning will see a great welter of people travelling to jobs, perhaps to the Royal Bank and the financial institutions in Edinburgh, or perhaps to Glasgow council and many other businesses inthe Glasgow area. When I stand there at Falkirk, High&#151;perhaps the best place to get a perspective on all this&#151;it seems to me that central Scotland and the Scottish economy are really part of what I like to think of as Glasburgh, which I view as a big metropolis extending from Glasgow to Edinburgh, taking in the peripheral areas and acting as the economic driving force of Scotland to a very large degree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07060428000145">Scotland is particularly interesting in respect of its outlying economies and cultures, but the area between Edinburgh and Glasgow&#151;with Falkirk right in the middle&#151;is also particularly interesting. To some degree it is for the UK Government and to some degree for the Scottish Executive to work out what should be done. I am not always absolutely optimistic about the ability of the new Scottish Executive to do that, but let us wait and see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07060428000146">It seems to me that an important role should be played by Government generally, and particularly the UK Government, in the context of ensuring a strong economy. The Government should ensure that fledging companies, which can become the Lomond plant hires and Applied Sweepers of tomorrow, are properly encouraged and brought on. Many areas in Falkirk and the central region of Scotland can be developed, yet it seems strange that many attempts to develop are still awaiting success, if I can put it in the most benign way. As a modest Member of Parliament, I do not quite understand why, but the reality is that despite the short journey time to Edinburgh or Glasgow, it is difficultto attract Scottish non-governmental organisations, which seem to prefer Stirling, Perth and Inverness. I do not know whether it is because they are more posh or because people prefer to live there or what, but the operating costs should be less in the central region. These are mainly decisions for the Scottish Executive, but not exclusively so, because some matters are decisions for the UK Government&#151;my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07060428000147">Fundamentally, from my perspective, there seems to be an odd economic dysfunction. Falkirk is, as I said, very close to Edinburgh and Glasgow, right in the middle of a motorway system and has five stations. If we spoke to a foreign national, he would say that it sounds like one big metropolis or one big city&#151;and yet there is a big space right next to the motorway in Falkirk, which for some reason is very difficult to sell. I am not exactly sure why that is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07060428000148">As I look up at the clock, Madam Deputy Speaker, I suspect that the Minister may be getting worried that I am going to take up all the allotted time for the Adjournment, so fair enough. I shall cut my comments slightly short, but, if I may, I should like to quote briefly a couple of excellent local agencies, one of which is Falkirk council, which used a consultancy called DTZ Pieda to say:</p>
<a name="70604-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="07060428000224"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The loss of traditional and more recently high technology manufacturing capacity, and the growth of a service oriented economy, has been the key feature of economic change since the 1970s.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07060428000149">That relates to my earlier reference to Lord Ewing. It continued:</p>
<a name="70604-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="07060428000225"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nevertheless, by 2003, Falkirk still retained a substantial proportion of manufacturing&#151;18 per cent. of employment and 25 per cent. of gross value added&#151;in its industrial structure.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07060428000150">The consultancy went on to say that there was a dichotomy between the petrochemical industry&#151;BP Grangemouth, which happens to lie outside my constituency&#151;and the rest of the economy. In pointof fact, however, we have a mixed economy, with a productive local work force. A bit of imagination needs to be applied to the question of why that dichotomy exists in spite of the substantial rise in employment. I will not go on at great length about the figures that show that if the petrochemical sector is included, mean average earnings are much higher than if we extract the petrochemical sector from the figures. It makes no sense to take the petrochemical sector out of the economy of central Scotland, because its existenceis real.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07060428000151">If we take the petrochemical sector out, however, it tells us a little about what is going on elsewhere in the local economy in central Scotland. There may be a story about local skill levels. Forth Valley college, which is expanding and dominates education provision in central Scotland, is taking the bit between its teeth and now focuses, under Linda Mackay, its excellent principal, on the vocational. Although it also provides degree courses, art and so on&#151;all of which I know to be good&#151;the reality is that getting people into good, medium to high-skilled jobs is key. Stewart Hogg at Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley puts a great deal of time and effort into developing businesses in Falkirk, as the dominant part of Scotland in population terms. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70604-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07060428000152">As to development and land use in central Scotland, the great space at the edge of the motorway, which seems eminently useable, has, for the past six years since I have been the local Member, been the subject of a great deal of hype. Perhaps some of it is not hype, but a realistic projection of the area&#146;s potential. One good thing that has happened is that a new football stadium has been built for Falkirk football club, which has been really successful. My area has three professional football clubs.</p>

I once asked a question of Dan Macdonald, who is the chief executive of what is apparently a public company&#151;although it seems to me more like a family company. At a public meeting, I asked, &#147;Who will move into the many offices and hotels you are going to build? You don&#146;t have to tell me their  <br>

names, as it might be a matter of commercial confidentiality, and I will take your word for it. Can you just tell me that there are one or two interested parties for the space that Macdonald and Falkirk council were creating in the important and useful gateway project for Falkirk?&#148; He said, &#147;I cannot answer that.&#148; He put up someone junior to tell me why he could not answer it. He wrote me a letter, which, uniquely in my parliamentary experience, should have been written in green ink&#151;he had typed it, or someone had typed it for him. It more or less said that it was outrageous of me to ask him that question. He said that there is all this space, and people will come and use it&#151;if we build it, they will come&#151;and I merely asked him to convince me that one or two people might come to use it.</p>

I ask him to take full responsibility for the high employment in Falkirk&#151;I am going to challenge him on that&#151;and to convince me that the interests of the people of Falkirk and central Scotland are high on his agenda.</p>

debate. Since he was elected, he has always been an outspoken advocate for, and tireless champion of, central Scotland, in particular the Falkirk area that he proudly represents. I also congratulate him on his magnificent struggle with failing health. He managed to get through his speech without his voice giving way, although he had me worried when he declared an interest in Jobcentre Plus. I was not sure what he was going on to say, but he assures me that he is interested in it because he opened it, and there is a plaque on the wall to confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para0"><a name="07060428000163">This is an important debate and it is important to have it at this time. The performance of the economy is always crucial, but at this time, in a period of political flux, it is essential to recognise just how well the economy of central Scotland is doing, and how important it is not to take any decisions or pursue any policy paths that will put the state of the economyat risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07060428000164">As my hon. Friend properly outlined, the central Scotland economy makes a vital contribution to the overall Scottish economy. If one widens it out from the central region to what he called &#147;Glasburgh&#148;, we are talking somewhere in excess of 70 per cent. of the value of the entire Scottish economy. I take issue with him on one thing, however: I gently remind him that central Scotland extends west of Glasgow&#151;indeed, some of the most dynamic, exciting and beautiful parts lie there. However, I will not chide him any further. I think he takes my point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07060428000165">With the area making such a large contribution to the overall Scottish economy, it is reassuring to remind ourselves that as recently as April this year, no less an authority than the chief economist of the RBS Group, Dr. Andrew McLaughlin, said that the</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07060428000166">How right he was. The latest growth figures show Scottish output rising by 2.6 per cent. over the year, well above the long-term growth rate of 1.8 per cent. That is the highest calendar-year increase in GDP since 1997. It also marks the 10th consecutive quarter of greater-than-trend GDP growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07060428000167">As my hon. Friend said, dynamic sectors such as the financial services sector are creating a prosperous Scotland. Over 2006, financial services grew at the staggering rate of 8.1 per cent. Manufacturing, which played an important part in my hon. Friend&#146;s speech, experienced a 0.9 per cent. quarterly increase in output, meaning that the sector&#151;which, as we all know, has struggled, as it has done throughout the western and the developed world&#151;is no longer in recession. Gross value added per head in Scotland exceeds that in Wales, Northern Ireland and all the English regions except London and the south-east and east of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07060428000168">Not only is the Scottish economy performing strongly at the moment, but the predictions are also encouraging. Independent forecasters such as the Fraser of Allandar Institute and the Ernst and Young ITEM Club suggest that the economy will continue to grow at above its long-term rate into 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07060428000169">In the past the economy has done well, but growth has often come without jobs attached to it.

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07060428000170">As my hon. Friend said, stability generated by the United Kingdom&#146;s strong macro-economic framework has delivered the strongest Scottish labour market for decades. Much as I should like to take credit for that, I think my hon. Friend will agree that much of the credit must go to the excellent stewardship of the economy achieved by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I think everyone in Scotland will recognise that just as he has delivered an outstanding economy overall, he is well placed to take over leadership of the United Kingdom on the basis of his outstanding track record in delivering a strong Scottish economy, with record low inflation, record investment in our public services, and record numbers of people in work. That is the legacy of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and it gets his premiership off to an outstanding start.</p>

Although all parts of Scotland are making their contribution, tonight we are focusing particularly on the contribution made in central Scotland. In termsof gross value added per head, both Edinburgh and Glasgow easily exceed the UK average and are continuing to grow at a quicker rate than the national average. I have already mentioned the tremendous success of the financial sector in Scotland. Long may that continue. It now employs directly 110,000 people, and a similar number indirectly. New jobs are being created there all the time.</p>

constituency MPs are entitled and supposed to do, which is to make a case on behalf of their constituency on the Floor of the House. His constituency is a prime illustration of the success of the central Scotland economy. In the past year alone, unemployment has fallen by 9 per cent. in Falkirk and now sits below the Scottish average. I am sure that his predecessors would have liked to have been able to come to the House when unemployment in Falkirk was below the Scottish average. In his constituency and mine, unemployment was into double figures, where it stayed for many years. He can now boast that he is an MP at a time when unemployment in Falkirk is below the Scottish average. That does not happen often. He must take some credit for that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07060428000178">My hon. Friend mentioned Alexander Dennis, the coach builder, which is renowned not just throughout Scotland but throughout the world. On a trip to Shanghai, he and I spotted some buses that were made in Falkirk trundling through the streets, so they are clearly well known and well regarded throughout the world. We congratulate Alexander Dennis on winning in March a contract from Stagecoach worth &#163;55 million, for another 393 buses and, just last week, on being awarded a contract by the National Express Group worth &#163;26 million for 119 double-decker buses. In addition, it is making great strides forward. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland saw that when he visited the company recently: he saw the &#147;eco-warrior&#148;, the environmentally friendly double-decker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07060428000179">My hon. Friend invited me to reflect on the situation of some industrial estates throughout Scotland, including in my constituency. I have an industrial estate in my constituency that closely mirrors the one that he described. In Port Glasgow, the Devol industrial estate does not employ people in the vast numbers of years gone by, but it still makes an important contribution to the local economy in Inverclyde. I can think of several companies there that are still employing many of my constituents in well-paid, well-trained jobs. We lose those jobs at our peril, and we minimise the importance of that at our peril.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07060428000180">I have had a lot of dealings with&#151;I will pick just one of the companies&#151;McLaren Packaging Ltd, which has gone from fairly standard manufacturing of boxes for television sets to sophisticated manufacturing of those cardboard presentation tubes that Scotch whisky now comes in. It is a very skilled job. Many millions of pounds have been invested in the necessary capital, equipment and training of the work force. The Scotch whisky industry is thriving. It is worth a huge amount to the Scottish economy. Companies such as McLaren Packaging Ltd play an important part in allowing Scotch whisky to expand into markets where it is seen more as a niche product. The company will soon be employing upwards of 100 people, and has plans to expand even further. It is making a tremendous contribution to the economy of Inverclyde, and by extension to the economy of central Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07060428000181">Such industrial estates are not without their problems, as my hon. Friend outlined, but we give them up at our peril. We allow them to be sold off for housing at our peril. They may not be what they once  <br>

were, but they are still important. We must not minimise the importance of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07060428000182">On the broader front, the success of the economy in central Scotland has allowed the Government to make available to the Scottish Executive record sums of money to invest in our vital public services. In Falkirk alone, we have 23 more consultants, 88 more nurses, more midwives, 24 more dentists, and 162 more teachers. That is directly related to the strength of the economy. If it were not for the strength of the UK economy at macro level, and the strength of the central Scotland economy benefiting from that, we would not have the resources to allow us to invest in the college that my hon. Friend mentioned, in the schools and in the hospitals. It is important that we continue with the policies that have given us that strong macro-economic growth, if the new Executive are to continue to have the money that we have made available to the Executive to invest in vital public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07060428000183">Tourism in Scotland has increased. The success of the magnificent Falkirk wheel has helped in that. I visited it last year, and it is an astonishing feat of engineering. It is distinctly Scottish, and a triumph of engineering skill. It has taken Falkirk from being an also-ran as a tourist destination to the 12th most visited tourist destination in Scotland, and that ranking will only continue to improve. The wheel has played a tremendous part in that, and I am sure that the local economy near the wheel is benefiting from it. That stands as a great tribute to the people who had the foresight to come up with the idea for the venture, and who then implemented it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07060428000184">As well as successes in tourism, manufacturing and the financial sector, there is also in the wider central Scotland area a blossoming of a relatively new industry: the life science research industry. Cognia, a US specialist life science database company, has expanded its Edinburgh operations by recruiting 75 new staff. Many life science research companies are locating to Scotland. There is a cluster in and around central Scotland that rivals&#151;and is secondly only to&#151;that of Cambridge in the whole of the UK. That is an exciting development. We must make the right macroeconomic choices to foster and encourage those companies, which will in due course employ my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70604-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07060428000185">My hon. Friend made a strong case for the continued success of the central Scotland economy. It is doing well, but he is right to highlight the fact that we must continue to make the right policy choices for it to continue to flourish. Solid economic growth and success does not happen by accident. It happens because tough decisions are made, because the Government have the foresight to put in place the proper macro-economic policies, and because we have over the past eight years worked very closely with the Scottish Executive to ensure that in places such as Falkirk and Grangemouth the benefits of it are enjoyed by our constituents. I hope that that close co-operation on behalf of our constituents flourishes in years to come, and I know that as long as the people of Falkirk have as vociferous an advocate as my hon. Friend, they will continue to enjoy the economic success that they are enjoying today.</p>
