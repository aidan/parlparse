 (Con): What advice he has had from Ofgem on the security of electricity supplies.  [13802]
</p>


<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50721-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan Johnson): </b> 
 The Department is in regular contact with Ofgem. My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy has met John Mogg, chairman of Ofgem, on several occasions to discuss various issues, including security of electricity supply. The Government&#039;s and Ofgem&#039;s shared understanding of the outlook for electricity and gas supply is set out in a report, which has today been laid before the House. It is available in the Library. I propose, subject to the usual channels, to offer the House the chance to debate the report in the autumn.
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50721-01_spnew0"><b> James Duddridge: </b> 
 Given that severe weather this winter would require gas supplies to be cut off to industry to maintain electricity generation, and the fact that the Secretary of State has not explained what will replace some 30 per cent. of power station capacity, which is due to close in 2015, why has he placed a report before the House only today, when it was required under section 172 of the Energy Act 2004? Why does it take a parliamentary question from a mere first-time Back Bencher to elicit the information?
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50721-01_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Not a mere Back Bencher, but someone who has forced the Government to produce a report today. We are not required by law to report at a specific time. Ofgem and the Government believed that the primary objective was to give as full and as clear a report as we could, including the issues that may come up this winter. That is why we have published the report 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1385</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>now. The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members would be glad to have a debate on an important and serious matter but it should not revolve around peripheral issues such as the timing of the report.

 (Lab): Will the Secretary of State tell the House what assessments he and his colleagues have made in the context of energy security of the work of places such as Woking, which now generates 135 per cent. of its electricity needs, and the Mayor of London&#039;s announcement that he wants London to be energy self sufficient in a decade? Is the Department working on the security implications of local generating systems?
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50721-01_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Yes. We must ask whether we have what is called the headline plant margin&#151;the headroom&#151;when considering security of supply. We currently have 22 per cent. headroom whereas this time last year, we had only 16 per cent. That is important for security of supply.

<a name="stpa_0">We are also committed to renewable energy. We have the 10 per cent. renewables obligation. The announcement and the initiative that my hon. Friend mentioned make an important contribution to security of supply and the related issue of ensuring that we tackle climate change.

 I certainly did read that report&#151;as did the rest of the British public, because it was leaked to three Sunday newspapers the weekend I was appointed. It set out the issues that we face on energy, and replicated the points made in the 2003 energy White Paper. Of course security of supply is a central issue for the Government and for the House to tackle, as are climate change and the objective in the energy White Paper to ensure that we reduce the number of people in fuel poverty. Those are all important issues.

<a name="50721-01_para15">
<a name="stpa_3">The hon. Gentleman talks about our getting the report out by the skin of our teeth. We have Trade and Industry questions today, and we have had a question from the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)&#151;on which I congratulate him; it is a very pertinent question&#151;which has given me the opportunity to respond, and we have lodged a report, not a statement, in the Library of the House in anticipation of a debate in the autumn. Even the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), on this last day of term, should accept that that is not a bad thing for the Government to do if we want a serious debate on security of energy supply.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50721-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 I very much welcome the fact that the Secretary of State wants a serious debate on the security of energy supply. At the previous DTI questions, however, does he recall saying that he had only been in the job for five weeks? We can understand why he is feeling a little overwhelmed by what his predecessors have left in his in-tray&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Eight years, this Government have been in office. I should like the Secretary of State to confirm that this memorandum states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;The electricity generating margin . . . could narrow sharply over periods this Winter . . . in the event of bad weather. The margin is also expected to tighten after 2008&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-01_para16">
<a name="stpa_4">Are not those problems very urgent? I am grateful for the debate that the right hon. Gentleman is going to give us on the subject, because it is very serious.
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50721-01_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 In the interest of having a proper debate on a serious issue, of course we have to look at this. The issue of security of supply is particularly important over the winter period, and that memorandum was pointing that out to an incoming Minister. We have dealt with this in terms of the market having the capacity to ensure security of supply, which is the right way to approach this. The Government have to ensure that we are convinced that the market is providing that capacity, well ahead of the winter period. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that officials should point out to me the challenges that we face, and it is absolutely right that we should debate those challenges in the House. I do not understand his argument that my predecessor has somehow left me in a bad situation. My predecessor did not pass a law to say that we were no longer to have bad winters, so we shall always have to prepare for them and ensure security of supply.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50721-01_spnew9"><b> Anne Moffat  (East Lothian)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that nuclear power must play a major part in ensuring security of supply? What does he see as the short-term, medium-term and long-term prospects for supply from the nuclear industry?
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50721-01_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 When considering climate change and security of supply, we need to look right across the range, including at nuclear energy. My hon. Friend will know that our energy White Paper said that we had left the door open to nuclear energy. We also said that if we were going to go down the route to new build, we should need to produce a new White Paper and fresh consultation. That is still the Government&#039;s position. In

<p><a name="qn_1">2. <a name="50721-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Graham Allen  (Nottingham, North)</b> 
 (Lab): If he will take steps to assist those who have been the victims of loan sharks and whose cases have passed through the courts.  [13803]
</p>


<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50721-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe): </b> 
 The Government recognise the need to protect consumers against unfair lending practices. The Consumer Credit Bill will modernise the consumer credit market and drive out rogues from the market. The Bill will make it much easier for consumers to challenge unfair loan agreements. There will be a new right to challenge unfair relationships arising out of the terms of loan agreements or the way in which the lender acts, and borrowers will also have the right to take disputes with their lenders to an ombudsman service, so that they do not have the added burden of going through a lengthy and expensive court battle.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50721-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 May I pay a personal tribute to the Minister for moving forward the Consumer Credit Bill&#151;it may well be the first Bill of this Parliament that passes all stages; I certainly hope so&#151;and to Opposition Members for their constructive contribution to it in Committee? The Minister will remember that I brought a case to his attention recently. Mr. Frederick Jones took out a loan of &#163;7,700 and ended up having to pay back &#163;110,000. Will the Minister ensure that even people like Mr. Jones, whose cases have been through the courts, will now be caught by the retrospectivity clauses in the Bill? We are all very grateful that those clauses have been included, particularly people such as Mr. Jones and, I am sure, the constituents of many other hon. Members.
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50721-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks and the work that he has carried out on behalf of Mr. Jones. He knows that I cannot go into the detail of the case, but Mr. Jones&#039;s case was an inspiration to all of us in bringing forward legislation. I would like to add my thanks to the Opposition for the constructive way in which the Bill has gone through the House so rapidly. I assure my hon. Friend, however, that the unfairness test and the licensing regime will prevent the type of case with which Mr. Jones had to deal from happening again.

I echo his comments in terms of the constructive approach taken by all parties to getting a way forward for protecting debtors and lenders. Will he give a firm commitment to review the effect of the legislation once it is in place, because considerable concerns were expressed as to the effect of the new law, and particularly whether it would have an unintended consequence of driving commercial lenders out of the market for those on low and uncertain incomes, thereby giving succour to the loan sharks whom we do not want preying on the most vulnerable members of our community?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50721-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The point is well made. The Consumer Credit Bill is not to be seen in isolation&#151;we have introduced loan shark pilots in Birmingham and Glasgow, we are working with credit unions, and we are working on financial inclusion We are considering all the issues in relation to education, money advice and debt counselling. The Bill is central to that, but we will review the situation in two years as is normal practice for Governments. I remind the House, however, that the last time that consumer credit was considered in terms of legislation was 1974, so the Bill is certainly needed.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50721-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. John McFall  (West Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The best way to ensure that those who are victims of loan sharks no longer become victims is through financial inclusion. In that respect, the Government&#039;s response to the Treasury Committee&#039;s report on cash machines is breathtakingly complacent and blind to the trends in that industry. Can the Minister assure me that he will work with his colleagues in the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions, along with the Treasury Committee, to ensure that we get reasonable financial inclusion and achieve the goal of bringing the financially excluded into the mainstream financial community?
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50721-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who is the chair of the Treasury Committee, and to the work that that Committee has done on this and related issues. I assure him that the financial inclusion fund will provide &#163;45 million to be spent on education and support for bodies that help individuals.

 Our policy is to provide the right macro-economic conditions and support to enable British companies to compete successfully in world markets.

</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50721-02_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Moon: </b> 
 As Parliament faces the recess, workers in two factories in my constituency face a summer shutdown tomorrow. This morning, I was yet again contacted by the BBC informing me that 250 workers at the Pendragon furniture factory will face that shutdown with redundancy payments. What reassurance can I take to the workers of Christy Tyler, Sony and Wrigley Kraft that they will not face a summer of uncertainty about whether there will be jobs waiting for them at the end, that the Department will work with its equivalent in the Welsh Assembly Government to bring new high-value, high-quality jobs to Wales that will suit their

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50721-02_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I can certainly empathise with that final point. We must set this in context, because the Bridgend labour market is relatively buoyant, although the town has taken a battering lately, and I pay tribute to my hon.    Friend and her colleagues in neighbouring constituencies for their work to try to address the immediate problems of the area. Some of the changes are inevitable. The Sony factory, for instance, which produces screens, is a pretty inevitable casualty of the move to flat screens, which are much more mobile around the world. That does not make it any less devastating, however, for the individuals and families involved. I know that colleagues in the Welsh Assembly Government are working with Team Wales partners&#151;the Welsh Development Agency, ELWa, Jobcentre Plus, Careers Wales and others&#151;and are ready to provide co-ordinated assistance and support to help people move on to fresh employment opportunities in what remains, on the whole, a relatively healthy labour market.

</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50721-02_spnew9"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to signal this point, which I made at the outset. The way to safeguard jobs for the future is to go for high-value, high-quality jobs and an innovative economy. We cannot be protective about these matters; we must compete in what is a very challenging world market. In the short time in which I have been in this job, I have been very impressed by the engagement of people in the manufacturing industry. Yesterday, I attended a meeting of the Manufacturing Forum, which I chair jointly with Kevin Smith of GKN. The energy and will to take forward manufacturing in this country is palpable, and that is the direction in which we should take our economy.

 Yes, indeed. We have an economy in which employment is at record levels.

It is always sad when a long-standing employer, and very often a high-quality one, is affected by the competitive market in which we operate, but looking to the future is what is important. I recommend all Members to support the enterprise week coming up in November and to encourage others. If we had the number of women setting up business that there are in America, for example, we would have another three quarters of a million companies. We need to encourage enterprise by our young people, and by everybody, to respond to the challenges we face, and I wish the taskforce well in tackling the local issues referred to by my hon. Friend.

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="50721-03_spnew6"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 That is an important point, which was highlighted in the performance and innovation unit report in 1999 on the post office network, which gained broad support across the House. Part of the report was about the transformation of the Post Office as it loses its traditional customer base. Some 40 per cent. of its work was paying out pensions and benefits, but more and more people have those paid into their bank accounts. There is an enormous opportunity for the network to move to new forms of work, including community-based work. There is an awful lot going on, with the support of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, in order to make that work, but the simple message is that people have to use the initiatives and use the post offices. Post offices have to get the footfall otherwise they will be commercially unviable for the independent small business men who run them.

 My hon. Friend is another former employee of Royal Mail; there seem to be a lot of us around today. I disagree with her on the issue of employee ownership. In all my time as leader of the Communication Workers Union I looked for ways in which employees could have a bigger stake and involvement in the company that day in and day out they helped to make successful. I am surprised that from Labour Benches people are asking me to rule out employee involvement. Our manifesto commitment was to look carefully at the impact of full market liberalisation on the Royal Mail, the universal service obligation and the uniform tariff. That is a job of work that cannot be done with one statement to the House. It requires a thorough job of work.

If the argument is made to me that the only way to create a successful, profitable Royal Mail is to privatise it, I reject that completely. A public sector success story with full commercial freedom is within the grasp of Royal Mail. We intend to tackle the very real problems that the hon.

 I thank the Minister for that reply. However, when negotiating with important international partners like China and India, it is important to be able to speak on one&#039;s own behalf. When the negotiators go in and negotiate on behalf of 25 countries, it is far more difficult for them to strike a good deal. This is of great concern to me and I would rather that Great Britain negotiated its own international contracts.

 My hon. Friend is right that it is important that all partners stick to agreements. He will be aware of the EU&#039;s anti-dumping legislation, which has recently been applied to textiles. The Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, recently negotiated on behalf of the EU an agreement on the limitation of exports from China to the EU market. As my hon. Friend knows, there has been a massive restructuring in the UK textile industry as a result of the end of the multi-fibre arrangement. We have planned ahead, but other countries have not. We must take account of the fact that we will not be able to compete in future on the basis of low value added goods.

 I am grateful for that reply. My primary concern is with women in retirement who are poor. The pension credit has helped 1.3 million women out of poverty, but my hon.

 Defence modernisation measures announced to Parliament and to Ministry of Defence staff today will improve the support given to our armed forces, release resources for the front line and for new capabilities, and make the best use of taxpayers&#039; money. The future defence supply chain initiative will improve current service levels, enhance operational capability and put the armed forces in a better position to cope with &quot;surge&quot; logistics requirements, while also significantly reducing costs.
</p>

<a name="50721-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_0">The Ministry of Defence has selected an in-house option, which involved close consultation with the trade unions, to provide the best possible combination of effectiveness and cost in our defence supply chain. By updating processes, improving staff training, rationalising the distribution network and closing storage depots at Stafford by the end of 2007, Llangennech by mid-2008 and Longtown by mid-2009, we expect to make savings of over &#163;50 million a year by 2010 and over &#163;400 million during the next 10 years. The new organisation will require about 2,000 fewer civilian posts and about 50 fewer armed forces personnel. Those reductions will contribute to the wider MOD manpower reductions announced in the 2004 White Paper.

<a name="50721-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_1">A study of the future role of the defence munitions centre at Crombie in west Dunfermline has been completed, and the MOD has decided&#151;subject to consultation with the national trade unions&#151;to implement its recommendations. The study determined that the explosives storage capacity available at DMC Crombie was not required to meet the known and projected storage liability of its customers. In future, Crombie will concentrate on providing a loading-offloading function for Her Majesty&#039;s ships and royal fleet auxiliaries, together with berthing and other jetty operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">If the study&#039;s recommendations are implemented, there will be a reduction of 142 posts at DMC Crombie. It is expected that 67 posts will go in the first year, with the remaining 75 being phased out between 2006&#150;07 and 2009&#150;10. Implementation of the recommendations will have the potential to deliver savings of some &#163;18.1 million over 10 years. Subject to the conclusion of trade union consultation, the Army Base Repair Organisation&#039;s proposal to start phase 1 of a two-part rationalisation programme will also begin. Phase 1 addresses the immediate impact of the downturn in the ABRO defence revenue projections, but it will not diminish the range of capabilities that the organisation can currently deliver to the front line. As a result, ABRO will reduce its head count to approximately 2,150 posts by 31 March 2006, which includes the potential for up to 246 redundancies.

The Ministry of Defence is also announcing two such changes today. The cold war radar station at RAF Saxa Vord on the Shetland island of Unst will be put on care and maintenance from April 2006, subject to consultation with the trade unions. That will mean that the station is effectively closed, but that the main operational part of the estate will continue to be maintained should it be required for future use. Further work will be undertaken to consider how much of the remainder of the station will be retained. Radar cover at the level required can be provided by other RAF radars augmented by those of the National Air Traffic Service. Placing the station on care and maintenance means that we can reinstate radar capability should the threat assessment change.

In addition, 2625 (County of Cornwall) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment, based alongside 1 Squadron at RAF St. Mawgan will be disbanded with effect from November 2006. That decision has been taken because Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment squadrons need to be based alongside regular units to maximise training opportunities and to give auxiliary personnel access to equipment held by the regular unit. With 1 Squadron&#039;s relocation, that would not be possible at St. Mawgan. Around 75 reservists will be affected.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and wide-ranging these announcements are and what a grave discourtesy it is to the House that he has been forced to come here and did not offer a statement in the first place. I am rather sorry for the Minister, who is a courteous gentleman.

<a name="stpa_15">As the hon. Orkney and Shetland said, the discourtesy is compounded by the fact that the Secretary of State has time this afternoon to hold a press conference, at which journalists will be afforded the privilege of cross examining him&#151;a privilege denied to elected Members of this House. It is unacceptable that we will not have that privilege for a further three months.

<a name="stpa_16">Furthermore, although this is not one of a number of ministerial statements today, I understand that there is a proposal to scrap nearly all instructual flying at our 14 university air squadrons, which have been in existence since 1925. My understanding is that the proposal will take effect from 5 October&#151;five days before the House returns&#151;and that there is to be a briefing at RAF Cranwell next Wednesday when the university air squadron officers commanding will be briefed. I challenge the Minister to tell us whether that is true. What are his plans for the university air squadrons? It would be unacceptable if this decision, which affects about 1,000 students across the land, 60 per cent. of whom go on as pilots to join the RAF, were presented to us as a fait accompli when we return in October.

I understand that it is difficult for her and her constituents in Llangennech.

 What will the Leader of the House do to sort out the unedifying mess that we have seen in this place this morning? A Minister of the Crown has been dragged to the House, in response to an urgent question, to make a statement that clearly affects Members in all parts of the House? It is simply not good enough.

<a name="stpa_40">What will the Leader of the House do to address the fact that 156 written statements have been rushed out in the last few days before the recess? One cannot help but believe that the Government have not lost their habit of seeking to bury bad news. Will he explain why no statement was made to the House on the changes to the rules applying to special advisers and their relationship with civil servants? This week, that was raised with the Government by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Our concern about the &#039;hole in the corner&#039; way in which the changes were being proposed has been reinforced by the failure to inform parliament or make a public announcement about this amendment to the legislation.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_43">Despite the events of the past few weeks, Members will now not have the opportunity to question the Government on matters of terrorism, other important national issues or constituency issues until the week beginning 10 October. You will know, Mr. Speaker, that it is important to stress that the recess is much more than a holiday for Members; it is an essential time for us all to do important constituency work. But does the Leader of the House not accept that people outside Westminster will not understand this long gap during which MPs cannot question the Government about what they are doing? Will he now accept that it is time for MPs to be able to table and receive answers to written parliamentary questions right through recess periods, and for the Government to make written ministerial statements as appropriate during recess periods? Will he ensure that that change is introduced immediately?

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="50721-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am not entirely sure what the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the number of written ministerial statements is. I assume that he is saying that they should have been made, and that he is not saying that he would have preferred a smaller number, so he has left me in some difficulty as to what his precise point is. After all, each of the Ministers who have made those statements have informed the House, which I assume is precisely what he would have wanted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_44">On special advisers, a written ministerial statement has been made on that subject, and it is important that the House is kept informed in the normal way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_45">On the length of the recess, I am a little surprised that this is the first time that the hon. Gentleman has addressed the issue. He made no observation about it when I announced the date of the recess, and he made no observation yesterday in relation to the summer Adjournment debate, when the matter could properly have been raised. I am left with the slight feeling that perhaps only when the <i>Daily Mail</i> rang him up and asked him about it did he think that it was appropriate to make a comment&#151;a subject to which I might return next time he complains about a Minister not coming to the House and not keeping it properly informed. It might be that he prefers to see his name in the <i>Daily Mail</i> rather than in the pages of <i>Hansard.</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50721-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Winnick  (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I have always been against a 10-week break, but as someone who was on the picket line yesterday, with my hon. Friends and no Tory MPs, may I ask whether efforts will be made before the beginning of the summer recess to try to resolve that industrial dispute? If it is not resolved, is there not every possibility that further action will take place? The cleaners have a very strong case indeed&#151;they are not being treated the same as those who are directly employed by the Commons. Those who jeer should try living on &#163;5 an hour with no holiday entitlement and no pensions. Such hypocrisy is unacceptable in the House of Commons. I am pleased, however, that the House of Commons Commission is apparently to provide better accommodation than the squalid rooms that I mentioned last week. At least that is one step forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50721-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised this matter repeatedly. On the last occasion, I indicated that I would raise the matter in the House of Commons Commission, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1416</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which was done on Monday. As he has mentioned, the House of Commons Commission will be finding better accommodation for the cleaners, which is right. As far as the industrial dispute between the cleaners and their employers is concerned, obviously, efforts are being made by the employers to seek an appropriate and satisfactory solution.
</p>





<p><a name="st_45"><a name="50721-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 As we enter what I consider to be an excessively long recess, and at the risk of being accused of being the first to call for the recall of Parliament, may I express the hope that there will be no practical impediment to recalling Parliament if events demand that course of action, and that Ministers will find a way of keeping all Members, not just Front Benchers, advised of developments in security matters?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_46">I have just one other question for the Leader of the House, on Iraq. When he was Secretary of State for Defence, whatever our differences, I recognised that he was assiduous in keeping the House informed of developments by making statements. We have British forces in the field, who, sadly, occasionally take casualties. We have a deteriorating situation with, we are told, 34 civilian deaths in Iraq every day, and many people assessing whether Iraq is approaching civil war. And even as cautious an observer as Senator Joe Biden has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;It&#039;s not a question of &#039;staying the course&#039; but of changing course&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">Can it therefore be right that we have not had a single statement or debate specifically on Iraq in this Parliament? Indeed, the last statement was six months ago, and the last debate more than a year ago. Is not the House entitled to have a view on the conduct of our policy in Iraq?
</p>





<p><a name="st_46"><a name="50721-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Clearly, should the House need to return during the previously announced recess, it is important that that should take place. I made it clear that should such a requirement arise, there will be no practical difficulty for the House to reassemble, wherever that might be. The hon. Gentleman, and other Members, will understand what I mean, given that the length of this recess has largely been dictated by the need to improve the security arrangements in the Chamber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">As far as Iraq is concerned, the hon. Gentleman is not entirely fair in being so critical. There has already been a defence debate, which was an obvious opportunity&#151;my recollection is that the title of the debate was &quot;Britain in the World&quot;&#151;to raise the question of Iraq. Only this week, we have had Foreign Office questions, and there are four-weekly opportunities to question Defence Ministers. I do not therefore accept the criticism that there have not been opportunities in this Parliament to deal with the question of Iraq.
</p>





<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50721-10_spnew5"><b> Helen Goodman  (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</b> 
 The Leader of the House will be aware that two days ago the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality made an important statement changing the treatment of refugees, who will now be given five years&#039; leave to remain instead of immediate settlement. No consideration appears to have been given to the impact of that change on children, who face the prospect of having their lives torn apart twice if the proposal goes

<br>&nbsp;<br>ahead. Can the Leader of the House assure us that we will have an opportunity to discuss this matter as soon as Parliament returns in October?
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="50721-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am confident that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will have given full consideration to the impact on families. That is a necessary consequence of the very difficult decisions that he and his colleagues have to take. Certainly, however, there will be further opportunities to debate and discuss this matter when the House returns in the autumn.
</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50721-10_spnew7"><b> Sir George Young  (North-West Hampshire) (Con):</b> 
 Earlier this year. the House passed legislation&#151;with the support of the Procedure Committee, the House authorities and indeed, you, Mr. Speaker&#151;to enable Parliament square to be restored to its normal peace and tranquillity. Placards remain evident directly opposite New Palace Yard even though we are in a time of heightened security, so can the Leader of the House say when the authorities will carry out the wishes of Parliament and restore Parliament square and the pavement to peace and tranquillity?
</p>





<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50721-10_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is right that appropriate legislation is in place to allow effective action to be taken. Obviously, it is necessary for those responsible for enforcing the legislation to determine the correct balance between people&#039;s freedom to demonstrate and communicate their views, security requirements, and hon. Members&#039; need to get on with their work properly and in peace.
</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50721-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Alan Williams  (Swansea, West) (Lab):</b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend aware that George Cubie, one of the House&#039;s senior officers, will have retired by the time the House returns after the summer? He has only put in 39 years&#039; service and could not stay on to match my 40, but he beats anyone else in the Chamber today. As Clerk of Committees, he presided over the greatest transformation in the back-up services available to Committees in 25 years, and all the Committee Chairmen are grateful for that. He has been a wonderful source of advice to me and to the other Chairmen here today. We will miss him, as he has been great to work with. Will my right hon. Friend join us in wishing him a very happy retirement?
</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50721-10_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am extremely grateful to my right hon. Friend for that question. When the members of the Modernisation Committee spontaneously elected me as their Chairman recently, I was able to pay tribute to George Cubie&#039;s work on behalf of that Committee. He has taken forward a very considerable programme of change and I know how widely admired he is by previous members of that Committee and how much the House will miss his services.
</p>





<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50721-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Leader of the House reflect on the number of written statements issued this week? There have been 156, and that is out of all proportion. Although he has defended that this morning, I believe that he should think carefully about this matter. He has referred to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1418</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Modernisation Committee, which agreed that hon. Members should be able to table written questions during the recess. That provision was supported by his predecessor, so why are the Government so opposed to it now?
</p>





<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50721-10_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I make the same point to the hon. Gentleman that I made to the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling). Does he think that there should be a smaller number of written statements, or that written statements should not be made to inform the House of developments in the work of Government Departments? I should have thought that he would welcome the number of written statements and their quality, as they make clear the Government&#039;s determination to keep hon. Members fully informed. Obviously, it is important that hon. Members retain the ability to solicit information from Departments during the recess. I am sure that they can take advantage of the generous allowances made available for secretarial facilities and write to Ministers, who would expect to respond.

 Can we have a debate when we return on the implications for the structure of the NHS of the Government&#039;s choice agenda? Does my right hon. Friend understand my despair at the possibility of another restructuring in the NHS? Does he agree that the Government&#039;s reluctance to let changes bed down before uprooting them and starting again is positively Maoist?
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50721-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am fully confident that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and her Ministers are well aware of the significant amount of change experienced by those who work so hard on our behalf in the health service. I recognise my hon. Friend&#039;s concern that the NHS should not be in a state of perpetual revolution. It is important that those hard-working people have the opportunity to deal with recent changes and to continue to serve our communities so well.
</p>





<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50721-11_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson  (Strangford) (DUP):</b> 
 When we return, will the Leader of the House find time for a debate on industrial derating in Northern Ireland? Thousands of jobs will be lost if the Government maintain their present position. Understandably, there is massive concern, especially among small and medium-sized businesses.
</p>





<p><a name="st_58"><a name="50721-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I appreciate that this is an important and significant issue for Northern Ireland. I thank the hon. Lady for raising it and I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland writes to her on this subject.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50721-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ian Austin  (Dudley, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend arrange a debate on what is being done to tackle health inequalities? Although increased expenditure in the NHS has produced improvements such as shorter waiting times and better treatment for many illnesses, it has been reported this week that people in my constituency of Dudley, North die an average of eight years earlier than their neighbours in the south of the borough. Such a debate would enable us 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1419</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to examine the causes in detail and to look at the work being done to tackle such inequalities. We would also be able to determine whether resources are being properly targeted to give my constituents the same quality and length of life as those living elsewhere.
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="50721-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises a very important issue and one that is central to the way that the Government are tackling health care across the country. The problem of inequality is precisely why we are spending so much money on the NHS. When we came to office, NHS spending amounted to some &#163;34.7 billion. It has risen to &#163;69.7 billion now, and on present plans is estimated to rise to about &#163;92 billion. That money is specifically designed to ensure that the same standards are achieved across the country. We look hard at best practice in different areas to ensure that that is spread across the whole population. We now have the resources available to make sure that that happens.
</p>





<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50721-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 The Government have a formula for funding police authorities around the country, but the funding for Northamptonshire has been &#163;5 million short over the past three years. That has denied the people of the county at least 50 full-time police officers. Will the Leader of the House find time for a debate on that obvious anomaly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50721-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman had been here in 1997 and seen the poor support given to the police and police authorities by the previous Government, it is possible that he would not be making that observation today. I know that there are more police officers in Northamptonshire today than was the case in 1997.
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50721-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 That is not the point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50721-11_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 From a sedentary position the hon. Gentleman says that that is not the point. The point is that we have substantially increased police funding and police numbers across the country, including in Northamptonshire. The hon. Gentleman should give the Government credit instead of making carping criticisms.
</p>

 My right hon. Friend will have noted the mocking laughter from Opposition Members when my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) raised the question of the House of Commons cleaners&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> They are laughing again. However, there is considerable support among Labour Members for a proper, fair and just settlement for the cleaners. What is intolerable is that there is a differential between the conditions for permanently employed House staff and those for contract cleaners. There is no logic in that, and it is outrageous that a person can work here for nine years and yet at no point be offered any pension entitlement. That is what has happened to one of the cleaners I spoke to yesterday, and it is not acceptable in modern Britain.
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50721-11_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As I understand it, staff directly employed by the House work in a different capacity and do rather different jobs. Leaving that aside, however, I made it clear in my earlier answer that it is important for the

 I think the Leader of the House will be sympathetic to my request for a statement when the House returns. It is about the 8,500 multiple sclerosis suffers who are desperately waiting for the validation of a drug called AIMSPRO, which has been trialled for the last few years. Changes in medical guidelines have resulted in its withdrawal and as a result, those who have witnessed great improvements in their condition now feel all the symptoms returning. Will the Leader of the House do all that he can to look into this matter before the House returns? It is obviously very cruel when those whose condition has improved greatly see their one chance of such improvements becoming permanent being put into reverse.

 Every Member of this House is well aware of the suffering that this appalling disease causes&#151;often to friends and family&#151;and of the importance of appropriate treatment. But the hon. Gentleman and other Members know that the availability of prescribed drugs is determined wholly independently by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which is independent of Government and makes appropriate clinical judgments in the light of the appropriate medical evidence. It is right that that independent approach to this difficult and often sensitive issue should continue.

 The security work that will be carried out in the Commons in the coming weeks presents us&#151;both new and older Members&#151;with a unique opportunity to compare the length of the coming recess with the previous broken recess, in which we returned for two weeks in September. If that is true, does the Leader of the House agree that we should have a short debate on this issue when the House returns, followed by a vote, and permanently settle the question of the recess?

The right hon.

On the other hand, I also recognise the concern, which has been raised today and will go on being raised, about the long period of the recess. Of course, the practical difficulty responsible for such gaps and way in which the previous schedule operated is the timing of the political party conferences. We may well have to address that issue.

Friend back to two weeks ago, when I asked him to arrange for a debate on the middle east peace process. We are at a crucial point in that process. Israel&#039;s withdrawal from Gaza could lead to an agreed two-state solution that is recognised internationally, or Israel might see that as the end of the process and continue to occupy sections of the west bank. That would leave an unviable Palestinian state with sections illegally occupied by Israel, and the wherewithal would remain for further conflict.

: Is it not becoming obvious to the Leader of the House that we must have an urgent debate on written ministerial statements? His very junior colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, was dragged here by Mr. Speaker&#151;obviously very reluctantly&#151;to answer questions from a number of Members about matters pertinent to their constituencies. Yet that same junior Minister had the impertinence to hide behind the written ministerial statement, claiming that that seemed an adequate response. It is not an adequate response. Will the Leader of the House therefore undertake to look again at this matter and, if necessary, to get his ghastly Modernisation Committee to look at it, in order to establish that Ministers have a duty to come here properly to answer questions from Members, and not to hide behind written ministerial statements?

 Clearly, the House is making some sort of progress when the right hon.

That is a question of judgment, and on the occasion referred to, Mr. Speaker rightly decided that the matter was one that should afford Members an opportunity to ask questions. No one could possible argue against that, and nor did my ministerial colleague.

 I am certainly not commenting on any individual case. It may well be that since the time when the hon. Gentleman shadowed on defence, he has not kept up with all the developments. He should know that particular prosecutions are being conducted under English criminal law and by English courts, in the sense that our military courts martial system is part of our own system.

 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a personal statement. The Committee on Standards and Privileges has today published a report concerning me and it has requested that I make an apology to the House by way of a personal statement. This I readily do at the earliest possible opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_55">The complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards followed the publication of two articles in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last March that made a number of allegations about my conduct. By far and away the most serious allegation was that I had sought to use my parliamentary position as Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development to obtain or to attempt to obtain some personal financial gain. In respect of this matter, the commissioner found in his report that there had been no indication whatever in the course of his inquiries that I had sought to exploit my position as Chairman of the International Development Committee to further my private interests.

<p>
<a name="50721-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_56">The commissioner did, however, find that I had breached the code of conduct in a number of respects; that in certain instances I got it wrong. No one is sorrier than me for that. For what I got wrong, I said in person on Tuesday to the Committee on Standards and Privileges that I was very sorry and I repeat to the whole House that I am very sorry.

<a name="50721-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_57">The Committee in its conclusions says that my case illustrates the importance, not least in terms of public perception, of Members scrupulously separating, and being seen to separate, their public role from any private business interests. The Parliamentary Commissioner says in his report that he does not believe that I set out to exploit my public position for personal advantage, but he took the view that I failed to exercise sufficient care in distinguishing my public concerns from some of my private interests. I accept that judgment.

My letter to the Secretary of State was clearly very poorly written, as it has led to a number of misunderstandings, but I have to accept, as I wrote the letter, that the consequence of those misunderstandings fall to me and, as I said to the Parliamentary Commissioner, I fully accept that the perception of an MP&#039;s conduct is important. The Parliamentary Commissioner and the Committee have concluded from their reading of my letter that I breached the rules, and I of course accept their judgment. That was most certainly not my intention.

      I do not believe that there is anything in the Commissioner&#039;s findings or the Committee&#039;s report that suggests that I have done anything ignoble, dishonest or discreditable. In that I got matters wrong, I have at the earliest possible opportunity apologised in person to the Secretary of State and apologised in person to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, and now I say sorry to the House. I hope that the House will accept this as a heartfelt and unconditional apology for what I got wrong. I hope that any fair-minded person reading the commissioner&#039;s report will conclude that what I got wrong was by way of inadvertence and omission rather than through any deliberate attempt in any way to abuse my position as a Member of this House.

On 6 July, in Singapore, the world saw&#151;directly personified in the presence of those 30 young people, representing 20 nationalities, from Langdon school in Newham in the east end of London&#151;the tolerance and diversity that is London. They also saw a statement of our ambition for the future, which is not just to host the greatest sporting event in the world for 17 days but to unlock the ambition of millions of young people up and down our country&#151;a real legacy for both capital city and country. In London the next day, and ever since, the world has seen the resilience of Londoners again, linked to a determination that the grief, the mourning and the outrage of the terrorist attacks will not translate into division or hate and to continue as the city of tolerance that has so defined us to the rest of the world.

<p>
<a name="50721-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_61">Why was it that we won in Singapore against&#151;as many would say&#151;all the odds? There is a simple answer to that question. The IOC was moved by the spirit so clearly articulated and represented in our bid and the presentation to its members. The IOC realised that for London the games were much more than 30 days of Olympic and Paralympic sporting excellence. For London, the games are a chance to transform one of the poorest and most deprived parts of our capital city; to inspire millions of children with dreams of sporting success; to launch a nationwide cultural festival; and to unlock sporting talent, both at home and abroad.

The talented athlete scholarship scheme and 2012 scholarships are direct and practical ways to address that problem. We celebrated the success of our gold medallists at the Athens Olympics, but we should remember that five of those medals were won by a combined margin of less than half a second. That is why, if we are serious about ensuring that talent and potential are realised, those two schemes are so important.

I have today given the London Development Agency the go-ahead to start the massive construction and regeneration programme that will shape the Olympic park to be ready in seven years&#039; time. The first step is the undergrounding of the power lines that currently blight the Olympic park and the lower Lea valley.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_71">I want to set out for the House the shape of the Bill. The Bill does three things: it creates the public body that will get London ready to stage the games&#151;the Olympic Delivery Authority; it provides the powers needed to meet IOC requirements for the way that the games and the Olympic environment are managed; and it provides the Mayor with an Olympic-specific power so that he can meet his obligations as the signatory to the IOC&#039;s host city contract. I shall provide an outline of the scope of the legislation in each of those areas, before describing in more detail how some of the clauses will work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_72">The Olympic delivery authority will be the body that manages the Government&#039;s interest in the Olympic construction project and the public money going into it. It will make sure that the necessary infrastructure is in place by 2012, and that all the venues are built. Clauses 3 to 6 and schedule 1 allow for the authority to be created, grant it the necessary powers and functions and specify how it will be structured, organised and funded. Clauses 8 to 16 deal with transport, and establish the ODA as the co-ordinating authority for the Olympic transport plan. Existing transport authorities will be under a duty to co-operate with the ODA in order to implement the plan and to deliver Olympic transport services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_73">The Bill also provides for the creation of an Olympic route network and the ODA will be able to issue traffic regulation orders on that network; for example, to establish Olympic lanes or parking restrictions. Obviously, the authority&#039;s role will need to evolve over time. Before 2012, the ODA will focus on acquiring land&#151;80 per cent. of which is already under public control&#151;constructing venues and planning transport.

<a name="stpa_79">The ODA will co-operate with local authorities to ensure that the streets are kept clean and well lit and will be able to step in to do that work itself if necessary. It will also have a role in enforcing the regulations that restrict unauthorised advertising and trading around venues. Those regulations will be needed to comply with the requirement of the host city contract. Clauses 17 to 31 and schedules 2 and 3 aim to restrict the commercial exploitation of the games in five ways: by updating the existing Olympic symbol protection legislation, for instance to include protection for the Paralympic symbols; by providing additional protection against ambush marketers who try to associate themselves unfairly with the games, by using words like London, summer and 2012; by allowing regulations to be made restricting unauthorised advertising around Olympic venues; by allowing the same sort of regulations to be made restricting unauthorised street trading; and by making ticket touting a criminal offence in relation to Olympic events. These provisions all reflect the commitments made in London&#039;s bid documents to meet the requirements of the IOC&#039;s host city contract.

<a name="stpa_80">I turn now briefly to the Mayor&#039;s powers.

In 1948, just over 4,000 competitors from 59 different countries competed. School buildings were used to house athletes. A temporary track was built at Wembley stadium and many Government buildings were converted to temporary uses. The games could be watched on television only by those who lived in Britain. Athletes were asked to bring packed lunches. Despite all that, the games were a success. Three years later, the nation celebrated the Festival of Britain.

<a name="stpa_97">We all know that the ultimate guarantor of Olympic funding is to be discharged in a sharing arrangement with the Mayor of London and through additional national lottery funding. Any cost overrun will be picked up by taxpayers, by London council tax payers and, potentially, through loss of income to charities and other good causes throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_98">The Minister for Sport and Tourism has already made it clear that almost every Olympic host city has seen the cost at least double from initial estimates. In evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 15 January 2003, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;On the financing, one point that was very interesting on our visits to cities that have already run Olympics was that in broad terms, on the cost, every one of them has doubled from the first figure that was given.&quot;</p>

The final figures from Athens are not yet established, but the original bid estimate of costs was again &#163;1 billion, and costs published to date are &#163;3.98 billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_100">The Opposition are determined that London should learn the lessons from those cities, and we must ensure that the games are brought in strictly to budget and on time. We owe it to the many thousands of athletes who will be participating to do just that. We also owe it to council tax payers and to taxpayers, who will be left to pick up the tab long after the last medal is awarded if we do not put the right financial controls in place.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_101">We are pleased that Government propose that the Olympic delivery authority&#039;s accounts will be examined and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will lay a copy of the statement and report before Parliament, because I assume that that will allow the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee to examine and investigate the accounts. Perhaps the Minister will be able to confirm the PAC&#039;s role when he winds up the debate.
</p>

<a name="stpa_102">However, in the interests of transparency, and to allow the House fully to consider and discuss the development of the work, I hope that the Government and the Secretary of State will go further and agree to have an annual debate in the House on progress on the preparations for the games so that it is open to proper parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_103">The Government and the bid stakeholders have made public commitments to the IOC to establish the ODA. In particular, commitments have been made that the ODA will have development control powers in the Olympic park, powers to acquire land, and powers to control and co-ordinate Olympic transport.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-18_para9">

It is about street sweeping, massive building projects, and developing transport and infrastructure links. All those are complicated, costly and difficult to deliver. We have seen what can happen if we do not get the delivery of such projects right. That is why it is essential that we have the right people to do the job&#151;not political appointees or placemen, but professionals, experienced in managing and delivering large-scale projects on time

<a name="stpa_105">In the light of recent events, security is at the forefront of all our minds. We remember that the Olympics have been the victim of attacks on past occasions. We welcome the provisions to allow consultation with police commissioners from the metropolis and the City of London, and the British Transport police, as part of the transport plan. The Bill makes no mention of the overall involvement in security and policing of the event as a whole, although I understand that a Cabinet-level security committee will oversee the games. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more about the security arrangements and their funding, but if he cannot do that today, I trust that in due course a Minister will announce the arrangements to the House.

 The hon. Gentleman is right, in that there is a costing for security. I understand, however, that it is not &#163;20-odd million, but &#163;225 million.

I am sure, however, that the Government will keep the matter under constant review.

<a name="50721-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_106">One element of the Bill worries us particularly. We recognise that delivering the games is a huge task, and that additional powers will be needed to meet the challenge. We also understand that we need to grant the Mayor of London Olympic-specific powers allowing him to fulfil his obligations as a signatory to the host city contract. The powers in the Bill are far-reaching, however. Clause 32 is potentially the most controversial measure, as it gives the Greater London Authority&#151;and therefore the Mayor&#151;very wide-ranging powers.

 I share some of my hon. Friend&#039;s worries. It is notable that parts of the Bill give powers to the Mayor of London specifically, while others give the powers to the Greater London Authority. It would be helpful if the Minister could elaborate on the distinction that the Government draw between the two persons of the Mayor and the authority. Perhaps he will tell us how they think the democratic process will be available to ensure that the powers are being applied appropriately, so that we have a genuine London games and not just an event for which the Mayor is responsible. It is important for all London authorities to be part of the process, and not to feel that any interests that they have are being sidelined by the actions of the Mayor.

Many West Hammers contributed to the attainment of that prize&#151;for example, by contributing to community forums to garner support or talking to international or national delegations. Children sent their hopes and dreams to the International Olympic Committee, and the council contributed ideas and expertise to the bid. We contributed to the bid, and we demand the right to celebrate winning that amazing prize for West Ham. West Ham is proud, excited, expectant and optimistic, and it is beginning to celebrate its success, and I humbly ask hon. Members to celebrate London&#039;s and the UK&#039;s success.

<a name="stpa_121">My constituents are looking forward to participating in the games. We hope and expect that some of our residents will compete. Some of our residents will work as technicians, reporters, photographers, translators, artists, vendors, taxi drivers, chefs, medics and hoteliers. We expect some people to start companies, to sell services and to make their first million because of the inspiration and opportunity offered by the games. We are asking our people and our businesses to consider what they might reap from the largest peacetime event in history.

<a name="stpa_122">Some of our residents will be among the 70,000 volunteers who make the games so special. Recruitment has already begun, and to date 17,000 Londoners have volunteered, which shows their excitement about and commitment to the games. In my borough, more than 500 volunteers have received training and will participate in the London triathlon and volunteer for other activities in our libraries and schools. The opportunities to volunteer will help to reinvigorate civic pride and civic engagement, which will possibly provide skills, build confidence and increase employment.

<a name="50721-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_123">The physical and economic transformation of my constituency will hopefully be matched by a blossoming of the unique cultural vibrancy of those dynamic and creative communities. The bid team acknowledged the importance of the cultural development framework prepared by the five boroughs, which includes the concept of a new east bank for London&#151;a community-

<a name="50721-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_124">To achieve those objectives, we must plan because, to use a well-worn phrase, to fail to plan is to plan to fail. Some are concerned that previous Olympic games did not reap the expected social and economic benefits given the financial outlay, although it is difficult to ascertain what social and financial benefits were expected. If one does not plan to reap a specific and quantifiable benefit, one will fail, and the social legacy of the games was not top of previous Olympic agendas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_125">As a local councillor from Newham, I have discussed the benefits with a number of local, regional and national agencies. Those benefits will massively change the deprivation indicators in east London. If we work to ensure that the legacy of the Olympic games is the renewal and regeneration of an area of the country&#151;and indeed of a generation&#151;we will succeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_126">One concern is that the Bill does not refer to local authorities such as my own, and their role has not been recognised. I contend that the opportunities presented by the games will be fully realised, deep rooted and sustained only if the community is engaged with the physical and social changes. Local authorities are uniquely charged with that responsibility and are uniquely positioned to discharge it. Sir Robin Wales, the elected mayor of Newham, has already contributed as a member of the London 2012 legacy board. I ask the Secretary of State to ensure that the legislation fully recognises the essential role of local government in the planning, delivery and legacy phases of the London 2012 Olympics.

<p>
<a name="50721-19_para17">
<a name="stpa_127">The regeneration of communities is a partnership between the different tiers of government, their agencies and the communities they serve. Without such partnerships, the renewal and regeneration of areas will not be accomplished. The Olympics will bring billions of pounds of business to national, regional, and local companies over the next eight years and more. The Olympics will see the creation of 19,000 new jobs in construction, ICT, media, retail, health, hospitality, sport and the creative industries.

Firms have talked to me about wanting a fair price and about needing to ensure that any red tape is dealt with sympathetically so that they do not incur down time and therefore financial loss, which will mean a loss of confidence among their suppliers and customers. I ask the LDA or the Olympic delivery authority to streamline the planning and licensing permissions to avoid delays that might otherwise impede the relocation process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_130">I am further concerned by reports that break clauses in leases are being used as a device to lessen compensation, which may result in job loss and a loss of economic activity in the area. We all want the games to bring in additional businesses and business growth, not to see the demise of long-established businesses of international renown. Access to increasing opportunities is vital. Newham is the tenth poorest area in England and Wales and the fourth poorest in London. It is flanked on its western borders by the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the London borough of Hackney, which are the first and second poorest areas in the capital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_131">Think of the vast area of deprivation, the lack of skills, the high mortality rate, and the low educational achievement. West Ham has the lowest employment rates in the country. A third of our households contain no one in employment. Our people die six years earlier than those in the community of Westminster. More than half our children live in poverty. Imagine what could be achieved for this community by the benefit of the games. A games that fails to benefit these people&#151;benefit, not displace them&#151;will be a failed opportunity and a failed investment. If we can secure these benefits for the community, it will reciprocate.

<p><a name="st_189"><a name="50721-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath) (LD):</b> 
 Notwithstanding the appalling tragedy that befell London the day after that wonderful moment as Jacques Rogge fumbled with the envelope and announced that London had won the Olympics, the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) is absolutely right that today we must use our discussion of this vital Bill as an opportunity to celebrate the success of London and of the whole country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_134">I have had opportunities on other occasions to give my thanks to all those who have been involved in that wonderful success&#151;Seb Coe, Keith Mills, Barbara Cassani, the Prime Minister, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport team, including the Secretary of State and the Minister for Sport and Tourism, and many others, including the large number of elite athletes and young athletes who joined us as part of the bid team in Singapore. They all deserve our praise for a fantastic achievement. A few days before the announcement of the result, the Prime Minister anticipated how he would react were we to be successful, saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;it&#039;s not often in this job that you punch the air, and do a little jig and embrace the person next to you&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_135">I can assure hon. Members that when the announcement was made in Singapore very many people were punching the air, doing jigs and embracing the people next to them, but we understand that it also happened in London and right across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_136">We all know that winning the bid is not the finishing line but merely the starting gun that signals the hard work that is necessary to ensure that we deliver what we promised to deliver in 2012&#151;the best ever Olympic and Paralympic games. This Bill is part of that process of getting on with the work that is necessary to achieve that. We all know how important it is to get on with it quickly, because there are huge prizes to be won. We know that from all the other countries that have benefited from having the Olympic games. Just one example suffices to illustrate it. Before the 1992 games, Barcelona was ranked as the 16th most popular destination for tourists; since then, it has been for many years consistently ranked in the top four. If other countries and cities can benefit, there are also huge prizes for London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_137">Of those prizes, five crucial ones are on offer. First, above all, the delivery of the 2012 games will help to invigorate our sporting nation. It is worth reflecting that one influential International Olympic Committee member said, after London had been awarded the bid:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Seb&#039;s presentation was not so much on London as on sport.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_138">It was, and rightly so. The underpinning philosophy that should guide the way in which we deliver the 2012 games is the way in which it can invigorate our sporting nation. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1452</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is a vital goal. This week, as our schools finish for the summer holidays, 70 per cent. of those leaving school will drop out of any sporting activity whatsoever&#151;that is a staggering 390,000 children. We need to find ways of persuading them to continue being involved in sport, and the Olympics will help in that process. It is frightening to think that by 2020, on current trends, 70 per cent. of women will do no exercise other than walking. We are all aware of the problem of obesity, which has trebled among children in the past decade, and overall is costing this nation &#163;8.2 billion a year. I mention that figure to draw attention to it in comparison with the cost of the Olympics. Obesity is costing &#163;8.2 billion a year. The expenditure of some billions of pounds on the huge prize of the Olympics pales into insignificance by comparison. The games will inspire the nation to get active, and I welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_139">The Bill will also create a lasting legacy for our sporting infrastructure. Unlike some of the previous games, it is being planned so sensibly that there will not be enough &quot;white elephant&quot; sports facilities to start, as in the clich&#233;, an &quot;albino zoo&quot;. That will not happen here because of how we have planned for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_140">Secondly, the games will enable the regeneration of three of the most deprived boroughs in the United Kingdom, and will bring broader economic benefits across the whole country. The games will be crucial in the lower Lea valley, which will blossom and benefit hugely, like so many other areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_141">Thirdly, the Bill will enable zero waste games, which will help set sustainability standards for the future. The IOC recognised that our games offer comprehensive and positive environmental legacies, which are prizes worth striving for. Fourthly, the activities leading up to the games will showcase our country&#039;s excellence in art and culture. Indeed, the bid already did so with schemes, such as the &quot;40 Artists, 40 Days&quot; project, in the countdown to 6 July. With Jude Kelly at the helm we have every reason to believe that the London 2012 games will also offer a world class cultural programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_142">Fifthly, another crucial prize, the games will unite the nation, sharing in the build-up to 2012 and in the excitement of the games themselves. Those are the huge prizes to be won, but several hurdles need to be overcome to ensure we attain them. It will not come as any surprise to the Minister or his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that from time to time, supportive as we are on the Liberal Democrat Benches of the games, we will be critical of some details. Earlier this month, David Moorcroft, chief executive of UK Athletics, said,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;This is one issue where politicians can truly unite and show the public that they can co-operate when they need to and challenge when they need to do so, but do it in a way that is for the greater public good.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_143">Any concerns or criticisms that we may have on some details will be discussed with the Government in the spirit of finding a way forward for the benefit of the games and the nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_144">As the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said, we face some challenges. We must deliver the games on time, and we have got off to a flying start with our intention to get the Bill on the statute book as quickly as possible. We need to avoid all the delays that could arise from unclear lines of responsibility. In a recent debate in Westminster Hall some of us referred to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1453</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the huge complexity of the current arrangements in sport. This Bill, together with other activities connected with planning for the games, adds a number of additional bodies to that sporting framework. It is crucial that each body knows what its responsibilities and lines of communication are and what it is accountable for. We must get that right to avoid problems of delay. I am not thinking just in terms of structure; I am thinking of areas, such as construction and transport, where we need to ensure perfect co-ordination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para17">
<a name="stpa_145">During the debate on Crossrail the right hon. Lady, like me, was concerned about some aspects of the Bill. We are concerned that current arrangements for Crossrail give the Office of the Rail Regulator power to give overall primacy to Crossrail above anything else. Conflicts may arise about some transport arrangements for the Olympic games, so I am delighted at the agreement that that issue will be looked at by the Crossrail Select Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para18">
<a name="stpa_146">We also need to ensure that Crossrail and the Olympic games do not conflict over the need for people with relevant skills. I hope that the Minister will work closely with the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that we provide appropriate training now to ensure that we have people with the right skills to carry out the jobs, rather than us having to rely on workers from overseas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para19">
<a name="stpa_147">We must deliver on budget. That will be a challenge. Other countries have had difficulty maintaining their budget plans. We have robust budget plans for the games, but prices can change. Construction costs are increasing at three times the rate of inflation. We need to explore how further to protect Londoners from significant increases in their council tax, more than has already been announced, and how we can ensure that no additional raids are made on lottery funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para20">
<a name="stpa_148">We must deliver a safe games. The IOC approved Britain&#039;s security arrangements and praised us for our role in helping to make the Athens games safe. Our plans are robust, but in the light of the recent terrorist attacks they must also be seen to be robust. There needs to be greater reference to security in the Bill. It is surprising that the Bill places no specific duty on the Olympic delivery authority to have regard to security in planning decisions. I hope to return to that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para21">
<a name="stpa_149">There is a need to balance the IOC requirements with the needs of UK residents. The Olympic movement is an immense force, overwhelmingly beneficial, but with the potential to be overbearing. While honouring the requirements of the IOC to restrict advertising, street trading and ticket resale, legislation needs to be light touch and flexible. We should not gold plate any IOC requirements in respect of those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para22">
<a name="stpa_150">We must ensure that throughout the next seven years and right up to the games we maintain the current, fantastically high level of support for the games. It is worth looking at reports in local newspapers the day after the announcement was made. <i>The</i> <i>Herald</i> in Glasgow, for example, said,

<a name="stpa_153">From all the nations of the United Kingdom we have seen an immediate reaction of genuine excitement about winning the games and genuine belief that all parts of the United Kingdom will benefit. My local paper, the<i> Bath Chronicle</i> said:

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para27">
<a name="stpa_155">That is what people expect and we must ensure that they are not disappointed. We must ensure that each part of the country is given the help and support that it needs to maximise its potential. As the Secretary of State said in response to an intervention, the nations and regions support group under Charles Allen has a crucial role to play. I know that it has been working long before we won the bid but it has already held meetings subsequently and I hope that the Minister will tell us a little more about the support that each part of the country can expect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para28">
<a name="stpa_156">I find the Bill&#039;s references to regional development agencies confusing. It appears to imply that RDAs can undertake work in their region in relation to the games if the Olympic delivery authority asks them to do that. One would have thought that they should be able simply to get on with work if they believe that it is appropriate for their region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para29">
<a name="stpa_157">We have already heard what the Bill does. It creates the Olympic delivery authority; gives that authority powers to provide a transport infrastructure, including sophisticated traffic management, low carbon vehicles, the Olympic javelin train from King&#039;s Cross to Stratford, with a travelling time of only seven minutes and so much more; empowers the Mayor of London to spend council tax revenues for use in the games, and fulfils various IOC requirements on touting, training and advertising and ensuring that the Olympic environment is clean and hassle free. The Bill will achieve great things but it also asks us to take a leap of faith.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para30">
<a name="stpa_158">We took a leap of faith with the bid and we were proved right. However, we are being asked to take a leap of faith with the Bill. It does not mention many key issues such as immigration and tax arrangements for athletes, their entourage and supporters. It does not refer to the role that Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Excise will have to play in dealing with the likely flood of counterfeit merchandise. It does not mention the huge challenges that we will face in 2012, when we shall have not only the games but digital switch-over in London. The media authorities have the huge task of ensuring clear spectrum for broadcasters who want to beam out each day&#039;s events in London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-20_para31">
<a name="stpa_159">Even when the Bill refers to key issues such as the prize of setting new sustainability standards, it often does not go far enough.

<a name="50721-20_para32">
<a name="stpa_160">The Bill requires a leap of faith for another reason. During the passage of the Gambling Bill, I criticised the Government for including so many opportunities to give the Secretary of State secondary powers. One in every 10 clauses in the Gambling Bill gave the Secretary of State secondary powers. In the Bill that we are considering, one in every three clauses provides for a new power for the Secretary of State through secondary legislation.

Why, in outlining the mayoral powers, does the Bill contain no provisions to enable the Greater London assembly to scrutinise their exercise? Why do not restrictions on ticket touts include more onerous restrictions on newspapers and online market places such as eBay advertising illegally touted tickets? Is not it odd that, in relation to the role of the powers of the GLA, the Bill does not refer specifically to consulting the ODA or, as many others have said, local authorities?

 Are not hospitality packages another touting problem? A ticket with a face value of &#163;50 can be sold on with a rather grotty lunch attached for &#163;750. Is not that a form of touting for which we need to watch out?

 There are many examples. Hon. Members know of people paying large sums for a towel and getting a free ticket to an event thrown in.

Stopping ticket touting, especially in this internet age, requires far more than that, however.

The Bill forms part of the necessary procedures that will ensure that we do that. I can assure the Minister, his Secretary of State and the House that we will give our full support to the Bill, notwithstanding that there are areas in which we believe that it could be improved.

 I am pleased to take part in this debate on what will obviously be a massive event for London and for the whole country. I strongly endorse the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown), in which she pointed out that this will be a great event that is to be celebrated and welcomed, and that, above all, the basis of the bid was the regeneration of an impoverished part of north and east London. We must ensure that the games provide that regeneration, which will help the poorest people in that community, and that that assistance carries on after the games. We do not want to see the removal of the poor people of London to make way for the Olympic sites and all that goes with them, as has happened in other cities. The example of Barcelona is interesting, because that city managed to ensure that there was a huge social development spin-off from its games.

<a name="stpa_165">My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham mentioned employment opportunities. My borough borders the City of London, hers borders Canary Wharf, and Hackney borders both, as does Tower Hamlets. We have not seen an enormous number of jobs in the City or in Canary Wharf being made available to people in the surrounding boroughs. Instead, large numbers of people come in to fulfil those functions in both those places. I hope that the Olympic experience will not simply be the shipping of more people from further and further away and more commuter jobs, but that the chronic unemployment in that part of north and east London will be tackled.

: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is great news that the London Development Agency is setting up a business support and job brokerage unit, with people appointed by Christmas, to make sure that the concerns that he, I and other Members share are fully addressed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50721-21_spnew6"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend on that point. The London Development Agency, the Mayor and the Minister will have to be assiduous not just in ensuring that all the Olympic facilities are developed, which is crucial, but that all the spin-offs go where they are intended to go. We told the world that our bid was on behalf of a multi-cultural city of London, and that it was about regeneration of a very poor part of our city. We must deliver not just on the glittering stadium but on all the other things, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_167">As a London MP, I also have a lot of sympathy with points made by colleagues from other parts of the country. While the games will obviously be held in London, and the major construction work will take place in London, we must ensure that the construction materials, prefabrication of buildings and so on are sourced from British-based companies operating in areas of high unemployment and problems, so that there is a real spin-off all around the country. As someone who grew up outside London, in the midlands, I can imagine people feeling, &quot;Here we go again. London is getting everything and the rest of the country is not benefiting.&quot; I am sure that the Minister is well aware of that, and it is up to Members of Parliament to ensure that their areas do benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_168">I want to raise some specific items, and I hope that the Minister will reply to them. London&#039;s transport infrastructure was a problem area for the bid, particularly in comparison with that of Paris. The Mayor is well aware, as is the Secretary of State, of the need for huge improvements in the underground and bus networks and such tram networks as will have been developed by that time. Crossrail will not have been completed by that time, so it will not have much effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_169">North and east London have a considerable network of railway lines. I am glad that they are no longer under threat of closure, as they were in the dark days when the Conservative party was in government, but rather have benefited from increased investment and increased usage, which is very welcome. I want the Minister to address the issue of the East London line, however. At the moment, the East London line extension, which has been approved, goes only as far as Dalston, whereas if it could be included in the Olympic development plan it could go through to Clapham junction, which would link up with facilities in south London that are to be used as part of the Olympic games. If it could be extended from Dalston junction to Highbury and Islington, it would link up with the Victoria line, and the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1458</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>spur off to Finsbury Park would link it up to the east coast main line. A direct tube network would therefore link east coast main line trains either at King&#039;s Cross or stopping at Finsbury Park to go straight into the Olympic area. Such a short extension of the line would not be horrendously expensive, but it would be a valuable link within the rest of the London network. I have pressed that case on the Mayor and the Secretary of State, and such an approach seems highly logical at this stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_170">My other points relate to the creation of facilities around London that can be used to assist the Olympic games development. Currently, there is a shortage of swimming pools across London. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) will know that there is a splendid baths facility in Hornsey road in Islington, which was used as a training centre for the 1948 Olympics. Sadly, the baths have been closed, and a succession of developers have failed to develop the site. However, the building is still there, and more discussions are being held about it. The Hornsey road facility is the only 50 m pool in north London. We will need pools of that size for training purposes, and I urge the Minister to join me on a 91 bus trip to have a look at the baths together. I am sure that he will be bowled over and open his cheque book immediately to ensure the development of Hornsey road baths as a sports facility once again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_171">Earlier, I asked the Secretary of State about local communities. A considerable artistic and creative community exists around Hackney Wick, Tower Hamlets and the Olympic area in general. That is partly due to economic factors, as the rent for artists&#039; studios and creative space there has always been relatively cheap, compared with the rest of London. I suppose that that is reminiscent of Hampstead in the 40s and 50s, since when the many artists who used to live there have been priced out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_172">Artists, sculptors and people of a creative bent make up an important part of London life. It would not be a good Olympic legacy if they were all to be expelled from their low-cost facilities to make way for the games. I hope that the relevant authorities and the Mayor will remember that part of London&#039;s creativity stems from all the art and artists that areas such as north-east London supply. I hope that real efforts are made to protect the conditions for artists and ensure that buildings removed to make way for Olympic sports facilities are replaced with equally cheap and accessible places for such people. In that way, we can maintain the wonderful ethnic and artistic diversity that is London. Most artists subsist on less than &#163;8,000 a year, and so obviously have little chance of renting a studio in an expensive venue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_173">My final general point is more global than local. It has to do with the conditions under which much sports equipment, such as shirts and clothing, is manufactured around the world. The sweatshop mentality behind the production of high street brand names can be traced back to child labour and sweated labour in south Asia, Indonesia and many other countries. There are serious campaigns demanding that the equipment and clothing that will be bought and used are manufactured on an ethical basis. I hope that the Secretary of State and the Olympic authorities will take those campaigns seriously. These games are about diversity, equality, fairness and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1459</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>accessibility, and the Government must ensure that all the clothing that is licensed and used comes from ethically sustainable sources. The equipment and clothing that is available should be manufactured in places that do not use sweated labour or employ workers in dangerous working conditions. Such items should be put together in places that have good employment practices and where unions are recognised and workers have rights&#151;all the things that we want for ourselves.

We should also consider the historic significance of this country&#039;s role in founding the modern Olympic movement.

Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) said that she thought that 15,000 people had volunteered, but in fact they are volunteering through our website at the rate of one every five seconds. More than 30,000 have registered so far, and we held a meeting this week to discuss what to do with them for the next seven years. We need only 75,000 volunteers in total and at this rate we shall have them all by next weekend.

 I was interested in my hon. Friend&#039;s comments on volunteering and I am pleased that so many people are coming forward. The knack is to ensure that the volunteering programme reflects the diversity of both London and the UK. Do his figures show how the different communities that make up London and the UK are reflected in the volunteers?

 I do not have that breakdown, but I will get it for my hon. Friend. Given TimeBank&#039;s existing work&#151;for example, it carries out all the mentoring on behalf of the Home Office for families who take in asylum seekers&#151;I am sure that the strength and commitment of its team will be satisfactory, but I will obtain the figures and place them in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_193">Like everyone else, I congratulate the team. Seb Coe, Keith Mills, Mike Lee and Alan Pascoe have done well, but two people have not been given enough credit. The first is my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State who had the unenviable task, three years ago, of convincing a rather sceptical Cabinet that the bid was worth while, but to her great credit, she gathered support and did so. We must not forget that. The second person was one of our ambassadors in Singapore, who, so my spies tell me, was doing the rounds with great &#233;lan: the Prime Minister&#039;s wife was corralling many members of the IOC and introducing the Prime Minister to them. The campaign was very much like a general election campaign&#151;that is where some of the other bid teams got things wrong&#151;where the last four days are critical. We got the last four days right and France did not. That was the key, so we should also commend the Prime Minister&#039;s wife.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_194">I was lucky enough to see the Sydney bid at close hand, as I visited Sydney twice before the games. I made a post-games visit to Athens as part of my Select Committee work. Making such a bid is like a couple of entrepreneurs setting up a start-up company: they have got to the starting line and obtained their money&#151;in this case, we have been awarded the games. There is then a rather difficult situation, after the initial public offering, in that the management of the company last only for the next 18 months and, because they cannot cope with managing a brand-new company, are replaced by professionals. We should not be surprised if the current management team is not the same in 18 months&#039; time. That is normal and we should expect it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_195">The key thing is to ensure that the ODA understands how companies are built and developed, and that the appointment of people to the management team is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1465</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>critical. I realise that the Secretary of State will make those decisions, but we need to understand that members of the management team will need to be replaced, not at regular intervals, but in two or three years&#039; time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_196">Two things worry me, and they have been raised by other Members. The first is security. There was a hijacking at the Munich games in 1972 and a bomb at Atlanta in 1996. Greece did not expect expenses for security of &#163;2 billion, which it had to take on the hip. The Athens games cost the Greek Government 10 per cent. of gross domestic product. In any normal economy, that would be overwhelming. Given the problems that face any major world event, security is critical and I do not really see why it should always fall on the home team to provide the money. The IOC is a very rich organisation indeed&#151;it will probably take between &#163;20 billion and &#163;30 billion in TV fees over the next 10 years&#151;and although it is generous in giving at least $1 billion to the host city, I do not see why there should not be a separate fee for security, and we need to argue for that between now and 2012.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_197">Secondly&#151;I will not be popular for saying this&#151;we must look again at how this matter is managed in the House. We did have a Minister without Portfolio whose only portfolio was managing the dome. The dome was built on time and to budget. It was popular with some people. The only thing that did not materialise was our 12 million visitors&#151;we only got 6.8 million. Everyone who told us that we would get 12 million was wrong, including every tourism expert and everyone from British Airways. If we can have a Minister for a rather minor event like the millennium dome, it seems to me that, as we grow our expertise in the Olympics, we need a Secretary of State for the Olympics, or a dedicated Minister for the Olympics only. That is very important. The current Secretary of State has wide responsibilities. She not only has the Department for Culture, Media and Sport but she is Minister for Women too. As this complex, difficult area develops, the Government should look specifically at establishing a Minister for the Olympics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_198">The ODA will report to Parliament and it will be required to send an annual report to the Secretary of State. I wonder whether we might beef that up. It is critical that the Government find time every year for the House to debate that report, as other hon. Members have said. I say that because I chaired a meeting two weeks before Singapore on the design implications of the Olympics. About 100 designers attended and the Minister for Sport and Tourism was there. One aspect made me nervous, and it has been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who is no longer present: housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_199">In essence, so far the housing looks to be rather like Le Corbusier and the 1950s high-rises that went up in south and north London that we are now blowing up and taking down. We could be much more Port Sunlight, New Earswick and Welwyn Garden City. We need a very different approach on this and, if we go for high-density, cheap housing, we will deeply regret it within 10 years. It will not be the site that we think it is in legacy values. That is why there should be a way for hon. Members to feed our expertise into the system.

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_200">In <i>The Observer</i> last Sunday, there was an interesting article by Tim Payton, in which he floated the idea of Olympic parks across Britain. I am greatly attracted by that idea. We are all struggling in our constituencies, wondering which 1 per cent., or 1 per cent. of 1 per cent., we can get of the big budget of the Olympics. We are struggling to find out how we can participate if we are not a London borough. I just wonder whether the Olympic parks might be a good idea.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_201">I wonder whether we can persuade the Minister to look at that 12p in the pound of the lottery that currently goes to the Treasury. Although &#163;750 million from the lottery will be made available for the games, a hell of a lot of money is still going to the Treasury from that 12p. Could we make that a bond that could go into the market to develop the Olympic park idea, so that if we beefed up the regional development agencies&#039; interest in this whole procedure, we could at least give some of the money from the 12p to each RDA, to make some sort of infrastructure facility bid?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_202">I live in Kent. We are the largest local authority. We do not have a single Olympic event. We do not have any facility that could host an American team or a Japanese team, and therefore we shall need to come for money.

<p><a name="st_213"><a name="50721-24_spnew0"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be nice if we took the Olympics across the country and perhaps had dedicated sports centres and training centres that would allow the whole country to join in the Olympic year. Is that the sort of thing he is considering?
</p>





<p><a name="st_214"><a name="50721-24_spnew1"><b> Derek Wyatt: </b> 
 It will not be for me to consider, but last week we had a debate in Westminster Hall on elite sport and, when the Minister for Sport and Tourism replied to the debate, he said that that evening he was seeing Charles Allen, who was in charge of the nations and regions part of the Olympic bid. We are all trying to understand how we can participate. For example, I think that my constituency has the second best windsurfing in the world, in Sheerness, but of course we do not have a hotel facility for 80 people. Even if we built a hotel for 80 people, we would not be able to use it as a hotel once the windsurfing teams had gone. We do not want a white hotel. We want some system that will help us understand. If we want windsurfing, we must approach the international body first, then the British Olympic Committee and the British windsurfing organisation. We do not have the experience or expertise to understand the decision-making process, nor do we have the money. We are trying to understand what we can do. I hope the Minister will say in his winding-up speech that there will be a one-day conference so that all our chief executives, not just of the RDAs and councils, but of sporting bodies, can reach a better understanding of how we can participate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_203">It would be good if the RDAs could be challenged to do an Olympic audit. It would be instructive to know how many swimming pools, tennis courts or equestrian centres we have that are of Olympic standard. If they are not suitable, our councils must find the money to build them so that we can attract those sports. If we do not do that, Paris will, and so will Brussels, Hamburg and Berlin. We are competing for overseas teams not just inside the United Kingdom, but across western Europe. Hon. Members will remember that our Athens team took accommodation in Cyprus and our team to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Sydney Olympics took accommodation in Brisbane for two years. That is big business and we need to understand how best we can participate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_204">If the Minister is so minded, I should be interested in sitting on the Committee that will consider the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_205">The Olympics could be a huge catalyst for sport. There are three things that we do not have in the UK: there is no sports think-tank, there is no archive of every piece of sports film ever shot, and there is no sports museum. If there is some way that we can lasso the Olympics system in order to upgrade sport to the prominence that it should have but has never had, this is the one opportunity to do that. With regard to sport archive development, will the Minister convene a meeting with the British Library to ask it to serve as the digital infrastructure for the United Kingdom and make the Olympics its first priority so that we can gather all the films that have been made about sport in the United Kingdom? Because the British Library is the best in the world, perhaps the project could be extended to garner sports film from the whole world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_206">As I have said before, the film of the 1948 Olympics, which was made on nitrate, is three hours long and has never been shown on television&#151;I am still praying that BBC3 or BBC4 can find the time&#151;was saved and digitised only because two people spotted it in a can about eight years ago in the British Film Institute library. We must not lose such material.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_207">Another aspect that has not been discussed because it is not entirely covered by the Bill is the legacy that we leave the world from the games. Those of us who celebrated the millennium remember 300,000 people in Pall Mall. Why can only 80,000 go to the opening ceremony? Why can the celebration not take place all over London? Why should it not be celebrated in every football stadium? Would it not be wonderful if, like the opening of the millennium celebrations which started with Sydney harbour bridge being lit up with fireworks, we lit up all the cities around the world that have hosted the Olympic games, sharing an opening ceremony with all those cities and bringing a family of cities into the Olympic movement?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_208">We should leave something so that people could say, &quot;Ah, yes, London did that&quot;, much as we did in 1908 when we created the marathon. We also created the winter games in London in 1908 by freezing a swimming pool in the middle of the athletics pitch and skating on it. That eventually created the winter games of the Olympic movement. In 1948 we introduced the photo finish and starting blocks. We have contributed many things as legacy, but they are tiny. It would be good if we contributed something major.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_209">When de Coubertin set the marker for the games in 1896, it was for sport and arts. There were gold medals for poetry and music. We have a Nobel prize for literature, and it would be great if we could return to some aspects of the creative part of the Olympics. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham said that 120 nationalities would participate. Would it not be spectacular if there was some way in which we could celebrate their cultures and our culture together, beyond just sport?

<p><a name="st_215"><a name="50721-24_spnew2"><b> Mark Hunter  (Cheadle) (LD):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech to the House today. First, I add my congratulations to London on its successful bid to host both the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2012. I am sure that London&#039;s Olympic bidding team must have taken great encouragement and inspiration from Manchester&#039;s tremendous success in hosting the Commonwealth games back in 2002. Members from across the north-west region will surely agree that those games were not just a great sporting spectacle, but succeeded in bringing together communities, including my own, in a way that few other events can do. The residents of Cheadle made up a considerable proportion of the vast army of volunteers whose selfless contributions made the Manchester games such a success. The community spirit and enthusiasm shown three years ago by my constituents is typical of the local population, whom I am privileged to represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_211">It is also an immense privilege to succeed my friend and colleague, Patsy Calton, as Member of Parliament for Cheadle. Hon. Members will no doubt recall the courage and determination that my predecessor demonstrated only a matter of weeks ago in this very House. Having known Patsy for many years, I know that her qualities as a person and as a Member of Parliament were not defined only by the bravery and commitment that she displayed throughout her illness. She was an inspiration to and a great servant of the community in so many other ways. The drive and tenacity that she showed when assisting her constituents was matched only by her attention to detail and her sharp mind, which she employed in the House and in Committee. Her sheer work rate on behalf of the people of Cheadle will be celebrated for many years to come within the constituency and beyond. She came closer than most to bridging the gap between being a champion of the local community and a politician of national standing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_212">Let me take a moment or two to explain a little more about the constituency of Cheadle. It is located on the southern tip of the Greater Manchester conurbation, and many local residents consider their area to be part of Cheshire, as the constituency historically was. Even the briefest tour of my constituency amply demonstrates why residents feel this way. The word &quot;leafy&quot;, used frequently to describe the constituency, simply does not begin to do justice to Cheadle. We are blessed with magnificent, award-winning parks and nature reserves, such as Bruntwood park and Gatley Carrs, and tree-lined streets throughout the local area. I would advise any hon. Member fortunate enough to be visiting the area that there are few better days out to be had than taking a trip to Bramhall hall, a magnificent 14th-century manor house and its surrounding park.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_213">A number of hon. Members have probably visited my constituency over the past few weeks, and I hope that they all enjoyed themselves as much as I did. However, I assume that Members of the party to my right are unlikely to be putting in an appearance again for some considerable time.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_214">It is not just the precious green belt and open space that make our area so special. We have a number of district centres, all with unique characters, which serve to provide a network of villages and community centres across the constituency. Cheadle village, Cheadle Hulme and Bramhall are all distinct local centres with a range of amenities but which also face constant challenges from out-of-town retailers and other pressures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_215">Cheadle is considered a prosperous area and the statistics appear to bear that out. An initial assessment would show that local people, in general, are highly educated, highly skilled and relatively highly paid, particularly in a regional and sub-regional context&#151;a typically affluent suburb, some might say. That broad-brush approach, however, does not tell the whole story. It does not, for example, take account of the large number of pensioner households in every part of the constituency. Nor does it take account of the pockets of deprivation that can be hidden from Government funding formulae. It also fails to recognise the needs and expectations of the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_216">The dire funding arrangements for local services are the topic of debate locally. As leader of the local council for the past three years, I can say that there is a certain grim predictability about the financial settlement for local government every year. It leaves the council that is responsible for so many vital local services in an unenviable position, as both a low grant and a high council tax authority. It means that a two-pensioner household in Heald Green can end up paying more council tax than, say, a Cabinet Minister is expected to pay in a different authority area, although our council spends less per head than any other Greater Manchester authority. Moreover, all the current evidence suggests that the situation is likely to be exacerbated by council tax revaluation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_217">Currently, a pupil at King&#039;s Way school in Gatley in my constituency is funded at around &#163;1,000 per year less than a pupil at a school just over a mile away, in neighbouring Manchester. Local schools already achieve excellent results, but there is so much extra potential that could be released if we benefited from a fairer funding regime. All the signs suggest, however, that the inequality will only get worse unless something is done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_218">The position is replicated across a range of local services. Indeed, not long ago my predecessor had to fight tooth and nail to retrieve &#163;1 million of funding for Stepping Hill hospital that was rightfully its money. As for crime and antisocial behaviour, we are all familiar with the raft of legislation that has emanated from the Chamber in recent years. The sad reality is that, during the same period, my constituency has seen the closure of one police station and the failure to establish a long-promised police post in Cheadle Hulme to replace it. There is no shortage of legislation, but there is a pressing need for more police officers to enforce the law. The principle of fairness underpinned the Liberal Democrat election campaign in May, and I intend to pursue it in respect of the funding of local services in Cheadle.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>coherent strategy as part of the south-east Manchester multi-modal study. The strategy includes completion of the Manchester airport eastern link road, as well as construction of the Poynton bypass and the A6 Hazel Grove bypass. The current road network, involving the infamous &quot;road to nowhere&quot;&#151;the airport link road&#151;only serves to funnel traffic on to suburban roads in the Heald Green, Woodford and Bramhall areas, where the infrastructure is totally unsuited to coping with the volume.

<a name="stpa_221">While I intend all those serious issues and many more during the time for which local people allow me to serve in this role, I consider myself one of the most fortunate Members in the House in being given the opportunity to represent such an attractive, confident and cohesive community. It is therefore with sadness for the loss of my friend, but also with immense pride, that I have the privilege to serve the people of Cheadle. The constituency has seen some of the benefits that a major sporting event such as the Olympics can have for a community, in so many different ways. Other Members have said the same this afternoon. With careful planning, I hope that London can repeat that success in 2012 not only for the capital, but for our country as a whole.

It seems to be an unholy coincidence that just as the euphoria of the bid success in Singapore was succeeded by terrible atrocities the following day, today we are debating the Olympics and again we have seen appalling events in London. By 2012, the pain caused by the horrors of a couple of weeks ago, which will never be forgotten, will, I hope, have eased. A successful games will be the best memorial to those murdered two weeks ago. So far as I am aware, my constituency suffered more than any other two weeks ago, in that four of my constituents&#151;Rachelle Chung Far Yuen, Michelle Otto, Neeta Jain and Anthony Fatayi-Williams&#151;were victims. Those four people came from four different ethnic backgrounds, which reflects my constituency&#039;s diversity, London&#039;s diversity and our country&#039;s diversity.

The Norman Tebbit cricket test was out of place when it first appeared; it is out of place now; and it will be ancient history when we host the games in a few years&#039; time. People will back the GB team as well as the team from their roots country, which is how it should be. The GB team will be strengthened by our country&#039;s diversity, because competitors from different backgrounds will add to our chances of striking gold, and the whole of our country will support it, irrespective of ethnic roots. A successful 2012 games is the best way in which to answer the bombers. I am pleased that the Mayor, Ken Livingstone, has announced that relatives of the victims and those who were injured will be given pride of place in the stadium at the games.

<a name="stpa_225">Bombers and terrorists do not believe in the Olympics or the Olympic ideal. My hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt) has referred to the history of the ancient Olympic games. The Olympic truce was another feature of the ancient Olympics. We should consider trying to stop wars around the modern world, at least for the couple of weeks of the games, in the same way as wars were stopped in the ancient world as part of a religious duty. Greece tried to engender such a truce before and during the Athens games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_226">We must build quickly and locally on the great enthusiasm for the Olympics. Good practice notes are needed to help communities and local authorities use the games as a focus for their own sporting endeavours. As has been said, London council tax payers will pay some &#163;20 a year towards the cost of the games, and if we are to maintain enthusiasm, we should spread around the benefits.

<a name="stpa_227">How should we go about arranging training camps for visiting teams and how can other countries&#039; Olympic associations find out what is available in our different communities? Shaftesbury Barnet harriers, one of the country&#039;s leading athletics clubs, is based at the Copthall stadium in my constituency, where there are also two specialist sports colleges and many other public and private sports facilities. Some of those are in need of investment to bring then up to scratch, although in many cases it is not a large amount of money. We need to know whether that investment is available and how it can be readily accessed to ensure that in hosting visiting countries&#039; teams we can provide the facilities that they need to ensure that they can compete to the best of their ability. Will there be some co-ordination among areas able and willing to host visiting teams or a competitive environment with one authority bidding against another? I would prefer proper co-ordination around the country and around London to ensure that the games are distributed fairly.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that co-ordination is also needed as regards the delivery of apprenticeships? We need to ensure that companies that are already established in delivering skills for jobs, such as Stonebridge House, are used in the bid process.

<a name="stpa_228">In housing visiting teams we should build on diversity around the country to try to host teams in communities with which they have links. For example, in my area we

We have one of the largest Indian communities in the country, and many African nations are represented. Is it possible for several areas or local authorities to get together to put in a joint bid to host some of the larger teams? We need some guidance on how those arrangements should be made and accessed. The proposed Olympic delivery authority could play a useful role in the co-ordination of such activities.

<a name="50721-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_229">My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms    Butler) anticipated my remarks when she mentioned the role of apprenticeships as we go about organising the construction projects. It is fair to look at what has happened elsewhere. In Greece, much of the construction work, large and small, was farmed out around the whole country, benefiting the whole of Greece and the Greek economy. There is no reason why that should not happen here, given that this will probably be the biggest and most important construction site in London and the south-east, if not the whole country, once terminal 5 is completed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_230">My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South said that this should be an opportunity to ensure that there are plenty of local jobs for local people. Foreign teams of construction workers may arrive from all over the European Union, perhaps in the same numbers as their sporting teams given the scale of the project. There is no excuse for not making efforts to ensure that local people are trained up, through the apprenticeships that my hon. Friend mentioned, to play their part in building the major projects in the east end. It would be alienating for local young people if they saw people coming in from outside and the sporting facilities going up with no jobs for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_231">Those who work on the sites must have proper terms and conditions and health and safety arrangements. That is particularly so in the case of overseas workers. During the last Parliament, the Work and Pensions Committee&#039;s report on the work of the Health and Safety Executive highlighted the problems of health and safety in the construction industry, with particular reference to the position of migrant workers. I hope we can take that into account in our approach to the letting of construction contracts.

 As a fellow GMB member, I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes an excellent point. The GMB has played a major role in that success. Trade unions can play a constructive role in ensuring that the work force play their full part in delivering such projects on time.

I should be interested to hear from the Minister how parts of London with facilities to offer can put them forward. Will there be a sort of clearing house? In the Croydon and Bromley area there is Crystal Palace, which has already been mentioned and does not need a clearing house, and schools such as the Whitgift with tremendous national-class facilities, which it would love to make available. Guidance is needed on how that is best achieved.

<a name="stpa_237">Plans for London are undoubtedly ambitious. There will be a number of temporary facilities, such as Lords, Wimbledon and Horseguards Parade. There will be places around the country, such as Weymouth for rowing and sailing, in which I take a particular interest. The Lea valley site is extremely large. Canary wharf is only 85 acres; Lea valley will be 500 acres. It will need top-class management to fulfil its potential and to bring about the necessary restoration and regeneration of the east end. I do not want to make party political points, but lessons can be learned from the Jubilee line and the dome. The hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt) held out the dome as a triumph; others might not see it that way. The lessons of development and project management have to be learned from those projects.

A key player will be the mayor of London. I am pleased that he is given substantial powers to cut through bureaucracy.

He is a builder&#039;s merchant who picks up passing trade that comes from the east end of London into the development sites of the City and the west end. The London Development Agency is offering to relocate him five miles away in Beckton or 12 miles away in Rainham Marshes. Neither site has freehold available.

There will be redundancy payments and relocation costs. Investment value will be lost because the businesses have freeholds but will end up with leaseholds. Business will be lost in the transition and because the firms are no longer on such a prominent site. My constituent estimates that he will lose several million pounds.

We are going around in circles and only two people can cut through the problem&#151;the Minister and the Secretary of State. I would be grateful if the Minister could tackle the matter as a priority because businesses will be seriously affected. There is a lack of suitable alternative sites nearby. The sites on offer from the LDA are not ready to plan for or start development. There is uncertainty about the available funding and compensation.

There are other, more wide-ranging facilities in our communities. Many of the schools in my constituency have swimming pools. Over the years, there have been various swimming galas, but they seem to have lost the impetus that they had in the past. Let us take the opportunity to ensure that all our facilities used to the maximum.

I am very proud that Scott Wilson, an engineering consultancy in my constituency, will play an important part in some of the logistics behind the event. The Secretary of State spoke about the potential benefits for the whole of the UK, and I agree that the Olympics will provide a lasting legacy in terms of sporting facilities. The games will give us a unique opportunity to showcase our country and to unite behind the event.

<a name="stpa_259">However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) said, it is time to ask questions. I want to bring to the attention of the House concerns that the scope of the Bill could make it difficult for community organisations and the business community to show their support for the 2012 Olympics. Community organisations and many small and medium-sized firms can never hope to be official sponsors of this great event, as such a role costs many thousands of pounds, but I am sure that they will want to support an event that will be an integral part of our lives for the next seven years.

<a name="stpa_260">One specific concern is that the Bill will prevent any references to the games from appearing in our communities other than those made by the media and the official sponsors.

<a name="stpa_261">Official sponsorship is an important part of the revenue stream needed to fund the games, and I understand that we must protect the value of the games for potential sponsors. In many ways, the Bill is designed to prevent ambush marketing, in line with one of the IOC&#039;s requirements. I am sure that hon. Members will be familiar with the IOC&#039;s definition of ambush marketing, which refers to all

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;intentional and unintentional attempts to create a false or unauthorised commercial association with the Olympic movement or the Olympic games.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_262">The inclusion of the relevant clause in the Bill is understandable, as large corporations have engaged in blatant ambush marketing in many recent high-profile sporting events. However, I believe it important that we distinguish between unfair association, involving an implied endorsement and a consequent marketing gain, and mere reference to or allusion to the games, in which an Olympic logo might not even be used. Here, I am referring to schedule 3, under the terms of which, any reference that may

<p>
<a name="50721-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_265">There is a big difference between ambush marketing and reference to the event by a third party who is not an official sponsor. Such a party could be a small local business or even a community group. That the use of the words that I have listed might infringe the law is a matter of great concern, and it does little to support our cross-party efforts today to get as many people as possible involved in the forthcoming event.

<a name="stpa_266">If there is no implied suggestion that an organisation or business is an official sponsor, or that people could be confused into thinking that such an association existed, such an organisation should not fall foul of the legislation. We need to consider this issue very carefully. The danger is that we will tip the balance away from encouraging the country to support the event, toward what could look like censorship. That is a particular danger for community organisations and businesses. A passing reference by them to the games could mean that they were committing an offence, and they could face a fine of up to &#163;20,000.

<a name="stpa_269">Most of my friends and family will find it hilarious that I am supporting a sporting activity, given that I object to walking 15 yd to the car, but I have to say that I have been completely enthused by the whole process. I am glad to say that I have form on this issue, in that, as early as the beginning of last year, I was asking my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State what the Olympics will mean to towns and cities outside London. I suspect that I was flying a few kites, without really being certain that the bid would come to anything. However, I am delighted that there is evidence in <i>Hansard</i> that I was interested in this issue then. I remain interested in it, and committed to ensuring that not only Crawley but the rest of the UK benefits from the fantastic opportunity presented by the Olympics and Paralympics coming to this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_270">It is completely fortuitous that Crawley happens, in a few weeks&#039; time, to be opening one of the best sports facilities that this country will see. It includes a fantastic running track, a leisure centre that will be the envy of the country and a 50 m pool. The pool has been provided for the people of Crawley&#151;it was their money, and they built it. But we can see that there are fantastic opportunities to enthuse and engage with young people. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1480</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I am glad that my political history lies in an enlightened Labour council that has always provided first-class facilities. To see that matched now by the Government&#039;s commitment to making sure that the games come to the United Kingdom is to see something extremely special to us all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_271">When we were building the facilities, we were worried we would not have enough money, and I am glad to say that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism received a delegation from Crawley to hear about the benefits it would have. We began then to be a bit more excited by the idea that there might be opportunities for us in our part of the world to be able to contribute. And we believe that that is what we are doing in Crawley&#151;making a contribution to the tremendous bid. It is not just about getting our name on the map, but about contributing to ensure that the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics will be the most successful ever, and I firmly believe that they can be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_272">Part of the Olympic bid involved diversity, and many hon. Members have mentioned that. For a town with almost 15 per cent. of its people coming from different ethnic minority groups, it is important to be able to deliver an Olympics that truly encompasses all the fantastic diversity that we have in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_273">There are several other reasons why we are very keen. I have mentioned the enlightened approach of Crawley borough council, which has delivered fantastic athletes to the UK. Not a Member will not be aware of Daley Thompson, the fantastic decathlete who won gold in 1980 and 1984&#151;an Olympic gold medallist who came from Crawley. He was offered free facilities, in Crawley, to make sure that he was able to achieve his magnificent wins. The same goes for Mick Jones, the hammer thrower, who won gold at Manchester in 2002 and who continues to compete. A woman I am particularly proud of and know well is Jane Blackburn, who won gold for archery at the last Paralympics. The House can see we have a fantastic history of contributing not only facilities but of making sure that people are developed from those facilities and will be encouraged to be able to take part in what will be a fantastic games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_274">I have some questions for the Minister. I am keen that Crawley plays its part, but I firmly believe that we need an orderly collection of towns and cities able to contribute and that things should not be done simply by saying, &quot;We have better facilities, so it should be us&quot;. We should be able to look to the ODA to assess properly the facilities and opportunities that towns and cities can offer and to ensure that they are recognised in such a way that we feel secure about having been offered an opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_275">I firmly believe that would leave a good legacy for many years. I have spoken with people who were involved in the Sydney bid, and I have family members in Sydney who are involved in the volunteer programme, which continues to this day. People are continuing with the volunteering habit that they developed in the Olympic games, and that has to be a tremendous spin-off, which we need to accept and develop, and we have heard from other hon. Members just how that can be done.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>said all that I have said about a co-operative approach, I do not think that there can be a better town than Crawley to contribute to this fantastic games.

<p><a name="st_227"><a name="50721-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Pelling  (Croydon, Central) (Con):</b> 
 I very much agree with what the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) had to say about the opportunity that the Olympics, as a celebration of sporting excellence, can offer us, not only in fostering sporting excellence across the United Kingdom and identifying sports people who will win medals for us, but in taking the fullest advantage of the sports facilities that different communities can offer. For London, this celebration of sporting excellence is important. We shall see many facets of sport across greater London and the games will bring many nations together. With so many different people, London offers such diversity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_277">One matter that has not been mentioned so far is that the bid was successful because it offered the prospect of being the greenest Olympics. Public transport will be used to allow people from across the whole of London to reach the games. It is important, especially for my constituents in south London, that the Government&#039;s very good promises to invest in the East London line and extend the trams across south London, particularly to Crystal Palace, will provide support for good green travel plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_278">I am pleased that much reference has been made to the accountability of the Olympic delivery authority on the potential for cost overruns, especially in the context of the role that the Greater London Assembly has to pay&#151;has to play, but also potentially pay&#151;in holding the Mayor to account and scrutinising the power given to him by Parliament to restrict that budget if he has a two-thirds majority in favour of doing so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_279">I made an intervention earlier in the debate about the great reluctance of the Mayor, the London Development Agency and members of the Olympic bid team to present themselves before the London Assembly when its members recently had questions to ask about the efficacy with which the bid would be taken forward. It strikes me that there will be a conflict in the procedure if the ODA refuses to appear before the Assembly when it has a role in restricting the budget that may be made available for this important initiative for the country as a whole. A sensitivity has been created by the tremendous gearing towards the London taxpayer when only 8 per cent. of the GLA&#039;s spend is funded from London council tax payers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_228"><a name="50721-27_spnew2"><b> Justine Greening  (Putney) (Con):</b> 
 Transparency is fundamental in ensuring that the finances are robustly controlled. Does my hon. Friend agree that a good way to create transparency is to allow scrutiny by Londoners and separate out the Olympic precept on council tax bills in the same way as the London Mayor&#039;s precept is spelt out?
</p>





<p><a name="st_229"><a name="50721-27_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pelling: </b> 
 That is a helpful suggestion. It might also be helpful to require the ODA to appear once or twice a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1482</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>year before the Assembly for scrutiny. That might be a way to facilitate understanding, rather than create potential conflict, which would not be helpful to progressing this important initiative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_280">I am also concerned about how the ODA will proceed on issues such as decontamination of the land, burying the power lines and any problems left over from the small nuclear power station&#151;the GLA raised that issue recently. All those issues have the potential to cause significant cost overruns, so it is important to have transparency on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_281">The role of the London Development Agency has not been mentioned positively so far in this debate, but the agency and the GLA should be congratulated on the positive role that they have played so far in the success of the bid. The LDA will have a significant role to play in the future and I shall be interested to see what the relative roles of the agency and the GLA will be, as laid out in the schedules to the Bill. Significant powers will be given to the GLA, and on balance that should be seen as a positive development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_282">It is important that the LDA should also be required to report frequently on its performance with regard to the Olympic process. As someone who used to sit on the LDA board, I have noticed the significant transfers of spending from other parts of London that are not close to where the Olympics will take place, even areas of great social deprivation. Such developments should be closely followed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_283">In conclusion, the Olympics offer the prospect of sporting excellence, but it is also important to ensure the greatest excellence in the way in which they are delivered, because London taxpayers cannot afford any kind of cost overrun when the gearing in the London tax schemes is so high.

On numerous occasions when I have visited the schools, clubs and colleges in my constituency, they have shared with me their hopes and dreams of success in the future, focusing particularly on 2012 as the culmination of all of their ambitions. Imagine the effect on all those hopes and dreams when Conservative-controlled Dudley council announced plans to close Brierley Hill swimming baths, a facility that serves my constituents and those of the

<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1483</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Minister for Trade, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson). Many of my constituents from Brierley Hill, Amblecote and Quarry Bank learned to swim at Brierley Hill and many children still receive their lessons there. Local schools use the baths and the leisure centre is home to the Brierley Hill and Stourbridge swimming clubs and to the Dudley Dolphins diving club. In addition to competitive sport, the baths and the rest of the leisure centre provide local people with opportunities to improve their fitness and to relax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_286">The decision to close the baths is in direct conflict with advice from Sport England, whose survey proved that Dudley as a whole has poor provision of sporting water space. Our club swimmers and juniors have great prospects for achievement in 2012, but no hope of assistance due to that short-sighted council decision. The blow was all the harder to take when the first citizen of Dudley, the mayor, added his vote to close the baths. The local newspaper, the <i>Stourbridge News,</i> which serves Dudley, South and my constituency, has launched a campaign with SOS&#151;Save our Swimming&#151;to retain the baths, or at least to encourage the council to find an alternative piece of land for a replacement facility, to provide a venue for learning vital life skills and for maintaining the fitness and health of all my constituents, as well as developing the talents of young swimmers and divers in Dudley and Stourbridge.

All that will be harder to attain in the light of that short-sighted decision. I ask my right hon.

<a name="stpa_288">I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) on an excellent maiden speech. He knows, probably better than most people, that Patsy will be a hard act to follow, but I am confident that he will do well. I welcome him to the House.

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_289">I feel that the debate would benefit from a Scottish perspective. As many Members will know, there has been much support in Scotland for the London Olympic bid. The Scottish Executive supported the bid team, and many polls conducted among the Scottish public have shown a high degree of support. Generally, certainly in the House, there has been cross-party support among Scottish MPs, with the possible exception of the Scottish National party, although perhaps, as we heard earlier, even the SNP may yet be convinced of the benefits to Scotland. I am certainly convinced that Scotland will benefit greatly from the Olympic games in London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_290">As Members may know, Hampden will be one of the locations for the football tournament. Glasgow is ideal for that, as there is intense passion for football in the

<br>&nbsp;<br>city; Rangers and Celtic matches always provoke a lot of cheering and high spirits. Indeed, Scotland would be an ideal location to kick off the football tournament, which will be held before the main opening of the games. I hope that the organisers will consider that option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_291">Scotland has hosted other national sporting tournaments. The special Olympics were held in Glasgow in early July and were a great success, partly because the city has a reputation for being friendly and good at hospitality. Scotland also has a national treasure in the tartan army, which is famed for travelling round the world to support our team; the army was much loved by the French people during the World cup in 1998 and is held in great affection. However, at the last World cup, people were unable to see the tartan army in such large numbers, as unfortunately Scotland did not qualify. However, we Scots have also learned to lose with good humour. It is important to be able to do that in sport, and certainly in many cases the taking part and the enjoyment are also important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_292">My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) mentioned the way that sport can unite the nation, and I was reminded that even sports that are not usually on the front or back pages of newspapers&#151;sports that do not usually get a lot of publicity and generate a lot of interest&#151;can unite the nation. I recall the winter Olympics, when, like many others, I went into the office to work the next day and found that everybody had been up until the small hours of the morning watching the curling team&#039;s victory. That is not a sport that one would usually expect the masses to be interested in, but it provides an example of how sport can unite people and get their enthusiasm going.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_293">Obviously, huge economic benefits are likely to be experienced across the UK. David Williams, chief executive of Events Scotland, has estimated that that benefit will run into hundreds of millions of pounds for Scotland alone. Obviously, that will involve training camps being set up, attracting teams to come and prepare for the games; Scotland is well placed to do that. Sports facilities of international standard, such as the Scotstoun stadium, which has international standard badminton and athletics, Strathclyde country park with its rowing lake, and even the Tollcross Olympic swimming pool over in Edinburgh, will I am sure act as great attractions. Indeed, in my constituency we have a &#163;14 million world-class training complex for a range of football clubs&#151;Murray Park, based in Milngavie. So Scotland has world-class facilities, up to international standards, and I am sure they will help Scotland, through the London Olympics, to attract teams from around the world to benefit the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_294">As other hon. Members have mentioned, the games are also likely to act as an inspiration to achieve sporting excellence within the UK. Not all Members can claim the experience of my fellow Scot and right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) of participating in an Olympics as a competitor, but I am sure we all share the desire to see young people raise their ambitions to become Olympic champions in 2012.

<a name="50721-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_295">Last week, in fact, two young constituents of mine, David and Stephanie, visited the House with their parents. After the tour, when they had learned all about the history, I was chatting with them outside and they were saying that they were keenly interested in sport. Of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1485</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>course the conversation turned to the Olympics and the excitement that if they persevere and train hard, it might even be possible that they too could compete not just in the Olympics, but in the Olympics in the UK. That thought acts as a wonderful motivation for young people taking part in sport. Indeed, Andy Murray, who is fresh from doing Scotland and Britain proud at Wimbledon, has said that the thought of playing Olympic tennis at Wimbledon with the backing of the crowd would be perfect, and I too think that would be perfect, especially if it put us in with a shot at the medals in tennis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_296">In addition to the economic benefits that would surely arise from the training camps, there is the issue of tourism, which needs to be looked at seriously. We must be careful to ensure that strategies are in place to encourage people to use their visit to London, perhaps for the Olympics, as a starting point for a visit to other parts of the UK. The central belt of Scotland is just five hours on the train from London&#151;or an hour on the plane, even if that is a slightly less environmentally friendly way to travel. It takes a little longer to get to the north of Scotland or the wild west&#151;the highlands and islands&#151;but it really is worth the trip, and many areas of the UK would fall into that category.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_297">We need to get better at stimulating tourism across the UK by visitors to London. When I was studying in London, sharing a flat with students from America, south-east Asia and around the world, I often felt like an outreach of the Scottish Tourist Board. Often the attitude was, &quot;I have seen London so I have done the UK&quot;. We need to open up people&#039;s horizons and say, &quot;London is fabulous but actually there is so much more on offer in the regions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&quot; We need to ensure that we are very much on the ball with encouraging that. The UK is a diverse, rich network of communities and there must be some new, inventive ways in which we can spark interest in tourism to other areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_298">I conclude by saying that, obviously, we need to maximise these fabulous opportunities for London, Scotland and the rest of the UK. Many congratulations to everyone involved.

Waltham Forest is one of the four local authorities that are in the Olympic park, and Leyton in my constituency will house the velodrome for the cycling and, I believe, the BMX sports. Waltham Forest contains Chingford. For a long time its MP was Norman&#151;now Lord&#151;Tebbit. He once made a famous statement about getting &quot;on yer bike&quot; to find work.

<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1486</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>many opportunities, especially for the regeneration of an environmentally and financially poor part of east London. Lots of jobs will flow from the construction work and services, and we need to ensure that the local population, including local youth, is trained up with the skills necessary to benefit fully from that employment. Extra resources must be put into that skills training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_301">There are health advantages to be had as the population is inspired to get fitter, taking part in sport using existing facilities and, after 2012, the legacy facilities. It is important that schoolchildren are given the chance and encouraged to get fitter, too. In recent years there have been attempts at free access schemes&#151;for example, to swimming pools. Those schemes must be expanded to offer schoolchildren free access to pools and tracks. Arts for the Olympics should not be neglected, and we should utilise the talents of those who are more artistic than sporty. I echo the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) about utilising art.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_302">Many Londoners are worried about the cost of the Olympics and especially about a rise in council tax. The Olympic precept on the council tax as an element of the funding package to meet the games&#039; costs is due to commence in 2006&#150;07 and last for 10 years. In a press release in May 2003, the Mayor stated that the maximum addition to council tax to fund the Olympics would be &#163;20 a year on average on a band D property. That strikes me as a reasonable precept. It would raise &#163;625 million. If there were a cost overrun, that would require &#163;650 million from the precept and the council tax charge would be for 12 years rather than 10.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_303">The agreed funding package for specific Olympic capital costs is &#163;2.375 billion, but if the costs go beyond that, although the Government are the ultimate guarantor of Olympic funding, they would expect to agree a sharing arrangement with the Mayor of London. So cost overruns still have the potential to cause damage to council taxpayers and they must be avoided. The costs must be kept under control. It is important to keep construction costs from spiralling, as happened with the Dome, the Jubilee line, the Scottish Parliament and several other projects. We do not have a good record of controlling costs, but we must do so for the Olympic facilities. That means letting the tenders and getting the work done early. The later it is, the more the contractors have the taxpayer over a barrel, and that must not happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_304">There is a lot to do with the transport improvements and the infrastructure work, but the Government are also committed to many other building projects. Building schools for the future was an election pledge that I strongly supported, so that every school that needs such building work will get it over the next 15 years. There is the work on major new hospitals and the modernisation of older ones, such as Whipps Cross University hospital in my constituency. That will be the second nearest hospital to the main Olympic facilities and the nearest to the velodrome, should there be a cycling accident, which I hope there will not be, so that must be modernised, and I am keeping up the pressure for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_305">There is also much building associated with regeneration, including the Thames gateway and Stratford city, and the Government have also set the decent homes target, which is a strong target to build 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1487</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and improve many homes. Therefore, we must really get a grip on the construction and get on with it. The Government should relax the requirement that they have had up to now to build primarily via the public finance initiative, and instead use all appropriate means to finance construction, depending on what offers the best value and what gets the job done quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_306">Quality work is also important, a point that I made in an intervention during the Tuesday&#039;s debate on the Crossrail Bill. It is important to work in partnership with the trade unions representing construction workers. I admit that I have a vested interest because I am on the parliamentary team for the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, but I draw attention to early-day motion 591 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham), which points out that safe systems of work and dignified terms and conditions, often with a directly employed labour force, is the route to world-class projects being built safely and delivered on time, and the Heathrow project is given as an example.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the five boroughs concerned have done remarkably well in pushing together the benefits of the area that they all hold dear? In fact, the London borough of Newham may have been the driving force in creating the cohesion between them, keeping them together and pressing for the agendas that they all hold dear: inward investment, skills and education, health and opportunity, and opportunities for our children.

 That is a good point, well made. But we want Hackney to do even more. We also do not want any more road routes sprung on us at a late stage, for instance over the environmentally important marshes. We do, however, want public transport to be improved as quickly as possible. Reopening of the Hall farm curve in Waltham Forest would provide a north-south rail link through the borough and, crucially, to Stratford, the main station for the Olympics. That project should move to the top of the agenda.

It needs more resources to do that, and it cannot divert already stretched resources. I urge the Government to take that special factor into account in the next series of local authority funding settlements.

A new community sports facility, the SCORE project, is due to open shortly in Leyton. It will prove valuable during the Olympics, but schools have a vital role as well. Children are a captive audience. The Building Schools for the Future project must be brought forward in Leyton and Wanstead. It is currently at the back of the queue, which is not acceptable. In 15 years it will be too late. Waltham Forest is currently bidding for private finance initiative resources for a new pool and track complex. The borough wants to provide a replacement 25 m pool, track refurbishment and a new sports hall as Olympic training facilities and to reconfigure the surrounding area, including parts of the town hall complex and of Waltham Forest college. I hope that the Minister and his team will consider that bid favourably.

<a name="stpa_319">For a long time, the Tory-controlled London borough of Redbridge has failed to get its act together on the development of a swimming pool in the Wanstead area. That situation has existed for many years, and the Olympics provides an opportunity to rectify it. Wanstead is near enough to the Olympic action for a swimming pool to be valuable, if it is built. The London borough of Redbridge should revisit those plans and submit them to the ODA and the Government, who should consider them favourably. Finally, Waltham Forest must play a significant role in developing the local legacy benefits, which will also require resources and expertise.

<p><a name="st_241"><a name="50721-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pat McFadden  (Wolverhampton, South-East) (Lab):</b> 
 None of us will forget where we were when we heard that London had won the contest to host the 2012 Olympic games. The whole country is conscious that the games can be a tremendous showcase for our capital city and our country. I, too, congratulate the Secretary of State, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Lord Coe and the team behind the bid. We all remember great Olympic moments of the past such as the titanic struggle between Sebastian Coe, as he was then, and Steve Ovett a couple of decades ago or Kelly Holmes&#039;s recent triumph in Athens. I am sure that the 2012 games will bring us more memorable sporting moments, hopefully with British winners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_321">As has been said, sadly, the moment of celebration when we won the games will for ever be entwined with the terrible events of the next day, when terrorism came to our capital city and an act of hate against the very diversity and plurality that helped us to win the games brought death and grief to London.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_322">We await news of today&#039;s events, which show that that moment has not yet passed. We are still hunting those behind the bombings and still engaged in the much longer fight against the ideology that led people to commit terrible crimes against ordinary people who were going about their daily business. Our capital city and our country will not give up in the face of those who have attacked our way of life. We will lift ourselves to reclaim the spirit that won the games and we all hope that we will stage a games that captivates the world and of which our country is proud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_323">The Bill sets out a structure for managing the planning of the games and the financial arrangements for the huge investment required to make them a success, both of which are vital factors in a successful Olympics. The British people celebrated winning the games and look forward to a wonderful sporting showcase, but they also expect the games to be properly organised and delivered on time, and they expect the costs to be controlled. They are entirely right to take that approach, which is why it is welcome that the Bill sets out proposals for the ODA to manage our approach to the games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_324">The ODA faces a huge logistical and financial task. It must plan the games in a manner that inspires and maintains enthusiasm while commanding public confidence. It must ensure value for money and that the games result in not only 17 days of fantastic sport, but a legacy of lasting benefit to the whole country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_325">The ODA has one other essential task, which is to deliver on the Government&#039;s intention that the whole country should benefit from hosting the games. Of course, the primary benefits will be in London. London is the host city and London will receive the lion&#039;s share of the spending involved. We understand that. But the Minister and the Secretary of State will be aware that, to maintain the great spirit of optimism about the games that we witnessed at the announcement, there must be continued efforts to ensure that other parts of Britain benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_326">Hon. Members from many parts of the country have pressed Ministers for their areas to host events or training facilities, each arguing the benefits of their own area. The west midlands, like other regions, will want to host training for competing countries and to play as large a role as possible in the games. There is already a commitment to host football in Birmingham at Villa Park. We have some excellent sporting facilities in the region, and a long tradition of producing wonderful athletes. Any country that comes to the west midlands to prepare for the games will find first-class facilities and a very warm welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_327">There is another dimension to what the west midlands can contribute to the Olympic games. The region is the manufacturing heartland of the UK. It has good access to London. We have world-class companies that excel in their fields and a strong record of innovation in science and technology. In information and communications technology, a recent survey found that more than a third of the sector in the region is growing at more than 20 per cent. per annum. Property and accommodation costs are much lower than in London. The region has led the way in ethnic minority business start-ups and has a highly committed work force that will relish the opportunity to help to deliver the games. Given the enormous amount of construction work that is needed, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1491</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>along with equipment and supplies, the west midlands is well placed to make a tremendous contribution. Of course, that will require investment to ensure the right mix and level of skills, but what we need most of all from Government is the opportunity to make the kind of contribution of which the region is capable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_328">Today, I spoke to people at CBI West Midlands and our regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands. I am pleased that clause 34 specifically refers to regional development agencies and their role in preparing for the games. In our region, they are already working together with local authorities, educational institutions and the tourism sector to ensure that the region makes the most of the opportunities offered by London hosting the games. Their plan covers three essential elements&#151;facilities for teams to prepare, business procurement and tourism&#151;to ensure that the region extends the warmest possible welcome to the hundreds of thousands of people who will come to Britain in connection with the games. I assure Ministers that I will send them a copy of the plan, and I hope that they and the organisers of the delivery of the games will give it full and proper consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_329">In thinking about how the country can share fully in the games and go beyond the formal hosting of events and provision of training facilities, important as those are, we must also think about how the investment and job opportunities involved in making the games happen can be shared around the country. Although London will host the games, the west midlands can, in many ways, make the games. If the country pulls together to deliver the games, as I am sure that it will, we can create a truly unforgettable event.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_330">No other sporting event has the global reach of the Olympic games. We will recover from the attack on our way of life that took place two weeks ago and triumph over the ideology that led to it. If we manage this project properly, our Olympics can show Britain at its best&#151;a modern, open country, confident in itself, sure of its place in the world and the showcase for a sporting festival in which the whole world can share.

<a name="stpa_333">That reminds us of the contrast. London was bombed and may have been attacked again today because we are a world city. We won the Olympic bid because we are a city of the world and that world is reflected in London and throughout the UK. Hackney is a diverse borough, with all the countries competing in the Olympics represented in Hackney alone, let alone the rest of London and the UK. Since the bombings of 7 July, Hackney&#039;s communities have joined forces to show what they can do when they work together, particularly the Muslim Jewish Forum, which has existed for some years in Hackney and brings together different faith groups to face challenges together.

Hackney Wick sees the largest amount of sporting activity in London every Sunday. Not many of my colleagues present, but perhaps some of their constituents, will have played Sunday league football on Hackney marshes. The games are often described as the Stratford Olympics, but it is important to remember that four boroughs will host the Olympic park. Hackney is proud to be one of them. Arenas will be built in Hackney, with the basketball centre as a lasting legacy. We will also see redevelopment of its important business centre&#151;plans that local people have been frustrated to see, but have accepted, put on hold as we bid for the games. We will see important environmental improvements to those football pitches and elsewhere. We will see access to about 5,000 new homes, many of which will be affordable and welcome to my constituents. Critically, for Hackney as a whole, we will see the delivery of the East London line extensions, at last. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] I welcome that support.

<a name="stpa_335">Very importantly, the Olympics catalyse further transport improvements still. We will see the north London line become a turn-up and go service, with eight trains an hour. Hackney will effectively get its tube thanks to the Olympics, which will connect Hackney better with London. I welcome the comments of my hon.

Yes, we must see the investment in elite sport that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State outlined in her opening speech, but we need to see physical activity for all. The health impacts will be enormous for east London and the UK. I look forward to seeing more detail from her and my right hon.

We must preserve diversity in those relocations. Again, I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North. Hackney is greater than the sum of its parts and the artists and creative businesses contribute enormously to that. It is important to work out a formula that ensures that they can remain and contribute on a continuing basis to the diversity and creative talent of Hackney, and that they are not squeezed out by yuppie or any other sort of development.

<a name="stpa_348">The games have strong backing. We have heard about the number of people who have registered on the website to volunteer and to support the bid.

<a name="stpa_349">Will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State consider a proposal supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) and me: the people&#039;s games? This is a proposal to develop a mutual organisation in which every citizen is entitled to own a share and thereby become part of a sounding board for the Olympic organising committee. In that way, every citizen in this country could have a real stake in the games. Whether they are from Northern Ireland, east Dunbartonshire or east London, they could become very closely involved.

<p><a name="st_245"><a name="50721-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I apologise for not being here at the start of the debate. As I mentioned in an earlier intervention, I was chairing a meeting of the National Strategic Partnership for Volunteering in Sport, which was being held in the House. I just wish we could find a shorter title for the organisation; we are working on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_351">A massive contribution will be made to the games by volunteering. Today&#039;s debate has quite rightly been dominated by London Members; London will benefit to a great extent from the games. However, the way to engage the entire population across the country is through the distribution of training camps&#151;I shall come back to that later when I talk about Loughborough&#039;s contribution&#151;and through volunteering. At least 70,000 volunteers will be required. It is interesting that, of the five candidate cities, only London submitted a volunteer file with its original application.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_352">We have made an enormous contribution in the past through our history of volunteering in sport, but I do not think that has been recognised by some of the other cities. There are stories that there were more British volunteers than Greek ones at the athletics in Athens. People feel that they want to contribute to sport, and many do so through volunteering.

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_353">I am sure hon. Members know that this is the year of the volunteer, and August is the month of sports volunteering. This morning, we launched the campaign to raise its profile with Tanni Grey-Thompson, a great Paralympian&#151;the Paralympics must be integral to our purpose&#151;who is known not just as a gold medallist across a wide range of sports but as a coach and volunteer. She wants to put back into her sport what she has managed to get out of it over the last few years. That is a demonstration of the commitment from many people across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_354">It is estimated that this country has about 6 million unpaid sports volunteers, which is equivalent to 720,000 full-time jobs. Volunteers are paid nothing not because they are worthless but because they are priceless. Their contribution to sport, both at grassroots and elite levels, has made an enormous difference in this country. I hope that Members can squeeze into their diaries for August, which are probably full already, something related to promoting sport in their constituencies and making sure that people register themselves on the website to volunteer in 2012.
</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="50721-31_spnew3"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the big problems has been the sale of playing fields&#151;particularly in urban areas where schools have in the past, though not recently, been encouraged to sell them&#151;and the propensity of local authorities to charge far too much for sports facilities, thereby pricing many people out of sporting activity so that they end up back in front of the television?
</p>





<p><a name="st_247"><a name="50721-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Reed: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. As he knows, I have a great passion for grassroots sport in particular. I still play rugby every Saturday afternoon during the winter, at the playing field of the school that I attended until I was 18. I must admit that on Saturday afternoon we are the only team that uses the pitches, tennis courts, basketball courts and indoor facilities of that school. The costs have increased dramatically over the past few years. In terms of the legacy of the Olympics, we should make it successful across the country. Unless there is a legacy not only at the elite level, about which I want to speak specifically, but at the grassroots level, nobody will feel that there has been enormous benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_355">Great expectations have rightly been raised since the announcement. Everyone wants a training camp in their constituency, and everyone thinks that every 14-year-old they know who is quite good at sport will be in the Olympics. The reality, however, is that we will have a team of only about 200 or 300 athletes. I wish people well, but most of those who will be competing in the Olympics in seven years&#039; time are probably already in development squads. Many people who are very excited about the Olympics will still, like me, be playing on muddy pitches around their constituencies in 20 years&#039; time, and not competing at elite level. It is therefore important that we get the right combination of funding for elite athletes who will go on to win gold medals, to which having the Olympics in London will make an enormous difference, and ensuring that the real legacy is not just 50 m swimming pools but swimming pools across the patch, decent playing fields and decent changing rooms across the country. So my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) makes an important point.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1497</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_356">In relation to the sale of playing fields, there has been a step change, and while we have not reached the point at which we are not selling any off, at least there has been a massive reduction. In many cases, where a playing field has been sold, it has been replaced by a better facility, as is the case in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_357">In terms of regional development, places such as Loughborough, Sheffield and Bath&#151;I see that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is back in his place; we follow each other around all the time&#151;have, as part of the English Institute of Sport, some of the best facilities in the world for athletes. The Chinese team have already been to look around facilities such as ours, and will probably locate themselves at one of our three bases. As other Members have said, however, I am keen on not just Loughborough benefiting, but the whole of Leicestershire and possibly the whole east midlands. We cannot provide all the facilities for the Chinese team, but we could do athletics, netball, basketball and a wide range of other events, and we have a 50 m pool and cricket academy. Others events would have to be farmed out within the region, so a great partnership would be required. Every Member rightly wants something to come to their constituency, and every area with a 25 m pool wants to match itself with a country somewhere in the world, but we should create a clearing house so that the competition is proactive rather than destructive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_358">Finally, the success of the games will be measured by the number of gold medals that our athletes win. Every nation has always done much better in the medal tables when it has hosted the games than when it has not. The target for what our athletes achieve in Beijing in 2008 is already pretty ambitious, and we hope that they do even better in 2012. As I said, though, the people who will succeed in 2012 might already be in the development programme. I agree with UK Sport and the British Olympic Association that we need stability in the funding that is made available. We want the four-year programme to 2008 to be extended to 2012, and funding to be increased to ensure that our children and youngsters are able to win gold.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_361">The Paralympics will be coming to this country as well as the Olympics. Hon.

<a name="stpa_363">People in Putney are delighted that London will be holding the Olympic games&#151;especially if the finances are carefully controlled.

I lodge a request with the Minister that he seriously consider having a lift put into Southfields station, so that it will be accessible for everyone who wants to use it when the games are on.

 The IOC&#039;s decision in Singapore to award the 2012 Olympics to London, and today&#039;s Second Reading of the Bill, mark the start of a period of remarkable opportunity for this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_366">There is the prospect that the games will give our economy a very considerable boost. The boost delivered as a result of the Barcelona games was estimated at &#163;11 billion, and the amount is surely likely to be much higher now. For the environment, there is the prospect that we will have the largest new urban park in Europe. For Londoners, there is the prospect of regeneration of the lower Lea valley.

<a name="stpa_367">For those still at school&#151;such as Amber and the 30 children from the east end who represented us all so effectively in Singapore&#151;there is the prospect of achieving Olympic success in their own capital city, or of becoming an Olympic volunteer. Most importantly of all for all of us who care about sport, there is the prospect of a sea change in the relationship between sport and Government. In the fortnight since Singapore, I have been struck by just how much this opportunity means to so many different people, but also by how expectations have now been raised in so many different areas, as the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) said only a moment ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_368">This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and delivering on it will not be easy. However, before I turn to that issue I should like to put on the record&#151;as my right hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1499</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) did before me&#151;my and my party&#039;s appreciation for all the work done by those who brought the games to London. I pay tribute to Lord Coe, Keith Mills and everybody who worked at London 2012 during the bid process. At the celebratory party in Singapore after the vote, I was struck by the many personal and professional sacrifices that so many of their team made to work on the bid. We are all very much in their debt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_369">I also want to pay tribute to the three main stakeholders. First, I pay tribute to the Government, and particularly to the work done by the Minister for Sport and Tourism and, of course, in her absence, by the Secretary of State, in bringing the games to London. Secondly, I pay tribute to the Mayor&#151;I never thought I would say that at the Dispatch Box&#151;and thirdly to the British Olympic Association, and to the Princess Royal in particular, who has been somewhat left out. I saw her lobbying and working on the country&#039;s behalf day in, day out in Singapore, but she has received very little praise for it. To all of them and to the many others who have worked on the bid, we in this House and all those whom we represent owe a considerable vote of thanks.

Perhaps the Minister can confirm that during his winding-up speech.

<a name="stpa_372">We also want to ensure that the spirit of the London bid is upheld in two particular ways. First, London 2012 should be a games for athletes and it should empower the youth of this country through sport. Secondly and most importantly, and as I have already mentioned, the Government must deliver on the wider sports agenda. London 2012 provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the structure and funding of sport in this country, and it must not be missed.

<a name="stpa_376">As an east-end MP, the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) made some extremely sensible points about cost overrun&#151;a point to which we will return. The hon.

Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) is another who spoke up well in support of her constituency, and she reminded us of some timely security concerns. My friend the hon. Member for Loughborough, who is something of a House expert on sport, made some excellent points about the levels of expectation, volunteering and elite sports. I can only say that I entirely agree.

My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) voiced well-expressed concerns about ambush marketing, and with her commercial experience she made an informed and valuable contribution. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) spoke of the role of the London Assembly, and he, too, was quite right. Finally, it was nice to hear my hon.

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_378">Let me turn to my party&#039;s position. The detailed provisions of the Bill can be worked on in Committee, but seven key principles govern our approach. The first is accountability to Parliament. The London 2012 Olympic games is a national event, and we want to ensure that the ODA and other Olympic bodies are accountable, through the Secretary of State, to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1501</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Parliament. The Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport will clearly have a role, but I hope that the Government will agree to two more things, in particular. First, there should be an annual debate in Government time, ideally at this time of year, once the accounts have been published. Secondly, the ODA should be subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office and thus, should it wish to, by the Public Accounts Committee. I hope that the Minister will confirm that those ideas are acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_379">The second principle is partnership working. The powers available to the Mayor of London in this legislation are extensive and, therefore, in some ways, controversial. However, if London is to deliver the games on time and to budget, it is vital that the ODA and the Mayor work in partnership with the boroughs and use their reserve powers only as a last resort, and preferably only with the agreement of the Secretary of State. One way to reassure the London boroughs, which have concerns about that, would be to ensure that they were represented on the ODA board. Furthermore, I hope that as the games draw closer, they will be encouraged to second staff to the ODA for a reasonable period before, during and after the games. Perhaps the Minister will also address that point when he winds up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_380">Thirdly, there is concern about cost overruns, a subject raised by several Members on both sides of the House. The memorandum of understanding signed by the Government in 2003 puts the burden of any overspend firmly on the lottery and on Londoners, but previous games have considerably overrun their budget. It will almost certainly not be the fault of Londoners if the cost of the games overruns. One of the key marketing messages throughout the bid process has been that these games are for the whole United Kingdom. I very much hope that the Government will re-examine the 2003 memorandum now that the games have been secured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_381">Fourthly, there is the issue of businesses in the lower Lea valley. The Minister is aware of our concerns, and I am grateful for his intervention following the Westminster Hall debate a couple of weeks ago. However, it is clearly wrong if existing businesses end up paying for the privilege of hosting the games, and I hope that effort will be put into resolving that issue over the summer so that the Minister can report in Committee that progress has been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para22">
<a name="stpa_382">Fifthly, there is security, which is, sadly, again much on our minds today. Clearly, it will be a key concern as we count down to 2012, and security issues must be incorporated at every stage in the delivery process. Despite the fact that the London 2012 website details the formation of a new Cabinet-level Olympic security committee, there is no direct mention of security issues in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister would confirm the Government&#039;s position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para23">
<a name="stpa_383">Sixthly, there is the question of the tax take on the Olympic lottery game, and it will not surprise the Minister at all to hear me raise that once again. It is, in my view, simply indefensible for the Government to profit to the tune of an estimated &#163;320 million from a game designed to finance the London 2012 Olympics, particularly when they were so keen to exempt the Live 8 concerts. Given the Minister&#039;s constant assurances 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1502</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the games will not run over budget, that money ought to be used to create a lasting legacy from the 2012 games. Personally&#151;a purely personal view&#151;I favour giving the money to the British Olympic Association to establish scholarship funds at arms length from Government to help aspiring young Olympians in future. That is the sort of eye-catching initiative that would give the games a worthwhile legacy. I know that the Minister cannot give me any further assurances on the matter tonight, but he ought to be aware that it is a subject that we intend to pursue. I suspect that that will not surprise him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para24">
<a name="stpa_384">On the wider sports agenda there is the issue of the reform of the structure and financing of British sport. There is now wide agreement that there should be one clear funding stream for sport. The performance director of UK Sport said only last week following the meeting of the British Olympic Association:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;The management of the investment in sport should be through one body.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para25">
<a name="stpa_385">I could not agree more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para26">
<a name="stpa_386">On the financial side, delivering the Olympics will by any reckoning place the national lottery sports principal funding stream under extreme pressure. I cannot see that there is any chance of delivering the many promises made to sport during the bid process without a step change in Government&#151;let us be honest, by that I mean Exchequer&#151;funding. The Government must take action now to cut some of the unnecessary and overlapping bureaucracy and radically to reform the structure of the financing of sport in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para27">
<a name="stpa_387">I should like to finish where I started. The London 2012 Olympic games are a unique and remarkable opportunity for this country. We should all record our thanks to everyone who has brought them to us, notably tonight the Secretary of State and the Minister. As Conservatives, we will continue to offer the Government our wholehearted support for this fabulous opportunity as long as the process is accountable to Parliament, as long as partnership not compulsion is the key principle of delivery and as long as there is genuine progress on the wider sport agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-32_para28">
<a name="stpa_388">Delivering the 2012 Olympics on time and to budget will be a hugely testing undertaking. Seven years is not in all honesty a great deal of time. However, I firmly believe that, if we all remain true to the principles that have guided the bid thus far, Britain can stage a great and remarkable Olympic celebration in 2012.

<p><a name="st_256"><a name="50721-33_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 I start by saying thank you to all hon. Members this afternoon. It has been a successful debate and, to a large extent, it has mirrored the way in which we have taken the nation forward. The nation has been united behind the project of winning the 2012 games. I, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, Seb and all his team have felt proud to lead a nation that was united with a tremendous amount of pride.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_389">Like the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson), I did not think that I would be standing here congratulating the Mayor, but I should like to congratulate some others, including the press. Broadly speaking, the press were behind the bid, and that was helpful.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_390">The unity of purpose behind the bid was epitomised when the evaluation team was here. We were all at No. 10 sitting around the Cabinet table just a few weeks before the general election. The leaders of the various political parties were all there with the Prime Minister and they sang off the same song sheet with a unity that even shook the evaluation team of the IOC. It showed clearly how we were all behind the bid. Hostilities broke out five minutes later of course, but for that period we were united. There is only one thing that can do that; it was sport itself that brought the nation together.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_391">I congratulate the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) on his maiden speech. It was a thoughtful speech. He gave us a vivid tour of his constituency. Unfortunately, or fortunately perhaps, I was not involved in the by-election; we were out gathering votes in other areas of the world. The hon. Gentleman said that the north-west, through Manchester&#039;s Commonwealth games, had played a significant part in getting the Olympics for us. It was a multi-sport event, and he described the fantastic role played by some of his constituents who were volunteers for those games. That showed the pride of the north-west and it helped us significantly to convince people in the IOC that we can and will continue to stage major sporting events.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_392">The challenge now is to deliver the games with a legacy for London and the whole of the UK, as well as for the Olympic movement. We have made some clear commitments to bring young people back into sport through the Olympic movement. We made those commitments genuinely in relation to this nation and internationally, and we will live up to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_393">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said that we had spent a lot of time travelling the world and learning from cities that have staged the Olympics. We did, and I hope that we will learn from any mistakes they may have made. It became clear to us that the process has three stages. The first is winning, and there is no doubt that Barbara Cassani, who set up the company, and Seb Coe, who later led it to victory, brought together the skills that we needed in a partnership to win the games. We now need to deliver one of the biggest construction programmes that this country has seen for many years. The third stage will be the delivery of the games themselves. Each stage requires particular skills, and the two companies have been designed with that in mind. The first is the London organising committee for the Olympic Games and the other is the Olympic delivery authority, which the Bill will set up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_394">The ODA will be responsible for delivering the construction projects, and people can be confident that no favours will be done when the chairman, chief executive and board are appointed. We are looking for the best in the world and if we have to go internationally to get people to go on that board or join the staff, we will do just that. Seb and Keith Mills will be the chair and deputy chair of LOCOG, and they will seek a chief executive in the near future. They will be looking for the very best.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_395">I assure the House that we are approaching the setting up of those two companies very professionally. We have learned the many lessons from Picketts Lock, the dome and Wembley, so the companies will be set up to deliver those two main functions. The Office of Government Commerce has &quot;destruction tested&quot; the structures we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1504</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>propose, and we will set up a programme management committee to oversee the process and provide an early-warning system. We have spent a lot of time on the structures and on the budgets and financial structures. We were commended by the IOC on that chapter of the bid document, and it said that our structures were robust. It drilled down deeply into that chapter, and that is why we are confident that the structure will hold up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_396">We took the view that an overview was necessary as an early-warning system. If things start to go wrong, the programme management committee can inform the steering group and the board, which consists of the three stakeholders&#151;the Mayor&#039;s office, the British Olympic Association and the Government. It would also inform the two major companies that will manage the project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_397">On the wider issues of the nation and regions, the committee that has already been set up and functions well under the able chairmanship of Charles Allen, will continue its work. I met the committee last week and I was pleased to see the depth of representation, at a senior level, of the regional development agencies, the regional sports board and many others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_398">I shall not go into detail on all the questions that have been posed in the debate, because I am sure that in Committee and through the many contacts that we will have over the months and years ahead we will be able to explain the process and ensure that we get it right. It is in the interests of the nation to get it right, because it will provide many opportunities way beyond sport. Sport is the vehicle for many other opportunities, including regeneration and tourism. The committee will continue to function and I hope that many Members will be involved as the weeks and months unfold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_399">There is no doubt that there will be competition for the training camps. In my region of Yorkshire, the regional development agency and the sports boards have already carried out an audit, through the universities, and I should not be surprised if they had not already contacted people in various countries to encourage them to come to the county well before 2012.
</p>

 As my right hon. Friend knows, the world-renowned Gateshead international stadium is in my constituency. The Secretary of State explained in her speech that the Bill will include guidelines for the role of RDAs in attracting training camps and, in turn, regeneration. My hon. Friends the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) and for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) and I will be meeting our RDA, One North East, during the recess to get the process under way, but does my right hon. Friend the Minister agree that a fundamental element in the success of training camp bids&#151;especially ours in Gateshead&#151;is the complete and unified support of local communities, as was the case in London, from whose success we all hope to benefit?
</p>





<p><a name="st_258"><a name="50721-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Yes. I am sure that all the RDAs will work together and we shall give them every encouragement and assistance, wherever we can do so. The opportunities are there.

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_400">We cannot go into the wider issues in this debate, but the talented athlete scholarship schemes, talent identification and the world class performance plan will develop the sustainable structure for sport that many people want.

<a name="50721-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_401">We shall deal with the Mayor&#039;s powers in more detail in Committee, but we shall be working with the Mayor and the London assembly to ensure reasonableness in the operation of those powers. I think that the provisions of the Bill will ensure that the powers are used properly for the purposes for which they were designed. They were necessary to deliver our obligations to the IOC, as was right, but there are enough checks and balance to ensure that they are used reasonably.
</p>





<p><a name="st_259"><a name="50721-33_spnew2"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 Earlier, I asked about the relationship of the London boroughs and the London Government Association in respect of powers that relate to the rest of the country. Are the Government willing to include those bodies to ensure that the reasonableness is tested by them, too?
</p>





<p><a name="st_260"><a name="50721-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Absolutely. We should expect that, even though it is not stated in the Bill. There will be consultation and we believe that it should include all major partners, such as the local authorities and the LGA. As the project has developed, we have seen those partners come together on issues such as planning, and I would never have believed that we could have achieved so much even before we started talking about primary legislation. There has been a fantastic demonstration of support and partnership across local authorities and political parties on planning issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_402">Members asked about funding. The figures have already been set out, but there were questions about over-run, which will be dealt with through a memorandum of understanding. Our work on the funding mechanism was helped by our experience of talking to people in other Olympic cities, especially Sydney. I shall never forget the person who said, &quot;Do not underestimate the budget. If you have to go higher, it will be seen as a failure so make sure your calculations are realistic.&quot;

<p><a name="st_262"><a name="50721-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend bear with me? There are only a few minutes left for the debate and there are a number of things I want to cover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_403">There will be a &#163;17 billion investment in transport, which will include the East London line extension and the docklands light railway upgrade. Members will be able to discuss the details in Committee. That played a major part in winning our bid because, as Members know, we did not get the best grades for our answers to the 25 questions a year ago last January.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_404">Security formed part of our submission; it was part of our candidate file. I believe that the IOC was satisfied with what we were saying about home security and I have no doubt that that matter will be further explored in Committee. I can assure hon. Members that we will not leave it untouched. There is no doubting that we have a first-class security and intelligence service in this country. We were there in Sydney and very much so in Athens; our people were leading the security committees there. Security will be one of the major considerations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_405">On the Olympic delivery authority, I emphasise that it is very important to bring in not just the skilled but the best in the world, and we will search the world to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1506</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contract those people. We think that they will be attracted because, as has already been said, the national stadium will be more than an Olympic stadium; its design will revolutionise the way that sports facilities are used around the world in years to come. If we can build an 80,000-seater stadium, reduce it to a 20,000 capacity and build it back to a 40,000-seater capacity using designs that we believe are now attainable with existing materials and engineering skills, it will bring a whole new dimension to stadium design. If one looks at the legacy of Sydney, one sees that real difficulties were encountered with its national stadium. We saw what happened in Athens and in Barcelona. We believe that we can introduce a whole new dimension to stadium design. Our proposal to use facilities on a temporary basis and then to move them around the world is an important development, so the challenge to develop such stadiums and associated further facilities, and the opportunity that that presents, is immense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_406">Many initiatives have already been taken to ensure that the skills base and the opportunity for regeneration do not pass the east end by. More need to be taken and a major responsibility of the ODA company will be to ensure that we can drive that quality regeneration in the most effective way. It will also&#151;it is embedded in the Bill&#151;be one of the greenest Olympic games ever and it will be commended by the IOC.

 Will the Minister give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_264"><a name="50721-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 No, but on the question that I am sure the hon. Gentleman wants to raise, I think there has been an incorrect interpretation of the compulsory purchase orders. We want to ensure that there is a fair settlement for all those who will be displaced. I will ensure that the ODA understands that. We want to achieve that settlement. We do not want traders to be put out of business. I have taken a personal interest in this; I will continue to do so, and I hope that all parties will come to the negotiating table to try to get a reasonable and fair settlement. Yes, the balance of powers has now gone to the LDA; I acknowledge that. The LDA has now won that bid, but I hope that we can still have an air of co-operation and transparency, which will bring a fair settlement to all those who will be displaced. I will watch that very carefully and if the hon. Gentleman wants to meet me to discuss it, I will be more than pleased to see him.

But we are not in the hungry 1930s any more. We have moved on&#151;many of us against our will.

<br>&nbsp;<br>coke works. The restoration of Gibside however is not just about buildings; it is a living thing. A cursory glance through the programme of activity for this year reveals events ranging from brass band concerts to a Georgian Christmas dinner via a bat watch and a performance of Shakespeare&#039;s &quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot;&#151;how very fitting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_417">This superb venue that so many people have worked hard to retain and restore will be overshadowed by activity on the open-cast site, and if, as we suspect, the developers seek an extension of their permits, it could be a shadow that is cast for many many years to come. Gibside combines history, religion, culture, a respect for nature and just pure natural beauty, and it will all be at risk if these plans are not halted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_418">But Gibside is so much more. It is proposed to develop the stable block as a short-term residential facility for young people&#039;s projects, for school parties and for further and higher education use. It is a venue for a community project for people coming from the inner-cities of Newcastle and Gateshead to engage in the countryside with the National Trust. It is an opportunity to help people into work in areas that they would never have thought about before. Finally, it is used as an orienteering project by over 40 groups from the same inner-city schools and youth clubs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_419">It is not just the impact on Gibside that worries us in the north; it is also the impact on wildlife. Only two weeks ago we released a second batch of red kites into the wild after they were driven out from the north over 150 years ago. What have we released them to face? Blasts from explosives, dust from excavation and noise from the heavy duty machinery, which typifies open-cast sites. Forty-one of those beautiful birds will be released this year into the valley, and it is not being done here by accident. It is happening here because of the high quality of the landscape, which provides a real mosaic of different but complementary habitats.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_420">It is not just the fate of those beautiful birds that concerns us. In recent years otters have returned to our rivers, which is unheard of. Kingfishers and heron compete side by side in the becks, burns and rivers of our countryside. Tawny owls swoop silently through the night air. Red and fallow deer criss-cross the land, watched furtively by badgers and foxes. Grass snakes, adders and slow worms all form part of the natural habitat alongside great crested newts, which we believe have already suffered from the nearby working at a proposed landfill site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_421">Those are the main reasons why we are so strongly against these plans. In our part of the world we have seen too much of this activity. As I speak, residents in my community are still challenging the right of multinational companies to dump waste in a landfill site to the north of these proposed workings. Gravel pits, sand quarries, coal mines, coke works&#151;you name it, we have had it. We want to move on. We want to use the fact that we are a site of special scientific interest to attract people to our valley and the surrounding towns and villages. We want a renaissance in the north. It is our time for a moment in the sun. We know that wildlife can exist in the harshest of conditions, but why impose problems when the rewards are so small? In the classic words of soulless economists, we have done the cost-benefit analysis and it simply ain&#039;t worth it.

<a name="50721-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_422">There are concerns also about the impact on the area&#039;s water systems. This area, as I will explain later, is honeycombed with old mineworkings, most of which are prone to serious flooding. Excavation on this scale could well disturb the balance of the water table, something about which we are very concerned about in our area. There will be different impacts in different parts of my constituency and those nearby. Some 96 lorry movements per 12-hour day are predicted&#151;one every 7.5 minutes. Those lorries will drive through villages that already struggle to cope with the overspill of traffic from the massively blocked A1, which peaks during the morning and evening rush hours. The response from drivers will be to use rat runs around the local villages to avoid the A692. Unfortunately, those roads will lead cars into more congestion as they work their way through busy villages and past a large comprehensive school. <i>[Interruption.]</i>

 Order. There is a disturbance beyond the Bar, which is disrupting the debate.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_423">There is another consideration. Earlier I spoke of the long history of coal mining in our area. In the view of some historians, coal mining on an industrial scale started on the fells in our area before it started anywhere else in the world. Seams of coal near the river Tyne had been exhausted, and others could not be exploited owing to water problems. The coal on the fellside around Whickham was the nearest workable seam that could be readily drained. The market to London was crucial, and the liberalisation of the rules on mining introduced by Elizabeth I paved the way for the development of coal in the area on a scale never before envisaged. Drainage outlets were driven into the fell, from which water still runs. Dams, aqueducts and water wheels were built, which led to the world&#039;s first large-scale coalfield development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_424">Given the importance of coal to the history of our region, not to mention the rest of the country and the world, it could be argued that instead of ripping the area up we should&#151;as we are trying to do&#151;conserve it, develop it and use it to educate future generations. It is part of our history and heritage and should be seen as such, and as a stepping stone to a new future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_425">There will be claims that my call for rejection of the proposal is rooted in nimbyism. I hold both hands up to that, and I do not apologise for it. Our back yard has been used and abused for centuries; it is full to overflowing. We have had enough. We still suffer from the economic and social impact of that, and we refuse to allow it to go on any longer. Our area has been poisoned, polluted and exploited for far too long. If the country needs coal so badly, let us really go for it: let us redevelop the vast reserves that are left under the North sea, in Yorkshire, in the midlands, in south-west Scotland and in Wales. Let us use our expertise in deep mines, and reclaim our place as a world leader in clean coal technology. We must not let contractors who do not even live in our part of the world come and spoil our area for years to come, just to produce enough coal to burn in three days. We are talking about three years of disruption for three days&#039; worth of coal burn. We do not want it, we do not need it and we are not having it.

Different communities will be affected in different ways. The one thing that unites the people is their clear view that we have had more than our fair share of hassle and inconvenience from the exploitation of our area, and we want to move on. The people have consistently, and so far successfully, fought open-cast mining in our area. They have fought nine separate applications since 1971, and each time they had to fight all the way to appeal to the Government of the day.

We have paid our dues over and over again, and we deserve the chance to advance in a new direction. In the north, we know about paying our dues, and whether it involves our unions, our political parties, our faith groups or society as a whole, and people in my part of the world have never been found wanting. We have never been afraid to make our voice heard, and our voice must be heard in challenging these proposals.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) on securing today&#039;s debate. My constituency is affected by that development, and I have received many representations from local people who are opposed to it. I know that the Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), has received many representations and has met community groups and others in Burnopfield in her constituency, which would be directly affected.

<a name="stpa_437">Durham is rightly proud of its mining past, and the Durham Miners gala, which took place a few weeks ago, shows our rich history. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon has said, however, we have moved on through developments such as the turning the tide project on the north-east coast, which has been cleaned up and is now an attractive tourist destination, and the reclamation of former colliery sites across Durham in my constituency and that of the Secretary to the Treasury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_438">Two weeks ago, I visited the site with my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon and Stephen Hughes, the local MEP. The view across the Derwent valley is breathtaking. It was a clear day, and we could see across the valley, through Newcastle and up to the Cheviots. It is a peaceful and tranquil spot, and it would be a tragedy if it were ripped up and scarred.

<a name="50721-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_439">My hon. Friend has already mentioned the work of Gateshead council, to which I pay tribute, on making sure that that area of outstanding natural beauty is a tourist attraction. I also pay tribute to Durham county council for promoting tourism within Durham. I sit on the north-east tourism advisory board, and the last thing that County Durham needs is a succession of large holes across the county, which is something that we must consign to the past. The knock-on effects on constituencies such as mine are not only the visible impact, nor the fact that it may give developers opportunities elsewhere across County Durham, but the increased traffic flow from the site that will no doubt find its way through the small communities of North Durham.

I should also emphasise that I am not a planning Minister&#151;at this point, I am rather pleased that I am not&#151;and it would be inappropriate for such a Minister to be here. I am merely the Energy Minister, and my remarks&#151;not about this application, I emphasise again&#151;are intended partly to provide some energy context.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_443">I should like to table a few facts about surface mining in the United Kingdom. In 2000, total UK coal production stood at 30.6 million tonnes. Of that, 17.2 million tonnes was produced by deep mines and 13.4 million tonnes by surface mines; the latter is not an insignificant figure. Annual coal use in electricity generation, which absorbs around 85 per cent. of UK coal production, stood at 46.9 million tonnes. In 2000, UK-produced coal supplied around 55 per cent. of coal-fired electricity feedstock, and more than 40 per cent. of it came from surface mines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_444">Four years on, in 2004, total UK coal production stood at 24.5 million tonnes&#151;a fall of 20 per cent.&#151;of which 12.5 million tonnes was deep mined and 12 million tonnes was from surface mines. In the same year, coal use in electricity generation reached 50 million tonnes. In 2004, UK-produced coal provided around 45 per cent. of coal-fired electricity feedstock, half of which had been surface mined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_445">Those figures clearly illustrate the important contribution that surface-mined coal makes to coal-fired electricity generation and hence to total UK energy needs. Energy supply is crucial to our economies, our culture and our local communities. That contribution is under threat. In recent years, surface mine output in Scotland, which has no deep mines, has remained steady at around 7 million tonnes per year. Output in Wales has also remained steady, at around 1.2 million tonnes per year&#151;roughly double its deep-mined output. But output in England has declined sharply from 5 million tonnes in 2000 to 3 million tonnes in 2004. In 2005, it is expected to halve again to around 1.5 million tonnes. In

<br>&nbsp;<br>2006, on the basis of current planning permissions&#151;let me stress that phrase&#151;it is forecast to reach barely 600,000 tonnes. If that proves to be the case, total UK surface mine production in 2006 could be no higher than 9 million tonnes and that at a time when, despite receiving some &#163;170 million of state aid since 2000, deep mine output is also under serious pressure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_446">Already this year Ellington colliery has been closed by catastrophic flooding. It now appears likely that, despite the best efforts of all concerned, Harworth colliery is to be mothballed. Those and previous closures could bring annual UK deep-mined output to less than 11 million tonnes and total UK coal production, which was 24.5 million tonnes last year, to barely 20 million tonnes in 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_447">The Government firmly believe that there is a future role for coal as part of a balanced energy policy, providing that its potential environmental impacts can be managed, and that there can be a continuing role for UK produced coal in meeting our total coal requirements. The coal-fired generating sector has demonstrated its confidence in that vision by committing to install flue gas desulphurisation equipment at a number of power stations. However, the vision depends on sufficient supply of UK produced coal, which means coal from both deep and surface mines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_448">The decline in English output is not due to a shortage of workable reserves. The key planning document for English operators is minerals planning guidance 3, generally referred to as MPG3. It permits a presumption against coal extraction, whether open-cast or deep mine, and against colliery spoil disposal, but only if the proposal is not environmentally acceptable or cannot be made so by planning conditions or obligations. If it cannot be made so, it must provide local or community benefits which clearly outweigh the likely impacts to justify the grant of planning permission. My officials 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2005 : Column 1516</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>continue to work with colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to ensure that MPG3 is properly applied by planning authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50721-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_449">The industry has come a long way in recent years. It is subject to stringent controls, especially with regard to site operations, such as hours of work, noise and dust levels, provision of screening mounds and so on. Site restoration requirements may include the recreation of water courses and the replanting of hedgerows and mature trees as well as the careful reinstatement of agriculture land, where appropriate. Where a site has been degraded by previous industrial activity, it may include, for example, untreated waste, abandoned shafts or areas where old underground workings may collapse, causing subsidence or dangerous gas releases. Surface mining will normally remove those hazards and restoration will leave the site in a significantly improved condition. Many developments not only include reinstatement to a previous condition, but also new woodland planting, for example, habitat creation and improved public access. As required under MPG3, such enhancements will normally be taken into account by the planning authority when assessing whether a planning application offers long-term local and community benefits which offset temporary adverse impacts while the site is producing coal.
