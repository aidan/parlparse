 The reason the Opposition are wittering away, as you so correctly put it, Mr. Speaker, is that they do not like the answers. The answers show clearly what the Government are doing effectively in intervening in the Welsh economy. We have mentioned the car scrappage scheme; let us also not forget that the future jobs fund will create 150,000 jobs across the United Kingdom as a whole&#151;about 7,500 in Wales&#151;with an investment of about &#163;50 billion. That is effective. There is also the ProAct scheme, from which 63 companies and nearly  4,000 workers benefit, and the ReAct scheme. All those measures contribute materially to improving the lot of the people of Wales and improving the Welsh economy.</p>

As a result of doctors being able to prescribe complementary health care free on the NHS, some two thirds of participating doctors agreed that their patients&#146; health had improved. About half the patients took fewer painkillers, half took less conventional medication, including prescriptions, and two thirds had less time off work. This is therefore a win-win situation.

 I very much agree with my hon. Friend that. The fact that a new power station is being built in his constituency is a massive vote of confidence in the local economy. Indeed, that very point was made in <i> The Economist</i> only a few weeks ago. On his specific point about employment, there is a marvellous opportunity for the work force of the area and the region. We in the Wales Office are certainly doing our utmost to ensure that local people derive the greatest possible benefit from that investment. To highlight that fact, I know full well that my hon.

 My right hon.

 It is important to put the hon. Lady&#146;s question in context and recognise that the number of police officers in Wales has increased by almost 1,000 in the past few years&#151;a significant improvement. Throughout the length and breadth of Wales, including south Wales, people will testify to the fact that they want more proactive local and neighbourhood policing and that it is being delivered. I recognise the hon. Lady&#146;s points about the situation in south Wales, but let us also be clear that her Liberal party colleagues on the local authority in Cardiff have been reluctant to make the necessary increase in precept, which would allow proper funding. I am meeting the chief constable of South Wales in the near future to discuss her concerns and I am sure that she will mention the need to discuss the possibility of designating Cardiff as a capital city.</p>

We have to make sure that terrorism cannot hit the streets of Britain, and that is why we cannot allow the Taliban or al-Qaeda-related activities to flourish in Afghanistan, and why we cannot allow the Pakistan Government to be overrun by people who are operating through al-Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban.

The reason is that, in addition to the defence budget, &#163;14 billion has been spent on Iraq and Afghanistan, and &#163;4 billion of that has been spent on urgent operational requirements for the troops. Part of the spending is on helicopters, and we have now committed &#163;6 billion over the next 10 years to helicopter spending. We have already announced that more Merlins will arrive in the field later this year, and the helicopter fund is producing helicopters from allies as well. We have an order for more helicopters for the future. So the helicopter equipment programme continues, and we work with our allies to deliver the best services on the ground.</p>

 The Prime Minister is right that our armed forces and their families are watching this debate, but on this issue they expect responsible questions to hold the Government to account and proper answers from the Government. The Prime Minister mentions the international helicopter fund. Will he accept that so far&#151;it was announced 16 months ago&#151;it has not yet added one single helicopter? The public will find it hard to understand why as a country we have 500 helicopters, yet fewer than 30 of them are in Afghanistan. Let me take one group specifically: why is it that only one of the eight Chinooks that were delivered in 2001 at great cost is now ready? Why has there not been greater urgency to deliver? That is a legitimate question, and it requires a proper answer.</p>

On the allies&#146; contribution, three helicopters have either arrived or are about to arrive, 11 in total have been promised, and &#163;30 million has been put into the helicopter fund by us and others. May I just explain to the right hon. Gentleman that helicopters have got to be adapted for the terrain in Afghanistan because they need to deal with excess heat and with height? Our helicopter crews have got to be trained for that particular operation in Afghanistan, and the reason that we have greater capability now is that we not only have more helicopters in the field, but more flying hours are being done by helicopter pilots and more staff are available, and we have readapted some of the helicopters to be able to make those flights.</p>

We are raising child benefit and child tax credits, and we are creating Sure Start centres in this country that the Conservative party refuses to support.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the UK low carbon transition plan, which we are publishing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09071559000177">All of us in this House know the gravity of the challenge that climate change poses. We know that to rise to the challenge will mean comprehensive changes in our economy and our society. We are one of the few countries in the world to exceed our Kyoto targets, we are now the leader for offshore wind generation and we are the first country in the world to legislate for carbon budgets, but the proposals published today represent the first time that we have a set out a comprehensive plan for carbon across every sector&#151;energy, homes, transport, agriculture and business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09071559000178">A decade ago, the carbon impact of most policies was not even measured. Last year this House passed legislation for legally binding carbon budgets&#151;measurable caps on our carbon emissions. That was a dramatic change in approach, but we need to go further because every part of Government needs to be responsible for meeting those budgets. So I can announce that from today not just the country as a whole, and not just the biggest Departments, but every Department has its own carbon budget. Having been the first country in the world to set legally binding carbon budgets, we are now the first country in the world to assign every Department a carbon budget alongside its financial budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09071559000179">The plan sets out how we will meet the carbon budgets set out by the Chancellor for an 18 per cent. reduction on today&#146;s levels by 2020, or a 34 per cent. reduction compared with 1990. Let me announce to the House how we will make the 459 million tonnes of carbon savings. In agriculture and waste, there will be a 6 per cent. cut in emissions&#151;20 million tonnes&#151;by 2020, made possible by new policies on waste and new commitments on farming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09071559000180">In the transport sector there will be savings of 14 per cent., or 85 million tonnes, by 2020, as is set out in the sustainable transport strategy published today by my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. This includes plans for electrification of rail, tougher car and van emission standards, and the new &#163;30 million fund to get low-carbon buses on the roads in the next two years. We are also doing more to bring about the transition to electric cars, with new funding making possible a recharging infrastructure in up to six cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09071559000181">Across business and the workplace, we show how we can make 41 million tonnes of savings, or 13 per cent. on today&#146;s emissions, including through the carbon reduction commitment to be introduced next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09071559000182">The most important reductions to meet our carbon budgets will be in how we generate and use energy. In the power and heavy industry sector, we show how emissions will be reduced by 22 per cent., or 248 million tonnes. With North sea gas production declining, if we carried on with business as usual, over the next decade our imports of gas would double. On the basis of the low carbon choices I announced today, our forecast is that rather than our gas imports doubling, they will be   <br>

kept to 2010 levels for the whole of the following decade, so that with more low-carbon, home-grown energy, we avoid an ever-increasing dependence on imports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09071559000183">I have listened to representations on renewable energy and have concluded that, for reasons of energy security and climate change, it is right to go ahead with plans for 15 per cent. domestic renewable energy by 2020. In the final decisions in the Government&#146;s renewable energy strategy, published today, we show how we can secure about 30 per cent. of our electricity from wind, marine and other renewable sources. We are also publishing the shortlist of Severn tidal schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09071559000184">I believe it is right that we shall also go ahead with our plans for new nuclear power stations. We will publish our national policy statements on nuclear and other energy issues in the autumn, and the industry is planning at least 12.4 GW of new stations&#151;more than current capacity. Alongside the most environmentally stringent coal conditions in the world, the Government have proposed up to four carbon capture and storage projects, and we have proposed legislation for the next Session of Parliament to make that happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09071559000185">Let me be clear: I believe that for the future of energy in Britain, clean coal has an essential role to play. As the plan sets out, renewables, nuclear and clean fossil fuels are the trinity of low carbon and the future of energy in Britain. It would be fatal to pick and choose between them; all of them should be part of our future energy mix. In total, our plans show that we will get 40 per cent. of our electricity from low-carbon energy by 2020 and more in the years that follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09071559000186">To deliver the changes in our energy supplies between now and 2020, we must make it easier for investors to turn low-carbon projects into reality. Having tackled the planning rules, I believe we now need to do more to deal with the issue of grid connection, so I am today announcing that I will exercise the reserve powers provided under the Energy Act 2008 for Government, rather than the regulator, to set the grid access regime. The new rules should be in place within 12 months, so that instead of waiting for more than a decade for grid connection, as can happen now, we can get the fast access to the grid that renewable projects need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000187">We also know that as we generate power in a cleaner way, we also need to use energy in a smarter way in our homes. In the plan we show how, in total, cleaner sources of heat and better use of energy can cut emissions from our homes by one quarter compared with today. We must also transform the information on energy use available to all of us, so as well as putting in place new funding today for smart grids, we propose to roll out smart meters to 26 million homes by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000188">We need new incentives as well as better information. The plan makes it clear that in energy efficiency, we need a house-by-house, street-by-street transformation, like the transition from town gas to North sea gas in the 1970s. Over the next decade, our plan sees families not having to pay up front, but being able to spread the costs over many years, paid for out of the savings on their energy bills. Today we take the first steps with the first pilots of the new pay-as-you-save scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09071559000189">As well as information for individuals and the right incentives, we know from the transition towns movement about the power of community action to motivate people, so we will provide &#163;500,000 each to 15 areas of  <br>

the country for people to come together to trial the newest technologies and be beacons for how other communities can cut their carbon emissions. In addition, I can confirm that from next April, individuals and communities alike will be able for the first time to generate their own renewable power and sell it back to the grid, with guaranteed feed-in tariffs. The details of the rates and levels on which we are consulting are set out today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09071559000190">We need reforms not only in how we produce energy and how we use it, but in how it is regulated. In the energy world of today, unlike that of 20 years ago, the job of the regulator is to help to deliver on our climate change commitments, because failure to act now will store up greater costs later. I therefore propose to change Ofgem&#146;s principal objective so that for the first time, reducing carbon emissions, as part of protecting the future consumer, will be explicitly set out as part of its guiding mission. Competition is essential, but we know from the experience of prepayment meters that it has not delivered for all consumers, so I will also make it clearer in Ofgem&#146;s principal objective that when competition does not deliver, it is its duty proactively to stand up for consumers throughout this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09071559000191">With greater expectations of the regulator should come greater powers, so I also propose to legislate to provide Ofgem with tough new powers to take action where it believes that there is anti-competitive practice in the generation of electricity. Strong regulation is all the more important given the upward pressures on prices in the coming years. Making the energy transition will have costs, but for households those costs are significantly offset by savings resulting from energy efficiency and reduced energy demand. Today&#146;s plan will not increase average household energy bills by 2015, compared with now. For households in 2020, the plans today will mean, on average, 6 per cent. on domestic bills&#151;&#163;75 a year&#151;compared with today. If we include all previous policy announcements on climate change, the figure is 8 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09071559000192">Given the costs of transition and the priority of tackling fuel poverty, we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable consumers, so I propose to reform the system of social tariffs, as has long been urged. More than 800,000 households now receive discounts and other help with their energy bills. That is part of a voluntary agreement with the energy companies. I propose that when the voluntary agreement ends in 2011, discounts for the most vulnerable will continue not through a voluntary arrangement but through legislation for compulsory support from the energy companies. We will legislate to increase the amount spent, and we intend to target new resources at the most vulnerable consumers, particularly older, poorer pensioners. We must make the transition to low carbon on the basis of energy security and fairness, and we must also seize the industrial opportunities, using the money that the Chancellor allocated in the Budget. We have set out plans for carbon capture and storage and, today, for new investment in nuclear manufacturing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09071559000193">As for renewables, Britain has half the usable tidal energy in Europe. Today I am committing up to &#163;60 million to build our wave and tidal industries so that we can test new technologies and expand port access and deployment in key parts of the country. We also need to nurture the offshore wind industry, in which we have a unique  <br>

resource, so I am making available up to &#163;120 million to support the growth of a world-leading offshore wind industry in Britain. As well as supporting the demonstration and testing of offshore wind, the money will be used to attract offshore wind manufacturers to the UK. We estimate that those investments will help to nurture industries that can support hundreds of thousands of jobs in our country. We can make that investment today only because, even in the tough times, we made the choice to invest in the economy of the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90715-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09071559000194">Climate change is the moral issue of our time. In five months&#146; time, the world must come together at Copenhagen and follow through on last week&#146;s commitment by world leaders to stop dangerous climate change. Today we show how Britain will play its part. Our transition plan is a route map to 2020. It strengthens our energy security, it seeks to ensure that the decisions we make are fair, and above all, it rises to the moral challenge of climate change. This is a transition plan for Britain, and I commend it to the House.</p>

 I begin by thanking the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement. After the briefings in the weekend press, which were even further in advance, he has been generous in informing us all about the content of today&#146;s policy announcements. Like the Secretary of State, I read all the best bits months ago in the Conservative Green Paper &#147;The Low Carbon Economy&#148;, which, I am reliably informed, has lingered on his desk. That being the case, of course I welcome his remarks. This area of policy is crucial for Britain. Its consequences will affect our lives and those of future generations. Investments worth billions of pounds need to be made in a very short period. There is plenty of risk in that&#151;risks inherent in the capital markets, in future energy prices, and in the technologies. However, for too long, public policy in this country has been a source of additional risk for investors. I am determined that instead of amplifying uncertainty, our policy, with its clarity, rigour and consistency, should be a haven from it.

With the roll-our of smart meters already under way in America and elsewhere, why will he not set an earlier target than 2020?

The Government have taken an ambitious approach to offsets, as did the Chancellor in the Budget. We have said that we will achieve the 34 per cent. reduction through domestic action, and exclusive of the EU emissions trading scheme. That remains the case. As he will know, because his deputies will have taken part in the debate on this, we have set the credit limit for the first budget period at zero. In fact, in our plans we over-achieve on our carbon budgets, but I hope that he is not falling for the idea that any offsetting abroad is automatically a bad thing&#151;</p>

 I am going to ask the Secretary of State questions, not because I want to be confrontational but because his policy is lacking in certain areas. Will he confirm that the Government will wish to be judged at the next election not on words but on delivery? Will he therefore explain why, on the day that we have heard that the only company producing turbines in this country is going to close, the Government have done nothing specific to support the growth of UK-based industry in the sector? What is his estimate of the amount of new technology that will be produced in this country, as opposed to abroad, by the end either of next year or of the next five years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90715-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09071559000216">Given that we are at the bottom of the European league table on renewables, with a contribution of 2 per cent. compared with more than 30 per cent. in Sweden and almost 10 per cent. in Germany, is not the reality that, although the Chancellor announced incentives for the renewables sector in the Budget, he has subsequently failed, because the renewables industry has been waiting three months for the promised meeting to discuss how the European Investment Bank money can be accessed, and no meeting has taken place? Why have all the English regions bar one failed to reach their renewables target? What will change that situation over the next year, and the next five years? Will individual communities, including counties such as Cornwall and countries such as Wales, be able to get on with their own policies to deliver the green peninsula, in Cornwall, and the green country, in Wales, without the Government telling them what to do?</p>

Will the bills fall on the private sector, with its big profits, and on those of us who can afford to pay, so that in the end we have a fairer Britain, not just a greener Britain?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90715-0005.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000225">We had discussions with Vestas, but I want to make it clear that it never wanted grants or money to persuade it to stay in this country. The option was obviously considered with the company, but there were two factors in its decision. The first aspect is that it was making turbines for America, where it had a factory. The second aspect is related to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about renewables, and is a big issue for everyone in the House. It is about planning&#151;not so much the planning rules, because we are changing them, although unfortunately the Opposition want to reverse that change, but the question of whether one can get onshore wind turbines built. Vestas&#146; speciality is onshore wind, and that requires political persuasion&#151;a hard job for all parts of the House. The job is to persuade people that although onshore wind turbines may be unsightly to some, the bigger threat to the countryside is not wind turbines but climate change. Of course there are areas where wind turbines would be inappropriate, and we have proposals today in our renewable energy strategy about how we can work with local people to site the turbines more sensitively, but they have to go somewhere, and we all need to focus on that necessity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90715-0005.htm_para12"><a name="09071559000227">On fuel poverty, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we face a massive challenge. It will be an even bigger challenge in the future. I am happy to work together on the issue, but we need to find all the ways to tackle fuel poverty that we can. Reforming social tariffs is a good start, but if there are other ways we should definitely use them, because given the upward pressures on prices, fuel poverty will be a big challenge over the next decade&#151;and, frankly, beyond that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90715-0005.htm_para13"><a name="09071559000228">The hon. Gentleman and I disagree about nuclear energy. I am not engaged in a love-in with the nuclear industry, but I do think that nuclear energy has an important role to play. On grid access, I said that the new plans would be in place within a year, and that that is how we will speed up the connections, because I did not want the stand-off between the industry and Ofgem to continue.</p>

The Chancellor&#146;s decision in the Budget to look into support for offshore wind was important, but we then come back to issues such as sorting out planning and grid access. People need to be convinced not just that there is a theoretical financial investment worth making in the UK, but that it will be made on time, that it will start, and that it will not be obstructed by planning rules.

 The Secretary of State said that cuts in emissions in agriculture would be made possible by new commitments on farming. Can he tell the House how he expects the agriculture industry to face those challenges? Surely it is important that we do not challenge the profitability and sustainability of farming throughout the UK.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is completely right. My right hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek to invoke your help to improve ministerial accountability to the House. Paragraph 9.3 of the ministerial code states:</p>
<a name="90715-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09071559001374"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Every effort should be made to avoid leaving significant announcements to the last day before a recess.&#148;</p>

I have raised the matter with the Prime Minister on a number of occasions through written questions. Most recently, I asked him what steps he would take to ensure compliance with paragraph 9.3 of the ministerial code, to which he replied:</p>
<a name="90715-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09071559001375"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Guidance for Ministers on announcements is set out in the Ministerial Code.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 13 July 2009; Vol. 496,  c. 108W.]</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made his views very clear, and I am grateful to him for doing so. I think that he will understand, and I hope the House will appreciate, that it is not for me to rule or adjudicate as between one orderly method of giving information to the House and another. I think that Ministers are aware that there is a widespread appetite for oral statements, and it would be helpful if, to a greater extent in the future than in the past, that appetite could be met.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The House is well aware of your concern to ensure that parliamentary questions are answered promptly. I am concerned that there seems to be a practice in some Departments of answering on time on the required date by merely saying that they will write to the hon. Member concerned at some point in the indeterminate future. That indeterminate future can often occur during a recess. Is there anything that you can do to require Ministers, when there is sufficient time and a clear possibility, to give a clear written answer within the timetable required by the House?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that point of order. The answer to his question is that I can certainly reiterate today what I have said on previous occasions and indicated in writing to the Leader of the House, who I know takes ministerial responsibility for these matters extremely seriously&#151;namely, that replies to written questions should be timely, and that they should also be substantive. It would, I think, represent a breach of the spirit of the principle that I have set out, if not of the letter, if Ministers were simply to reply with what I suppose the hon. Gentleman would call a holding response. What is needed is a substantive reply, and it might interest the House to know that I requested of all Ministers a matter of a fortnight or so ago that the backlog of written questions should be cleared, with substantive replies, before the summer recess.</p>

Part of Jaguar Land Rover&#146;s statement referred to the fact that it is still waiting to secure funding of some hundreds of millions of pounds from the European Investment Bank. That is a matter for negotiation with UK Ministers, and may now put the company in jeopardy.

A Government Green Paper on paying for care for the elderly was also published yesterday. I want to consider another way in which the House should care for elderly people, however, because I believe that we can judge a society by how it looks after its old people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90715-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09071559000324">I want to consider the all-too-common situation facing some old people. They will probably live alone. Typically, they may be old women, who are possibly widowed. Through their doors, piles of mail pour daily&#151;I have such a pile here&#151;to be read by a person who was raised in a gentler and more honest society than ours. Of course, many old people are busy and active with friends, and understand what to do with junk mail&#151;namely, throw it away. However, others are lonely and perhaps confused and bored. They have time to read the junk mail, and an industry has been created that preys on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90715-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09071559000325">A constituent first alerted me to the problem. Since then, the personal experience of my 89-year-old mother has revealed the problem in all its detail&#151;and she is registered with the Mailing Preference Service. However, I am not making a personal plea. Only today, I spoke to a journalist who had the exactly the same experience with his old father before he died, and I have also read a three-year-old article from <i> The Guardian</i>, which believed in September 2006 that the Office of Fair Trading would introduce a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90715-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09071559000326">The problem has two sides. The first is less serious and involves mail from charities, many of which have laudable aims. Mailshots are an accepted and possibly important way in which to raise to money, and many people are employed by charities to do mailshots. I am sure that that raises money for what one hopes are good causes. However, I suggest that all charities examine their consciences and the aims of their work and consider whether they should target old, confused and lonely people, tugging at their heartstrings to get money out of them. Let me give a few examples. I have a pile of letters from animal charities, including Animals in Crisis; the Dogs Trust; Compassion in World Farming; Spana, which is about animals in Spain; World Horse Welfare; Network for Animals; People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare. I also have letters from human charities, including St. Christopher&#146;s Fellowship; VSO; St. Mungo&#146;s; Feed My People; Medical Mission International; Ethiopia Aid; Christian Blind Mission and&#151;most perversely&#151;Help the Aged. All those begging letters arrived in one month. Indeed, Help the Aged wrote to an 89-year-old woman, pointing out that she had cancelled her direct debit and asking if she would like to reinstate it. Such a charity could have applied a little common sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90715-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000327">I do not doubt the good intentions of many of those charities, if not all of them, but I question whether they should bombard elderly people in that manner. I suggest, first, that charities should have a box that over-75s might tick to indicate their age, and then a voluntary code, providing that they will not send further begging letters to over-75s. I also suggest that they employ common sense. If an elderly person is subjected to constant direct mail, the charities should be somewhat ashamed of themselves. The worst example is from IFAW. I have several letters that suggest that an elderly person has won &#163;20,000. We all know that that is not true, but IFAW and its chief executive, Mr. Fred O&#146;Regan, send elderly people letters, which say that all they need to do is register to be entered into a fantastic prize draw: &#147;Red Hot Cash Payout&#151;&#163;35,000 of prizes to be won.&#148; It states that if people follow the rules, cash prize funds will be paid to winners. IFAW should be ashamed of itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90715-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000328">However, the second element is much more pernicious, and there is nothing laudable in the motives of those responsible. Direct mail is being sent to elderly people&#151;and, I suspect, others&#151;pretending that the recipient has won money. All the recipient has to do is buy something useless and worthless or send money to receive a huge cash prize. I have here a large pile&#151;too large to hold in one hand&#151;of one month&#146;s largely unopened junk mail. Some letters come from something called &#147;Our Life&#148; in Greenford. There is another from the &#147;Department of Information&#148;, again in Greenford, which states: &#147;You have won &#163;20,500&#148;. A letter from Biotonic, also in Greenford, states exactly the same thing, except that some Biotonic and Star Shopping letters say:</p>
<a name="90715-0007.htm_brev3"><a name="09071559001377"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You have won &#163;15,500&#151;your winning status is certified&#151;congratulations&#148;.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para0"><a name="09071559000342">I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for clarifying Mr. Speaker&#146;s judgment in this matter. If it helps, let me give Members a brief background. The Gary McKinnon case has been extensively publicised in recent days, but it cannot currently be the subject of debate in this House, as you rightly say, because of the rules that apply on sub judice. The McKinnon case is currently subject to a further round of legal proceedings in the courts&#151;proceedings that were taking place this morning and, as far as I am aware, are still taking place as we speak this afternoon. The House has strict rules about debating matters where legal proceedings are in train. Under a resolution of this House that was passed on 15 November 2001 on matters that are sub judice, we cannot discuss the case unless and until those proceedings are concluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09071559000343">However, the concerns that exist about our current extradition arrangements go much wider than simply the McKinnon case. The matter has been debated and issues have been raised for a number of years. As I think you will agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the McKinnon case has brought those issues back to the fore. That is why we have sought to use this time to allow Members in all parts of the House to discuss those concerns and to send a clear message to Ministers that we want the current situation to be reviewed. Such a review is vital to maintain the integrity of the extradition system, to make changes to ensure that it is fair and just, and to ensure that it enjoys public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09071559000344">There is no doubt that public confidence has been sorely lacking in the past few years. In several cases raised by hon. Members on behalf of constituents there has been a prima facie case for believing that justice was not being done. Current events make the case for a review all the more urgent. The motion that we will vote on at the end of this debate is therefore designed to underline the case for such a review. The motion does not seek to prescribe what changes should take place, even though many right hon. and hon. Members will have strong views about the detail. Neither does it seek to condemn the Government for their handling of our extradition system in recent years. The motion is simply designed to demonstrate that there is a will in Parliament for change. I hope that Members in all parts of the House will join me in the Lobby to send a message to Ministers about the need for change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09071559000345">Extradition is a pretty trying process for a person to go through and it can take an immense psychological and physical toll. In the United Kingdom alone, the act of extracting someone from their home to stand trial and then serve a prison sentence will change their life for ever. To do that to someone and also send them to a foreign country with a different legal system is something that should be decided only in a process of the utmost rigour and scrutiny. That is why any system that is put in place to manage such a process must be subject to the most serious checks and balances on both sides of the arrangement. It is our fear on the Conservatives Benches&#151;and, I suspect, among Members in all parts of the House&#151;that the arrangements that are currently in place for extradition from the United Kingdom do not meet the criteria that we would expect on reciprocity and fairness.</p>

relationships with other countries. I am not seeking to criticise the conduct of the United States or any other country&#151;they are rightly looking after the interests of their citizens. Rather, it is this Parliament and our Government who make the rules surrounding extradition from the United Kingdom. The Extradition Act 2003 set the framework for those rules, but we are unconvinced that it is working in the way that we should expect.</p>

Frankly, we have seen that again and again&#151;indeed, it is a trap that the Government have fallen into on many occasions.</p>

 I hope that the shadow Home Secretary will not think that my point is merely one of semantics. We talk about the extradition treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom, but actually there is no such piece of legislation in the United Kingdom. These things are done under the royal prerogative. In contrast, the measures in question were endorsed in legislation in the United States Congress two and a half years after we promulgated our side of the so-called bargain. There has clearly been a disparity from the beginning. For two and a half years, we were implementing our part of the treaty, whereas the United States refused to do so. That is simply unfair. A previous Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), ignored the fact that this Parliament&#146;s Foreign Affairs Select Committee protested time and again about the disparity and the inequality of application of the treaty.</p>

 Given the fact that the motion has been phrased so as not to criticise the Government, did it not surprise my hon. Friend that they did not find it possible simply to accept it?

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The House would be grateful to the Home Secretary if he withdrew his amendment, accepted the principle of the motion and agreed to look again at the arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09071559000359">There are three big problems with the current arrangements. The first relates to the people who are being extradited. We have long argued that the Extradition Act 2003 has resulted in a situation whereby the people who get caught up in the system and who are being extradited are not those whom the Government said the legislation was designed to target. We were originally told that the legislation represented a move to address the international security situation after the horrendous incidents of 2001. However, the House of Commons Library has assembled an analysis of the people who have been requested for extradition by the United States. They include 20 people requested for drugs offences,  18 for fraud, two for satellite signal theft, three for theft and just one who was involved in a terrorist case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09071559000360">These issues are not just about our relationship with the United States. The 2003 Act also enacted the arrangements that exist with other countries, particularly the European arrest warrant. It is another example of a measure that was introduced when security was top of the agenda. It was designed to enable the swift transfer between one country and another of terrorist suspects, but it has subsequently developed mission creep, and in so doing, it has undermined civil liberties.</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="09071559000361"><a name="90715-0008.htm_spnew10"><a name="09071559001676"><b>Mr. David Burrowes (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):</b>
 Is it not also noteworthy that, in the list of offences that my hon. Friend just gave to the House, there was no mention of computer hacking? Other serious computer hacking offences have been dealt with by our own courts, leading in some cases to custodial sentences. Crucially, justice has been seen to be done in this country.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I will come back to that issue, because another key question is where we should implement justice when a case involves multiple jurisdictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09071559000363">British citizens can be extradited to other parts of Europe for a range of extraordinarily ill-defined offences that might not even constitute a crime here or in many other European countries. There have already been examples of the European arrest warrant being used in a way that most of us would feel was inconsistent with the original principles discussed at the time of its introduction. The rapid move to strengthen extradition arrangements in the first part of this decade was clearly designed to combat the terror threat, but those new arrangements should not be allowed to become a quick  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000364">The second big problem with the present arrangements involves the way in which we appear to be sub-contracting justice to other countries in cases in which there appears to be a competing jurisdiction. This goes back to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) made a moment ago. There is a strong case for arguing that the courts should have a statutory duty to consider issues of what is called forum&#151;in other words, the question of which country has the most appropriate claim to prosecute&#151;and that this country should not sub-contract difficult prosecutions to other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90715-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000365">This problem is going to arise again and again in cases involving cybercrime in particular&#151;my hon. Friend has just mentioned computer hacking&#151;not only in the Gary McKinnon case but in a whole variety of others around the world. I remind the House of the recent case of the two Swedish men who were prosecuted in their own country for piracy offences, but whose crimes had clearly crossed jurisdictions around the world. The provisions of the law in this country should be much clearer about when a case should or should not be tried in the United Kingdom. There are clear legal precedents for this: British people charged with crimes that were allegedly committed in the United Kingdom but which electronically targeted organisations in other countries have been brought before the courts in the United Kingdom.</p>

During a two-week trial at Southwark Crown court in 2003, Caffrey was accused of launching an electronic attack in 2001 on America&#146;s busiest port at Houston, Texas. The jury cleared him of any wrongdoing after accepting his claim that unknown computer users had hijacked his machine, using it as a Trojan horse to stage the attack. His case was tried in this country, and he was found not guilty. He was not extradited to the United States.</p>

At the time, the Americans were in the midst of delicate negotiations with the North Koreans, and they were terrified because the break-in appeared to originate from a US air base. In 1997, Bow street magistrates fined the 19-year-old &#163;1,200 after he admitted 12 offences that his lawyer described as a &#147;schoolboy prank&#148;.</p>

Countries that are classified for the purposes of the 2003 Act as category 2 countries can be given an additional designation, enabling them to dispense with the requirement to provide prima facie evidence with their extradition requests. A territory in the enhanced category 2 status need only provide &#147;information&#148; rather than &#147;evidence&#148; to satisfy tests for the issuing of warrants.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Home Secretary and I will have days when we spar and days when we do not, and I very much hope that today can be one of constructive discussion leading to a genuine consensus across the House that a review is necessary to deal with a whole range of actual or potential injustices that have taken place in our extradition system in recent years as a result of these agreements.</p>

 I seem to recall that the original negotiations were done in an unusual manner and were peculiarly related to terrorism, war and defence implications. The heart of the Government&#146;s argument at the time was that there was &#147;rough equivalence&#148;, but the very use of the word &#147;rough&#148; demonstrated that there was no equivalence. That lies at the heart of our current difficulties.

 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. I am tempted to say &#147;very rough equivalence&#148;, because the gap is really quite big, as we have seen in some of the cases. I do not suggest that it was initially the Government&#146;s intention that some of these injustices should take place, but none the less they have taken place, and there are real concerns about individual cases.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way a second time. I have been interested in this matter since 2003. I have sought an explanation, including from the former Prime Minister, of why the UK was willing to enter into a treaty that disadvantaged British citizens to the advantage of American citizens. I have received no such explanation, but may I suggest that it may well be that in the period immediately after the military action against Iraq, the then Government&#146;s policy of staying as close as they possible could to the United States was the motive that lay behind the treaty.

The underlying principle was that when a British citizen was involved, the case should be made in a British court in the ordinary, traditional way.

 I take the Home Secretary&#146;s point that there was a need to examine this whole area, but does he not accept that at a certain stage it became clear that the system was not working in terms of natural justice, in the contexts of both public confidence and individuals? Can he not spend a little time telling us how he feels that it could be changed in order to end ridiculous situations, which the public will not accept, involving individuals such as Gary McKinnon?

 I understand why the Secretary of State is trying to mix and match the Extradition Act 2003 and the precise terms of the US-UK treaty, but will he confirm that this House first had an opportunity to express opinion on the treaty on 15 December 2003? I was a member of the Committee that considered it, and my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) and I voted against it; I was supported by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell). We have consistently taken that view. When we brought the treaty back to the House, we opposed it, but unfortunately it was supported by a margin of 243 to 43. We Liberal Democrats have continuously and consistently opposed this treaty. We have done so because we believe that it is one-sided, that it is wrong to have this sort of negotiated treaty with the 51 jurisdictions of the United States, each of whose judicial systems have widely different terms, and that in its effect it is unfair to British citizens. We cannot believe that the British Government adopted a position of such supine acquiescence as not only to agree it in the first place, but then to implement it long before the United States Senate itself had got around to ratifying it.</p>

Is not the point that ultimately everything, including the treaty and the European arrest warrant, is governed by the terms of the 2003 Act, and the 2003 Act is deficient?

but the fact is that there are insufficient safeguards, and on top of that the treaty that was negotiated with the United States is more visibly deficient in terms of lack of proper reciprocity than any other agreement that we have entered into. That is why this debate is so relevant.</p>

 I am sorry, but I did not frame this motion; the Opposition did. I am just pointing out the disparities. Of course I want to talk about the 2003 Act and the UK-US treaty, because they are both important subjects in this debate. The hon. and learned Gentleman intervened on me to say that this is not just all about the US and the UK, but it is also about Europe. That is where this particular discussion comes from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09071559000426">I disagree profoundly about there being an absence of any safeguards, but I shall come on to that shortly, and I certainly reject the suggestion that the extradition arrangements between the UK and the US, as set out in the 2003 Act and in the treaty, are somehow unbalanced. That argument has traditionally been made on the following basis. First, it is argued that the evidential requirement placed on US authorities seeking to extradite people from the UK is somehow less burdensome than the evidence that the UK is expected to produce to extradite people from the US.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09071559000427">Historically, all requests by countries to extradite people from the UK had to provide prima facie evidence. There are too many right hon. and hon. and learned Members present for me to have to explain this, but I will do so for the record: prima facie evidence is evidence that if taken at face value would be enough to convict someone. This was a much stronger requirement than some other nations demanded for UK extradition requests. The requirement was dropped for all EU member states, signatories to the 1957 European convention on extradition and other trusted international partners with mature judicial systems such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia. UK courts instead asked for &#147;reasonable suspicion&#148;&#151;in other words, the same level of evidence required by the magistrates court to issue an arrest warrant in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09071559000428">Following the introduction of the 2003 Act, the relaxation of the evidence requirement was extended to cover other trusted extradition partners including, but not limited to, the US. That is hugely significant, because it means that the UK and the US now demand of each other essentially the same level of evidence. The imbalance was prior to the change, not after it.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) reminds me that this is even worse; Baroness Scotland was not a legal officer when she made that announcement, but a Home Office Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000446">It is assumed that the fact that more people have been extradited to the US from the UK than the other way round somehow indicates an imbalance&#151;the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell did not use that in his argument, but the most common argument used against the treaty deals first with reciprocity and secondly with that fact, rather than simply telling us that more people flee the US for the UK than the other way round. It is the  case that between 2001 and 2008, about 30 people  were extradited to the UK, compared with around 60 being extradited to the US. Since 2007, however, we have extradited more people from the US than vice versa, and many of the people extradited since the 2003 Act came into force have committed serious offences&#151;those are the &#147;low-profile cases&#148; that I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000447">Members of this House may recall the successful extradition from the US of Mark and Sean Gorman, who were wanted in this country for a savage hammer attack that left a man with permanent brain damage. They were apprehended in New York, subsequently extradited and are now serving seven years and five years respectively for their horrific crime. Another low-profile case was that of Calvin Berry, who was extradited from the US and jailed for 10 years for the manslaughter and robbery of a teenage girl. Hon. Members may also be interested to know that since 2004, 10 people have been extradited from the US on suspicion of murder, manslaughter or attempted murder, six have been extradited for sexual offences, including one case of gross indecency with a child, and two have been extradited for kidnap and child abduction. So there is no question of this being one-way traffic.</p>

The motion, for understandable reasons, does not specifically mention which cases those are, but one of them, as we have discussed, must be that of the so-called NatWest three, whose extradition was vigorously opposed by many Opposition Members. That was despite the fact that there was &#147;reasonable suspicion&#148; of their involvement in a major case of fraud, which, in turn, played a role in the Enron scandal that deprived  21,000 people of their jobs and many more of their pensions and life savings.</p>

The High Court was clear on this matter: the case had substantial connections with the United States and could properly be tried there. It was claimed by those campaigning against extradition that the NatWest three would be denied bail and would spend two years in a maximum-security prison&#151;they were, in fact, granted bail and the trial was delayed only at their instigation.

tried in November 2007, they pleaded guilty to fraud and were each sentenced to 37 months. Following short periods spent in US prisons, they are now serving the remainder of their sentences in the UK. I understand how the public become involved in high-profile cases, but it is difficult to understand how cases are not reported so accurately when they go from being high profile to low profile and how the actual experience of the NatWest three can be left completely out of the argument now raging about Gary McKinnon.</p>

 If the Home Secretary is interested in the experience of the NatWest three, who include Mr. Gary Mulgrew, he should consult his fellow Labour party member, Mrs. Trish Godman, who is an MSP and the mother of Mr. Mulgrew. I have kept in touch with her, as I did with Mr. Mulgrew during his imprisonment. She has made it clear, as indeed has he, that such was the nature of the prosecution and the implied threat behind it that he was compelled to accept a plea bargain&#151;that is not unusual in the United States, where prosecutors traditionally load the prosecution in the hope of encouraging accused persons to try to do the best they can by offering a plea to a reduced charge.

 I am sorry, but I do not take it from that intervention that Mr. Mulgrew was innocent. I take things from the action of the courts and what has happened through the courts.

I am pointing out that for all the campaigning and hyperbola about the NatWest three, they were treated fairly in the American courts and were brought back to serve their sentences in the UK, so I can hardly see how the case brought the 2003 Act into disrepute&#151;it might have brought a lot of other things into disrepute, but not the 2003 Act.</p>

 I am going to make progress. On the question of prosecution, as I made clear to the House, only the Director of Public Prosecutions can make such a decision, and that includes deciding in which country the prosecution should be brought. In practice, under the 2003 Act, the extradition process works as follows. First, the case for extradition is submitted to the Home Office by prosecutors from another country and is then referred to the magistrates court. The magistrates court must consider whether there are grounds for the issuing of an arrest warrant&#151;and whether there are any &#147;barriers&#148;, as they are termed, to it&#151;which means that there must be reasonable suspicion that the subject in question has committed the offence. An arrest warrant is then issued to the police following that procedure, if no barriers were found&#151;no barriers were found in the case of Gary McKinnon. The case is then heard in the magistrates court, and the court must decide whether or not there are any grounds that bar the extradition&#151;for example, whether the individual in question has already been tried and cleared of the offence for which they are to be extradited, which is known as double jeopardy, or whether the extradition would be a breach of that person&#146;s human rights under human rights legislation, which Opposition Members seem to find so difficult at times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09071559000457">Once the court is satisfied that there are no grounds that bar extradition, the case comes to the Home Office and the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary is then legally obliged to order that person&#146;s extradition, except in three specific circumstances set out in law: where it is possible that the person who is to be extradited could be sentenced to death if convicted; where there are inadequate arrangements in place in that country to prevent someone&#146;s being also charged with an offence that was committed prior to extradition and not included in the request that led to their extradition; and where the person who is to be extradited was previously extradited to the UK from another country and that country has not consented to any further extradition. If none of these circumstances apply, the Home Secretary must order extradition.</p>

 Order. Before the Home Secretary answers that question, I just say to the House that he has been on his feet for some 32 minutes. That is quite a long time, and he obviously has more to say. It is not his fault that he has been on his feet so long: it is because he has taken so many interventions, which obviously stimulate the debate and need to be made. I just hope that he is conscious of the time, because it is passing quickly and many hon. Members still seek to catch my eye.</p>

 I understand that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) is intimately involved in his constituent&#146;s case, but I assure him that the safeguards are in the 2003 Act. I have no problem with campaigns, whether by newspapers or others, because that is a healthy part of our democracy, but we have to act in accordance with the law, which provides safeguards in this case. We have gone through the process whereby the magistrates court has decided that there are no reasons and has sent the case to the Home Secretary. I have three specific points to judge such cases on, none of which applied in this case.</p>

If their appeal fails, they can appeal it in the other place. If that fails, there is then a legal duty on the UK Government to extradite the individual within 28 days. But within that time, the person in question can also refer their case to the European Court of Human Rights, which will look at whether the extradition would breach that person&#146;s human rights. If the court rules that an extradition would not breach their rights, the UK is legally obliged to continue with the extradition. So there are safeguards at every single stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90715-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09071559000464">Following these failed appeals, only if powerful and compelling evidence comes to light that demonstrates clearly that the extradition would breach our obligations under the European convention on human rights&#151;for example, a life-threatening illness&#151;can the Home Secretary halt the extradition. In doing so, he or she must apply strict legal tests to determine whether the new information about the subject&#146;s mental or physical health would mean that their human rights would be breached should the extradition continue. If the case does not meet that test, they cannot halt the extradition, although their decision not to do so can be challenged in the courts.</p>

 I welcome the Opposition&#146;s motion on the Extradition Act 2003. This is a timely and important debate. Every few months, an extradition case hits the headlines, including most recently the case of Gary McKinnon, which is still sub judice while judicial review proceeds. Before that, as the Home Secretary and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) have pointed out, there were the NatWest three. These repeated causes c&#233;lbres underline the problems with our extradition arrangements. They underline the injustice of the unequal treaty that we have signed with the United States, and they will go on and on until that treaty is amended to put American and British citizens on an equal footing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90715-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09071559000468">I am astonished by the Home Secretary&#146;s new doctrine, which no previous Minister has advanced&#151;perhaps we could call it the Johnson doctrine&#151;that there is an equality of treatment. In the past, Ministers have confessed that there is no equality of treatment, but they have justified that on other grounds. The reality is&#151;this is the key point, which the Home Secretary confirmed&#151;that we have to show fact if we want to extradite from the US, and that is not the case for the other way around. For any Government to agree that our citizens should be treated as second-class citizens is an outrage and demands correction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90715-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09071559000469">That is why the Conservative motion does not go far enough. It calls for a review of the Extradition Act 2003, without signalling the problems and highlighting the unjust arrangements contained in the US-UK extradition treaty. The Extradition Act has good and bad parts. Let me start with the good. We like its enabling of the European arrest warrant, a sensible measure for the easyJet age, that has brought back more than 300 dangerous criminals&#151;including rapists, murderers, paedophiles and drug runners&#151;to face British justice. That, sadly, is what the Conservatives seem to dislike: because the EAW is European, they oppose it even though it tackles crime and locks up dangerous people. Judge parties by what they do, not what they say.</p>

extradition agreement with the US. There are, however, some challenging areas in connection with the EAW, because it also applies to countries where the state of the justice system has been criticised by the Council of Europe. We cannot just ignore the fact that the way in which the EAW works can lead, and has led, to anxieties being expressed about whether individuals are being extradited under it for very slight cause, in circumstances that may be unreasonable.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for that point. I was hoping that he would make a full tribute at the Dispatch Box to his colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, for the service that he has performed for the Conservative party over the years. Sadly, the hon. and learned Gentleman did not do so. I regret that. On his substantive point, however, let us be clear that there are within the justice and home affairs chapters of the treaties very substantial ways in which member states can raise their concerns about other member states&#146; justice systems, if that is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90715-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09071559000473">Let us also remember that every member of the European Union that is subject to the European arrest warrant is also a signatory of the European convention on human rights, and, by the way&#151;I should explain for the benefit of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s party&#151;is also prepared to have the European convention applied in their domestic law. His proposals to fail to do that would be an astonishing break with what is happening elsewhere.

The European arrest warrant is a perfectly workable instrument as it is, and although it should perhaps be improved it has certainly done an enormous amount to help crack down on crime in this country and to help crack down on the old costa del crime.

Article 8 removes the requirement for the US to provide prima facie evidence when requesting extradition from the UK, yet article 8, section 3, subsection (c) still requires the UK authorities to provide the US with &#147;a reasonable basis to believe&#148; that the US national whom they are seeking to extradite committed the offence. The key point is precisely the one that the Home Secretary made about facts: it is simply ludicrous that this Government are prepared to afford our American counterparts greater protection than they do our own citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90715-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000493">In the past, of course, the Government have said that the Americans have the small matter of their own constitution, which insists on probable cause and constrains what they can do. Quite. The US constitution is one of the finest pieces of liberal drafting in legal history. US citizens have enormous advantages over British citizens in the guarantees of freedoms and the checks and balances on arbitrary state power that the US constitution affords, but that is not an argument for ditching our safeguards, weak and feeble though they are in comparison. It is surely an argument that Ministers should have taken even more care to defend UK citizens&#146; rights, precisely because we do not benefit from a written constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90715-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09071559000494">This is a practical and a moral issue. Even when it comes to extradition to a state where the death penalty exists, we did not see fit to impose an absolute refusal on our duty to extradite&#151;even to Texas, where the death penalty is rife, or, in the past, to Illinois, where a retiring governor was so distraught by the evidence that he had sent so many innocent men to execution that he pardoned everyone on death row.</p>

 Even faced with those appalling examples of an affront to the settled will of this House that we will not contemplate the death penalty, we still allow extradition to American states that carry out that objectionable practice; the treaty merely says that we &#147;may refuse&#148;. I suspect that the Home Secretary wanted to intervene to make that point, so I shall let him go ahead.</p>

I am also informed that many of those extradited will come under extraordinary pressure to plead guilty to minor charges in order to escape a long trial and extended pre-trial detention on major charges. Where is the justice in that? Where are the protections for our citizens? If the Home Secretary regards that practice as fair in a system of justice, why have he and his predecessors refused to introduce it in British justice?

In 2006 we tabled a Bill to restore the need for prime facie evidence to be provided by US authorities when requesting extradition. More recently, we made a pledge in our freedom Bill to ensure that the treaty is redrafted immediately. We did all that because we believe the Extradition Act 2003 is manifestly unfair to British citizens and those who have been caught up by the treaty, such as Gary McKinnon.</p>

That is the least they can do. We will back the Conservative motion today, even though we would prefer more detail and more commitment.

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne). I am not a recent convert to the cause of Gary McKinnon: he is my constituent and I have been campaigning for him for three years. I welcome the support for Gary McKinnon from the Liberal Democrats and Members of other parties. Mr. McKinnon&#146;s case brings into sharp relief the problems caused by the operation of the Extradition Act 2003 and the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09071559000505">I shall respect Mr. Speaker&#146;s direction and not base my remarks wholly on the case of Gary McKinnon. However, it is important to recognise that Mr. Speaker&#146;s direction on sub judice matters relates to the challenge to the DPP&#146;s decision not to prosecute, as opposed to the challenge to the decision on whether the Home Secretary should have taken account of Mr. McKinnon&#146;s condition of Asperger&#146;s syndrome, which on its own the House would have been free to debate fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09071559000506">I was worried to hear the Home Secretary trying to pick and mix justifications for the operation of the extradition treaty. We thought that we had moved on from a Home Secretary who trumpets the Government&#146;s terrorism-fighting credentials and focuses only on terrorists whom we all want to be prosecuted and extradited. We thought that we had moved on from a Home Secretary who only talks about fighting on behalf of the innocent. What we are all concerned about is justice&#151;justice for the innocent and for the guilty. That is as important for Gary McKinnon, who has not sought to hide his guilt, as for anyone else. We are concerned about proper due process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09071559000507">One would have thought that the Home Secretary had learned from his predecessors&#146; mistakes. One of them&#151;the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)&#151;has come on board and acknowledged the deficiencies of the 2003 Act, of which he was very much an architect, as it affects Gary McKinnon. During the passage of the Bill in 2003, no one in his right mind would have used as the centrepiece of his argument the case of Gary McKinnon&#151;someone who has the severe autistic condition of Asperger&#146;s syndrome and is now the subject of this unbalanced process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09071559000508">I do not propose to go into the details of Gary McKinnon&#146;s case today; nor will I attempt to defend his actions&#151;I doubt that any hon. Member would do so. What I want to do is defend Mr. McKinnon&#146;s right to justice and that of others who become victims of the 2003 Act and the treaty. The Home Secretary talked about causes c&#233;lbres, but Gary McKinnon is the last person whom one would promote as a cause c&#233;lbre. He shuns publicity in many ways: his condition makes him introverted and he shies away from communicating. He needs others to speak up on his behalf. I am pleased to do that as his Member of Parliament, and others have also done so. I commend the <i> Daily Mail</i> for the momentum it has given to the campaign<i> .</i></p>

trial. Regrettably, those who do not fit in with the system&#151;those who are vulnerable or mentally ill, or who have special needs&#151;often cannot get justice, although they deserve it as much as anyone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09071559000510">The Home Secretary talked about safeguards. Those safeguards are plainly not in place. Whether we are dealing with one case or a number of cases, and whether we call them high profile or low profile, there needs to be justice and appropriate safeguards for all. That was not the case for Gary McKinnon, who was diagnosed late with Asperger&#146;s syndrome, and it is not the case for anyone else like him who has symptoms of compulsive behaviour, not communicating well, and not seeking to make the case for themselves.</p>

 It was made in August 2008. Decisions on Gary McKinnon and others in his position are subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion and to the European convention on human rights. It is for the Secretary of State to determine whether that discretion should be applied in the case of those with Gary McKinnon&#146;s condition. It has been argued that it should be applied in Gary McKinnon&#146;s case, as in others, but the Secretary of State has chosen to ignore that. Although there have been concerns expressed by No. 10, it has chosen to ignore Gary McKinnon&#146;s particular condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09071559000513">The McKinnon case and others show the problems that occur when there is a challenge of the process. Gary McKinnon and others are left to look to the Home Secretary or the Director of Public Prosecutions for relief. The Home Secretary is saying, &#147;I don&#146;t have to consider forum, because that is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions&#148;, and the DPP is saying, &#147;We&#146;ve decided to cede jurisdiction to the United States.&#148; That leaves any appellant, defendant, or whatever one calls them, to challenge via judicial review a DPP decision not to prosecute in this country, and to challenge the Home Secretary&#146;s decision, too&#151;that is the case for Gary McKinnon. As should be clear to the Home Secretary, that shows the plain need for forum to be properly determined. It should not be left to applicants to mount a campaign, find legal advice and representation, and go through all the complicated procedures on the judicial review route. It clearly shows the need for proper consideration of forum, and the lack of consideration of forum in the current process.</p>

Part of his legacy is an amendment that he supported, together with Baroness Hanham, to the Policing and Crime Bill. That amendment would deal with many of our concerns. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the old schedule 13 to that Bill deal properly with two issues. The first is the issue of evidence and the conditions relating to whether a significant part of the conduct alleged to constitute the extradition offence was conducted in the United Kingdom. The second issue relates to whether an extradition would be barred if, in view of all the circumstances, it would not be in the interests of justice for the person to be tried for the offence in the requesting territory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09071559000515">On the issue of the interests of justice, such a provision would allow the court properly to consider the applicant before them. In the case of Gary McKinnon or others like him, it could consider the fact that the applicant was severely autistic, and could consider the implications of that, not only for the defendant&#146;s understanding of the crime that they are alleged to have committed, but particularly with regard to the impact of the extradition process, the impact of the process taking place in another place such as the United States, and the impact of the sentence. The sentence would have a profound effect on people such as Gary McKinnon, particularly given the length of sentence proposed; it is judged that it could be up to 60 years. The provision would also allow bail to be considered carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09071559000516">The example was given of the NatWest three, but that was an exceptional case, and should not be brought forward as a precedent&#151;certainly not as regards bail&#151;when we are talking about cases such as that of Gary McKinnon, who is penniless. The question of adequate representation would be a key factor in America. Also, the question of whether there was confidence that the defendant would get bail, rather than be in custody before trial, perhaps for two years, would be relevant if we considered forum properly in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000517">The same is true of consideration of repatriation after sentence. Again, we heard the example of the NatWest three, in which repatriation took place after conviction. However, in the case of Gary McKinnon, there has been no assurance that that would happen, despite the fact that other countries have agreements with the United States on that subject. The Netherlands and Israel have, on behalf of all their citizens, come to an agreement, whereby their Home Secretaries would give a specific assurance before extradition that, on conviction, the person would be repatriated to serve their sentence in their country. Gary McKinnon does not have the benefit of that assurance, and nor do other citizens of this country, because the Government have not properly negotiated on behalf of their citizens to allow for due process and justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000518">Prima facie evidence will not be considered; that point has already been debated today, and on other occasions. The Government ceded the part of the Extradition Act 2003 that has that requirement in it&#151;a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to make a case. That requirement has been a fundamental principle of our criminal justice system, but the Government gave it away; the treaty makes a point of removing that requirement. That has had a crucial effect, but it would in many ways be remedied by the forum position, because consideration of forum would enable consideration of whether the offence or a significant part of the offence had been committed in this country. Currently, in cases such as that of Gary McKinnon, prosecutors do not have the evidence before them to enable them to come to a judgment, because the United States has it for its own purposes. The authorities in this country have only a partial picture on which to make a judgment. If the court had forum provisions, it could give proper consideration to whether a significant part of the offences and the criminality took place in this country, and could then form a judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09071559000525">I believe that in many ways the Home Office has a split personality.

Lord West talked about &#147;naughty boys&#148; and, although I am not sure that Gary McKinnon would come under that definition, perhaps the Government should employ him.

 I am sorry that he is not here, but I have to say that I was deeply disappointed by the new Home Secretary&#146;s performance. I had thought that he was a man whose natural common sense would have led him to come to the House with a recognition of the seriousness of the issue before us. Instead, he flatly refused to accept that the Attorney-General had given advice that was wholly contrary to what he asserted again and again. He prayed in aid the fact that he was not very bright&#151;that, because he is not a lawyer, we ought to take his view of the law rather than that of the Law Officer herself. The Home Secretary went on to say that the Attorney-General was anyway not a Law Officer when she gave the advice, but a Home Office Minister. It is not good enough for him to come to the House and propose to begin his answer to a serious and polite debate in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09071559000528">That is my first concern, but things got worse. Secondly, the Home Secretary went on to admit that he did not have the key figures that he was asked for in connection with the numbers of people extradited from the US to Britain, and the circumstances of each case. He had only the figures that suited his case: he had none of the other figures for which he was asked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09071559000529">Thirdly, the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman asked the Home Secretary to put his advice in the Library, and he did not even have the courtesy to reply. The spokesman had to intervene again, yet he still did not get a response. Not only did the Home Secretary come to the debate unprepared; he came believing that hectoring and rudeness were suitable responses to what is a serious issue for many people around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90715-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09071559000530">Fourthly, the Home Secretary was asked a direct question about the implications of the extra powers that the Government had assumed, and he did not know the answer.

I have been concerned about it from the beginning, as a result of my experience of the US judicial system. I had a constituent who was an American citizen and who was on death row in Texas for more than 20 years. I went there to plead for his life, and I will repeat what a senior law officer of the state of Texas told me.

We are governed by the European convention on human rights, so it is reasonable to say that people have a right to be concerned when extradition to the US is raised as a possibility.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that a key source of anxiety about the US criminal justice system is that it imposes very substantial penalties on those who are found guilty? To people throughout the European continent, they often appear to be utterly disproportionate to the offence that has been committed.</p>

 I agree with my hon. and learned Friend. That is one of the three things that I am concerned about. First, I am concerned about the concept in many parts of the US that the real purpose of the law is to get off the streets people with whom the law does not hold. Secondly, I am concerned that the punishment is therefore very often out of line with anything that we in Europe would think acceptable. My third concern has to do with the concept of plea bargaining. People in Europe think that those who plead guilty are in fact guilty, whereas in many cases they plead guilty merely because the alternative is very much more serious. Such people will have learned from their lawyers that, especially for those who are not American, to stand out is to risk very long prison sentences indeed.</p>

I want to ask the fundamental question: what were the Government doing signing a treaty that was not reciprocated? On what possible basis could they have done so?</p>

 Before the right hon. Gentleman moves on, will he confirm something that he has just said?

members seek to operate together. In those circumstances, it is not unreasonable to have a mechanism that shortens the period needed for extraditing a person from one member country to another. I have no difficulty in accepting that. I have been through the list and do not see any cases that disturb me, except those where one country&#146;s law is wholly different from another&#146;s on a particular point. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) and others were right to draw attention, for example, to the question of holocaust denial. One can understand precisely why there is a law on it in Germany, but why there might not be somewhere else. That is a perfectly reasonable judgment to make, and we need to have a mechanism to overcome it, but in general there is no problem with the European arrest warrant. That has been proven by the period that has elapsed. What has not been proven is that there is no problem with the British-American agreement, and I wish to end on that. The problem with the agreement is that it leads people in Britain to believe that this country will do anything that the United States asks, without being prepared to stand up for its own people.</p>

Member for Eastleigh, who spoke for the Liberal Democrats, mentioned. We need to make it clear to the United States that we are partners not subjects. There is a constant refrain. We are told, &#147;America cannot do this because of the constitution&#148;, but we have to do something. The business about ratification is universal. America still has not ratified the convention on international trade in endangered species, which it has signed.

 It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), this time after his philippic about schoolboy debating techniques. I remember as a student at Oxford university attending perhaps my only Oxford Union debate. The right hon.

because this grave case has been given absolutely no national publicity. Last year, those two gentlemen were convicted at Leeds Crown court of publishing anti-Semitic and racist material on the web, including pictures showing Jews being cruelly disfigured. There were up to 4,000 hits a day. They also published a book called the &#147;Tales of the Holohoax&#148;&#151;we get the sense of what they were trying to argue&#151;and they sent it to synagogues.</p>

In Los Angeles, they claimed that they should be allowed to stay in America under the provisions of the first amendment to the US constitution which gives the absolute right to free speech. Had they been Americans and published the material in America, they could not have been prosecuted. One of the big problems for those of us who campaign against anti-Semitism and racism on the net is that the United States cannot take any control of the internet service providers.</p>

Last Friday, Whittle and Sheppard were sent to jail&#151;for three and four years respectively, I think. That was an important victory in the fight against anti-Semitism, but it could not have been won without the willingness of the Americans to rise above their own constitution and free speech amendment and co-operate with us.</p>

In March 2003, while Parliament was discussing the Extradition Act 2003, the then Home Secretary signed a new extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States. The treaty was subsequently published as a Command Paper in May 2003, after the legislation had been enacted. The most significant difference between the new treaty and its predecessor treaty, which was signed in 1972, lay in article 8 of the new treaty, which set out extradition procedures and required documents. The previous treaty required an extradition request to be accompanied by such evidence as would justify the person&#146;s committal for trial according to the law of the state from which extradition was sought, including evidence that the person requested was the person to whom the request warrant referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09071559000565">For requests made by the United Kingdom to the United States, the new treaty required such information as would provide a reasonable basis for believing that the person sought committed the offence for which extradition was requested&#151;&#147;probable cause&#148;. There is no corresponding requirement for requests made by the United States for extradition from the United Kingdom.</p>

It was an act of the Home Office&#151;God knows why the Home Secretary was negotiating an extradition treaty when it is normally the function of the Foreign Office, but it was nevertheless done. It was in the designation orders of December 2003 that we changed the whole process, which has given rise to indignation and a sense of injustice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09071559000572">All those matters were debated on 11 July 2006, when the Government suffered defeats in the House of Lords on the Police and Justice Act 2006. The Conservative peer, the late and much lamented Lord Kingsland, successfully moved amendments that sought to remove the United States from the designation order under the 2003 Act listing of part 2 territories, which are those not required to provide prima facie evidence when seeking a person&#146;s extradition from the UK, and to prevent the Home Secretary from designating the US as such a territory until reciprocal arrangements had been made in respect of the information and evidence required to support an extradition request for a person who had not been convicted. The Government lost in the Lords but set that right by a majority in the Commons. That is at the heart of the debate and the justification for it, and I plea with the Home Secretary to review properly the workings of this dire mechanism.</p>

 I will be very brief, because I know that time is short. I begin with an apology. The Select Committee on Home Affairs met earlier, and my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) and I were there, so we missed part of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09071559000574">I have only three quick things to say. On my way to the debate, I bumped into a previous Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), and asked him whether I could quote what he had said to me about the time when he signed the treaty. He said that I could. He is on record as saying that when the treaty was signed we did not get the best deal, and that frankly the Americans got a better deal than we did. That is why there is a difference between the standard of proof required to get someone over from America and the standard of proof required when the Americans are seeking to get someone from this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09071559000575">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) for what he has done for his constituent. I appreciate that we are governed by the sub judice rule, though it was waived briefly for the purposes of the debate. I tried earlier to sign the early-day motion that the hon. Gentleman tabled about Mr. McKinnon, but it was withdrawn because it was out of order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09071559000576">There is a time when the House and, indeed, the public, should be listened to. Of course, some of us went along with the Government on 42 days, even though my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) warned me that the meaning of the slightest word in a Select Committee report could be widened. He was right. In the discussions on the Gurkhas, the Government again lagged behind public opinion and certainly did not take the will of Parliament into account, though as soon as Parliament expressed its view in a vote, they changed their mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para29"><a name="09071559000577">This is another occasion when the Government should listen, and I am therefore minded to support the motion. It is a modest motion, which calls for a review of the Extradition Act 2003. It is important that we examine it, now that it has existed for five years, measure what it has achieved and ascertain whether we can improve it.  <br>

The motion is not against Government policy&#151;it would not undermine extradition to a friendly country that is an ally, but it would give us an opportunity to review what has happened, so that cases such as Mr. McKinnon&#146;s can be tackled in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90715-0013.htm_para30"><a name="09071559000578">I greatly admire the Home Secretary, who appeared before the Select Committee yesterday. When I put it to him that he had the power to intervene and halt Mr. McKinnon&#146;s extradition, he said that he had no power to do that. I think that he has that power and that, if he sought a different set of legal advisers, they would tell him that. Surely the Home Secretary can exercise discretion in the public interest. Mr. McKinnon, who has already admitted to committing an offence, should be tried in this country. I urge, even at this late stage, the Home Secretary or the Attorney-General to write to the Director of Public Prosecutions and ask that that happens. That is the sensible, pragmatic way in which to deal with the situation, and I hope that the Government will take that course of action.</p>

 In the time available, I will try briefly to explain again to the Secretary of State why the motion is sensible. I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) for indicating his support for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09071559000580">I apologise to my hon. Friends who have made powerful contributions if I do not have time to dwell on each one at length. I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), who has so eloquently championed Mr. McKinnon&#146;s case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09071559000581">Hon. Members of all parties accept that it is desirable for extradition to take place to maintain international justice. Some countries do not have it&#151;apart from under the European arrest warrant, France will not extradite its own nationals&#151;but we have never adhered to that principle, and we do not seek to advocate it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09071559000582">In it is inevitable, given that extradition is a human process, that it may contain errors. It is for the Government, in setting out parameters, to try to ensure that those errors are minimised. In adopting the 2003 Act, the Government moved fundamentally away from the previous principle that there would be close scrutiny of each extradition application, from wherever it came. Before that, there was a need to show a prima facie case: the evidence had to be rehearsed in court and the Home Secretary also had administrative powers to prevent miscarriages of justice. I fully accept that, consequently, many extraditions took far too long, and the Home Secretary has my sympathy, because that was an intolerable situation that needed rectifying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09071559000583">In adopting the 2003 Act, however, we have moved far too far in the opposite direction. We have extradition on reasonable suspicion, which is no more than a statement of fact, on which it is sufficient to ground an offence. That applies whether it is the United States or any other category 1 or 2 countries. In this country, if a reasonable suspicion is found not to exist, there is at least the remedy that the police officer who came upon the unfounded suspicion can be prosecuted for false arrest and malicious prosecution. No such protection exists once a person has been extradited. We effectively have to take it on trust that the reasonable suspicion exists  <br>

elsewhere. That is why, to make the precise point, I told the Home Secretary earlier that the problem goes way beyond the United States. In some ways, it is unfair to pillory the United States Government, who have simply taken advantage of the structures that we have put in place. Whether we are talking about that or, desirable as I am sure many of its consequences have been, the European arrest warrant, each has that underlying issue, which merits being revisited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09071559000584">We then have to turn to the particular problems that appear to exist in our treaty with the United States and in how it is operated. The point has been made quite forcefully that true reciprocity in the US-UK treaty does not exist. In particular, it does not exist because of the differential standards. There may be good reasons why the Government had to go for those differential standards, but they cannot escape the fact that there are safeguards for a United States national being extradited to this country that do not exist in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09071559000585">Secondly, we cannot escape the unfortunate fact, which has been touched on in these debates, that, although nobody would question its desire for fairness, to ensure that only the guilty are convicted, the United States criminal justice system has some onerous aspects to it. That is particularly true in relation to plea bargaining and the astonishing disparity of sentencing between those who have engaged in plea bargaining and those who have not. That gives rise to genuine fears that justice may not be done, because people may be coerced into pleading guilty because they are so frightened of the consequences on conviction, which, particularly for financial offences, most people on this side of the Atlantic would consider to be dramatically disproportionate to anything that would be inflicted in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09071559000586">To take an example that does not concern extradition, Chantal McCorkle is a lady who received 24 years in prison, which was subsequently reduced to 18, for a fraud on a matter that, if it had come to the courts in this country, would have been unlikely to attract a sentence of more than three or four years in prison. The Government have a particular responsibility in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09071559000587">Then there is the fact that the United States prosecutors have been remarkably creative in interpreting the new regime that is in place to expand their jurisdiction. We have discussed and debated the issue of forum. That is because the United States prosecutors are now exercising an almost universal jurisdiction, particularly in the case of offences that may concern the internet, where messages frequently go through servers around the world. That enables them to extradite people to the United States for offences that one could argue were far more closely connected with this country, yet where no decision in this country has been made for prosecution or, indeed, where no complaint has even been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09071559000588">That must inevitably give rise to disquiet about the fact that under the new system individuals, where the prosecutors have decided in this country that there is no possible reason to proceed&#151;and where, if they did proceed, those individuals would receive a rather light sentence&#151;can be extradited to the United States, where they are likely to receive a sentence that is drastically and dramatically different from that which they would receive here. The Government cannot escape responsibility on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09071559000589">As an example, in the Morgan Crucible case, which involves my constituent Ian Norris, the United States has sought extradition for an offence and failed, because that offence does not constitute dual criminality, because it was not an offence at the time that it allegedly took place. However, the United States is still seeking extradition on the related matter of obstruction of justice, when, as the law currently stands, there appears to be no safeguard to ensure that, if a trial took place and he were convicted of that offence, he would not be sentenced for the original offence.</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="09071559000590"><a name="90715-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="09071559001769"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 I am most grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for giving way, and I will be very brief. Is not another factor that we ought to take into account the fact that it was originally suggested that the current treaty was a response to terrorism cases? The right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) pretended again that it dealt only with grave cases, but in fact it applies to any case for which the maximum sentence is 12 months&#146; imprisonment. That includes a lot of cases that are not grave cases.</p>

<p><a name="st_o306"><a name="09071559000591"><a name="90715-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="09071559001770"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. However, I rather ignored the remarks that the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) made, especially when he resorted to such cheap and revolting statements about autism as to induce in me a revulsion about what he was saying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09071559000592">I simply say this to the Minister. Anxieties on this subject have been raised repeatedly in this House. That is not some cheap polemic: those of us who are friends of the United States wish to see a system in place that commands widespread acceptance. However, it really is time that the Government listened to the anxieties being expressed, particularly because mechanisms are available to address the problems. An example is a provision introduced in the other place by my noble Friend Lord Kingsland&#151;whose passing is much regretted and lamented&#151;and other noble Lords that would allow forum to be considered. This would provide considerable protection, but the Government have shown no inclination to put the provision on to the statute book, even though the mechanism now exists for that to happen. Furthermore, a review could undoubtedly take place that might not even require the renegotiation of the UK-US treaty, because I believe that our own national safeguards could be introduced without jeopardising it.</p>
<a name="09071559001362">
<p>Those are the issues that the Minister needs to address, and I have set out the sensible points that a sensible Parliament ought to be debating. Simply coming to the Dispatch Box and having a rant about this being a cheap matter does not help, because the issue is not going to go away. Most people can apply their common sense to matters of criminality. They feel a revulsion against it and a desire that it should be stopped, but they also want to see fairness. I have to say to the Home Secretary that, at the moment, there is a strong perception that we have created a system that might, on occasion, be very unfair. It is our responsibility in this House to try to do something about that. I commend our motion to the House.</p>

some strong views being expressed about the position of the Extradition Act 2003 and the position of several individuals under that legislation. We have heard strong speeches from the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), from the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and, helpfully, from my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09071559000594">The judgment that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I have had to make is whether we believe that the review of the Act requested in the Opposition motion is justified. The motion states that</p>
<a name="90715-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="09071559001406"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Extradition Act 2003 is being undermined by a series of high profile cases that are jeopardising confidence in the system&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09071559000595">My right hon. Friend and I have made the judgment that we do not believe that to be the case, and I will try to illustrate our reasons for doing so. To support a review, we would have to say that we believed that public confidence was being jeopardised and that the Act was being undermined. As my right hon. Friend has said, we believe that the Act is operating in a fair and effective way, providing modernisation of the extradition treaty between ourselves and the United States, and undertaking a valuable function for our community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09071559000596">The treaty came into force, following the Act, on  26 April 2007. It defines clearly the extradition offence by way of a sentence threshold of 12 months in both states, and organises extraditable offences as those that are punishable by a year or more in prison in both states. I say to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that these measures were not devised by the Government following the events in New York on 11 September 2001. They were examined prior to those events as part of the modernisation of the treaty. Indeed, the US-UK extradition treaty was signed, subject to ratification, on 31 March. The text of the treaty was published and laid before Parliament under the Ponsonby rule, which allowed for an explanatory memorandum to be produced between 21 May and 30 June. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)&#151;who I know cannot be here for the wind-up speeches today&#151;said that we had used the royal prerogative, but he should note that no requests for a debate or for additional time for the Select Committee to consider matters were received at that time. That is why the treaty was ratified at that point.</p>

Extradition is barred if the judge is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person before him is the person sought. Dual criminality provides another safeguard, as extradition is barred if dual criminality is not established. Evidence must be there, as I have outlined. Double jeopardy is another, as extradition is barred if the person has already been convicted or acquitted elsewhere. Other criteria include injustice due to ill health or passage of time; injustice due to domestic proceedings; specific legislation on the death penalty; and specific legislation on onward extradition from another state to another country.

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09071559000612">The suggestion has been made that a number of high-profile extradition cases have been unbalanced and unfair. I cannot accept that. I believe that the evidence on these matters is important. At first glance, the Opposition motion may look relatively attractive and it might be thought that a review could easily be undertaken by my right hon. Friend. The evidence base for that review can be provided so that the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell can understand it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90715-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09071559000613">The motion refers to &#147;jeopardising confidence&#148;, and says that the Extradition Act is &#147;being undermined&#148;. Those are not presumptions that I wish to make. The Opposition&#146;s views are not shared by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and me, and I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p>

As for increased prosperity, there are now some 2.5 million pensioners living in poverty. Even before the economic downturn began to bite, research for Age Concern and Help the Aged showed that 60 per cent. of low-income pensioners were struggling to get by and were finding it hard to manage, two thirds were cutting back on gas and electricity, more than half were buying less or poorer quality food, and one in 12 pensioners said that they had built up debt as a result of increases in the cost of living.

such documents. What do they have in common? Is it the fact that they serve only to underline this Government&#146;s record of inaction and failure when it comes to the needs and concerns of older people?</p>

After 12 years, it appears that Ministers have finally woken up to the challenges of an ageing society. Of course, we can agree that increased longevity is phenomenal. If my speech were to last an hour, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;I promise you that it will not, although it may seem like it&#151;your life expectancy on average would increase by about 12 minutes during that hour. Indeed, in the foreword to that document, the Prime Minister is good enough to refer to my erstwhile constituent Henry Allingham, who at 113 is now the oldest man&#151;but not the oldest person&#151;in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90715-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09071559001167">The best Labour can offer us is a &#147;grandparents summit&#148; in the autumn and an earlier review of the default retirement age, plus a ragbag of existing initiatives, empty self-congratulation and some vague aspirations for the future. There are to be refresher courses for older drivers. It is all jam tomorrow while hard-pressed pensioners bear the brunt of the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90715-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09071559001168">The document promises to bring forward to next year the review of the default retirement age. It rightly points out that more than 1 million people are already working beyond state pension age&#151;mainly, I suspect, through harsh economic necessity. It sets out the financial and social benefits of working longer, but for many people, continuing to work may be the only way of repairing their finances for retirement. Indeed we have already legislated to raise the state pension age to 68. But the Opposition have been saying for several years that retirement should be less an event and more a process. Flexibility is what older workers need. However, the document is bizarrely free of any opinion from Ministers as to whether they support a default retirement age. This is the very point to be decided by a High Court judge very soon. Perhaps in her response the Minister for Pensions and the Ageing Society could give us some clue about the Government&#146;s thinking on the subject, or even just tell us what she thinks. The Government also make much of the Equality Bill as a vehicle to tackle age discrimination, yet although that Bill includes wide powers to bring in exemptions relating to older people, the detail of the exemptions is not yet available.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that in their latest proposals the Government talk about a &#163;20,000 tax on prudent pensioners&#151;if they still have a pension left. That will be a &#163;10 billion-plus a year tax on the very people who have saved to look after their future. Is that not a disgrace, and does it not sum up the Labour approach to poverty in old age? They want more people to be poor, because they want to tax them more.</p>

If he was in this place at that time, did he vote for that? If he was not in this place, did he support it? That was one of the accelerators of pensioner poverty in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. In fairness, he assiduously attends these debates on pensions issues. I might have a slightly lived-in look, but I certainly was not a Member of this House in the early 1980s. We could go into the prehistory of 1980 and the decision to break the link at that point&#151;again, curiously, as history repeats itself, the then Government had inherited a disastrous financial situation from a previous Labour Government, but we will not go down that route&#151;but this Government have had 12 long years to restore the link and they have done nothing about it.</p>

They saved while they were working so that they could supplement their pension when they retired. About three quarters of pensioner households receive income from savings and investment, and in recent times they have seen those savings rendered almost worthless. The interest that they receive, thanks to the economic mess that this Government have caused, is pitiful or even non-existent. To make matters worse, the Treasury assumes that they are getting 10 per cent. on those savings when it comes to calculating entitlement to benefits. Will the Minister now undertake to review the tariff income rule that causes such blatant unfairness?</p>

We pressed Ministers to scrap income tax on savings for basic rate taxpayers. Instead, the Government increased taxes on pensions. Ministers have even refused our proposal that the compulsory annuitisation rules be temporarily suspended during the financial turmoil. As a result, many people who prudently saved for their retirement have been forced to fix their income for the rest of their lives at the worst possible moment. We Conservatives believe that Governments should encourage saving, not penalise it. We would introduce measures that would help everyone, but particularly older people, such as the two-year council tax freeze, which is worth more than &#163;200 to the typical family, and energy-efficiency improvements for every household, saving energy and reducing bills.</p>

Other benefits have even worse take-up, the best example being council tax benefit.

They have continued to heap extra costs and red tape on those employers who, for all the right reasons, continue to sponsor defined-benefit schemes for their work force. The latest estimate puts the funding shortfall for UK defined-benefit schemes at more than &#163;200 billion&#151;a staggering 88 per cent. of the country&#146;s DB schemes face a shortfall.

The Green Paper makes various suggestions about using non-means-tested disability benefits&#151;such as disability living allowance and attendance allowance&#151;to help fund the means-tested social care system. That would represent a huge shift in the principles that underlie the system of disability benefits, and would be of great concern to many disability organisations and disabled people. If media reports are to be believed, the Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions and for Health were arguing about the point right up to the last moment before the Green Paper was published. It seems that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions lost that battle in Government, but that will not be good news for disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90715-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09071559001207">The Green Paper could not be clearer: there is no guarantee of extra Government funding to meet the yawning gap in provision. People may well end up being forced into a compulsory insurance scheme and, at the end of it, a nationalised system of care. Yet still the relentless destruction of hard-won family assets goes on, the lottery of care continues, and older people and their families remain fearful about what will happen to them when they are frail and needy. What older people need in these difficult times is more help from the Government, not less. Dot Gibson, the general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said:</p>
<a name="90715-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="09071559001417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact that it has taken 12 years for the Government to come up with any proposals&#151;with the prospect of up to another five years before any legislation&#151;is a terrible betrayal of Britain&#146;s pensioners and their families.&#148;</p>

 As part of the review, could we reflect what is one of my frustrations and, perhaps, one of the Minister&#146;s? In such debates, we always refer to older people as a drain on the nation&#146;s resources, not as contributors to them. May we please reflect the fact that older people make a huge contribution to the child care needs of a variety of families and to the charitable sector, and recognise at all times that they are net contributors as well as drawers on the nation&#146;s resources?</p>

 I am more than happy to agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that we, certainly on the Government Benches, refer to older people as a burden. It is quite clear that they offer a great opportunity for economic development and for handing on many of their life experiences to the younger generation, and that there is a great deal of opportunity in developing older businesses. Opposition Front Benchers rather sneered at the idea that grandparents fit in as a sandwich generation, often caring for younger people as well as for older relatives, but it is a key social policy issue that needs to be developed, not sneered at.</p>

Under a new national care system, everybody with a care need will have at least some of their care costs paid for by the state. There will be a national entitlement and an end to the postcode lottery.</p>

 The hon. Lady mentioned personalising care. A problem that has been around for a long time&#151;and one, I have to say, that I picked up on while on the streets of Norwich, North only this week&#151;relates to when people have a package of care. Elderly people do not want to find that they have to be put to bed at half-past 6 or 7 o&#146;clock. Their care is not personalised; they are often in the hands of agencies, funded through social services, that do not personalise care packages, but treat elderly people as numbers.</p>

 That is why we are working with the process set out in our document &#147;Putting people first&#148;, which is about personalising care. It is absolutely clear that we should be transforming services for older people by having them at the centre, making choices about how their care is delivered, rather than having one-size-fits-all care policies under which there is a compulsory bed time in a person&#146;s own home according to what suits whoever comes to give the care. That is why yesterday&#146;s Green Paper put such choice and personalisation right at the centre of the transformation that we want to see. We have already spent &#163;500 million on developing the first examples of that kind of personalisation. That approach is transforming how local authorities are planning to deliver their care packages to their clients in future.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend has not forgotten&#151;perhaps the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) has&#151;that this Government made it compulsory for councils to offer a direct payment instead of providing care directly; every one of those people in Norwich could ask for the cash instead of the care service, and organise their care themselves. Equally, the Government gave councils the money to put a charge on people&#146;s homes so that they did not have to sell their homes during their lifetimes, and their care could be paid for after their deaths.</p>

 It is important that the approaches that are being developed now become the norm in time.

That is a major theme that this Government have begun to develop and to fund.</p>

Thanks to increases in the basic pension and pension credit this year, no pensioner need live on less than &#163;130 a week. Since 1997, this Government have spent about &#163;100 billion more than if we had maintained the policies that we inherited from the Conservatives, and &#163;13 billion of that extra spending is happening in this financial year, despite the economic challenges that we face. As a recent European Union report underlines, there has been a significant change in the income of the over-65s in the UK. In 1997, it was 15 per cent. below the EU average: that is the Conservative record. After 12 years of Labour government, it has risen to 9 per cent. above the average.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) has drawn attention to a point at issue. The country has to judge the Opposition by their actions.

 I have been generous in giving way. To get through the rest of my remarks, I will not be so generous. I merely observe that in May, when the right hon. Member for Witney was asked whether he would rule out abolishing the winter fuel payment, he refused to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09071559001274">The Government have legislated for the most radical pension reforms since the basic state pension was introduced. Those changes will sharply narrow the gender gap in pensions, delivering fairer outcomes for women and carers. In 2010, more women will be able to claim a full basic state pension than ever before. The number of qualifying years will be reduced from 39 to 30, which means that around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 will be entitled to a full basic state pension in their own right, compared with around only 30 per cent. now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09071559001275">Our reforms will enable more women to build up a state pension based on their own contributions. For the first time, paid and credited contributions for caring will be recognised equally for basic state pension and state second pension purposes. It is a great step forward that the invaluable caring work done by millions of women up and down the country is finally to be recognised, valued and rewarded in that historic reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09071559001276">The Pensions Act 2008 also introduced a vital measure to allow eligible people, mainly women and carers again, to buy an additional six years of voluntary national insurance contributions.

We have been clear that we will restore the link between state pensions and earnings in 2012 or by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. From 2012, radical changes to private pension saving will start to come into effect. Those changes will be the most significant changes to pension provision since the state pension was introduced 100 years ago. We will see between 6 million and 9 million workers either newly saving or saving more in workplace pension schemes. That will be supported by the introduction of the personal accounts scheme, which will fill the gap in the pensions market for workers on moderate or low incomes. Annual pension contributions are estimated to grow to around &#163;10 billion a year by 2015 as a result of those changes. Around &#163;6 billion of that is estimated to  <br>

be new saving. That represents significant steps toward tackling under-saving for later life, as well as a boost to the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09071559001278">Through the Budget this year, we introduced two important changes for pensioners with savings. From November, the capital disregard for pension credit will be increased from &#163;6,000 to &#163;10,000. That will benefit 500,000 people, with an average weekly gain of &#163;4, and it means that 88 per cent. of pension credit recipients will be unaffected by having benefit deducted because of their savings. From October, we will increase the amount that the over-50s can save in an individual savings account to &#163;10,200. Those measures, when taken with the planned changes to personal allowances announced in the Budget last year, will mean that around 600,000 more pensioners will pay no tax at all. Overall, that means that 60 per cent. of pensioners will pay no tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09071559001279">Maintaining confidence in pensions is undermined by scaremongering about the state of the industry. Unlike in previous downturns, this Government have put in place arrangements to ensure that people are not left without a pension, even when their employer goes bust. This Government set up the Pension Protection Fund to ensure a strong and clear protection regime for people whose pension scheme fails. The Pension Protection Fund provides a safety net for 12 million members of defined-benefit schemes. It has &#163;3 billion in assets and is currently paying out around &#163;4.2 million a month in compensation to those whose employers have ceased to trade. Given those numbers, there is no question but that the Pension Protection Fund is sustainable and that people can have confidence that pensions savings can be maintained.</p>

For the first time in history, we in Britain have broken the link between age and poverty. Thanks to the policies of this Government, people are now no more likely to be poor because they are old. That is an achievement of which we on the Government Benches are rightly proud. We have also laid strong and lasting foundations for the future. We are not only taking action to deliver real help now to Britain&#146;s pensioners, but planning for generations to come. Our pension reforms mean that generations will benefit from a fairer and more generous state pension and that millions more will be saving in workplace pensions. Being old need no longer mean being poor, thanks to the action that we are already taking.</p>

We have published our strategy to build a society for all ages, and we will take action to bring forward the review of the default retirement age. Yesterday, we published a Green Paper looking at the care and support system, which encompasses many of the important issues that have struck such a chord outside this House, such as personalisation and the national carers system.

In Britain we rightly aspire to a care and support system in which everyone&#146;s needs are met and people can live their lives to the full.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09071559001288">But how many older people in this country would recognise the reality of their lives over the past twelve and a half years in those words? Only last year, we had another consultation paper from the Government: &#147;The case for change: why England needs a new care and support system&#148;. Its opening paragraph stated:</p>
<a name="90715-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="09071559001423"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In a civilised society, we have a moral obligation to ensure that people in need are not left without any care or support.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90715-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09071559001290">The sad reality for pensioners in Britain in the 21st century is that 2.5 million of them live in poverty. That is about one in five of the pensioners in this country. No Government&#151;especially a Labour Government&#151;should be anything other than deeply ashamed about that. The Commission for Social Care Inspection has estimated that older people are forced to spend &#163;6 billion a year of their own money&#151;often through selling their homes or raiding inheritance funds&#151;in order to pay for their care in retirement. More than 2 million pensioners do not claim money from the benefits and credits system even though they qualify for it. So, whatever the Minister says, I am afraid that the system is not working to address the problem of pensioner poverty.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making powerful points about the position of the many pensioners who live in poverty in Britain today.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that interesting figure.

Many of us find that division artificial, yet there it was again in black and white. I ask the Minister again, as I have asked before: when will that be addressed? Are we going to have a social care constitution, and why is social care not incorporated in the NHS contribution?</p>

I would be delighted to send hon. Members a copy. We remain committed to ensuring that those who are least able to pay get all their care paid for, but that everyone receives a minimum entitlement to care.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his generosity. An argument that I have not heard advanced so far is that care should be about quality. I think that one thing that the Government have tried to do is drive up quality, although what they have done may not be perfect. It may, for instance, have resulted in the closure of facilities that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Government realised could have remained open. Nevertheless, we should be trying to ensure that our older people experience quality, rather than just thinking about numbers. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that?</p>

 I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments, but I am afraid that if he spoke to all the elderly people in the country he would find that they were not receiving quality services. What they are receiving is patchy services that are very different in different areas, along with different entitlements. All the surveys conducted by older people&#146;s organisations make it clear that the quality of care is as important as its funding, but the two must be seen together. It is simply not realistic to suggest that we can secure better quality services without facing up to the difficult issues of funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90715-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09071559001323">The truth is that under this Labour Government, the local authority bar for access to care has risen repeatedly because of the funding position. Care has been removed from those with moderate or even quite serious needs. It is necessary for people to be at the top end of the care need scale before they have access to local authority care, thanks to the actions of this Government.</p>

Can the family member be sure that they are asking the right question? Do they know who to ask for? Are we really empowering people in the right way? Do we perhaps need something akin to what we have in the health service? Do we perhaps need a patient advice and liaison service in the social care system?

The people in the cases in my postbag have been receiving NHS care, so that situation has not arisen because such care is paid for. I know that some people have not been in that position, but usually where someone is having to be fed, an NHS paid-for place is involved. I can see that he looks quizzical and does not agree with me, but the places in the cases I am discussing have involved NHS care. I understand the point that he is making, however.

 I wish to follow the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) in adopting a relatively non-adversarial tone, but nevertheless addressing some of the core issues that are at the heart of the debate that the Government seek on this sensitive issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09071559001347">The truest words spoken in the House this afternoon have been by the former Minister for Pensions, the right hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), who acknowledged that this subject has been avoided by Governments for the previous 25 years. It is therefore true, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said from the Front Bench, that it is disappointing that a Government who came in pledged to action on the subject, which was certainly unfinished business when I left office as Secretary of State 12 years ago, are only now introducing a Green Paper and seeking a national debate. I am happy to enter into that debate, because it is a hugely important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09071559001348">The central problem, of course, and the reason why Governments have consistently failed to address the issue, is not that it is difficult to express the aspiration&#151;the Green Paper expressed many of the aspirations accurately, and I could have used much of the same language myself. The key issue is how we produce the resources necessary to deliver the services that we all aspire to provide for our elderly citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09071559001349">I agree with the Green Paper&#146;s emphasis on the importance of carers. As one of my hon. Friends said earlier, elderly people can be carers not only for their elderly relatives&#151;often their spouses or partners&#151;but important sources of care for other members of the wider family community. Engaging in a proper discussion about how to use the voluntary support available from a wider understanding of family connections is an important part of this discussion. That is my first point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09071559001350">My second point relates to my intervention on the Minister on the subject of direct payments and to the rather larger subject of personalised care, about which the hon. Member for Colne Valley was talking. We must all have experience from our personal lives and in constituency surgeries of money being wasted because it has not been accurately used in a way that reflects the individual preferences&#151;I use that phrase as distinct from a need calculated from a dispassionate point of view&#151;of the service user. The importance of personalised care and, in particular, of the direct payment principle  <br>

<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>15 July 2009 : Column 389</b><br>
is that it focuses resources on the delivery of service chosen and fashioned by the service user. In my view, that is the best way of securing care that meets the service user&#146;s needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09071559001351">The third issue that I want to touch on briefly before I come on to what I have described as the core issue of resources is what has been called &#147;a |National Care Service&#148;. The Government are extremely unclear in the Green Paper about what that phrase means. What, for example, is the role of the local authority in delivering a national care service? Is it to be a service provider? Is it to have local discretion on commissioning? The Green Paper refers to the oft-used &#147;postcode lottery&#148;, which is exactly the same concept as local discretion. Do the Government think that all exercise of local discretion is merely a manifestation of the postcode lottery? If so, do they aspire to a single, uniform national service or are they willing to defend local differences of service and not dismiss every local difference as merely a manifestation of the postcode lottery?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09071559001352">I would suggest to Ministers that the phrase &#147;national entitlement&#148; is extremely dangerous, as we have seen not just from court cases in the social care field but from the broader debate about what the national health service should be providing as a national minimum entitlement. The moment we get into a discussion about the concept of a national entitlement, it becomes extremely difficult to produce services in a local area that reflect accurately the needs of people in that area and represent an efficient use of the resources available. Those resources will be different in different parts of the country for a variety of difficult historical reasons and the needs that arise will be different because of the nature of different local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09071559001353">The concept of a &#147;National Care Service&#148;&#151;the balance between the national definition and local delivery and between national priorities and local priorities&#151;is not made any easier by the introduction of initial capital letters. With respect to Ministers, all the difficult questions attached to that phrase are left unanswered by this Green Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09071559001354">I now come to the fundamental issue of resources. In 2006, Wanless analysed the resource implications of moving from social care provision, which we acknowledge does not deliver what we would want it to deliver to elderly people, to either what he called scenario 1, which was the current basic level projected forward for another 15 years, or scenario 2, which met the current aspiration projected forward for another 15 years. One can follow the arithmetic with decimal points, but in back-of-the-envelope numbers Wanless identified a funding gap of &#163;20 billion emerging over 15 years. That funding gap of &#163;20 billion is the elephant in the drawing room. It is the reason why, 12 years on, we have a call from Ministers for a national debate. It is the reason why we have not had the action promised by Tony Blair at the Labour party conference of 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09071559001355">The Government say that it is impossible for tax funding to fill that gap&#151;in their phrase, that is &#147;ruled out&#148;&#151;and I agree with them. I suspect that the Liberal Democrats still believe that it is possible&#151;through a penny on income tax, no doubt.</p>

 I am following the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument with care. He is absolutely right: that is the elephant in the room. That gap can be funded only from public spending or from people&#146;s savings&#151;largely, the money they have locked away in their property. Although he may be justified in criticising the Government for not facing the elephant in the room, are not his hon.

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman to the extent that the funding gap has to involve more private resources&#151;I totally agree with that. However, although it may be the policy prescription that he espouses, I do not think that it is necessarily true that those resources have to come out of the savings of retired people in retirement. It is, to my mind, one of the unattractive policy options canvassed by the Government that we should have a compulsory system that pays for provision exclusively through what is, in effect, a tax on elderly people. I think that we should be encouraging people to look forward to their likely evolving need during their working lives, and the secret to doing that lies in the insurance system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09071559001358">The Government identify what they describe as partnership funding. As I said in an intervention on the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland), the Government&#146;s definition of partnership funding is different in an important respect from Wanless&#146;s definition of partnership funding. As it happens, I am more on the side of the Government than I am of Wanless in that debate. However, the Government identify partnership funding as one option and then imply that insurance is a different option. I think that they are wrong to imply that they are different; in fact, they are one and the same option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09071559001359">In my view, the Government&#146;s refashioning the resource that is currently provided from the Exchequer&#151;using Government money more effectively&#151;in partnership with private resources will, if the Government develop a proper policy, automatically lead to an insurance market that allows resources to be mobilised in a way that is significantly fairer than trying to pay for the provision from a tax on pensioners, which is what I understand the Government&#146;s so-called comprehensive option to be. The core challenge, which the Government acknowledge but do not face head-on, is to use existing public resources more effectively and in a way that enlists private resources in order to fill the Wanless funding gap.</p>

 The key strength of a link between partnership and insurance is that more private resources are unlocked for an area where I see no alternative source of funding available to meet the requirement, and those resources are levied in a way that is fairer than the other options offered by the Government, because the insurance system allows people to contribute during their working lives.

and I have repeatedly tabled different versions of insurance-based schemes that work in partnership with the public sector. That is where the answer to the conundrum lies. What is disappointing is that, 12 years on, we are still taking about the concepts, rather than the detail of the legislation. As the Minister knows, a version of that legislation was left in the desk of the incoming Secretary of State in 1997. I no longer sign up to every detail of that legislation, but it was a long way on then from where we are now.</p>

Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), and comment on his constructive comments and on the very thoughtful and impressive comments of my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09071581000019">If people in Norwich, North are listening to this debate to help make up their mind how to vote, let me remind them that it was the Conservatives who broke the link with pensions. They then attacked the Government&#146;s tax changes, and the impact that those changes had on definable benefit pension schemes, but they never point out that it was their Government who gave employers payment holidays, which accounted for a large part of the black hole in pension pots. Of course, the Conservatives never explicitly say that they will change those tax arrangements to refill the pot, because they are not going to do that. They do not mention that it was they who opposed the introduction of pension credits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90715-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09071581000020">The Conservatives raise issues such as Equitable Life and try to give the impression that if they were in power, they would find &#163;5 billion with which to compensate all Equitable Life pensioners. I have some Equitable Life pensioners in my constituency, and I hope that we will treat them generously, but the Conservative party really should not try to give the impression that it will give a blank cheque to those pension holders when clearly it will not. The Conservatives keep telling us that they want honesty about public spending in the debate, yet today they have tried to imply that every pensioner will be better off. They have even tried to fudge the difference between means-tested benefits and universal benefits. They tried to give the impression to people who currently do not get means-tested benefits that the Conservatives will move to universal benefits, and that everybody will get something, without being honest to the people on means-tested benefits about the fact that if one does that, the pot of money has to be distributed more thinly, and the poorest in society will get less. The people of Norwich, North would be well advised to take what has been said today by Conservative Members with a substantial pinch of salt. That also applies to the Liberal Democrats&#151;</p>

 In one moment. I was just about to be rude to the Liberal Democrats; let me do that first, and then I will certainly give way.

 I was going to agree with the hon. Gentleman absolutely until he made his last point. Everything that he says about Conservative policy, about the fact that the origins of the problems lie in what the Conservatives did in the 1980s, and about their lack of an answer now is true. However, is the hon. Gentleman&#151;a former Minister&#151;happy that after 12 years of a Labour Government we have the worst pensions in western Europe, 20 per cent. of pensioners in poverty, and still no answer on the question of care for the elderly?

areas can voluntarily create care trusts, in which NHS resources and social care resources from the local council are pooled together. What we have not yet done, but ought to, is say that that approach should no longer be voluntary. We should say that adult care trusts must be created everywhere, with each one having a director of adult care services responsible for pulling together funding from the NHS and local councils and making sure that it is spent most effectively.

They can continue to live in the biggest houses in the remotest parts of our constituencies and expect care workers to travel out to deliver care. Effectively, that will be at great expense to the Government: the liability falling on individuals will be capped, with the result that the public sector will have to step in and meet the costs.</p>

Therefore, we should change the planning laws, so that local councils can say, &#147;No, you can&#146;t build this accommodation as just warden-assisted accommodation.

 I am absolutely not suggesting that, but many people live in suburbs and around towns and are happy to be urban dwellers.

Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), to avoid the partisan rhetoric in which it is too tempting to engage on the eve of a by-election. I was, if I may say so, struck by the sincerity and dignity with which the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) addressed the House, and if I were tempted to engage in the debate in a partisan spirit, her presence here, listening to me, would shame me into not doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09071581000043">This is a profoundly serious debate. As somebody with a 97-year-old grandmother, who lives near me, whom I am responsible for, who is in residential care, who has gone through the often bruising experience of losing a great many assets and who is now, I am afraid, afflicted by dementia, I must say that the problem is all too present and real to my family and to me. This debate is therefore not one in which I can engage with any light or bantering tone. Plainly, the situation that afflicts my grandmother as she descends into dementia afflicts tens of thousands of people throughout the country, and they look to this House not for party point-scoring, although hon. Members in all parts of the House have engaged in such activity in good humour today, but for solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09071581000044">I have been struck by something in this debate: we seem to have made a breakthrough. In recent years, it has been particularly depressing to note that there has been an element of deception in how we have approached the foundation of public policy on this issue. Indeed, the more I have come to play a part in the system under which we now operate&#151;on behalf of constituents and personally&#151;the more apparent it has become that the system has become cruelly deceptive of those who operate in it. For example, carers are said to be entitled to an assessment and a carer&#146;s package. How often do we Members experience that as a reality as we carry out our constituency functions? In the rural part of the south-west that I have the honour to represent, it is more of a declaration than a reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09071581000045">In Devon, part of which I represent, it is not true to say that when a person has exhausted their assets they can choose a home or remain in the home in which they have been resident. If the county council will not pay the fee associated with such homes, more and more families end up digging into their own pockets to top up the amounts that the county council will pay. Alternatively, a benevolent fund or charity&#151;whomever one can find&#151;becomes involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09071581000046">The alternative with which the resident is presented is that of moving from a home in which he or she has become happy, or at least contented and used to. That is cruel. Having paid all they can and descended beneath the relevant threshold of assets, the resident comes to the system. In many parts of the country&#151;particularly in Devon, which has the sixth worst social care grant in the country&#151;they find that the reality is not what they were led to expect, which was that the state would provide for them in their straitened circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09071581000047">Far too many in residential care are affected by serious conditions such as dementia; the hon. Member for Colne Valley spoke a little about that, but did not go into detail. My grandmother is in a home, clearly suffering from moderate, and increasingly severe, dementia. That is not, we are told, a matter for the health service and it is extremely difficult for her to access the mental health services that might assist her. I  <br>

suspect that thousands of elderly people in residential care are affected by dementia. I fear that the curious assessment system that decides who falls under the health category and who falls under the social care category is also, to a large extent, a deception. The system is variously interpreted in different parts of the country and one senses that the lower the Government social care grant for a local authority, the more people who should be paid for from the health budget are in the homes of that authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09071581000048">I make criticisms of that, but I understand its springs and origins; it comes down to a shortage of money. I said that we had made a breakthrough in this debate and the run-up to it: it is that I have yet to detect anybody who seriously contests the notion that all parties must make a frank and candid admission to the country. It is that we cannot conceivably fund these measures through taxation, and if both sides of the House start from that point, we will at least have the beginning of a consensus&#151;the start of a foundation on which we can build a policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09071581000049">I have yet to detect that; indeed, the Liberal Democrats went to the country at the last general election with a policy based on precisely that position. That reminds me of Harold Macmillan&#151;I am going to indulge in a little badinage, but I hope it is good-humoured&#151;saying that the Liberals are full of original and practical ideas, but the problem is that the original ones are not practical and the practical ones are not original. One has to say that the policy with which the Liberal Democrats went to the country three or four years ago was not practical. I am delighted to hear that they are no longer wedded to it, given that even their own party members considered it to be based on a deception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09071581000050">We cannot go on suggesting to the people of this country that we can sustain elderly and social care on the basis of taxation. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood that there must be a balance. I am going to risk provoking the concern of my Front-Bench colleagues by saying that we need to use public funds more effectively. I say to the Minister that I am not speaking for my party, so let him not make too much of this. I participated in a Select Committee that looked into fuel poverty and asked, &#147;Are we making enough of the public funds?&#148; and &#147;Are we directing them and making them more effective?&#148; That Labour-dominated Committee decided in its report, which I commend to the Minister, that we were not making effective use of the public means at our disposal. In my judgment, winter fuel payments should not be paid to those on higher-rate tax bands. It  makes no sense to do that, and we could save about &#163;250 million by not doing so&#151;a small amount, but it would be a start. We are not making effective use of the many different allowances that are&#151;I fully accept this&#151;designed and targeted to relieve the poverty of the aged, including fuel poverty. On top of that, we should, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood suggested, adopt an insurance system over and above a particular threshold.</p>

and if it were made compulsory, how would it differ from national insurance, which is effectively just another tax?</p>

 Plainly, the detail needs to be examined. I can think of solutions through the insurance system that would not necessarily mean that the money was lost if one did not subsequently have to call on the insurance fund, and other techniques could be used. The danger is that there would be no incentive to engage in it. However, it would be retrograde and unfortunate simply to have a tax on those who were elderly or a tax on their estates; we must look for alternatives to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09071581000053">The silver lining that I perceive in this debate, starting from a position of far less expertise than those who have participated in examining the problem in government, is that we have all been able candidly to accept&#151;nobody has sought to argue otherwise&#151;that we will need a system that is based at least partly on the private financing of those affected. If we can build on that as a starting point for this policy, we then have a responsibility to develop it. Twelve years ago, the former Prime Minister came into government promising that he would solve this problem. It is a bit late for the Labour Government to produce a policy now, but I am glad that they have, because at least we can all begin to talk about this an adult and sensible way and to say to the public that it can no longer be done on the basis of public means and direct taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09071581000073">What do independent elderly people living alone need, as well as peace of mind about long-term care? They need the security of knowing how to access appropriate acute care and that they will be cared for expertly and appropriately in the right setting. One of the disadvantages of the rapid changeover of Ministers in the Department of Health is that, just when one has got a particular Minister to recognise something important, he moves on. I am referring to the right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), with whom I have had more than one debate about access to emergency care. That is particularly important for the elderly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para30"><a name="09071581000074">I want to put it on the record, so that current Ministers do not forget, that they are working towards a single, three-digit telephone number, which will allow the elderly to know that they do not have to traipse round the minor injuries unit or an accident and emergency department or to look for out-of-hours care. They can ring the number, which will point them to the correct pathway. That is the first thing that I do not want to be forgotten.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para31"><a name="09071581000075">The second thing is also crucial for elderly people. Let us imagine an elderly person found unconscious in the street and taken to an A and E department. The first thing casualty officers do is measure blood sugar because, time and again, that puts matters straight. They whop in the sugar and, if it does not work, they take further tests and discover that the person has terribly low blood pressure and terribly low sodium. That raises all sorts of possibilities. If that patient were accompanied by an electronic summary care record, the doctors would be told the reason for the particular problems immediately. The electronic summary care record is crucial to quality of care for the elderly, and I cannot understand why it has been so delayed when we have an absolute model for it in Canada, where there is, on a single computer screen under eight headings, all that an emergency doctor needs to know. I hope that Health Ministers will recognise the importance of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90715-0020.htm_para32"><a name="09071581000076">I hope that, in the excitement of publishing the elderly care Green Paper, those other matters will be remembered and that everybody will engage, especially, as the right hon.

debate to ask the Minister two questions, which need to be asked with only three sitting days left before we break for the summer recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09071581000078">The first relates to a commitment that was made last June by the Minister&#146;s predecessor immediately to produce a paper on prescribing anti-psychotic medication to people who suffer from dementia. That scandalous practice affects more than 100,000 people a year in care homes, and it probably accounts for the premature deaths of around 23,000 elderly people up and down the country. It is clear from the evidence that has been compiled over many years that such drugs cut lives short, that they result in strokes and that they cause many of the symptoms that are then used to justify yet more prescribing. Government action on this issue is long overdue, so will the Minister tell us when the now overdue report on prescribing will be published and the necessary action that will be taken?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09071581000079">My second point is about the Government&#146;s commitment to do something about elder abuse more generally and put in place new measures to tackle that scandal. Some 342,000 people a year are the victims of elder abuse in this country. That is a scandalous tally, and it does not even include those in care homes or those with dementia. I would therefore like the Minister to tell us when he expects the &#147;No Secrets&#148; review to release a publication. The codes of practice for consultation&#151;codes to which the Government say they adhere&#151;suggest that a publication should have come out in April. However, we have seen no analysis of the responses to the consultation, nor have we seen any indication of the Government&#146;s proposals.</p>

It would therefore be useful if the Minister were to confirm today that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to do that, that there will be full accountability to this House and that there will be a genuine effort to keep minds open to the case that has been made by the police, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and almost every statutory body that responded to the Government&#146;s consultation. Legislation should be introduced to put the protection of vulnerable adults on a similar footing to the protection of children. Surely that should happen, because it is long overdue.</p>

across the Chamber, but I am a Norfolk MP and make no bones about it. The issues that affect people in Norwich equally affect people in my constituency, so I make no apology for bringing up that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09071581000084">The fact is that elderly people feel vulnerable, but at the same time people in Norfolk are proud people: they want dignity and respect in retirement; and they want the state there as a hand-up, not as a handout. The fact is&#151;this comes up on the doorsteps&#151;that there is much social and economic deprivation across the county of Norfolk. I have spoken to people in Norwich and in my own constituency, which is highly rural&#151;Norfolk is a disparate county that covers eight constituencies of various sizes&#151;and they are concerned that what is being proposed today is too little, too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09071581000085">Tony Blair talked about the issue 12 years ago. I have a quote here from a constituent who came to see me at my surgery: &#147;It&#146;s 12 years of hardship and misery&#151;not just for me, but for my family and all those people whom I am now reliant on to give me the support I cannot get from the state.&#148; That is the fact of the matter, and that is what we face every day. I encourage hon. Members to listen more to constituents who say such things. That is not partisan; it is our job as Members of Parliament to stand up in this House and represent those points of view, however people may see it from the Government Benches. I am doing this, because it is right for the people of my constituency and the people of Norwich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09071581000086">At the end of the day, we have a growing elderly population, who realise that their pensions will not cover the cost of care that they have to provide. They feel penalised as they go about their daily lives. They have made a contribution to the community and to society, and they have paid their taxes, yet in their hour of need, they often feel that the rug has been pulled from beneath them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09071581000087">The families of many elderly people have moved away, because they can no longer afford to live next door, so they can no longer invite their grandmothers, grandfathers, uncles or aunts to live with them. Families have had to move because of work. My constituency covers 1,200 sq miles, and people can live very far away from each other while remaining in the same constituency. Villages and rural areas often do not have a proper infrastructure or a proper transport system. It is all very well to say that elderly people can get help from their families, but that is just not practical and it does not work.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the black hole in finances and resources is such that the honest message must inevitably go out from this place that families need to do more to support their loved ones in their old age? There is unlikely to be a solution that will provide the security that older people need without greater personal commitment from families.</p>

 I agree 100 per cent. with my hon. Friend. There is no doubt that families try. No matter what their political persuasion or where they live, they try to help each other as best they can. At the end of the day, however, selling one&#146;s own home to pay for care is not the solution. Over the past 12 years, many people  <br>

waiting for help from the Government have done their best to sort, but selling one&#146;s home in an economically and financially difficulty environment is not the easiest option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09071581000090">Some of the proposals in the Green Paper will not suit people, because they will not be around to see the benefit of them. There is no mention of people who are coming to the end of their lives having struggled to manage. What are they to do? What is the Government&#146;s commitment to them? The Green Paper talks about the next generation, but we are talking about the here and now. The Green Paper goes some way towards dealing with the problems, but it is too little, too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09071581000091">Norfolk is a good example of a local county council in a diverse county doing its best. It serves local farming communities, rural villages, larger towns and, of course, the city of Norwich. Long distances mean that costs go up. People in my constituency, and in Norwich, will need to decide in a couple of months&#146; time whether they can afford to fuel their homes or put food on the table. That is as bare as it gets, and it is a very difficult thing to decide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09071581000092">People feel very isolated, and they do not have to live in a rural community to do so. People who live in terraced houses in streets with 150 other residents can feel just as isolated if their neighbours have no respect for them and do not feel the need to knock on their front door, and if local services do not have enough money to offer services such as meals on wheels. Other charitably based organisations sometimes cannot offer services to the community. People are making great sacrifices in difficult times, and the Government must address that problem. The people of Norfolk and the rest of the county&#151;and, of course, the people of Norwich&#151;deserve better.</p>

 We have had a wide-ranging debate that has been characterised by thorough and thoughtful contributions from both sides of the House. In addition to all our constituents, many of us have parents, grandparents, other relations and friends for whom these subjects are a genuine reality. In that spirit, I pay particular tribute to the measured, moving and brave speech by the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). It was one of her understandably rare speeches in the House, and we all listened to it with great care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09071581000094">The debate has also been characterised to some degree by disappointment in the Government. That disappointment coalesces around the question: who has been in Government for the past 12 years? We must also ask who promised, 12 years ago, to deal with the very issues before us today. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) opened the debate with an excellent speech that covered the economic issues affecting pensioners and addressed the aspects of the motion that cover care of the elderly in the round. He pointed out that the present Prime Minister promised to end the means test for elderly people, but had not done so. The Labour party promised in its 1997 manifesto that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09071581000096">On that latter point of care, it is not as if the Government have not had chances to deliver. On the subject of caring for the elderly&#151;the title of this debate&#151;the Government set up a royal commission on long-term care as far back as 1999. In 2006 the King&#146;s Fund published the Wanless report, which set out the models and problems faced much more thoroughly than the Government&#146;s Green Paper published yesterday did. In response to the Wanless review, the then Health Minister, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), who is now Chief Secretary to the Treasury, announced a zero-based review. There is no evidence of any serious work being undertaken as a result of that; it seems that it amounted to little more than kicking the problem into the long grass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para15"><a name="09071581000097">Expectation then coalesced around the comprehensive spending review in 2008&#151; fuelled by comments by the then Minister, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who is now a Foreign Office Minister. He said that the Department would</p>
<a name="90715-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="09071581001185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;secure a fair and reasonable settlement as part of the comprehensive spending review&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, </i>21 February 2007; Vol. 457, c. 98WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para16"><a name="09071581000098">It did not: the spending review simply announced another consultation. That consultation was launched by the Prime Minister in May 2008, in a speech to the King&#146;s Fund, in which he said:</p>
<a name="90715-0021.htm_brev3"><a name="09071581001186"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the government is publishing a consultation document setting out the challenges we face and why we must now look again at the options for reforming our current system of care and support.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para17"><a name="09071581000099">I see that the Prime Minister also wrote a foreword to yesterday&#146;s Green Paper, which said:</p>
<a name="90715-0021.htm_brev4"><a name="09071581001187"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What is now needed is a major debate about the challenge we face and the options for addressing it. This Green Paper sets out those options and the principles which we must now consider. This is the start of a process of discussion rather than the end&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para18"><a name="09071581000100">It is thus a fair question to ask just how many starts the Government need. We rightly ask that question, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) comprehensively did in his response to yesterday&#146;s statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para19"><a name="09071581000101">Let me touch briefly on the question of consensus. Throughout this debate Ministers, including the Prime Minister, have deployed the word &#147;consensus&#148;. The Prime Minister ended his King&#146;s Fund speech by saying:</p>
<a name="90715-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="09071581001188"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I look forward to building a consensus in this country about the best way ahead.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para20"><a name="09071581000102">But the Government&#146;s record suggests that their understanding of the concept of consensus is to use it as a cloak when they are in trouble. At no point have they approached vast numbers of people in the third sector, let alone the official Opposition, to discuss the ways forward. As far as I know, they have not talked formally even to the Liberal Democrats or others. One would have thought that that was hardly a way to build a consensus. More importantly, the Government have consistently withheld the work they have commissioned and paid for with taxpayers&#146; money, using it for political leaks rather than for informing public debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para21"><a name="09071581000103">If this talk of consensus is to be more than warm words, the Government need to start building one, as urged by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) and by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox), who spoke powerfully,  <br>

informed by his experience of caring for his grandmother. They need to build consensus around agreement that social care in all its ramifications cannot be fully met from taxation alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para22"><a name="09071581000104">I turn to the so-called models or options set out in yesterday&#146;s Green Paper. On the first, which the Government call the partnership option, the House must be careful about the choice of words. Derek Wanless described a partnership model, but for him, the Government would pay a first section of the costs and would match-fund the next section&#151;an element that has slipped away in the Green Paper. The insurance option is actually a partnership plus, with insurance coming in to fill the gap. This was favoured by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who spoke authoritatively and reminded us that it has been 12 long years since a proposal was first promised by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para23"><a name="09071581000105">From the Government&#146;s presentation, it did not look as though traditional insurance solutions would work, so considerably more examination was needed. Inexplicably, however, the state-backed version of the insurance model has not been modelled. Indeed, an impact assessment, signed by the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope) who is about to reply to the debate, said that all the benefits had been properly assessed for impact. When we get to the comprehensive model, however, it is equally problematic, and the impact assessment admits that this model has not been specifically modelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para24"><a name="09071581000106">According to the impact assessments, it looks as though all the Government&#146;s preferred solutions and schemes assume that money is to be taken from abolishing the attendance allowance. The Green Paper is blind on this issue, so will the Minister explain what assumptions the models make about the disability living allowance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para25"><a name="09071581000107">I shall now talk briefly about people with disabilities who are under 65. Mike Smith, chair of the National Centre for Independent Living, said yesterday:</p>
<a name="90715-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="09071581001189"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Disabled and older people were hoping for leadership from the government in care reform.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para26"><a name="09071581000108">It is clear that there are few ringing endorsements for the Government from the care sector. Indeed, it has been pointed out that reform was urgent for 12 years and remains so today, and that those under 65 with lifetime care needs have been completely overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09071581000109">We need to ask the Government a question that they have sought to skate over, not least yesterday. They call this a national care service. The national health service was extended throughout the United Kingdom from the outset. Can the Minister explain what the Government&#146;s plans are as regards cross-border portability in social care in a national care service, when it is impossible for Members, or indeed Government policy, to impose what the Government claim will be part of a national service on three parts of the United Kingdom? That question has yet to be answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para28"><a name="09071581000110">I hope that the Minister will also be able to tell us what provision the Green Paper makes for meeting the costs of accommodation and food&#151;the so-called hotel costs. It is interesting that, having said that he would set out his own party&#146;s policy, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) failed to do so, because&#151;not least at the last general election&#151;the Liberal Democrats said that they would meet care costs, including &#147;hotel  <br>

costs&#148;, because that had worked in Scotland. It did not work in Scotland. Indeed, in answer to a question from me in Westminster Hall, the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) put it on record&#151;it is in the <i> Official Report</i>&#151;that the Liberal Democrats&#146; policy had been dishonest, and that the writers of her party manifesto had used that approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para29"><a name="09071581000111">Lest anyone become carried away with the word &#147;consensus&#148;, let me say that politics is about choices. Let me take this opportunity to explode the myth that Labour has been peddling about Conservative policies, not least in Norwich, which I have visited twice. How many times has the Minister been there? Labour is saying that we would cut pension credit, but that claim is dishonest. We have never said that we would cut pensions or pension credit. Labour is saying that we would scrap free television licences, but that claim too is dishonest. We have no plans to scrap free television licences. Labour is claiming that we would scrap free bus passes for the elderly, but we have no such plans, and it is dishonest to claim otherwise.</p>

 We have had a vigorous debate. Some of it has been driven by political motivations&#151;we know where they are coming from&#151;but some has been driven by the experiences of constituents and by Members&#146; personal experiences. I welcomed the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford)&#151;who spoke from huge experience&#151;and that of the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox).

Given that a country is measured, ultimately, by how well it looks after its elderly, it is right for this question to be at the heart of our political discourse, whether here in Westminster, in Norwich or in any other part of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90715-0021.htm_para32"><a name="09071581000115">I recently met an elderly couple in Croydon who were receiving excellent care through a unique partnership between the national health service, the local authority and a voluntary organisation, which were working together to give them high-quality support. They made it clear to me that they wanted us in Parliament, and in Government, to ensure that they would be looked after financially, and wanted to be reassured that their health and social care needs would be met so that they could play an active part in their community. They wanted it to be recognised that although they were elderly and frail they still had something to offer society, and they wanted the opportunity to prove it. It is up to us to rise above the party political division that will inevitably accompany debates of this kind, and try to reach a consensus on a better future for older people.</p>

In 1997&#151;10 years ago&#151;pensioner poverty was a national disgrace: 3 million older people were living below the breadline, and the poorest had to scrape by on &#163;69 a week. Today, no one under 60 need live on less than &#163;130 a week. We have made huge strides in providing help for older people. Every pensioner benefits from free off-peak bus travel, free television licences and help with fuel bills.</p>

Through putting people first, more than &#163;0.5 billion of extra investment is today allowing local authorities to transform the way services are delivered, including through piloting new personal care budgets. I thought there was support throughout the House for that new direction in the delivery of social care. My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90715-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09071581000121">Let me be clear about what we have done in spending terms over the past 12 years. In 1997, adult social care spending was less than &#163;10 billion. Ten years later, that figure has risen to &#163;15.3 billion&#151;a 50 per cent. real-terms increase. Local authorities have received record increases in funding for the care that they provide. Spending on care for older people has gone up from &#163;6 billion to almost &#163;9 billion&#151;a 41 per cent. real-terms increase. All that investment over the past 12 years, and all the reform that I do not have the time to describe in detail, has made a real difference to older people in our communities, but we now need to build on those successes to reshape the entire system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90715-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09071581000122">Given the unfairnesses that others have described in the system, and given the demographic challenge of an ageing society, it is clear that we need radical proposals to maintain a viable and affordable care service for the future. Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health laid before Parliament the vision of a new national care service to deliver a fairer and simpler approach to funding and accessing care services for all adults. With the exception of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and his Front-Bench colleagues yesterday, I thought that on the basis of  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90715-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09071581000125">When the Tories were in power, pensioner poverty increased and social care was ignored. In opposition, they are refusing to say what their policies would be and, very cynically, they have now said they will not support a national care service despite the comments of certain Conservative Back Benchers. Perhaps the Conservative Front-Bench team should look to them for sensible contributions about the right way forward, as I thought I heard support for option two in our Green Paper from at least two Conservative Back Benchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90715-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09071581000126">We want a system in which people can rely on a care service for the future, and we want to build a consensus around new national care services. For the sake of the people in Croydon whom I met recently, and the millions of people we represent as constituency MPs, I hope that the House will grasp this once-in-a-generation opportunity to support the creation of a national care service that is fairer, simpler and more affordable for all, and that provides good quality care for everyone, wherever they live and whatever their needs.</p>

 The Johnnie Walker whisky bottling plant in Kilmarnock dominates the town. As its Hill street address suggests, it sits above the centre of the town as a solid symbol of Kilmarnock's industrial history. Like the ravens in the tower of London, no matter how bad things get in Kilmarnock, as long as the Johnnie Walker plant is there, there is always hope for the future. For a community that has suffered decades of de-industrialisation and that for more than 30 years now has had a systemic higher rate of unemployment than the rest of Scotland, psychologically the imposing presence of Johnnie Walker and its 700 jobs offers some optimism that the town can rise again.</p>

There are thousands of former Johnnie Walker workers in Kilmarnock, hundreds of present Johnnie Walker workers, and many thousands who aspire to be Johnnie Walker workers.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his campaign, which has brought together on a cross-party and cross-community basis many people in Kilmarnock and the surrounding area. Does he agree, however, that the closures would affect the whole of Ayrshire, which has already lost far too many jobs in the past few decades? The economic impact on Ayrshire would be dire.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend, who has been a stalwart supporter of the campaign that we are conducting to try to get Diageo to change its mind. The fact that she has been so vocal in her support shows the extent to which the people of Ayrshire&#151;and, indeed, Scotland, to a large degree&#151;have fallen in behind the campaign. She anticipates many of the arguments that I am about to make, so perhaps I should carry on.</p>

By operating the bottling plant in Kilmarnock and the distribution centre in Hurlford, Diageo contributes all that benefit to the wider community of Kilmarnock. To that extent, the people of Kilmarnock and Ayrshire are grateful for the years that it has run the plant, but the situation has been far from a one-way street, and I think that the business would accept that.</p>

consumers at home and abroad? It is a real mistake for any multinational company to lose touch with, and lose its commitment to, the communities that produce their profits, whether they are in Kilmarnock, Glasgow or Speyside.</p>

<p><a name="st_o459"><a name="09071581000662"><a name="90715-0023.htm_spnew8"><a name="09071581001768"><b>Des Browne:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, and indeed for his support, to which I shall come back in a moment. The interventions reassure me that the argument that I am developing is the right one; it is being anticipated right, left and centre. It may well be anticipated further as the evening goes on. I was explaining that the situation is far from a one-way street, and that the people of Kilmarnock have contributed significantly to the success of the plant and its well-known and internationalist spirit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90715-0023.htm_para9"><a name="09071581000663">For many of my constituents, Johnnie Walker is woven into the weave of Kilmarnock. I have to say that until 1 July, they thought that that commitment was reciprocated. Diageo is an impressive multinational company: it provides 4,500 jobs in Scotland, leads the drinks industry across the world, and markets some of the world&#146;s best-known and leading brands. To its credit, it earns formidable amounts from exports for the United Kingdom and its shareholders. Ostensibly, it is a modern company managed according to the best 21st-century corporate practices. That means that over the years, its workers in Kilmarnock have been conditioned to understand just how much they are valued by their corporate masters, just how important their individual and collective contributions are to the corporate success, and, importantly, how seriously Diageo takes its responsibilities to them as partners, not just workers. Its workers have been conditioned to understand how much the company is committed, as part of its ethos, to cherish and preserve its legacy and heritage and to protect the communities that are its hosts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90715-0023.htm_para10"><a name="09071581000664">I could paper the walls of this Chamber with corporate documentation that articulates that message of partnership. It is designed to encourage the work force to show greater efficiency and greater loyalty, and it succeeds. Yet on 1 July, those same workers were told that the need for &#147;more shareholder value&#148; required that their bottling plant be closed within two years, and that the distribution workers be transferred within months to a new employer&#151;essentially, as they were told in a letter, whether they liked it or not.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on securing the debate. He is well aware that Kilmarnock workers have made a major contribution to the profits of Diageo, but so have workers throughout the rest of Scotland, particularly in Port Dundas and in Renfrewshire, where we are losing jobs, too. Independent consultants have been brought in to assist Diageo, which is a welcome move. Can he inform the House whether those independent consultants will work with the workers&#146; representatives, the trade unions? I do not mean just talking to the trade unions, which have expertise in such matters; I mean working alongside them.</p>

Kilmarnock and Loudoun and in Ayrshire, have all joined together to speak with one voice in asking Diageo to think again. That we have sustained this campaign from a standing start for two weeks now, maintaining a consistent public presence and gathering support from across the world, is convincing evidence that the cause is just. However, it is also a sign of the degree of pain that the community is feeling and the level of fear that it has for its future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90715-0023.htm_para18"><a name="09071581000677">The Johnnie Walker workers in Kilmarnock are extremely grateful to wider Scottish society for the support that they have received. The First Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland have both pledged their support. On behalf of my constituents, I should like to thank the hon. Members for Moray (Angus Robertson), for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) for joining me last week to launch an all-party UK parliamentary presence in this campaign. I should also like to add our thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) and the Scottish Affairs Committee for taking up our request that it investigate the implications of the decision for Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90715-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09071581000678">If we add to that the growing petition that is attracting support from throughout the world and the offers of support that are flooding in from all over, the House may get a sense of how important the issue is. All that will be reflected in a march and rally in Kilmarnock on 26 July, to which all those Members not on holiday&#151;which we all know is for all but two weeks during the recess&#151;are invited.</p>

 I am a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee, and today, as I am sure my right hon. Friend is aware, we met senior members of Diageo&#146;s management. Not only I, but all members of the Committee, were angered at the management&#146;s expression of resentment at any political involvement in the decision. Currently, by legislation of course, it is a proposal not a decision, but I hope my right hon. Friend agrees that it would be remiss of any politician not to challenge such a decision. The management said today that we were using the issue as a political football, but &#147;political football&#148; suggests to me that politicians have fallen out with each other, and that is not the case. There is cross-party condemnation of the proposal and cross-party support for a challenge to it.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution, although he has spoiled the whole second half of my speech.

It cannot be the case that the former are the only people in Scotland who cannot see the point. My research has revealed that an embarrassment of phrases from whisky&#146;s own promotional material could be deployed to show what we all know, which is that, when a glass of whisky is raised anywhere in the world, the whisky drinker is raising Scotland in a glass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90715-0023.htm_para21"><a name="09071581000684">Of all the competing brands of Scotland in a glass, Johnnie Walker is the most successful by a street because of its provenance&#151;because of its roots stretching back to 1820.

 I, too, was at the Scottish Affairs Committee briefing with senior Diageo management, and I was surprised that they were so surprised by our reaction. We merely reflect the reaction of our constituents, however, so can I, through the right hon. Gentleman, tell those in corporate whisky, as he calls it, that they have always received a good reception in this House because we see the connection between our communities and their business? If they are determined to break that connection, why should our communities seek to support them in the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="90715-0023.htm_para22"><a name="09071581000687">About 12 years ago, the local council, East Ayrshire council, Scottish Enterprise and the workers at Kilmarnock, supported by Donald Dewar and Brian Wilson, who were then in the Scotland Office, succeeded in persuading Diageo that that combination of efficiency, loyalty and profitability, embedded in a credible heritage and provenance, which is in the bottle, was a winning combination. Then, Diageo decided not only to continue to bottle whisky in Kilmarnock but to invest in the plant. Then, politicians intervened, and as a consequence Diageo and its Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock have enjoyed a decade of improving markets and greater profitability. It is possible for politicians to make a positive contribution, and that is an example.</p>

The difference this time is that the company&#146;s marketing gurus and desire for more shareholder value have convinced its executives that they can take the risk of breaking the link between the world&#146;s best-known Scotch whisky and its history. Furthermore, they must have been prepared to contemplate the disastrous social effects that the decision would have on the community  <br>

that I represent, which has so loyally served the company for about 200 years, and they must have considered that a price worth paying. I do not believe that it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para1"><a name="09071581000689">Making the case for the company to think again is my job as a politician; it would be a dereliction of my duty not to do now what I did 12 years ago. Thankfully, we are dealing with what in Diageo&#146;s own words is a proposal. Its chief executive officer told me to my face that he would listen to an alternative. He has repeated that, both to the First Minister and to the Secretary of State for Scotland&#151;and, no doubt, to the Scottish Affairs Committee. We intend to take him at his word.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para2"><a name="09071581000690">I am not in the business of peddling false hopes and I realise how difficult this will be, but I am determined that all of us involved in this side of the argument will work together to produce an alternative that is at least as attractive as the proposal that is on the table at present. Scottish Enterprise has accepted the mandate to conduct the assessment of the underlying financial and business plan to enable us to come up with that alternative. The First Minister of Scotland has cast himself in the role of principal interlocutor with Diageo. Yesterday in a meeting in Edinburgh, local politicians and I made it perfectly clear to John Swinney, the Finance Secretary, and his officials and the senior management of Scottish Enterprise, that time is of the essence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para3"><a name="09071581000691">Diageo&#146;s 90-day consultation clock is ticking, and the unions are already embroiled in consultations. If those consultations are not to become simply an opportunity for the company to justify its proposal, the shape of the alternative must begin to emerge sooner rather than later. When the First Minister meets the chief executive officer of Diageo next week, this story must move on. The campaign is bringing the community that I represent together in a spectacular fashion, but behind closed doors the uncertainty is destroying its confidence in its future. That cannot be allowed to go on.</p>

However, on my constituents&#146; behalf I have some messages for the Government and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response. First, the UK Government must stand ready to support, in any way that they can while respecting devolved responsibilities, any alternative proposal that emerges. I repeat that what has happened is not a consequence of recession and the decision is not driven by duty rates on spirits; consequently, the levers that the UK Government hold will be limited. However, as the counter-proposal emerges, and if we need to come for support, my constituents need to know that it will be there.</p>

Friend the Minister is a fellow Scot and a former adviser to the late Donald Dewar, and he has a long history of appreciation of Scots values and heritage. I do not have to explain to him just how important these historical links are to Scotland&#146;s most famous export. Does he share my concern about the facility with which whisky executives now seem to be able to trot out the justifications for not only breaking the link but for moving even more than 20 per cent. of whisky bottling offshore?</p>

However, I am satisfied that the man paid to run the company is telling me the truth and that it will listen. The onus is on us to come up with the alternative to persuade it.

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne) on securing this debate. I have spoken to him about this issue several times in recent weeks, and I know how much it means to him and to his constituents. He is of course deeply concerned about the jobs of the Diageo workers in his constituency and the effect that the loss of those jobs will have not only on the families involved but on the wider community in Kilmarnock and the rest of Ayrshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para7"><a name="09071581000698">The Scotch whisky industry is hugely important to the UK economy. Figures published last month by the Scotch Whisky Association put the value of annual whisky shipments at more than &#163;3 billion, earning &#163;97 a second for the UK last year. Overall, the equivalent of more than 1 billion bottles of Scotch whisky were shipped all over the world&#151;to north and central America, Australia, Europe and Asia. Whisky also means jobs. About three quarters of the UK&#146;s distilled alcoholic drinks enterprises are located in Scotland, with an estimated 41,000 people employed just in making, distilling and bottling whisky.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para8"><a name="09071581000699">Diageo is a major player in all this.

Twenty-eight per cent. of its net sales are from Scotch whisky; that is a very large figure when one considers that it has sales of about &#163;8 billion. Diageo directly employs 4,500 people across 50 sites. The Government, through UK Trade and Investment, have strongly supported the Scotch whisky industry, as my right hon. Friend said, and we   <br>

have worked with Diageo in developing export markets. We very much appreciate the importance of that company and of the industry in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para9"><a name="09071581000700">Diageo&#146;s proposal is twofold. The first part is to close the packaging plant in Kilmarnock&#151;one of three in Scotland&#151;along with the cooperage in Port Dundas that was mentioned. The second part is to make a new investment of some &#163;100 million, creating 400 new jobs elsewhere in Scotland. I understand that, as my right hon. Friend said, this has been greeted in Kilmarnock, where the greatest number of jobs will go, with deep disappointment and dismay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para10"><a name="09071581000701">My right hon. Friend outlined the history; if someone knows the history, it means something to them. Kilmarnock is known as the home of Johnnie Walker whisky. Place has a huge role to play in whisky brands. As he said, when people buy whisky, they are not just buying a drink&#151;they are buying into a story about place, heritage and tradition. That is one of the major reasons for whisky&#146;s success. This particular whisky has been blended in Kilmarnock for almost two centuries, ever since Johnnie Walker himself blended it and sold it in Kilmarnock high street back in 1819. In fact, one of the earliest incarnations of the whisky was called Walker&#146;s Kilmarnock. Since then, generations of Kilmarnock families, including Johnnie Walker&#146;s descendents, Alexander Walker and Alexander Walker II, have added to the story of the whisky, whether through the iconic square bottle introduced in 1870 or the distinctive label applied, I understand, at the precise angle of 24.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para11"><a name="09071581000702">The association of the brand with real people and real places helps make Johnnie Walker such a distinctive and successful whisky. In fact its influence goes beyond the pleasure of drinking, as it has a wider cultural influence. I could name Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison, The Band, The Streets and ZZ Top as just some of the artists to have featured Johnnie Walker in their lyrics. Films such as &#147;The Dirty Dozen&#148; and great television programmes such as &#147;The West Wing&#148; contain references to Johnnie Walker. Indeed, there is even a Japanese novelist, Haruki Murakami, who went so far as to create a character called Johnnie Walker.</p>

Perhaps that is one reason why there are yearly sales of more than 120 million bottles. Such is the product&#146;s worth that owning one bottle of a particular Johnnie Walker blue label of which I understand there are only 200 in existence would set one back an estimated $30,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90715-0024.htm_para13"><a name="09071581000704">The affinity between the town and the brand helps explain why the proposal to close the plant in Kilmarnock has aroused such passionate and vocal opinion in the local community. As my right hon. Friend said, there is a 90-day consultation on the plans, and Diageo has given guarantees that there will be no compulsory job losses in the next 12 months. My right hon.

The business of devising alternative solutions involves the First Minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the chairman of Scottish Enterprise and many others. They are working on putting together an alternative proposal for the company. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said, a meeting yesterday was convened by the Scottish Government&#146;s Finance Minister, John Swinney.</p>
