<p>1. <a name="50210-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): What steps she is taking to improve the capacity of the Environment Agency to tackle illegal waste dumping and fly-tipping.  [215588]
</p>


<p><a name="50210-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 A number of measures have been included in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003&nbsp;and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Sheerman: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the Environment Agency does a very good job and that it is increasingly being given new roles with European directives, one after the other, on waste electrical and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electronic equipment, end-of-life vehicles and hazardous waste? At the same time, the Government are saying, through the Gershon review, that we must make all Departments cut back, and the James report from the Conservative party says that the Environment Agency should lose 1,200&nbsp;jobs. Is that the way to ensure that the Environment Agency has the capacity to look after our environment?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. The James report is not a ministerial responsibility.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I welcome that guidance, Mr. Speaker, but I certainly join my hon. Friend in welcoming the work of the Environment Agency. Indeed, its role is absolutely vital in environmental protection, environmental standards and the collection of waste. Any ill-thought-out measure that would seriously weaken its environmental protection department would be bad for the community and bad for the environment.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew3"><b> Dr. Alan Whitehead  (Southampton, Test)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend plan to publicise the new regulations on waste tipping, which could be introduced as a result of legislation being passed by the House? Might he consider giving anyone with a farm or premises where 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1638</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fly-tipping is taking place a large notice telling the men in white vans that their vehicles could be confiscated, and the costs of recovering those vehicles would have to be paid by them, if they continue to fly-tip in the future?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 It is certainly important that we raise awareness about the penalties for fly-tipping in particular. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill will strengthen the penalties that can be applied and give local authorities and the Environment Agency more powers, including on the seizure of vehicles, as my hon. Friend rightly suggests. We have been working well to raise awareness with a range of stakeholders, including the Country Land and Business Association, the National Farmers Union and the Local Government Association. I have been pleased to see the targeted action that the Environment Agency has been taking with various campaigns to seek out areas at high risk of fly-tipping and, along with the police, to stop and search vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para0">
My hon. Friend might also be interested to know that under the BREW&#151;business resource efficiency and waste&#151;fund, which comes from landfill tax, we have made available to the Environment Agency &#163;2&nbsp;million in additional funds, in particular, to tighten up the permitting and transfer of waste.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): In Burnley, waste dumping and illegal fly-tipping is a major problem. We get waste dumped in the backyards of empty properties and the council is clearing it up all the time. One of the biggest problems is that small builders who are working on one property dump the waste in the backyard of another property. Should we not impose draconian penalties on those people and, if necessary, put them out of business because that practice is unacceptable?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. Fly-tipping is antisocial, selfish and, of course, brings with it environmental risks, and we must use all the measures that we can to stop it. Under another measure in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, site plans must be produced for large construction works to make it clear where the construction waste will go, so those sites will be clearly identified. Of course there is a threshold for that&#151;it will not apply to small operators&#151;but the Bill also contains measures to ensure that the landowners of empty properties take action either to secure the property or to clear it up when it is used as a tip, and that people who are responsible for fly-tipping take on the costs of the clean-up as well.

<p>2. <a name="50210-01_wqn1"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester, Central)</b> 
 (Lab): What assessment she has made of the scientific evidence presented at the avoiding dangerous climate change conference.  [215590]
</p>


<p><a name="50210-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 The conference on avoiding dangerous climate change, which was convened by my Department from 1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;February, concluded that the risks of climate change were even more serious than previously thought. It provided new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1639</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>scientific evidence that underlined the need for urgent work on both climate change mitigation and adaptation.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew7"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend once again deserves the thanks of the whole House for convening that important conference. As she pointed out, its conclusions were consistent with recent reports showing that climate change and the pace of change are worse than we thought. Although I welcome the implementation of Kyoto next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week, it was disappointing that the European Commissioners announced that they will not establish targets on climate change under Kyoto beyond 2012. Will my right hon. Friend tell the House whether we can use our EU presidency to ensure that we firmly push forward the agenda, perhaps change the Commissioners&#039; view on the matter, and make sure that Europe takes the lead with the United States, Japan and, importantly, the newly industrialising world so that we get a grip on the problem of greenhouse gases now? Frankly, if we do not do that now, we are betraying future generations.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew8"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I take entirely the point that my hon. Friend makes. We will be engaging with some of the newly developing countries, especially those with substantial and growing energy needs, at a further conference that we are convening in the middle of March. I understand his worry about whether further targets will be set. We anticipate that we will discuss that issue during the March Environment Council. Our likely discussions will centre on whether the scientific and economic analysis informs dialogue and debate on whether further targets should be set, when they should be set and what their form might be. It is important for us to have an evidence-based discussion of the kind that we held in this country before we published our energy White Paper.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight)</b> 
 (Con): Was any evidence presented at the conference on the effect of default demolition, which English Nature estimates costs the equivalent of 3,000&nbsp;gallons of petrol for every Victorian terraced house? <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph</i> described the demolition of homes as &quot;Prescott&#039;s &#039;first resort&#039;&quot;. Has the Secretary of State discussed with the Deputy Prime Minister whether that fits neatly with her green agenda?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew10"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am afraid that the conference did not concentrate on default demolition. It considered what the key impacts of climate change are likely to be for different regions and sectors, as well as for the world as a whole. It also considered what levels of climate change imply about the stabilisation and concentration of greenhouse gases, the emission pathways that would enable different stabilisations and concentrations to be reached, and the technological options. With due respect to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, the scope of the discussions was a little different.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. David Chaytor  (Bury, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend accept that public understanding about the link between burning fossil fuels and climate change is still at a comparatively low level? People now clearly understand the links between tobacco and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1640</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cancer, and between junk food and heart disease, but we have a long way to go before most of my constituents clearly understand the impact of burning fossil fuels. Is there more that the Government can do to improve public awareness?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew12"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Yes, I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point entirely. He is right that the links are less well understood in this area, which is at least in part because in the effort to ensure that all points of view are heard, media coverage tends to put a disproportionate emphasis on the views of those who are way outside the scientific consensus on the matter. He is entirely right that we realise that there is more to do to increase communication on the issue. We have given extra resources to both the Carbon Trust and the Energy Saving Trust&#151;he might have seen the new campaign that the Carbon Trust has started to run&#151;and we are getting advice about a further communication programme to be run by the Government, for which we were given money in the spending review.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk)</b> 
 (Con): I join the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) in congratulating the Government on holding the conference last week. Given the serious conclusions, are the Government worried that carbon dioxide emissions have not fallen since they came to power, that they will miss their own target for cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 2010, that their renewable energy target is no longer credible, and that because of their incompetence, British companies cannot take part in the European Union emissions trading scheme? Is it not all too clear that a far more urgent response to the threat of climate change is now needed, and that no amount of fine words from the Prime Minister will cover the gaps in the Government&#039;s policy?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew14"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Of course we are disappointed that CO <sub>2</sub> levels have not fallen, but the hon. Gentleman is stretching things to say that we will miss our target. We are not in 2010&nbsp;yet&#151;in fact, we are some five years away. It was intended from the beginning, when the climate change programme was established in 2000, that the programme would be reviewed. It was always thought likely that the measures would not be sufficient to get us to our 20&nbsp;per cent. target by 2010. No such target was missed by the previous Government because they did not have a target for meeting carbon dioxide levels.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): That was before Kyoto.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew16"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Yes, but we have moved substantially beyond the levels of greenhouse gas emissions that we inherited from that Government. I am not criticising them because they made progress, but we have made still more and have, indeed, exceeded our Kyoto target.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para1">
On the emissions trading scheme, I know that it is too much to expect consistency from the Conservatives, but considering how much they criticised us when we announced our initial proposals for a national allocation plan&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew17"><b> Norman Baker  (Lewes)</b>

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1641</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew18"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Indeed, they also prayed against the regulations. So it is a bit ironic that they criticise us for trying to amend that plan.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 However hard the Secretary of State tries to mislead people&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh.&quot;]&#151;about the Conservative party&#039;s attitude to emissions trading, nothing will stop us telling the truth about the Government&#039;s failures. [Hon. Members: &quot;Withdraw.&quot;] We have always supported the principle of emissions trading&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. Hon. Members sometimes tell me how to do my job. The hon. Gentleman is in order, but he is close to the edge.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para2">
Is it not disgraceful that at the time when the Prime Minister is putting climate change at the heart of Britain&#039;s presidency of the European Union, Britain, along with Greece and the Czech Republic, is not even in the emissions trading scheme? We all support the principle of targets, but it will not add to the Government&#039;s credibility if they defy the clear evidence that their targets for renewable energy and cutting carbon dioxide emissions will be missed, despite the fact that, after five years of continuous economic growth under the previous Government, they inherited falling carbon dioxide emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para3">
The next Conservative Government will make transport greener, do more to promote energy efficiency for the benefit of households and business, and develop a wider range of renewable energy sources than Labour has done. Does the Minister realise that if we are to achieve our objectives and obligations, those are the very steps that the Government should be taking?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew22"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I reject utterly any suggestion that I misled the House. All I did was remind it that the Conservative party&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman said I was misleading people. I was not. I referred merely to the simple fact, which is on the record, that the Conservative party prayed against the emissions trading scheme regulations. I was delighted to be told the other day that, nevertheless, the Conservative party supported the principle of such regulations. I have not since said, and will not say, that the Conservatives oppose the principle, but I am entitled to draw attention to the record. I am certainly entitled to draw attention to the Conservatives&#039; inconsistency in criticising us, as they did, for hitting British industry when we published our original proposals and now criticising us for trying to amend them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para4">
I have made no attempt to deny where we are with the targets. It should concern everyone in the House that we are not finding it as easy to meet those targets as had been thought, and we will have to do more. I trust that we will get support from the Conservatives for the measures proposed in the climate change review programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para5">
As for the notion that the Conservatives would do more on energy efficiency, the Conservative Government did not recognise the issue of fuel poverty, and certainly no steps were taken on energy efficiency to

<br>&nbsp;<br>help the millions of people who have been helped by this Government. The hon. Gentleman says that we need a wider range of renewables. I agree absolutely. What a pity, therefore, that the Conservatives cut the funding to programmes such as marine and coastal renewables when they were in power.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew23"><b> Linda Gilroy  (Plymouth, Sutton)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend will know that nine out of 10&nbsp;of the most costly insured weather catastrophes since 1970&nbsp;happened in the past 15&nbsp;years. Was the insurance industry represented at the conference? What prospect does she see for engaging that industry in urging those who are rather laggard in realising the dangers of climate change to take more urgent action?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew24"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is entirely right. The dangers to which she draws attention are very real. The insurance industry was not represented as such at the conference. It was a conference of scientists that was convened by and run by the scientific community. My hon. Friend is right that there is increasing awareness not only in the insurance industry but, as I heard myself during recent conversations that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister had with the World Economic Forum in Davos, in the banks, which are increasingly warning those who use their services that their preparations for and understanding of the risks of climate change will, in the long term, be a factor in the assessment of their financial record and probity.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew25"><b> Norman Baker  (Lewes)</b> 
 (LD): May I welcome the work that the Secretary of State&#039;s Department has done in co-ordinating the scientific evidence on climate change? It has taken a lead within the Government in promoting the necessary radical action that we need, although sometimes it has lost out to other less enlightened Departments, which demonstrates the importance of the departmental structure. Have discussions been taking place within the Government on the possible abolition or reconfiguration of DEFRA, to be announced shortly after the election?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-01_spnew26"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am not aware of any such discussions. I am constantly urged in conversations, particularly, for example, with non-governmental organisations, that my Department should take in all of energy policy, all of planning or all of transport. That is all very interesting, but I am aware of no plans that we should do so. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-01_para6">
Alongside the concerns expressed and warnings given about the increased danger and urgency of the problem, the scientific community also judged that many of the technological options for tackling the problem already exist, and that significant moves forward could be made at a lower cost than some had previously believed. That is an important and worthwhile message that I hope will come out of the conference.

<p><a name="50210-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 Thanks to the policies of this Labour Government, wild bird numbers, after decades of decline, are now recovering. Among threatened species that are increasing are the bittern, the corncrake and the cirl bunting. Others, including some more common species, such as the house sparrow and starling, are still declining. However, I can announce that from 1&nbsp;March the house sparrow and the starling will enjoy increased legal protection.

 Will my hon.

Will he join me in congratulating the RSPB also on the stance that it has taken on the potential effects of dredging in the Dee estuary and the damage that that could cause to this important wild bird habitat? Will he urge the authorities concerned in reaching a decision on the dredging of the Dee to take a view that fully balances the important ecological considerations alongside those of commerce?

 Yes, on my hon. Friend&#039;s latter point I can give him the assurance that he seeks.

The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) is wrong that those species are still declining.

 Yes, my hon. Friend has highlighted one of a number of projects supported by the Government to restore the habitats that the country has lost over preceding decades.

 Cormorants are one of the species that have done extremely well in the past 20&nbsp;years, and their numbers have increased a great deal. The hon. Gentleman is right. Last year, after listening carefully to the views of both the RSPB and the angling community, we decided to change the licensing regime for cormorant culling because of the damage that they were inflicting on some fisheries. However, even if the maximum number of licences were issued, the cormorant population would still be far higher than it was under the Tories.

 In the UK, we recycled 3&nbsp;billion aluminium cans in 2003, including 1&nbsp;million in the Novelis plant in Latchford in my constituency. That is a huge number but, in the same year, 4&nbsp;billion cans were thrown away. Every single recycled aluminium can saves enough energy to power a television set for three hours, so we saved 600&nbsp;million kW of energy in 2003. However, we wasted a lot more. Will my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="50210-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the energy saved through recycling, which avoids the need to make new cans from raw materials.

There is a great deal more scope for improvement, and I accept the point made by my hon. Friend. I am pleased about the recycling rate for aluminium&#151;the prices are also good&#151;but there is an opportunity to do a great deal more, and the Government are committed to doing so.

 Let me be clear: I congratulate any council that has achieved and exceeded its targets. Many of the councils that the hon.

<p><a name="50210-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I understand that my hon. Friend is referring to the White Moss tip, and I appreciate the point that he makes. The White Moss tip has a licence for hazardous waste. It is monitored by the Environment Agency and I understand that action has recently been taken under the pollution prevention and control permits system in relation to odours from the site. The latest information that I have is that the issue comes from an old cell and not one of the new cells, which are engineered to very high standards and must meet the requirements of the Environment Agency and the relevant legislation. I might add that the tip always took hazardous waste and had a licence for former co-disposal. My understanding is that the owners are

<br>&nbsp;<br>currently spending &#163;100,000&nbsp;to deal with the odour problems relating to one of the cells, and that the agency is supervising that and monitoring what goes into the tip.

<p><a name="50210-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Michael Jack  (Fylde)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister may be interested to know that the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has recently received from the organisation Beyond Waste a report using official statistics to calculate that 692,000&nbsp;tonnes of hazardous waste are still unaccounted for. There is dispute about that number, but would he agree to receive a copy of that report and analyse it? Does he accept from me that correct data are required on the volumes of hazardous and toxic waste that have to be disposed of if industry is to have the confidence to make the necessary investments to provide appropriate facilities in the long term to deal with the problem?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-02_spnew16"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I certainly accept the point that the right hon. Gentleman makes. We have recently put a great deal of effort and resources into improving data capture, which is very important not only in monitoring waste flows, but in guiding our policy. I shall be only too pleased to receive the information to which he referred, and I will look at it seriously, as it is important that we are never complacent about hazardous waste management issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-02_para3">
Both the industry and DEFRA predicted a substantial fall in hazardous waste, mainly because between 60&nbsp;and 70&nbsp;per cent. of hazardous waste was contaminated topsoil. We know that there was an acceleration in the amount of topsoil going into sites before the new regulations were introduced. We also know that many sites will be developed at a later date and that many are also being remedied on site, rather than with the use of dig and dump, which is exactly the outcome that we seek. We want to limit the amount of all waste, including hazardous waste, going into landfill, and there are clear signs that the policies that we are putting in place are having that effect. The amounts are within our predictions, but I shall be only too pleased to look at the figures.

The quality of the water going into watercourses and rivers is an important matter. The Environment Agency addressed that situation, but we must have a great deal of further investigation and research into the toxic water waste from surface water on tips.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-02_spnew18"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that leachate from tips must be rigorously controlled, and that is a condition of the pollution, prevention and control permit that landfill sites must obtain. I had the pleasure of opening a reverse osmosis plant&#151;I have opened many projects&#151;to deal with leachate on a landfill site, which is an example of the rigorous standards. When a fire breaks out on a tip, the situation is an emergency and run-off is likely to occur. The Environment Agency,

<p>6. <a name="50210-03_wqn0"><b> Mr. Hugo Swire  (East Devon)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on farm incomes.  [215594]
</p>


<p><a name="50210-03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality  (Alun Michael): </b> 
 Total income from farming in the UK is estimated to have fallen in 2004&nbsp;by 5.4&nbsp;per cent. in current prices, or by 8.1&nbsp;per cent. in real terms, to &#163;3.01&nbsp;billion. Despite the recent fall, total income from farming in real terms was almost 70&nbsp;per cent. higher in 2004&nbsp;than at the low point in 2000.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Swire: </b> 
 Given that the Prime Minister is in an apologising mood, will the Minister take this opportunity to apologise to the hundreds of dairy farmers, and particularly those in the south-west, whose incomes have fallen year on year since Labour came to power? Given that the Secretary of State has consistently stated that she does not think it right or proper for the Government to get involved in negotiations on milk prices, what practical advice does the Minister have for the sector, which is suffering from a lack of Government understanding and woeful neglect?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The apology should come from the Conservative party, which neglected agriculture for decades, so I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman had the cheek to ask the question. If one examines the issues, one sees that a wide gap exists between the performance of the most and least efficient dairy farmers&#151;we concentrated on that issue at the last Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions. We have made a grant of nearly &#163;500,000&nbsp;to the Food Chain Centre to examine how to improve dairy supply chain efficiency, because we must address the issue of productivity. In the next few weeks, we will receive a report from the Office of Fair Trading on the operation of the supermarket code of practice. The hon. Gentleman should recognise that the Government are contributing to the many things that are going on.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend understands that farmers want an early sign that they will receive single farm payments. As we live in the era of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, does he agree that the figures on payments by the state to individual farm holdings should be disaggregated, so we can see that the payments are going where they are most needed and that we are getting the best return?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I agree with the principle enunciated by my hon. Friend that it should be clear that money from the public purse is achieving the intended outcomes. Because we are discussing farm incomes generally, it is worth pointing out that the upper trend in incomes since the low point in 2000&nbsp;reflects increased productivity in the farming sector&#151;labour productivity is up 18&nbsp;per cent. and total productivity is up 5&nbsp;per cent. The farming industry is tackling its own problems, and the

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1648</b>

</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew4"><b> Sir Peter Tapsell  (Louth and Horncastle)</b> 
 (Con): Bearing in mind that many Lincolnshire farmers face an acute financial crisis, will the Minister say when the new single farm payment will be made? Will it be paid at the same time as or earlier than under the old system, and will it be staggered?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman had followed the exchanges at the last Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, he would know that the single farm payment will consist of a single payment, which will be made at the front end of the window. For a variety of technical reasons, we cannot promise to do that this year, when we hope to make the payment as early as possible. We are working with the industry on the best way of making sure that farmers benefit from the move to the single farm payment and on minimising any disadvantages in moving from the old system of partial payment and supplementary payments, which was not best for farmers. The situation is getting better.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew6"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): A few days ago, I went to Cattows farm in Heather in my constituency with pupils from the local primary school to plant trees on that land. Those were some of the 6&nbsp;million trees that have been planted over the past 10&nbsp;years in the national forest largely located in my constituency. Will the Minister say a word or two about the potential of reafforestation in contributing towards a boost in farming incomes? Across north-west Leicestershire and south Derbyshire, we are seeing the fruits of what is being achieved in national forests.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises a number of interesting points in what seems a simple question. The growth of some 7&nbsp;per cent. in reafforestation makes a contribution to the income of farmers. Exercises such as that in which my hon. Friend was involved help young people to understand the importance of that, which is crucial. Of course, they also make a contribution to tackling climate change and general environmental improvement.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew8"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b> 
 (LD): The Minister has already made it clear that he is aware that many thousands of farmers on the very margins of survival are anxious to hear more news and guarantees about the timing of the single farm payment, particularly its impact on tax records and cash flow. Will he therefore give serious consideration, in his discussions with farmers, to the possibility of an up-front payment of the bulk of the estimated payment before the end of this calendar year, with payment of the residue before the end of the payment window?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew9"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 If we followed that road, we would increase the bureaucracy involved. As we have said, we want to make the single payment as early as possible, bearing in mind that very complex processes have to be gone through to achieve that. As the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question implied, no one has any doubt that in the

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1649</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>longer term, once we have bedded in these systems, making the payment up front, at the beginning of the window, will be to the benefit of farmers, and that it is worth going through the change this year. We will consider with farmers&#039; representative organisations what we can do to ease the transition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-03_para0">
The hon. Gentleman rightly says that many people, particularly farmers on the margins, are looking to the future with some trepidation. However, it is worth pointing out that, this year, the latest farm land values show an increase of 25&nbsp;per cent., with farmers buying most of it for the first time in many years. Confidence in the industry is increasing. Productivity is the big challenge. We are addressing the variations in productivity across the industry through the strategy for sustainable farming and food and the investment that we are putting in to helping the industry be more efficient and effective and to have a successful future.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew10"><b> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West)</b> 
 (Lab): Is it fair that farm income should be further boosted by raiding the taxpayers&#039; pocket again for the &#163;600&nbsp;million by which animals were overvalued during the foot and mouth epidemic? Is it not time to break the link between valuers and farmers whereby farmers can choose their own valuers, who have a perverse incentive to overvalue animals because their commission is paid as a percentage of the animals&#039; total value?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew11"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point, but compensation that has been paid has been paid; that is in the past. Furthermore, money has been withheld where there were doubts about whether the money was justified. We are sometimes criticised for not having paid out money quickly enough. We are genuinely considering the public interest and ensuring that it is protected, and there have been changes in the system as a result of the experience gained during the crisis. I understand the points that my hon. Friend makes, which have been very much taken on board in the systems that are now in place.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): I am sure that the Minister agrees that farmers&#039; incomes in future will increasingly depend on whether they can command a premium in the marketplace to exploit the high standards of production, animal welfare and environmental care. Does he therefore understand the utter frustration that the National Farmers Union, the Tenant Farmers Association and the National Beef Association express about their inability properly to exploit those advantages while the Government continue to allow food to be labelled as British when it is not?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-03_spnew13"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I am not sure whether the labelling of food is the problem. The problems and the fall in income this year are to do with lower market prices for cereals, a rise in input costs&#151;primarily, the higher world oil prices&#151;and movements in the exchange rate. There have also been lower prices for some classes of cattle and sheep. That leads to a fall in income. However, the hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that farm incomes are volatile&#151;they go up and down, year after year and are influenced by many factors. We want to ensure stability 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and sustainability in farming by increasing productivity. That will enable farmers to compete in the future and to cope with the inevitable volatility in the market.

</p>


<p><a name="50210-04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 Flood risk from rivers and the sea in both urban and rural areas is managed by the Environment Agency and other operating authorities. The Government set the overall strategic framework and provide the great majority of funding, which was projected to be &#163;570&nbsp;million per annum throughout the 2004&nbsp;spending review period.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-04_spnew0"><b> Hugh Bayley: </b> 
 I congratulate the Government on sharply increasing their contribution to flood protection. Does my hon. Friend share my concern about the Yorkshire regional flood defence committee&#039;s decision to halve local authority contributions to flood protection? Does he believe that it should think again? Will he confirm that the Government&#039;s funding for flood defences in Yorkshire will not be cut as a consequence of that short-sighted decision by local authorities?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I need to talk to my hon. Friend about the details of what is happening in his area. However, I think I may know what has happened. We have moved to a block grant for regional flood defence committees and that means that the levy that local authorities formerly provided will go down. Instead of the money from central Government being paid through local authorities, it is now paid as a block grant to the Environment Agency and the regional flood defence committees. That is a much securer method of funding, which the flood defence committees and the agency have warmly welcomed. I know that approximately &#163;1&nbsp;million has been spent in my hon. Friend&#039;s area since 2000&nbsp;on upgrading flood defences and, for example, repairing the pumps on the Foss barrier. There is a long-term commitment of &#163;30&nbsp;million for upgrading the whole catchment area. Part of that money will go to York.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-04_spnew2"><b> Miss Anne McIntosh  (Vale of York)</b> 
 (Con): The best way in which to prevent flooding on flood plains is not simply to make the Environment Agency a statutory consultee but to make its advice obligatory for local planning authorities. Does the Minister agree that it is unacceptable that, out of almost 3,000&nbsp;planning applications to which the Environment Agency objected, more than 300&nbsp;were allowed to proceed in blatant contradiction of agency advice? What is his solution?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Well, I do not think that it is banning all forms of building on flood plains, which the hon. Lady advocated when we discussed the matter previously. The number of planning applications that have gone ahead against the Environment Agency&#039;s advice has dropped to approximately 12&nbsp;per cent. That is a dramatic decline from the former position, including that under the

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1651</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>previous Administration. Some of the applications that went ahead may have been minor. She should understand that there are sometimes conflicts between planning authorities and the Environment Agency. Lincolnshire county council went to court to complain that the Environment Agency was taking too hard a stance in its planning advice. There must be a proper balance. In some cases, inappropriate development on flood plains must be turned down. In the case of appropriate developments on flood plains, the developers should make a contribution to not only defending those properties but mitigating any effect that they may have on other communities in the area.

This has been widely welcomed in the north-west, which was one of the first regions to open. We are also working to improve and maintain the existing infrastructure and to increase the range of people who have access to the countryside. We have today published the draft Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill. As set out in the rural strategy by my right hon.

 That was a rather silly question if I may say so. The hon.

We should await that, read it with interest, and Members on both sides of the House will no doubt want to focus on it as soon as it is available.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-05_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford)</b> 
 (Lab): It would help farmers and small businesses if the practice of predatory pricing by supermarkets were to be stopped. Other countries have laws preventing retailers from selling goods at lower than cost. Now that the Office of Fair Trading has said, at least in respect of alcohol, that minimum prices are not anti-competitive in some circumstances, will my right hon. Friend try to persuade the DTI to accept that in the case of our food and drink, minimum prices would be acceptable?

<p><a name="50210-05_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 What I am prepared to do is wait for the outcome of the compliance audit. That will provide us with a factual basis in order to discuss these matters further. As my hon. Friend knows, we are working, through the support of English Farming and Food Partnerships and the Food Chain Centre, to enable producers to get a fair return from the end price. I do not think that we should jump ahead of the publication of the compliance audit. We should all focus on that.

I have no objection to instruments that silently prompt the Members carrying them. Clearly, many Members use these devices and they serve a useful purpose, provided that they are unobtrusive.

 Further to the congratulations and good wishes of the Leader of the House, supported by the shadow Leader of the House, following the announcement this morning that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales will remarry, may I, as Second Church Estates Commissioner, say that the Archbishop of Canterbury has warmly welcomed the statement? The arrangements have his strong support and are consistent with the Church of England guidelines on remarriage, which the Prince of Wales fully accepts as a committed Anglican and as prospective Supreme Governor of the Church of England.

Does the Leader of the House understand that it is not good enough simply to say that the House has been kept informed? Especially after the elections, Members in all parts of the House have views on the very serious situation of what might occur with the Kurds. They have views on relations between Iraq and Iran, which, heaven knows, are delicate enough. Why are we being denied expressing those views? Bluntly, without raising the anger of MPs from Northern Ireland, to spend a day on the electoral register in Northern Ireland, yet not to discuss Iraq will be seen as very odd outside the House.

It has national significance because it will be the biggest ever encroachment on the green belt.

 I recognise the constituency point that the right hon. Gentleman raises, which my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister will note carefully. I reject the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s central charge that there is some kind of selective release of information&#151;officials advise on the release of information. In the instance of Black Wednesday, no Treasury Ministers were involved in the decision on the release of information. Indeed, the former Prime Minister, John Major, acknowledged as much on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning. The permanent secretary to the Treasury is in charge of all these matters. I am sure that, as a distinguished Secretary of State himself, the right hon.

 As you will know, Mr. Speaker, there is guidance for Members of Parliament on some important issues for us in respect of the Act. The overall point is that we introduced the Act because we believed in greater transparency and accountability of government. That is what we believe in and will stick to. Despite these day-to-day processing stories that are being raised by the Opposition, in time the workings of the Act will settle down. Some complex matters are involved such as how to protect the principle of ministerial responsibility but at the same time protect the position of officials and civil servants as well as national security and commercial confidentiality. Every request has to be judged carefully, and that we are doing with scrupulous fairness.

A strategic rail freight network is developing on the continent of Europe, and the channel tunnel is underused and in financial difficulty, while on this side, we have an inadequate railway system that does not deliver sufficient freight to the channel tunnel. We could put 30&nbsp;extra freight trains a day through the tunnel&#151;10,000&nbsp;trains a year&#151;thus making a tremendous difference to our freight industry. We could link our industrial areas directly to the continent of Europe if we had that freight delivery system.

It is undoubtedly true that there are opportunities to make greater use of the channel tunnel, which is why the Government seek to maximise those opportunities. My hon. Friend refers to the inadequate railway service, but I am sure that he will also want to welcome the huge investment that the Government are providing to improve our railway network, including for freight, and to compare it with both the dreadful situation that we inherited from the Conservatives and the cuts in rail investment that would follow as part of the &#163;35&nbsp;billion in cuts that they are promising if they win the next election.

<a name="50210-08_para3">
We need a debate on freedom of information. Of course, the Government introduced the Act, but the question is whether they did so to enable the even-handed disclosure of information or for partisan political advantage. When he says that civil servants decide such things, he should bear in mind the civil service advice that was leaked, which advised that certain aspects of the exchange rate mechanism papers should not be revealed because they might be read across and then used by the Conservatives to insist on answers to some of the questions that we have asked.

 I welcome the Government&#039;s investment in higher education.

That means it will hand out more &#163;300&nbsp;minimum-standard bursaries and have higher administration costs for those bursaries, and it has more part-time students. By comparison, Wolverhampton university will hand out five-and-a-half times as much of its additional fee income as Cambridge university. Unless the access regulator steps in to redress that, Wolverhampton university will be penalised for its success on access, and universities such as Cambridge will be rewarded for their poor access.

He makes some important points about the student catchment and intake of the university of Wolverhampton, to which the Secretary of State will want to respond, but he must also bear in mind the fact that we are bringing back grants, which were abolished by the previous Conservative Government, and which will be of enormous assistance to students going to the university of Wolverhampton and welcomed by everyone.

Far from apologising, the Prime Minister can take great credit, as now the longest-serving Labour Prime Minister, for record employment, economic stability, continuous growth, low mortgage rates, low inflation and record public investment, all of which would be put at risk if the Conservatives won the election and returned us to public spending cuts and boom and bust.

That should be taken forward with great energy because there is no dispute that it is more important to resolve in the current international situation than the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis. A secure Israel must be the outcome, with an independent Palestinian state existing alongside it in friendship, rather than anger.

If it is successful, it will go a long way to reducing the number of accidents and fatalities at the workplace, which is a vital concern for all our constituents.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-10_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I think that the Bill gets its Second Reading on 4&nbsp;March. Health and safety is important and must be paramount, and the Government have given it that position. We will obviously want to consider my hon. Friend&#039;s points carefully.

</p>





<p><a name="50210-10_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend takes a careful and studious interest in such matters. He has a point. We should find ways to have better post-legislative scrutiny and to monitor the impact of legislation. For example, it was only as a result of Back Benchers&#039; experiences of the disastrous Child Support Agency, as then configured, in their surgeries in the early 1990s that its whole operation was reviewed. It might have been better if the House had had a proper mechanism for monitoring that. We need to consider such scrutiny, perhaps in the new Parliament.

 My right hon. Friend will know that the Government intend to publish their White Paper on reform of the 14&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;curriculum in our schools and colleges in the very near future. Given the extremely long time scale that is likely to be needed for implementing the proposals and the absolute necessity to build a cross-party consensus in support of the Government&#039;s proposals, will he find time in the busy schedule over the next weeks for a full debate on the subject&#151;not just a statement from the Secretary of State&#151;as part of the process of building that all-party consensus?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-10_spnew16"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I cannot promise a debate. However, the subject is vital and the Secretary of State wants to make a statement at some point, if there is an opportunity for her to do so. Indeed, she gave an interesting presentation in Cabinet this morning about the Government&#039;s plans. Raising the skills levels of people in the British economy and focusing on improvement and reform in 14-to-19&nbsp;education is, she indicated, probably the greatest priority that our educational system faces.

 In terms of topics for debate after the recess, should not the private finance initiative take priority over Northern Ireland electoral registration? More than 10&nbsp;per cent. of GDP is tied up in such schemes. Jarvis is teetering on the edge of the financial abyss. Fourteen PFI projects are at a standstill, including London&#039;s Whittington hospital acute facilities, with HBOS plc refusing to step in. Finally, today saw the publication of Sir John Bourn&#039;s National Audit Office report on the Darent Valley hospital in Kent. It shows inflated performance scores, leading to unearned profits, and refinancing, leading to internal rates of return to The Hospital Company (Dartford) Ltd., the contractor, at 56&nbsp;per cent., which is 60&nbsp;per cent. higher than planned. Does not all that show that PFI is prohibitive in cost, flawed in concept and intolerable in consequence to the taxpayers, patients and NHS workers?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This is a serious and genuine point of order. You are a stout defender of the rights of Members of this House, and we look to you for that protection and rely on you to discharge that function, which you do. Will you reflect on whether it might help the House to make a Speaker&#039;s statement to clarify the relationship between parliamentary questions and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and in particular to rule whether they should be treated with the same force as a freedom of information request? It would be intolerable if parliamentary questions carried less weight than a request from someone outside the House.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I think it would be best if the hon. Gentleman wrote to me. I can then give the matter reasoned consideration.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, you rebuked Defence Ministers for failing to provide full and accurate answers to me, my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) and the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) about Swan Hunter. I regret to have to seek your guidance today, but a Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation will this afternoon debate the armed forces pensions appeal tribunals. Unfortunately, there is little on the face of the statutory instrument to indicate what it is all about.
</p>

<p>

</p>





<p><a name="50210-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Every hon. Member of this House has a high regard for our ex-servicemen and the organisations that represent them, including the Royal British Legion. My understanding is that the hon. Gentleman can attend the Standing Committee, and he should raise that matter with the Minister there, which will put the Minister in the position of making a reply that goes on the record.

<p><a name="50210-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Is it possible for a dilatory motion to be made in circumstances in which information provided to a Committee is misleading in such a way? Clearly, the views of the Royal British Legion on pension appeals are crucial. If they are not known, there should be a delay&#151;or at least there is an argument for a delay&#151;in that Committee&#039;s sitting. Can you give us guidance on whether that would be in order?

The motion is intended to assist the House in using the time that we have available&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps Opposition Members might wait for the punch line before they laugh. It is intended to assist the House in using the time that we have available this afternoon for consideration on Report to the best possible effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-11_para4">
We have made good progress with the Bill so far. Indeed, it was clear from the pace with which we dealt with many parts of the Bill in Committee that, in huge part, this is not highly contentious legislation. I will put before the House the evidence of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-11_para5">
The Bill has been given proper scrutiny. Indeed, in preparation for it we had a six-month public consultation exercise, starting in 2002. There was an inquiry by the Home Affairs Select Committee, starting in 2003. There was further consultation on a draft Bill in 2004. The Government responded to all those consultations in the way in which the Bill was presented to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-11_para6">
On the last sitting of the Standing Committee, on the afternoon of 27&nbsp;January, we dealt with amendments and agreed to 20&nbsp;clauses and one schedule&#151;clauses 26&nbsp;to 45&nbsp;and schedule 2. That indicates how quickly progress could have been made in large parts of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-11_para7">
After the first two sittings of the Committee, the Government proposed a timetable motion for the remaining consideration of the Bill in Committee. That was at the beginning of the fourth day on the morning of 25&nbsp;January. The motion was agreed to only after we had spent an inordinate time debating a group of two amendments to clause 8&#151;one hour and 10&nbsp;minutes on the afternoon of 20&nbsp;January followed by a further one 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1678</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hour and 35&nbsp;minutes on the morning of 25&nbsp;January. Two and three quarter hours was spent on the same group of amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-11_para8">
A group of amendments could have justified two hours and 45&nbsp;minutes, but I do not rest my case only on the time. The Chairman of the Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beard), had to intervene nine times to remind Opposition members of the Committee of the need to keep in order on the morning of the second of those two sittings alone. The debate was brought to a close when, unusually, the Chairman agreed to a motion that the Question be now put. I do not have extensive experience in the House, but I have served on a number of Standing Committees. I have never before known a Chairman of a Standing Committee to accept a motion that the Question be now put. It is clear to me that the Chairman, having intervened of his own volition on nine occasions, had no alternative but to do that.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-12_para0">
It was clear to me that, had there been a proper use of the time allotted for the Committee, we would have scrutinised every clause. I had already said that I would be happy to sit late and for there to be another Committee sitting.

Some of us find it peculiarly offensive to be told that such and such an allocation of time was provided in Committee and that members of the Committee had every opportunity to consider the Bill, and so on and so forth.

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1679</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Bill comes before the House with certain parts of it unscrutinised by the Committee. The opportunity was there for that to be done and significant progress was made on large parts of the Bill in short measure in Committee. However, a significant part of the Committee&#039;s consideration was taken away by filibustering, which was identified by the Chairman and responded to by him. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I say that because I am sure that, in opposing the motion, Opposition Members will make the point that parts of the Bill were not scrutinised by the Committee.

<a name="50210-12_para3">
To offer the opportunity for the completion of the work in Committee, the Government made the offer of additional time, an additional sitting or a late sitting, but that was not taken up. It is clear to me that, at least in part, some Opposition Members were making use of parliamentary procedures to frustrate the passage of the Bill. As a result, we had to divide the timetable today to ensure that all parts of the Bill are properly scrutinised. That is the purpose of the motion. It is a consequence of what was done in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-12_para4">
On Second Reading, the official Opposition voted in favour of the principle of the Bill. We know that the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) is in favour of ID cards. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I accept that some Opposition Members are against them. When the right hon. and learned Gentleman was Home Secretary in the last Conservative Government, some other right hon. Members who are in the Chamber were also Ministers. They were apparently in favour of them as well. They were part of that Government&#039;s programme. The right hon. and learned Gentleman remained in favour of ID cards. In an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 20&nbsp;September, he wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We must protect our citizens in every way that we can and, in my judgment, that includes ID cards.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-12_para5">
He is right. He is no doubt aware that a recent survey found that 88&nbsp;per cent. of Conservative voters support ID cards.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-12_spnew8"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 What has the fact that the Leader of the Opposition supports the Bill got to do with the timetable, which is about allowing time for Back Benchers to take part in the debate? Surely it is precisely when Back Benchers disagree with their Front Bench that parliamentary time should be generous. Given that the Leader of the House has told the House that the current hours for Thursday make it unsuitable for major legislation, will the Minister tell us why the Bill has been scheduled for a Thursday? Does it mean that the Government do not see the Bill as major legislation?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Bill has been scheduled for a Thursday because the usual channels agreed that the Bill should be presented to the House today, and I am not part of those discussions.

If the Opposition want to allow debate on the Bill, as they suggest that they do, whether from the Back Benches or the Front Bench, they should agree with the motion. Last week, the hon.

I am offering an opportunity to the House not to do that in these circumstances and to avoid the temptation of the &quot;choreographed Greek chorus&quot;.

 I always listen to the wisdom of the Father of the House and have enormous respect for his views.

 I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the programme motion, for the simple reason that it is the latest in a long line of insults to the House of Commons. We face a Government who are determined to ride roughshod over elected Members of Parliament and to get their own way at any cost. They have consistently ignored the principle of proper parliamentary scrutiny. I shall take a look at what happened in Committee in a moment but, make no mistake, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is a major Bill with major implications for the lives of all of us. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) said in a question a little while ago, it touches on the sensitive relationship between the individual and the state, so it has enormous implications for civil liberties, and it is not just about identity cards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-12_para8">
The Bill&#039;s principal purpose&#151;not understood widely outside the House&#151;is the creation of a national register or database under which people will be obliged to provide dozens of pieces of personal information to the Government register, to which many others will have access. If one does not supply that information there is a penalty&#151;some say a fine&#151;of &#163;2,500. The Bill is clearly important and has huge constitutional and civil liberties implications.

 I hope that my hon. Friend will not be seduced by the argument of the hon. Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick). We must assert the right to scrutinise legislation.

<a name="50210-13_para0">
If ever a Bill needed detailed and thorough scrutiny in Committee, this is the Bill. It did not receive it, and that was the Government&#039;s fault. I shall tell the House what the Government did. At a stage in Committee when he did not have any justification whatever for his charge, a Government Back Bencher falsely accused the Opposition of over-long speeches and filibustering. It was an absurd allegation that was utterly rejected by the Committee Chairman. Throughout our proceedings, we had kept to the point. Yes, there were long speeches, but the Minister himself made a speech in excess of one hour. I do not criticise him for doing so&#151;he was giving a lengthy, if unsatisfactory, response to points that we were making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-13_para1">
Following that absurd intervention by a Government Back Bencher, the Government introduced knives or what people outside the House would call a viciously short timetable for the rest of the Bill. As a result, whole clauses were not debated or scrutinised. Part of clause 8&nbsp;was not debated; clause 9, was not debated at all; clauses 10&nbsp;and 11&nbsp;were not debated at all; clauses 23, 24&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;were not debated at all. Those important clauses deal with the commissioner and his or her powers, as well as the provision of information about an individual without their consent. None of those clauses was debated, so they were not subject to any scrutiny. By any standards, that is a disgrace.

After the Committee&#039;s proceedings had finished, the Joint Committee on Human Rights reported. It said that the Government&#039;s identity card and register proposals raised &quot;serious questions&quot; about possible breaches of human rights and it regarded Ministers&#039; failure to explain why they believed their Bill was compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998&nbsp;as &quot;deeply unsatisfactory&quot;. I warned the Government on day one of the Committee that the Joint Committee would

One might ask whether there was a good reason for that unseemly hurry and ridiculous rush. I believe that the main motive of this utterly discredited Home Office is to secure some last-minute headlines before the general election. It wants to give the appearance of being tough, but it has completely ignored the need for proper parliamentary scrutiny of a vital Bill.

Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr.&nbsp;McNamara). The hon. Member for Walsall, North is wholly against his Government, and has as much right as any hon. Member to speak to his amendments. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) and his colleagues have tabled a number of amendments, and they have the right to speak to them.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the perverse effects of this truncated procedure is that it dissuades hon. Members from becoming interested in a Bill, as they know that they do not have an opportunity to discuss it on the Floor of the House or, indeed, in Committee?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My right hon. and learned Friend makes a good point. Increasingly, in recent years, right hon. and hon. Members have wondered what is the point of tabling an amendment or coming to the Chamber to try to debate something, as there will be a guillotine and their contribution will be cut out. That has a serious impact on parliamentary democracy.

<p><a name="50210-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 I very much agree with my hon. Friend, but I hope that he accepts that, because many Conservative Members take such comments seriously, we need a constant reminder that when we are returned to Government automatic guillotining will stop. That has not been stated with sufficient strength, and until my hon. Friend does so his comments lack moral authority.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I can only speak personally and I choose my words with care: I hope that when we are returned to Government, considerably more time will be made available for vital Bills of this sort.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 On the point that my hon. Friend so ably made about the impact on the House of Commons, does he agree that the extent to which people are concerned that they are being effectively cut out also contributes to the lack of turnout in general elections? People who witness what is happening and see that it is such an invasion of constitutional rights and civil liberties say to themselves in a state of fury, &quot;The House of Commons is impotent and decisions are taken without regard to the people we have elected.&quot; They then do not bother to turn out, so it is the destruction of democracy as well.
</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree, perhaps along with my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), that one of the best ways of ensuring that all this guillotining is not necessary is to introduce fewer Bills so that they can all be considered properly?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-13_spnew9"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right&#151;there is far too much legislation and far too little scrutiny. Today we have Report and Third Reading, and we have less time than my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) had for his private Member&#039;s Bill last Friday. I refer also to the report quoted earlier from the Select Committee on Modernisation, which mentioned restoring longer hours on Thursday to take substantial business. If this is not substantial business, I do not know what is.

<p>
<a name="50210-13_para4">
Today should be the chance for all Members of the House to express their views on the detail as well as the principle of the Bill. The Government have taken that chance away from all of us by giving us a matter of a few hours&#151;not even one full day&#151;to debate the vital issues. When times for votes are taken out, the position is even bleaker and even more unfair.
</p>

<a name="50210-13_para5">
Today, we cannot stop the Government driving a steamroller over Members of the House. Today, we cannot stop the Government showing their contempt for Parliament.

The Minister said that a Greek chorus was the appropriate metaphor for the current circumstances. I am quite a fan of Greek tragedy.

The Bill is complex and has significant technical, financial and privacy implications that cannot be covered under the programme motion before us today.

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is entirely correct and I have a lot of sympathy with his point.

<p><a name="50210-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I will not disappoint the hon. Gentleman and I am grateful to him for giving way. He made an enormous contribution to the debate in Committee, but he must tell the House that his party had two people on the Committee, only one of whom was ever present at any time.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 That is known as teamwork: we were running a relay operation. The serious point is that it is difficult for smaller parties&#151;they will speak for themselves&#151;to cover all the Committees that take place in the House, and Report remains an important part of the structure of legislation for precisely such purposes.

 That intervention was entirely helpful.

<p><a name="50210-14_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Given that most members of the public have not seen the selection of amendments for consideration today, would the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important, in order to underline the gravity of the situation and our complaint, that people should be aware that there are 150&nbsp;minutes in which to debate no fewer than 77&nbsp;new clauses and amendments? In other words, even if there were no votes, which is not realistic or desirable, there would be fewer than two minutes for the consideration of each. That is an outrage and an insult.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-14_spnew11"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those mathematical calculations. Even at the speed at which I customarily speak, it would be difficult to get through those amendments in that time.

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para0">
Briefly, I shall tell the Minister off, if I may, in my own gentle style for one point that he made in his introduction. He said that there were certain points on which we made progress in Committee. I will be completely honest: there were times when we had too little time in Committee and on other occasions people spent too long debating matters that did not need so much time. I am not going to pretend that everything in Committee worked smoothly, but the reality was that the Committee did not have sufficient time overall. There were occasions on which hon. Members such as I felt that we ought to assist in making some progress in order to get on to other things, so we did not spend as much time debating clauses as we wanted. Having tried to be co-operative and helpful, we find it a little difficult to have that thrown back at us afterwards, as if to say, &quot;You went through these clauses quickly, so everything was fine and they were non-contentious.&quot; I want to put that on the record, because it is not an entirely fair comment.

If we stick to the timetable that we have before us, hon. Members will be asked to vote&#151;I must be careful with my imagery&#151;for a pig in a poke. That is the correct metaphor to describe what we are being asked to buy: something about which we do not have sufficient detail. In my party, we do not want to buy this pig at all. We have made our position clear on the Bill. The Conservatives have explained that they do not yet know enough about the pig, and that what they have seen they do not like. I understand that they are officially planning not to vote at all. However, we will be united in voting against the programme motion, which is essential if we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 The programme motion is nearly as bad as it gets. It is not quite as bad as the instrument that the Government use to deem that a Bill has been considered, but it is close.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para2">
As the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr.&nbsp;Allan) has pointed out, the Bill is essentially an enabling Bill. It gives huge powers to the Secretary of State, but what do those powers enable him to do? The point about a pig in a poke is correct. The House has a right to examine the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para3">
The Minister takes a lofty view of Committees, which are for the convenience of the House. In years gone by, Bills were traditionally taken on the Floor of the House in order to meet the reasoned observations of hon. Members. We have all been elected and all represent a point of view.

<p><a name="50210-14_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree with this proposition: by curtailing debate, the Government are showing contempt for the views of hon. Members and, more importantly, for the views of the public, who might seek to use their representative to express their views?

<p><a name="50210-14_spnew14"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 I have spoken so often in debates on guillotine motions that I sometimes think that my remarks are explicit, when they are merely implicit. I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for yet again underlining one of the crucial reasons why we have parliamentary debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para4">
An early-day motion has been tabled to point out to hon. Members and Members of the other place how lamentable the process has been. As my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) has pointed out, the EDM lists the clauses that were not debated&#151;clauses 8&nbsp;to 11&nbsp;and 23&nbsp;to 25. Is that a mere technical matter in an enabling Bill that should not fuss us? Clause 8&nbsp;sets out the procedure for issuing identity cards. Is that a small matter and should we have the right properly to consider it? Clause 8&nbsp;concerns matters such as issuing identity cards and designating documents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para5">
Clause 11&nbsp;contains the power to require information for validating the register. It is enormously important because it is crucial to the operation of the scheme, but it has not been debated. Clause 11(1) places a duty on a person to provide information to the Secretary of State for the purposes of verifying an individual&#039;s entry on the register. Not unreasonably, we would like to discuss that duty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para6">
Clause 23&nbsp;has also not been discussed. It concerns:

Clause 23(1) states that information&#151;photographs, signature, fingerprints or other biometric information&#151;provided under clauses 19&nbsp;to 22&nbsp;may be authorised only when the Secretary of State, an omnipresent individual who wants to know everything about us,

For example, if fingerprint information were recorded on the register, the police would first have to search their own register of fingerprint records before requesting information from the register.

My hon. Friend the Member for Woking has mentioned the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Bill has been galloped through with less than 28&nbsp;hours of consideration in Committee, and we are discussing the heart of the Bill&#151;issuing ID cards, the commissioner and databases. The strongest civil liberties argument is that we have seen no detail because we are examining an enabling Bill. The Bill&#039;s vagueness, which is inappropriate, was a principal concern of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. How will the Bill affect an individual&#039;s privacy?

I do not accept that we should reduce ourselves to nothing, which is the presumption of all those Labour Members who say, &quot;Let&#039;s get on with it.

We must solemnly ask ourselves whether the procedure is right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-14_para12">
This is not a party matter. When we vote on the programme motion, which concerns the suppression of the freedom of expression of elected Members of Parliament, we should make a personal judgment. Some might say that that contradicts the purpose of the modern Parliament, because we are merely party men who must do as we are bid. We are, however, individuals who represent human beings&#151;our constituents. Should we agree to a meaningless and monstrous consideration that defeats the very purpose for which we are sent here?

<p><a name="50210-15_spnew13"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We now have no more than 18&nbsp;or 19&nbsp;minutes to discuss no fewer than 24&nbsp;amendments and three new clauses. That is a disgrace. It gives us no chance to make meaningful contributions. Is there any way that the Government could be persuaded through you to take the proceedings out of today and return on another day when we can have a proper debate? Otherwise, the proceedings are a farce.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Given the position that we now face, would it be convenient for the Chair not to use the expression, &quot;With this, it will be convenient&quot;? It is not convenient for the House; we are proceeding in the current manner because we have to. That is altogether different.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-17_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is an experienced Member of the House. I simply refer to the way in which the amendments are grouped, not the time allowed for them.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I repeat that our problem is that we now have 17&nbsp;minutes in which to get through a great deal of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1696</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>business and it simply cannot be done properly. I had intended to outline new clause 1&nbsp;at some length. In fairness, I cannot do that because other hon. Members want to make some contribution to the debate, and I shall ensure for my part that they have an opportunity to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para0">
My hon. Friends and I would very much like to divide the House on new clause 1. We have already discussed the fact that the purpose of the Bill is principally to set up the national identity register. New clause 1&nbsp;would change the existing clause 1&nbsp;in a number of respects. Under the existing clause, I shall be obliged to provide &quot;registrable facts&quot; about myself to others, so that they may check on me. I have already remarked on the vast number of registrable facts that an individual will have to provide. New clause 1&nbsp;seeks to limit that number. After all, if I am seeking to establish my identity, why on earth should I provide more than my full name, my date and place of birth, my address and my residential status?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Richard Allan  (Sheffield, Hallam) (LD):</b> 
 It would be helpful to the Liberal Democrats if the hon. Gentleman could confirm that his new clause seeks dramatically to restrict the functions of the scheme. He will be aware that we are opposed to the scheme as a whole. If he is seeking our support, we might find something that seeks to restrict it preferable to the Government&#039;s option, although that would be no indication of our support for the scheme as a whole.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman contributed significantly in Committee and I respect his views on this matter. He is right: we are seeking to place restrictions on these measures, in this brief debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para1">
The purpose of clause 1&nbsp;ought to be to establish the real purpose of the scheme. The Information Commissioner himself has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The lack of a clearly defined purpose for ID cards, including the continuing change in focus causes concern&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para2">
Having heard different arguments over the past two or three years about what the Bill is for, I believe that it is time to establish in the Bill what the card and the register are going to do, and what the purpose of the scheme is. Surely the Government should insert in the Bill the statement that its principal purpose is to assist the Secretary of State
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in the preventing or detecting terrorist acts in the United Kingdom or elsewhere or otherwise in the interests of national security&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para3">
as new clause 1&nbsp;would do. I believe that it is essential that that vital purpose should be specifically set out, although the Government appear to disagree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para4">
We have not yet been persuaded that the register and the cards will significantly contribute to reducing acts of terrorism. We also need to be persuaded that the costs involved will be worth while. Could the money be better spent elsewhere? The Information Commissioner, Mr. Thomas, also told the Home Affairs Committee:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I want to see on the face of the statute right at the outset a very clear indication of the stated purposes for this card.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>





<p><a name="50210-17_spnew4"><b> Dr. Nick Palmer  (Broxtowe) (Lab):</b> 
 The list in new clause 1(3) differs significantly from the provision in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1697</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clause 1&nbsp;only in that it omits any mention of illegal employment. Do the Opposition not care about illegal employment?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I have made it quite clear that the significant difference is that we want to insert in the Bill a reference to terrorism, which we believe is very important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para5">
I want to illustrate the uncertainty that exists among Ministers by quoting some exchanges between them and others in the past. In 2002, in answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor), the then Home Secretary said that he would not rule out the possibility of the cards making a
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;substantial contribution to countering terrorism&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3&nbsp;July 2002; Vol. 388, c. 236.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para6">
He said on a later occasion that they could make a contribution towards countering terrorism, but that it would not be their primary purpose. The hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) was taking a break from ministerial office at the time&#151;otherwise he would not have asked these questions of the then Home Secretary:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;May I ask my right hon. Friend, first, whether he accepts that it is for those who are in favour of the card to make a case for it, not the other way round? Secondly, will he confirm that the card will be little or no use in combating terrorism? Thirdly, given the unhappy history&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of Government information technology projects, are we not entitled to be sceptical about some of the claims made for the card?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para7">
The Home Secretary replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I can say yes to all three.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3&nbsp;July 2002; Vol.&nbsp;388, c. 231.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-17_para8">
So there are serious doubts on this matter.

<p><a name="50210-18_spnew0"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Government might be resistant to his new clause because they themselves do not believe that an identity card can significantly reduce the risk of terrorism?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. That could well be the case. In Committee, the Government certainly did not persuade us on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para0">
On illegal immigration, a MORI poll found that a third of the people surveyed tended to support a card because they believed that it would prevent illegal immigration. Are they right? In the few moments remaining to me, I should like to point out that all new asylum seekers&#151;the poll showed that most people were referring to asylum seekers&#151;are already issued with a biometric card, so they are already covered. What about the 250,000&nbsp;failed asylum seekers who are already in the country? How will the card help in that regard?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman have any sympathy with our amendment No. 44&nbsp;in this group? We may not get to it, but we would like to divide the House on it. In it, we seek to dissociate ID cards from passports. British passport holders are the last people we need to issue with an ID card, as they already have a secure document.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1698</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para1">
What will the card do to prevent illegal immigration? What effect will it have on the millions of people who come to this country on short-term visits of up to three months? They would not need to register or have a card. Have the Government persuaded us that the card or the register will have an effect on illegal immigration? No, they have not. Have they persuaded us that the card will have a sensible effect on identity theft or benefit fraud? No, they have not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para2">
Our other amendments are restrictive. I am concerned that the registrable facts that we shall have to supply include information about addresses at which we have previously resided in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. I have tabled amendment No. 11&nbsp;to restrict that to the previous five years. We also seek to limit the nature of information about the addresses where we have lived. We are trying to limit the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para3">
If the principal purpose of clause 1&nbsp;is to help us to prevent terrorism&#151;or if it is not&#151;the Government should say so. Our debate is uninformed unless we know that. Furthermore, we need convincing that it will do that. I am also reluctant for the state to have quite so much information from me as an individual, and the new clause seeks to restrict the information to an amount that we regard as reasonable in the circumstances.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew4"><b> David Winnick  (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I should like to speak to new clause 5. In the limited time available, I want to explain that it aims to limit the use of identity cards to dealing with terrorism or an emergency, and that it would introduce the necessity for the Government to seek parliamentary approval every year. As I have explained elsewhere, including on Second Reading, I do not accept that identity cards would help in the fight against terrorism. They would certainly have been of no assistance during the 30&nbsp;years of IRA violence and murder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para4">
Nevertheless, the Government put great emphasis&#151;more than on anything else&#151;on the view that identity cards would help in the fight against terrorism. Therefore, I believe that, if we are to have such cards, their use should be confined to terrorist outbreaks or the kind emergency that I describe in the new clause. It would then be necessary for the Government to come to the House of Commons to defend and justify their view that such an emergency was about to occur, and to seek the approval of Parliament for the use of identity cards&#151;incidentally, we have not had such cards for more than half a century&#151;and then, if Parliament gives its approval, it would do so on the basis of 12&nbsp;months. Obviously, the Government would then come back if they require a renewal of powers given by Parliament for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para5">
For all those reasons, we should confine identity cards along the lines that I have suggested. I hope that the Government will consider the matter more carefully than they have done.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew5"><b> Lynne Jones  (Birmingham, Selly Oak) (Lab):</b> 
 Is my hon. Friend concerned that the Government have made no response available to hon. Members to the concerns raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights about the human rights aspects of the Bill?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew6"><b> David Winnick: </b> 
 That was mentioned in the debate on the programme motion. That is unfortunate, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1699</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>perhaps the Minister will refer to it on Third Reading. The criticism that has been made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights is very important. I do not want to appear in any way immodest, but in some respects, it draws on some of the matters raised in the minority report of the Home Affairs Committee, which I recommend, with due modesty, that some Members read, even if the footnotes were not included as they should have been.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 Read out the report.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew8"><b> David Winnick: </b> 
 I will resist that temptation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para6">
My other amendment relates to public services. In effect, my argument is that it should not be necessary for those seeking hospital treatment or access to other public services to produce an ID card. At Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time yesterday, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston), who is a supporter of identity cards, said nevertheless that people do not want a society in which the response is, &quot;Where&#039;s your papers?&quot; Neither do I, although it would be, &quot;Where&#039;s your identity card?&quot; There are already enough checks on people coming along for registration or treatment at a GP surgery or hospital. It would be an undesirable state of affairs in which the first inevitable question asked of a new patient at a GP&#039;s premises or hospital is, &quot;Can you show me your identity card?&quot; That is what will occur if the measure is passed without amendment.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew9"><b> Mr. John Taylor  (Solihull) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is addressing the question of producing an identity card in anticipation of public services. Would he take note of my recent experience buying a new motor car last autumn when the dealer required me to produce my passport? I suggest that the application of identity cards would not be confined to public service but might also become widespread in private sector transactions.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew10"><b> David Winnick: </b> 
 I note that point, but the hon. Gentleman satisfied the motor car dealer by producing his passport. If he did not have a passport, he would no doubt produce other evidence. There is all the difference between that sort of evidence, which we all carry on us, and an identity card. That relates to the debate on Second Reading.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr. Desmond Browne): </b> 
 Is my hon. Friend aware that the Government&#039;s reply to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights is available in the Vote Office?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew11"><b> David Winnick: </b> 
 That is useful.

</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew13"><b> David Winnick: </b> 
 Perhaps it is restricted, but it will not be after the Minister&#039;s intervention. If the Government have responded in a positive way&#151;I have not read it&#151;that would be very encouraging.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew14"><b> Mr. Allan: </b>

<a name="50210-18_para7">
Amendments Nos. 42&nbsp;and 43&nbsp;would restrict the amount of historic address information. That came up in Committee, and we did not receive a satisfactory answer. We want to ensure that any address information is necessary and proportionate to that which is sought to be achieved, and we are not yet clear what the bounds of that are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-18_para8">
Amendments Nos. 44&nbsp;and 45&nbsp;are important, particularly amendment No. 44, which has cross-party support and on which we would seek to divide the House, as it is intended to break the link between applications for passports and ID cards. The Committee pointed out that assigning ID cards to those who apply for passports is a fairly arbitrary method. Those who have passports are the very category who do not need ID cards. Therefore, we would seek to make the scheme genuinely voluntary by breaking that link. I hope that hon. Members will support the amendment on that basis. If the Government want compulsion later, they can use clause 6&nbsp;powers to introduce compulsion in a much more open and transparent way, rather than using the passport system.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-18_spnew15"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Does not the House see that the Minister has not had a chance to answer any of these points, which shows that we are once again held in contempt?

<p><a name="50210-20_spnew1"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I want to make it clear that the letter in response to questions from the Joint Committee on Human Rights was available in the Vote Office, but that the staff there did not seem to understand that that was what was being requested. However, the Committee asked for a reply by 7&nbsp;February and said that it would consider the response and report back. There has been no opportunity for the Committee to report back on the Government&#039;s response.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-20_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 That is not really a matter for the Chair, but the point made by the hon. Lady is now on the record.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I ask you to indicate&#151;or the Minister, through you&#151;what opportunity it is felt that hon. Members have to consider their response to the Joint Committee report before we continue our debate?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-20_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 That is not a point of order for the Chair at this stage. All the official documents necessary for dealing with the debate should, of course, be available to the House. That matter has been raised before, and I trust that the documents have been made available.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek your guidance. Is it not important for us to know exactly when the Government&#039;s response to the Joint Committee&#039;s report was deposited in the Vote Office? If information is supposed to be available before the debate, surely considerations of reasonableness must apply? Did the Government intend to put the response in the Vote Office only today? Was that an insult, incompetence, or a combination of the two? I think that we ought to be told.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050210/debtext/50210-21.htm"/>




<p><a name="50210-21_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 That is not a matter with which I can deal precisely at this time. I repeat what I said earlier&#151;that all Government documents necessary for the debate ought to be available to all hon. Members before the debate starts. I think that we should now proceed, as time is limited today.

<p><a name="50210-21_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 No, we have dealt sufficiently with that matter for the time being. If the Government have not done something that they should have done, that will obviously be looked at later.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I should be extremely grateful if, at the end of this debate, we can have Divisions on new clause 4&nbsp;and amendment No. 26. I shall speak to the latter in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para0">
The debate has been under way for a little while, and it is time for me to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow). On Second 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1706</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Reading, he had something to say about the commissioner. I pause only to remind the House that clause 24&nbsp;was not debated at all in Standing Committee, even though it is the vital clause that deals with the appointment of the national identity scheme commissioner. Neither was clause 25&nbsp;debated in Committee, but on Second Reading my hon. Friend very properly expressed his disappointment that the Bill made it clear that the commissioner&#039;s report
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;can, and probably will, be doctored by the Secretary of State before being presented to Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para1">
He went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Does that not underline our anxiety that the commissioner will prove to be but a craven lickspittle of the Government?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para2">
He was right to draw our attention to that issue. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) said that he had
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a prejudice in favour of the commissioner reporting to the House rather than to the Government&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24&nbsp;December 2004, Vol.428, c. 1958.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para3">
What is the effect of my new clause and the associated amendments? Clause 25&nbsp;provides that the commissioner must make a report to the Secretary of State about the carrying out of his functions. Clause 25(3) states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Secretary of State must lay before Parliament a copy of every annual report made to him under subsection (1).&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<a name="50210-21_para4">
So far, so good. However, the tricky bit comes next. Clause 25(4) states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;If it appears to the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Commissioner, that the publication of a particular matter contained in an annual report &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would be prejudicial to national security,&quot;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="50210-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 My right hon. and learned Friend is right. I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but the clause seems to give the Secretary of State the power to say, &quot;I don&#039;t want Parliament to know about this bit of the report. I don&#039;t have to justify it on grounds of national security. I can catch this point under any of these little subsections.&quot; Frankly, I am not happy about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para9">
New clause 4&nbsp;offers a different way to proceed that would avoid the House getting a watered-down report. As a general proposition, it is impossible to review the Secretary of State&#039;s actions independently and properly if the commissioner&#039;s reports to Parliament are filtered by him. For that reason, the new clause would establish an alternative scrutiny mechanism under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. New clause 4(2) identifies the

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1707</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>commissioner as a public authority under that legislation, and there is no obvious dispute about that. Proposed new subsection (3) would disapply the exemption in the 2000&nbsp;Act relating to the formulation of Government policy, as well as the prejudice to effective conduct by public affairs. It means that legal advice in relation to human rights and the ID card could be accessible to people who request it. The reason for that is that the Government, as the Joint Committee has shown, cannot be trusted on human rights issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para10">
New clause 4(4) would remove the absolute national security exemption, mainly because the service has, for example, secret access to details on the register under paragraph 9&nbsp;of schedule 1. I commend the House to examine that paragraph.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-21_para11">
My proposed change would not jeopardise national security, as the 2000&nbsp;Act contains an additional, non-absolute national security exemption that can be used case by case. In short, new clause 4&nbsp;would set up a new mechanism that would allow the House of Commons to have access to some information to which it would not have access otherwise but which may be very important. There is no intention to jeopardise national security, to which the new clause poses no threat. All we seek is a method whereby more information can be made available to parliamentarians.

There is a further minor amendment. In Committee we debated the cost of the scheme as much as we could&#151;we were heavily curtailed&#151;but never received a satisfactory answer. One of my amendments in Committee, which is now amendment No. 24, relates to the appointment of the national identity scheme commissioner. Clause 24(6) requires the Secretary of State to

I pause only to say that at no stage have we been reassured about how many members of staff would be employed by the commissioner.

The answer is simple&#151;it would be helpful when looking at the cost of the whole scheme to know what the cost of the commissioner and his staff will be. At the end of the day, someone must pay. There was an exchange in Committee when the Minister said that the issue had very little to do with taxpayers&#039; money because the burden would be on the individual to pay for the service&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, if I have misquoted him, he will put me right, because he will have a chance today to speak to the House.

 When my hon. Friend the Minister replies to this group of amendments, will he explain how and in what way the commissioner will have the power to protect the rights of the individual? The hon. Member for Woking (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malins) touched on that. If information on the register is inaccurate and wrong, or if the register is in some way abused, how will our constituents seek redress? I cannot see in these clauses that the commissioner has specific powers to act as a tribunal and guardian of individuals&#039; rights. Should our constituents appeal to the commissioner, either through us or in their own right, and what could the commissioner do to put the matter right?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para0">
I suspect that every hon. Member has had constituents who have found that their credit rating is incorrect. A couple of years ago, one of my constituents had that problem and although the credit card company recognised and eventually admitted that its information was wrong and my constituent should not have been denied a credit rating, it took me nine months and unending correspondence to get it corrected. If that happens with a relatively small commercial data bank, how will constituents obtain redress and correct information? Surely, we must have a fast-track method of appeal to the commissioner, or to someone else, to have such information corrected. Otherwise, there will be absolutely no confidence in the scheme.

<p><a name="50210-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Does the hon.

</p>





<p><a name="50210-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Fisher: </b> 
 I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman. He is addressing&#151;correctly&#151;the strategic macro point, but I do not want to lose my micro point about individuals. Whatever the virtues of the scheme, it will be completely discredited if it is seen to abuse the rights of individuals and people will not have confidence in it. In a scheme of this scale, which requires individuals to submit 56&nbsp;pieces of information, things are bound to go wrong and there must be a fast-track procedure to put them right.

 I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern from past experience of things going wrong.

That register involved just names, addresses and locations of people, not the wealth of information that the national identity scheme will require.

 I am pleased that this group of amendments has been tabled, as it is an opportunity to explore at more leisure than we had on the previous group whether the commissioner will be any more than a fig leaf to cover the Government&#039;s embarrassment or genuinely an organisation or individual who will be a fearless champion for the citizen. That is what we are interested in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para1">
When discussing these issues we must remember why an individual might want to go to the commissioner. What might have happened to them? They may be seeking redress for a range of serious circumstances. We know that the cards will be used for public services. A person may have had all kinds of hassle accessing a public service; they may have found it difficult to obtain health care or education. Those are serious matters for an individual. The person may have been falsely arrested and have had problems with the criminal justice system. We have seen how errors in the Criminal Records Bureau system have led to individual cases of hardship, where a person has been denied a job because a record is fake or has been falsely matched. We must be aware that people could be seeking redress for serious circumstances.

 On cue! The hon. Gentleman knows my theme&#151;about needing a passport to acquire a new car. He was talking about accessing public services with the aid of an identity card. Would he care, just for a moment, to speculate on how widely the use of an identity card might be made necessary in private sector transactions?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-22_spnew7"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is correct. A typical circumstance that someone may take to the commissioner is that in a financial transaction a bank has denied them access to financial services or they have been hauled up on suspicion of doing something they had not done, because the identity card checking process has gone wrong somehow, as it will do in some cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para3">
In Committee, we discussed the fact that there will be a trickle-down effect. Banks will be offered a voluntary service for checking people against the identity register and will be charged for that service. That is in the Bill. But then the Government could come along with money-laundering regulations that will make the process mandatory if the banks want to be in the clear under those regulations. There will be a trickle-down effect; the ID card could come into play for a huge range of everyday transactions, for all of which people might want to go to the identity commissioner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para4">
We must take the amendments seriously. They try to remove some of the restrictions that the Government have&nbsp;placed on the ability of the commissioner to carry out his or her work. Governments increasingly like commissioners for all sorts of things. We have seen how some of them&#151;for example, the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, and the data protection commissioner, Elizabeth France before him&#151;can build 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1711</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their roles and perform a good function. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards performs an effective function. The measure of that is the extent to which commissioners can criticise Ministers and the Government, on a serious and well-founded basis, and have that criticism accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para5">
Well-functioning commissioners have an important role in making criticisms of particular instances and in drawing lessons from them to show why the system is flawed. That is what we want the identity commissioner to be able to do. If, as we fear, the identity card system contains serious flaws, we want the commissioner genuinely to be able to highlight them and bring them to Parliament so that we can hold an informed debate and either scrap the scheme or change it, depending on the depth of concern. Our fear is that unless we accept some of the amendments or the Government make their own proposals to strengthen the commissioner&#039;s hand, the commissioner will be too weak.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para6">
The Government, like previous Governments, have been desperately keen to avoid judicial review of anything that they do. It now seems to be built into legislation&#151;Ministers do not like being hauled up before the courts and told that their legislation is poor. I suspect that the commissioner process is part of that. The Government hope that the commissioner will deflect some of the criticisms that might otherwise come through the courts and be directed at a Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-22_para7">
I fear that the proposed commissioner system will still leave citizens having to take the judicial review route, which is much less satisfactory than being able to put the case to the commissioner, particularly in respect of the exclusion applied to the commissioner looking at the way that fines are levied. As we understand it, the Secretary of State, almost personally, will be taking people to court. The Secretary of State will take people to the county court saying, &quot;You owe me &#163;1,000&nbsp;because you didn&#039;t register. You didn&#039;t notify your change of details or do x, y or z.&quot; The county court could send the bailiffs round if a person did not pay up. The Government are trying to avoid poll tax martyrs, so they have set up a complicated civil recovery scheme, yet the commissioner, unless the clause is amended, will have no power to look into that system.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to that point. We received no explanation whatever in Committee because the clause was not debated; it just passed through. We had no opportunity to go into the detail of how the process would work.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para0">
I think that plays to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. If the functioning of the identity card scheme would be damaged by publishing criticism of the scheme, we shall not criticise it. The law as currently drafted would seem to permit the Secretary of State to do that. If the Government have something to be embarrassed about, if they have dirty washing, let us have it out in public. What is the point of having a commissioner if they are not able to do that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para1">
Unless the clause is amended, sadly, we shall have a fig leaf commissioner rather than, as I want to see, a fearless champion of the citizen. There will be a spill-over. If people cannot obtain satisfaction from the commissioner, there will be judicial review. The case will go to the parliamentary commissioner, the ombudsman, instead of to the identity commissioner. People will bypass the process. For example, if the problem was with the health service, they would go to the health service commissioner. We run the risk of creating a real mess and that is not satisfactory from the citizen&#039;s point of view.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the great advantage of new clause 4&nbsp;is that it makes information available to the citizen, on the back of which the citizen can go to the court for judicial review if he feels that the Secretary of State has acted unreasonably?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is entirely correct about the citizen having access to information. There are other examples of the kind of harm we are talking about. Something may have happened to the system that meant that a citizen was denied entry to another country. They may have spent several thousand pounds to somewhere, but then have immediately been flown home again. That would be a serious incident in anyone&#039;s life. If that occurs, they must be able to obtain information about what went wrong. If there is any suggestion of blanket coverage, if the individual was told for example, that it was an agreement between the UK and the United States authorities covered by terribly secret terrorism provisions, when they were merely going on holiday to Disneyworld, that would not be satisfactory in terms of the citizen&#039;s ability to obtain redress. I question the point of having a commissioner if they were unable to expose that type of information. I hope that the citizen could go to the commissioner and say, &quot;I turned up at Orlando airport and they sent me back. They said it was something that came out of the identity system that we are all part of now.&quot; I hope that the commissioner could say, &quot;Right, I&#039;m going to get on with that. We will take the case through whatever process we need to get the redress that you are after.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para2">
My fear is that the citizen will meet a blank wall and the commissioner will not offer such satisfaction. I hope that the Minister, in the time available to him, will be able to offer some more assurances. I suspect that this is one of the issues that will have to be picked up at greater length in the Committee proceedings down the corridor 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1713</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the Lords, where they often do have sufficient time to consider such things.

<a name="50210-23_time0"><h5>3.30&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50210-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 I shall be brief, because this is a time-limited debate. I shall confine myself to three points. First, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) made an important point. It is certain that errors will be made with regard to individuals. One of the problems about the Bill is that the individual will not be well placed, perhaps not placed at all, to identify the fact of an error or to challenge it. The advantage of the proposal made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) is that it will make it possible for a citizen, using the procedure set out in new clause 4, to identify errors of fact made in relation to them. Once an error of fact has been identified, corrective action is possible. I say to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central that new clause 4&nbsp;goes directly to the anxiety that he has properly expressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para3">
Secondly, looking at the wide powers set out in clause 25(4), one has to accept that, in reality, they give the Secretary of State of the day the power to amend at will the report of the commissioner. Phrases such as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;would be otherwise contrary to the public interest,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para4">
and
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;prejudicial to &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the continued discharge of the functions of any public authority&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para5">
are so wide that there are few Secretaries of State who could not bring their own prejudices within the parameters of those phrases. And of course the discharge of that amending function is not reviewable, which takes one back to new clause 4. If new clause 4&nbsp;is accepted, individuals&#151;whether they be Members of this House or someone else&#151;will be able to say, having obtained that information, that the exclusion of material from the commissioner&#039;s report is unreasonable and does not fall within the language of this Bill and either raise it as a parliamentary matter or seek judicial review of it. That is particularly important when one reflects that the commissioner might well wish to use his annual report as a vehicle for criticising the Government&#039;s use of the scheme. It would be intolerable if the Secretary of State was able, by using the language of clause 25(4), to delete that criticism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para6">
My final point is that my own preference, and one that I commend to the House, and through this House to the other place, is the approach recommended by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, namely, to approve new clause 4&nbsp;or something like it and to amend the language of clause 25(4) broadly in terms of amendment No. 38, which is in this group, so as to remove the offensively wide language on which I have addressed the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para7">
As time is pressing, that is all that I wish to say, although were time not so limited, I would wish to say a lot more.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I rise to oppose the new clause and amendments to speak to amendment No. 56, which I think, when I explain it, will give some significant

<br>&nbsp;<br>comfort to hon. Members, especially those who espouse the provisions of new clause 4. Amendment No. 56&nbsp;in substantial measure covers exactly the same ground as new clause 4, although there are qualifications, which I shall come to in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para8">
Before I deal with the new clause and amendments and the questions that I have been asked&#151;to the extent that I am able to answer them&#151;it is important that I put on record the position in relation to the Government&#039;s response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights report. I am disappointed at the way in which hon. Members have implied in the House that the Government were dilatory or that there was some attempt not to make the information available to Members of the House at the earliest possible opportunity. I might say that those observations were made to some degree in bad faith because no one asked me about the matter at any point or made any inquiries about the true circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-23_para9">
The fact of the matter is that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) is correct.

That permission was given yesterday, and the letter was deposited in the Vote Office before 10&nbsp;o&#039;clock this morning. Nothing could have been done in any sense any quicker, and I do not think that there can be any criticism of the way in which the Government and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary have acted in relation to this issue.

<p><a name="50210-24_spnew0"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 The Committee set the date of 7&nbsp;February, but it would not have been aware that we would debate the Bill on Report so soon. Obviously, the Committee has not been given sufficient time to report to the House about whether it considers the Home Secretary&#039;s response satisfactory.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. All those observations are truisms, but the workings of the Joint Committee on Human Rights are matters entirely for the members of the Joint Committee, and the timetable for their work and the priority that they give to their work are matters entirely for them. The Bill has been published in draft form&#151;substantially the same form as at present&#151;for some months now. I make no criticism of the members of that Committee. Indeed, I was a member of it at one stage 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1715</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and served with some members of the current Committee for whom I have the greatest regard. However, it cannot be a criticism of the Government that a Committee of the House adopted a certain timetable&#151;that is the only point that I make.

<p><a name="50210-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I will give way to the hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), since I understand that he is a member of the Joint Committee.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 I am a member of the Joint Committee. Of course, the drumbeat of Home Office legislation that touches on human rights matters is so great that we are running behind the Government. That is the difficulty that this huge volume of legislation places on us, as well the constraints that lie within it. It is in the Government&#039;s gift to make reasonable the passage of Bills and the deliberation of Select Committees. That is all this is about.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say, but I remind the House that, before the Government&#039;s incorporation of the European convention on human rights into the law of this land, there was probably no need in the House for the Joint Committee on Humans Rights.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 I am afraid that that simply will not do. I have the very highest regard for the Minister&#039;s ability, as he knows. Moreover, I do not on a daily basis make partisan points for the sake of it&#151;when the Government are right, I am quite happy to say so&#151;but what we have just heard in relation to this matter from the Minister is a very shabby piece of buck-passing. No hon. Member on the Floor of the House is suggesting for one moment that the timetable for the activities of the Joint Committee, or those of any other Committee, should properly be a matter for the Minister. Does the Minister not accept that one is entitled to say that the Government should operate on a joined-up basis? If the Minister did not know what the Whips Office had in mind when scheduling the Bill&#039;s consideration on Report and Third Reading, he certainly should have done. It should have been his priority to do everything that he could to ensure that the Joint Committee&#039;s report was available for consideration by Members well before today&#039;s debate.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I do not want this to turn into a mutual admiration society, but I have great regard for the hon. Gentleman, too, although he is perhaps inflating the debate on this issue slightly. The report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights has been available to hon. Members for some time. Nothing that the Government have done has interfered in any way with hon. Members&#039; ability to access the report. I thought that I would be able to cover this matter in a few minutes, but it has turned into a mini-debate of its own. However, hon. Members will agree that some comments that were made strongly implied that the Government delayed 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1716</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their response to the report and produced it at the last minute. I was merely pointing out that the Government responded within the Joint Committee&#039;s requested timetable&#151;albeit one day out&#151;and that a further day&#039;s delay was required before the Joint Committee gave permission for the letter to be placed in the Vote Office.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew9"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I never attribute bad faith to the Minister&#151;quite the reverse&#151;but now is the time for frankness. Does he think that it would have been helpful to the Standing Committee if it had had the benefit of the report during its deliberations? Does he also think that all hon. Members would have benefited if the Government had produced their report a little earlier? I am sure that he will be frank and say yes.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew10"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I will be frank and say yes. It would be nonsensical to say anything but that that would have been helpful. I am merely explaining to the House how events arose because although there was a clear implication that timings were manipulated, they were not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-24_para0">
In the few minutes that remain, may I try to reassure hon. Members who want to be satisfied that the Government intend the commissioner to work with teeth and be a formidable person? The Government&#039;s response to the report of the Home Affairs Committee made it clear that we accepted the recommendation that the national identity scheme commissioner should have a broader oversight of the whole scheme, which is provided for by clauses 24&nbsp;and 25. The commissioner&#039;s remit will thus include examining the uses to which ID cards are put, the dealings of all recipients of information held on the register and the administration of the issuing of cards.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew11"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 Will the Minister specify the relationship of the commissioner with the Scottish Parliament and its Committees?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew12"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The commissioner will have no relationship with the Scottish Parliament and its Committees under the Bill&#039;s structure because we are not considering a devolved matter. There would be no reason for the commissioner to have a direct relationship with the Scottish Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew13"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 The Minister said that one aspect of the commissioner&#039;s remit will be examining the uses to which identity cards are put. Many of the uses to which they will be put in England will not be those to which they will be put in Scotland. How can the Minister maintain that that is of no relevance to the Scottish Parliament and its Committees?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-24_spnew14"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I am not suggesting that the commissioner&#039;s actions will be of no relevance to the Scottish Parliament and its Committees. The hon. Gentleman asked me a specific question to which I gave a specific answer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-24_para1">
Hon. Members posed questions about the commissioner&#039;s ability to listen to specific complaints. The commissioner will of course be able to listen to specific complaints and will have a strong advisory role to the Secretary of State. I understand that there is a clear and established process if there are errors in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1717</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>issuing of driving licences, which eventually ends with the possibility of judicial review, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) pointed out. The commissioner will be able to take individual complaints from people who are affected by the process and from people whose attempts to correct information on the register were not successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-24_para2">
New clause 4&nbsp;relates to the status of reports and information from the national identity scheme commissioner in respect of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The most important aspect of the new clause is that subsection (2) would make the commissioner a public authority under that Act. Schedule 1&nbsp;of the Freedom of Information Act lists all public authorities for the purpose of the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-24_para3">
I am grateful to Opposition Members for raising that. They are no doubt aware that it is not strictly necessary for the Bill to be amended because it is possible to add to the list of public authorities by order. The Government could do that later, which was our intention. However, as dealing with that important issue in the Bill has merit, I accordingly tabled Government amendment No. 56&nbsp;to do just that. I must, however, reject subsections (3) and (4) of the new clause which relate to Freedom of Information Act exemptions for the formulation of Government policy&#151;

<center>Disclosure from the Register: Unlawful Activities</center><br>


<p></p>




<br>

<br>
&#039;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section shall have effect in relation to any disclosure from the Register which is authorised by provisions in sections 19&nbsp;to 23.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be unlawful for any person who obtains information about an individual from the Register to retain copies of that information for the purpose of duplicating the Register or part of the Register.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be unlawful for any person who obtains information about a particular individual from the Register to disclose that information about that individual to another public authority unless an entry relating to that disclosure is recorded in the Register for that individual.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be unlawful for any person who obtains information about a particular individual from the Register to disclose that information about that individual to another person for his (the second person&#039;s) purpose where the other person is not authorised to obtain that information directly from the Register.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;connected with&quot; shall not be construed as meaning that the connection with a particular event is remote or unlikely, but to the contrary, that the connection with an event is significant or that failure to obtain the information from the Register could prejudice an investigation into that event.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase &quot;in the interests of national security&quot; shall be construed as meaning that failure to obtain the information from the Register would cause prejudice to the objective of safeguarding national security.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who obtains information from the Register shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any obtaining, use or disclosure of the information is consistent with the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42).&#039;.&#151;<i>[Patrick Mercer.]</i>

&#039;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State must not make any regulations under this section unless a draft of such regulations has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.&#039;.
<br>



<p><a name="50210-26_spnew1"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am conscious that we have a lot to get through in a very short space of time. Certainly, Conservative Members feel that we did not have enough time to cover as many clauses as we would have liked in Committee, where we constantly ran out of time, although I hope that I spoke with great brevity. I will try to do so again today, so that Members who are interested in speaking to their amendments in the available 15&nbsp;minutes or so will have the opportunity to take part in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para1">
I will speak briefly to new clause 3, as well as amendments Nos. 30&nbsp;to 32. It is designed to address the issue of disclosure from the register in terms of unlawful activities. First and foremost, I am extremely concerned about the wide powers in clause 19(1), which, to remind the House, says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Secretary of State may, without the individual&#039;s consent, provide a person with information recorded in an individual&#039;s entry in the Register if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the provision of the information is authorised by this section; and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there is compliance with any requirements imposed by or under section 23&nbsp;in relation to the provision of the information.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para2">
I am concerned about such wide powers to disclose information held on the register without the consent of registered individuals. The range of eligible authorities under clause 19(2)&#151;the director general of the Security Service, the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters and the director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency&#151;means that far too wide a register of individuals can be concerned with this. Moreover, the test on what information can be disclosed to such bodies&#151;in other words, &quot;for purposes connected with&quot;&#151;is insufficient. That is why new clause 3&nbsp;would provide that the
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;term &#039;connected with&#039; shall not be construed as meaning that the connection with a particular event is remote or unlikely, but to the contrary, that the connection with an event is significant or that failure to obtain the information from the Register could prejudice an investigation into that event.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="50210-26_time0"><h5>4.15&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para3">
Similarly, the authorisation to disclose information that does not fall within paragraph 9&nbsp;of schedule 1&nbsp;to a chief officer of police for the prevention and detection of crime under clause 19(4) is far too wide. I shall not bore hon. Members by talking about that in great detail except to underline that subsection (4) specifies
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in the interests of national security&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para4">
New clause 3&nbsp;tries to redefine that by stating:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The phrase &#039;in the interests of national security&#039; shall be construed as meaning that failure to obtain the information from the Register would cause prejudice to the objective of safeguarding national security.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1725</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para5">
I am concerned that the police could conceivably have information routinely disclosed through the powers of the clause. I also view the disclosure of information that does not fall within paragraph 9&nbsp;of schedule 1&nbsp;to a prescribed Department
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;for purposes connected with the carrying out of any prescribed functions of that department or of a Minister in charge of it&quot;</p>

in clause 19(5) as not tight enough. The provisions need to be much more clearly focused and new clause 3&nbsp;achieves that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para7">
I am worried about the powers of disclosure in clause 21(2), which would allow disclosure to a person who provides &quot;inaccurate or incomplete information&quot; of the discrepancies between it and the information recorded on the register. Regardless of whether the person who provides the information is an individual who represents himself or herself to an organisation for entitlement or an organisation that requests information to check against what an individual provides, disclosing the discrepancies would be most unwise.

<a name="50210-26_para8">
The seventh data protection principle requires data controllers to take appropriate technical and organisational measures against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss, destruction or damage to personal data. Given the importance of the national register and its security and the number of linking organisations, that will be tremendously difficult and technical. Above all, the managerial task, which includes staff vetting, and dealing with the rules and different cultures across the many organisations, will be difficult. To ensure that the principle is met, there should be clear information for users about how their data will be used, processed and transferred. We need unambiguous consent&#151;that is essential&#151;and I believe that new clause 3&nbsp;would cover that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-26_para9">
I am concerned about the extended powers of disclosure without consent in clause 22. Previous clauses provide an extensive list of personnel, some of whom we have covered, who may get access to an individual&#039;s information. However, clause 22&nbsp;provides the Home Secretary with an opportunity to add people and purposes by order. Again, it is far too slackly defined and bestows far too much power.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important in highlighting to the public the scope and dangers of the Bill that we should underline what secondary legislation means? As my hon. Friend well knows, it means that, subsequently, the Government will set up delegated legislation Committees to sit upstairs and consider proposed extensions of power for an hour and a half at most. The Government are contemplating that, and they hope that the public will either not notice or understand and cannot therefore complain.

 As usual, my hon. Friend makes a clear and unambiguous point, which we are trying to achieve in new clause 3. We made that point consistently in Committee. I hope that the Government have listened, but I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point. If we try to tighten the clause and explain it in unambiguous language, we will get some way towards tackling my hon.

I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 30, 31&nbsp;and 32, which deal with the rules for using information without an individual&#039;s consent. Amendment No. 30&nbsp;would substitute the word &quot;possible&quot; for &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; in clause 23(1). Amendment No. 32&nbsp;would delete clause 23(3)(c), and amendment No. 31&nbsp;would add to the clause the sentence:

New clause 3&nbsp;and our other amendments in this group would considerably clarify what is going on, and considerably narrow the scope of the provisions, making them much less likely to be abused.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I rise to speak to new clause 6&nbsp;and amendments Nos. 46&nbsp;and 47. I shall deal with the amendments briefly, because Government amendments Nos. 54&nbsp;and 55&nbsp;seem to deal with the issues involved, which came out of our considerations in Committee. Amendment No. 46&nbsp;identifies a particular kind of data that Committee veterans will know as &quot;schedule 1, paragraph 9&nbsp;data&quot;. These are the audit data, the trial of information on every time the national identity database has been checked. Significant invasions of privacy could occur as a result of its use, because it could be shown that someone had accessed a public service in a particular place, or been abroad at a certain time, for example. The gathering of this kind of data is most intrusive, and I am pleased that amendment No. 54&nbsp;seems to accept that it should not be available to be given out under the powers in clause 22.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-27_para3">
Amendment No. 47&nbsp;was important. I asked the Minister in Committee whether he could introduce an order under clause 22&nbsp;to allow the FBI, Europol or any other external, foreign agency access to the entirety of our national identity database without our consent. He replied in his usual forthright manner that, yes, the existing wording would allow that. I hope that he will now confirm that amendment No. 55&#151;which changes the word &quot;person&quot; to &quot;public authority&quot;&#151;will achieve what we were trying to achieve, namely, that the authority in question would have to be a UK public authority. People are interested to know who will be using the national identity register database, and their legitimate concerns are motivated not by xenophobia but by an interest in whether the bodies that will have access to the data will be accountable under the British constitution and jurisdiction, or whether the provision will extend to external bodies. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify what is meant by &quot;public authority&quot;.

<a name="50210-27_para4">
New clause 6&nbsp;merits a much longer debate, but I shall spend just a few minutes on it now. It springs from a question that arose in my mind as I was reading <i>Jane&#039;s Police Review&#151;</i>my normal bedtime reading&#151;which is a police product review that describes the products that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1727</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are available to the police. It talks about the use of biometric technology in combination with technology such as closed-circuit TV cameras. This country has more CCTV cameras per head of population than anywhere else. There are 4&nbsp;million of them out there, and they have their uses. However, one use to which they had not been able to be put, because the technology was not there, was the real-time monitoring of people as they go round the streets. They are used for evidence gathering and deterrence, but if we were to move to such monitoring, it would be a significant change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-27_para5">
Tim Lott writes in the <i>Evening Standard</i> tonight:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;For most of us, liberty is a <i>feeling</i> rather than the difference between jail and freedom&#151;but it is a feeling I value tremendously. The idea of being able to go about my private business without being stopped by a policeman, or observed by a secret camera, strikes me as something many of us so take for granted that we can&#039;t imagine what it would be like to lose it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-27_para6">
That is at the heart of this issue: the idea that we could be monitored everywhere we went changes the feeling that we have as we go about our business. We are trying to test that in our proposals, and to understand whether the protections that Parliament has rightly put in place&#151;including the legal safeguards under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which establish who authorises any surveillance, what suspicion has to be shown, and what thresholds apply&#151;will apply under the new regime if the Government have their way. Questioning that is justified<i>. Jane&#039;s Police Review</i> provides some lovely quotes&#151;for example:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The co-ordinated national use of intelligent tracking systems&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which can piggyback onto the CCTV network is viewed within the service as something of a holy grail.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-27_para7">
I accept that it may be a holy grail for law enforcement purposes, but it is not necessarily a holy grail for privacy. Throughout this debate, we have tried to argue that law enforcement measures are necessary, but they must always be necessary and proportionate in respect of the invasion of privacy that takes place. It is a delicate balance to strike, and we are trying to establish whether it has gone too far.

<p><a name="50210-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bill Tynan  (Hamilton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 If one of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s or my constituents were attacked by a group of youths, and were they to find themselves recorded on CCTV cameras, is he saying that we should not use that for identification, along with national identity cards?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has described the kind of circumstances in which, under normal policing procedures, it would be acceptable. I am not seeking to rule out the use of the technology where appropriate; I am trying to establish the bounds of that technology. What would be inappropriate, for example, would be people outside the police service who monitor CCTV cameras having access to the database to monitor everybody going past. There would be temptations for people to seek to abuse that. What I am trying to do, and what the amendment specifically tries to do, is to ask: will the strict legal safeguards that would be in place were the police doing it be applied universally? If the hon. Gentleman is in favour of the cards, as I believe that he is, he needs to assure his constituents that they will be used for the purposes that he intends, and not abused.

<p><a name="50210-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Frank Roy  (Motherwell and Wishaw) (Lab):</b> 
 On the question of priority, would the hon. Gentleman&#039;s priority be the privacy of someone walking the streets or the fact that CCTV cameras would enable them to walk the streets safely?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-27_spnew8"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has highlighted the balance that we must always strike. We want both, and the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A clear principle is established in the Human Rights Act, which he and his Government support, whereby breaches of privacy can take place if they are necessary and proportionate to that which we are seeking achieve. Throughout discussion of the Bill, we have tried to establish where that boundary is. It is possible to have a complete surveillance state. It is possible for CCTV cameras to scan everybody, with a record of where everybody in the country is at any particular moment. The technology will enable that. The decision for us is whether the benefit of being able to catch additional criminals outweighs the potential loss of privacy and freedom. We are approaching that debate with an open mind, and we are seeking to establish those boundaries in the new clause.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-27_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 With an eye to the clock, I want to assure the hon.

They could not be used under the Act in the way that he fears, whereas they could be used in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) suggests, as he agrees that they should be.

 I encourage the right hon. Gentleman to continue progressing towards wanting to vote against this Bill. He is right in saying that, as that is precisely what we have found.

We are asking people to buy into this scheme with their own money&#151;for a family to take part in the scheme, they will have to put their hands in their pockets and pay several hundred pounds. With all the promises made, we do not really understand the full implications. That is what we have been trying to tease out, and we still do not have all the answers. The Minister has given some kind of assurance.

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Nine amendments, duly selected by Mr.&nbsp;Speaker or the Chairman of Ways and Means, were down for debate, in order, yet as a result of the timetable motion we have not even been allowed to start that debate.

 Those key amendments affect Scotland and Wales. The Minister, who represents Kilmarnock and Loudoun, has arranged for them not to be discussed.

<p><a name="50210-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 During debate in Committee, I undertook to look again at the legal status of the counterpart driving licence, which forms part of the definition of a UK driving licence in clause 28. The clause lists the identity documents to which the clause 27&nbsp;offences of possessing false identity documents apply. Doubts were raised at the time about whether the counterpart&#151;that is, the paper part of a photographic card driving licence&#151;should be considered an identity document.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para0">
On 3&nbsp;February, I wrote to the Chair of the Committee with the results of my consideration, which I will briefly summarise. Both the photocard licence and the counterpart have to be produced to the police and courts in certain circumstances relating to road traffic offences. Many people of course still hold valid paper driving licences that incorporate the counterpart. However, the Road Safety Bill, currently before Parliament, will enable the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to create an electronic driving record that will be available to the police. The legislation includes a provision to remove references to the counterpart in existing legislation. It is anticipated that the Bill, if enacted, would not come into force until about 2007&nbsp;or 2008.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para1">
In view of the intention to abolish the counterpart licence, I have decided that we should simplify the definition of a UK driving licence by removing it from clause 28(3)(c) in respect of that offence. I therefore invite the House to agree to the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para2">
Government amendments Nos. 59&nbsp;and 60&nbsp;bring the commissioner and his staff within the remit of the clause 29&nbsp;offence of unauthorised disclosure of information. Disclosures made as part of the commissioner&#039;s functions will not be caught by the offence, but clearly it would be unacceptable for the commissioner&#039;s staff to make unauthorised disclosures of information to which they had access as a result of their employment. I see no reason why such behaviour should not be criminalised. It is therefore right that the clause 29&nbsp;offence should be extended in the way proposed in Government amendments Nos. 59&nbsp;and 60, and I invite the House to accept them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para3">
Government amendments Nos. 75, 76&nbsp;and 78&nbsp;restructure the offence in clause 31&nbsp;of tampering with the register and Government amendment No. 77&nbsp;is a technical amendment which replaces &quot;is&quot; with &quot;may be&quot;. It is not intended to be a substantial change. The effect of amendments Nos. 75, 76&nbsp;and 78&nbsp;is to make it clearer that it is a defence to a charge under this clause to have an honest and reasonable, albeit mistaken, belief that the modification made to the register was authorised. The way in which a prosecution under clause 31&nbsp;would work is as follows. The prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant caused a modification of the register and that the modification was unauthorised. &quot;Unauthorised&quot; is a term defined in subsection (5); it is an objective concept.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para4">
It would be a defence for a defendant to show on the balance of probabilities that, notwithstanding the lack of objective authority, he held a reasonable subjective belief that the modification was authorised. I consider that the amendments structure the offence in a clearer way, and I urge hon. Members to support them.

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para5">
I have nothing further to add on this group of amendments, and I commend them to the House.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-29_spnew4"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister. There were times in Committee when it seemed that we were making no progress and that nothing at all was being given by the Minister. Therefore, much of what he has just said meets with our approval, especially about amendment No. 57, which relates to clause 28&nbsp;and the driving licence. It strikes me as a helpful and sensible way forward. I suggest that our amendment No. 41&nbsp;would have been clearer, simpler and probably easier than Government amendments Nos. 59&nbsp;and 60, which achieve the same end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para6">
Everything that the Minister says about so-called whistleblowers and public interest disclosures makes a great deal of sense. We dwelt on that quite long enough in Committee to show how important it was. I broadly welcome what he has said.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I echo the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments. This is an example of constructive Committee work. We had to go through the clauses to which these amendments relate fairly quickly. It would have been good to spend a little more time on them in Committee. The issues that we picked up are ones that the Government have accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para7">
I raised the issue of the counterpart driving licence as much as anything so that I could highlight the ridiculous system for getting a replacement driving licence. If one loses the whole licence, it is considerably easier to get a replacement than if one loses one part of it. The Minister has told us today that there is a broader solution to that, which will filter its way through to the provisions in the Bill, and has tabled amendments for that purpose. That is entirely welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para8">
The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) raised the point about whistleblowing or public interest disclosure. We feel that it is an important one. People should be able to report abuses of the system. We felt we had good reason for that because there have been abuses of other systems such as the police national computer, and they have resulted in prosecutions. Fortunately, they are few and far between, but when they occur it is important that no one feels legally constrained in making allegations if they are justified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-29_para9">
Both sets of amendments are thoroughly welcome and non-contentious. I hazard to suggest that if we had longer in Committee we could have made even more helpful suggestions to improve a Bill that the Liberal Democrats do not want to see go through, but wish to do what they can to make less bad.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I wish to take a few more minutes of the House&#039;s time to put on record how grateful I am to the hon. Members for Newark (Patrick Mercer) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) for their constructive response. As this may be the last opportunity that I have to speak to the Bill in the House&#151;it may not; we do not know&#151;I wish to say that I appreciate the constructive way in which the Committee conducted most of its work. I greatly appreciated the atmosphere in which its work was done, even when I did not think that significant progress was being made&#151;and that was a comparatively short period.

<a name="50210-29_para10">
The Government amendments contain examples of the Government listening to constructive criticism and responding, and I hope that that response has improved the Bill. I am particularly proud of the Bill for the paucity of Government amendments that had to be introduced unprompted by the Committee. That is a credit to the officials and the draftsmanship of the Bill, as well as the pre-legislative scrutiny that it received.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050210/debtext/50210-30.htm"/>




<p><a name="50210-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for the way that he is speaking. He may remember that he offered a bet to each of us who served on the Committee that the Government would introduce fewer amendments than could be counted on the fingers of one hand. We thought that each of us would win a bottle of champagne if the number exceeded three or four. I wonder whether he can help us.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has a selective memory. Part of what he remembers is correct, but we will need to check the <i>Official Report</i> to find out whether his memory is comprehensive. I think that I made a rash prediction that a smaller number than this very small number of Government amendments would be introduced. I should not have underestimated the persuasive powers of the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 I hope that the Minister will accept in a positive spirit that the scale of what is required from his pocket should be roughly in proportion to the scale by which the Government have exceeded the number of amendments that he originally envisaged introducing. On my mathematics, the Government have introduced no fewer than 12&nbsp;amendments. In other words, they have introduced four times as many as he had in mind. That seems to suggest that, ethically, he should buy at least four bottles of champagne for the members of the Opposition Front-Bench team.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Given the history of Government amendments under Governments of all colours and the fact that there are only 12&nbsp;Government amendments to a Bill with 45&nbsp;clauses and two schedules, perhaps I should suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the drinks should be on him.

The time has now come for the House to agree that we need the benefits and safeguards that an identity card system will provide both to individuals, who will be able to prove their identities securely and reliably, and in the wider public interest.

 My right hon. Friend says that an advantage of the scheme is that it will allow people to secure their identity.

The Home Affairs Committee started an inquiry in 2003, and there was further consultation on a draft Bill in 2004. Changes have been made to the Bill, and I assure the House that I shall continue to listen to, and act on, constructive comments on plans for delivering the identity card scheme after this enabling Bill has completed its passage through Parliament. It is our intention that the first ID cards will be issued in 2008, and there will be further opportunities between now and then for the House to examine the detailed provisions to be set out in secondary legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 How can the Home Secretary claim that the Bill has been given proper scrutiny when seven amendments, including all those specifically relating to Scotland and Wales, were not debated in Committee or on Report as a result of the Government&#039;s programme motion?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can claim that the Bill has been given proper scrutiny for exactly the reasons that I set out a moment ago. There has been a long-standing debate about the issues, and a range of discussions on the specific matters that have been taken forward has been held in the Chamber and in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para4">
The simple fact is that the possession of a clear, unequivocal and unique form of identity in the shape of a card that is linked to a database holding biometrics will offer clear benefits to us all. Such benefits include the prevention of terrorist activity, the proper control of immigration and illegal working, help for the more efficient and effective provision of public services, and specific measures to deal with crime. That is why recent surveys show that 80&nbsp;per cent. of the public support the introduction of identity cards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para5">
Biometrics are being developed around the world to improve the security and reliability of identity documents, including fingerprint biometrics on visas and our own biometric passports with a facial image biometric that will be introduced in about a year&#039;s time. The scheme will not create threats to privacy or change the way in which we live our lives. We have never proposed a scheme under which it would be compulsory to carry a card.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew10"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I want to pin the Secretary of State down on the question of terrorism. Will he explain exactly how a voluntary identity card will protect us against terrorism? If identity cards are to become compulsory in 10&nbsp;years, does he think that the war on terror will still be being fought in 2015?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-30_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 We dealt with that on Second Reading, but let me go back to the core points. There is no guarantee that any scheme&#151;identity cards or anything else&#151;will be able to deal with and eliminate the terrorist threat. There is no silver bullet to solve the problem. However, identity theft and fraud represent a significant modus operandi for those involved in terrorism, serious and organised crime, people trafficking and drug dealing. The fact that we will have an identity card scheme will give us the capacity to attack the problem that would not otherwise exist. It is true that a compulsory card would give us more power to attack the problem than a voluntary card, but it is also true that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1738</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a voluntary card gives us more capacity to attack the problem than we have at present. I think most people acknowledge that that is true.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para6">
It is, moreover, the case that ID cards will help in tackling fraud and will save tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers&#039; money. The Government have proceeded in a measured way by consulting on the principles and, most recently, on the draft legislation. The Bill sets out a clear legal framework for the scheme. It provides a means for everyone legally resident in the country to assert their right to be here and to help them gain access to the services to which they are entitled. It will help preserve national security and assist the work of law enforcement. It will enable the public to have the ID card system that they say they want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para7">
Those are the reasons why people in all parties have supported the legislation. In an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 20&nbsp;December 2004, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), the Leader of the Opposition, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have listened to the police and security service chiefs. They have told me that ID cards can and will help their efforts to protect the lives of British citizens against terrorist acts. How can I disregard that? We must protect our citizen in every way, and in my judgment that includes ID cards.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para8">
In that same article of a couple of months ago or less, he went on to write:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In my first speech as Leader of the Opposition, I would not oppose Government policy just for the sake of opposition. It is wrong to sacrifice the national interest for political expediency.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para9">
I applauded those remarks at the time and wish that they had been carried through. They reflected previous remarks also by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. On 23&nbsp;September 2001, he wrote in the <i>News of the World</i>:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Britain is the easiest country in western Europe in which criminals and terrorists can lose themselves. If we are serious about tackling this problem, there is one obvious remedy: identity cards.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para10">
Even earlier, in 1994, at the Conservative party conference, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In time, carrying your ID card would seem as natural as carrying a credit card is at the moment.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-30_para11">
Perhaps that is why the 1997&nbsp;Conservative party manifesto had a commitment to introduce ID cards.

I find it utterly extraordinary that the Opposition have decided to abstain on this vital issue, affecting the future of the nation.

 I can assure the Home Secretary that a number of Conservative Members have no intention of abstaining. We voted against the Bill on Second Reading and have every intention of doing so this evening, because his proposal is a serious invasion of the civil liberties of the people of this country.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 To be candid, the hon. Gentleman has more to say for his position than his Front-Bench colleagues. The fact is that some people&#151;he is one of them, and some of my Labour colleagues agree with him&#151;have issues of principle with ID cards and find it difficult to support them for the reason that he identified.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew2"><b> David Winnick: </b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend distinguish between the opportunist position of the Conservative 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1739</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>party and those of us who oppose ID cards in principle but would change our minds&#151;certainly I would, without the slightest hesitation&#151;if we thought that they would help in the fight against international terrorism? I hope he recognises that although my opposition is based on principle, it would change were I so persuaded.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I accept that distinction, which I have sought to make, including in evidence to the Home Affairs Committee earlier this week. Some people, for reasons that I respect but with which I do not agree, think that ID cards pose such a threat to our civil liberties that it is necessary to oppose them. Those people exist on both sides of the House. They are entitled to take that position to a vote and to carry it through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para0">
My point is different, however. The Government and, in my opinion, the Opposition have to assess, when considering national security, precisely the balance of issues, as described by my hon. Friend, that arise from ID cards. The Government have made that assessment and believe that the ID card is in the interest of the country. The Leader of the Opposition made that same assessment and came to the conclusions that I quoted, but he has now decided to abstain&#151;not to vote against, not to vote in favour&#151;on this key national issue, and abstention is not an honourable position. I believe there is a reason&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. The right hon. Gentleman must be very careful about impugning the honour of any other right hon. or hon. Member.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I beg your pardon, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and that of the House. I was not intending to impugn the honour, in the parliamentary sense, of the Opposition or of anyone else. I withdraw that word at your request.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para1">
It is not defensible, however, for an Opposition party or a Government party to abstain on an issue of this sort. There is a clear reason for the abstention. It is that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), who I am delighted to see in his place&#151;he has forgone his chance to be at the shadow Cabinet meeting in Manchester with the Leader of the Opposition, perhaps to undermine the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s position even further&#151;has been clear about his scepticism of ID cards in a variety of different ways. The truth is that he has rolled over his leader and reached an abstention position. That is the reality. I say that that is not defensible.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew5"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 I may be able to help my right hon. Friend. My Conservative opponent in my constituency was until recently the press spokesperson for the Leader of the Opposition. He says that his position is that he is opposed to ID cards in principle but that if they are required for international travel he might be persuaded otherwise. Does my right hon. Friend hope that we can yet persuade the Opposition to do a second U-turn?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall be even more candid than I was earlier. I have that hope. I ask the Opposition to reconsider their position. The position of abstention is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1740</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not defensible, in my view, for a serious political party. It has an implication that is of meaning. When the other place considers the proposed legislation, if there is not agreement from the official Opposition there are real issues about whether the Bill can be brought into effect in this Session, were a dissolution to be sought. The normal wash-up issues would arise, but a decision of the Conservative party to oppose the Bill in the other place would lead to a delay in carrying forward this important measure for the security of the country.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Does the right hon. Gentleman remember that I voted and spoke in favour of the Bill on Second Reading? I attended all the debates on the Bill to seek to continue that support. I have to tell him that the way in which he treated the House&#151;the failure to enable me to ask a number of questions on key issues and the time given, which did not allow his junior Minister to respond to many of the debates&#151;has led me to believe that indeed we should act differently, and I shall vote against the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Those right hon. and hon. Members who come to the view that they must cast their vote against, either for the reasons just given by the right hon. Gentleman or by others, are taking a position that I can understand, though I do not agree with it. I cannot understand those who say, &quot;We shall abstain on this key issue that is facing the country.&quot; I believe that it is a matter of internal politics within the main Opposition party and a betrayal of the interests of the country. If, in the final event, we are not able to carry through the proposed legislation in this Session, we will know clearly that that is because of the decision taken by the Opposition&#151;their decision to put peace within their party ahead of the national interest.
</p>

<p><a name="50210-31_spnew9"><b> David Davis  (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</b> 
 So much for the constructive and open debate on liberty and freedom and on security of the state that the Home Secretary was so keen to tell us we would have when we talked about identity cards and house arrest, an issue on which he is in even more trouble.I join him, at least in one respect, in thanking those right hon. and hon. Members who have taken part in consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report. At the same time, I sympathise with them in what must have been the most frustrating process of their political lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para3">
The Bill attempts to strike a balance involving a number of extremely serious issues: individual privacy, the relationship of the citizen and the state versus security, prevention of fraud, control of immigration and a number of other serious issues. That is why I set some tests for the Bill on Second Reading. I did not just want to test individual practicalities but to establish the balance between those principles and the Bill&#039;s competence to achieve some of the things that the Home Secretary talked about. A competent Bill would do what he said and that would, as the hon. Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick) said, have a significant effect in improving security. It would make a minimum intrusion into the liberty and privacy of the individual, and there would be strong safeguards where such intrusions proved necessary. An incompetent Bill would have a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1741</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>weak or non-existent impact on security, the prevention of fraud and the control of immigration. It would prove highly expensive and too intrusive into liberties, and would provide few effective safeguards for those liberties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para4">
The point of those five tests is to establish, as I said, the balance or imbalance between those serious principles, which matter, as the Home Secretary rightly said, and the competence or incompetence of the proposal. Having read all the <i>Hansard</i> reports of the Committee and listened to today&#039;s debate, which I attended when I could, I do not think that we have had a real or persuasive answer to any of the tests. It is not only our questions that remain unanswered. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said on page five of its report on the Bill:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Explanatory notes to the Bill have been published. They do not, however, contain any explanation of the Government&#039;s reasons for believing the Bill to be compatible with the Convention rights.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para5">
The next part is important:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We consider the absence of such an explanation to be deeply unsatisfactory in a Bill which is concerned throughout with issues of personal privacy, and with the delicate balances to be struck between individual rights to private life and the protection of the community.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para6">
That is not the stated view of the Conservative party but of the important and distinguished all-party Joint Committee on Human Rights. We are not the only ones to have reached the conclusion that we have had a dreadfully inadequate set of answers to an important set of questions as well as dreadfully inadequate time in which to debate those questions.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew10"><b> Mr. Chris Mole  (Ipswich) (Lab):</b> 
 Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-31_spnew11"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has not been here all day, so he is not qualified to comment on the Bill, as he lacks the information or attendance record to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para7">
The first test in that important series of tests deals with clarity of purpose. That matters, because it has implications for every other aspect of the Bill. As I said at the outset I, like the hon. Member for Walsall, would be persuaded as a sceptic to support the measure if it had the aim of dealing with terrorism. We tried to include that aim in the Bill, but we failed, because the Government refused to do so. We tried to make the priorities explicit, but Ministers refused. Foreign travellers, particularly from the European Union, can come here under EU rules without identification for three months, which means that the Bill is quite inadequate for use as an anti-terrorism measure, unless we have a way of dealing with that problem. The common travel area is another problem, as is the issue of Ireland, which I shall address in a moment. Those issues may be soluble, but there has not been a single attempt to answer our questions. If identity cards are an anti-terrorism measure, it should be made compulsory to carry them, otherwise they will not work. I do not want to have such a compulsory card in this country. As has been said, we do not want to hear our policemen saying, &quot;Papers please, citizen&quot;. However, there has been not been any attempt to answer the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para8">
The Bill could have been used to tackle illegal working but before we introduce a draconian measure we should try everything else first. For several years under this 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1742</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government, under legislation that the Conservatives passed to make the employment of illegal immigrant workers a crime, there was one successful conviction a year. Only after the tragedy at Morecambe bay and the brave campaign of the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith)&#151;she is a Labour Member, but I am happy to give her credit&#151;and, I am afraid, a campaign by my party on the failure of Government policy that led to the departure of a Minister, have we gone from one conviction a year to well over 600&nbsp;operations a year against employers of illegal immigrant workers. That is what must be done first; instead of throwing away liberties, the Government should do their job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-31_para9">
On benefit fraud, we have again not been told all. The Home Secretary told us that the provisions will save us tens of millions of pounds; the cost of the scheme may be tens of billions of pounds. I hope that he is never Chancellor, because with that sort of return on capital, the Government will go bankrupt very quickly.

 Black Wednesday.

<a name="50210-32_para0">
The primary problem is not concealment of identity, but concealment of circumstance, of which my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), the former Secretary of State for Social Security, was only too well aware during his review of the issue during the 1990s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para1">
We have had no answers. On illegal immigration, which was raised on Report today, my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) made the very good point that nine tenths of the issue is dealt with by the asylum identity card&#151;a registered card. So we have 90&nbsp;per cent. of the solution for 1&nbsp;per cent. of the grief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para2">
My point to the Government is that those questions could have been answered in Committee, but no attempt was made to give an answer. Why? It is hard to understand why, unless the Government do not believe their own case or their supposed reasons for the ID card. That is very worrying, and it is more worrying in many ways than other points that I shall raise in a moment.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-32_spnew2"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman says that his position is consistent: the Conservative party supports ID cards, but on condition that these questions are answered. He says that it would be possible to answer them, but he feels that the Government have not done so. Does that mean that a Conservative Government would answer their own questions and introduce ID cards?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-32_spnew3"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should not put words in my mouth. If I wanted someone to rearticulate my views, I would not pick him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para3">
What have we heard today? We have heard from the Home Secretary&#151;I think that I am quoting him correctly&#151;that this issue shows that the Tory party is &quot;soft on crime, soft on immigration, soft on terror.&quot; We will let the public decide the plausibility of that proposal. In many ways, I would worry more about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1743</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>being called stupid on crime, stupid on immigration and stupid on terror, which is the risk if we do not get the matter right. That is the point: we must get it right. It is a question not of being pro or anti a particular matter, but of getting the issue right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para4">
I have to say that this is a very poor start to the Home Secretary&#039;s serious debate on liberty and security, because this issue is one of the key components of that debate; indeed, perhaps it is the most important one. Let us go on to the second test, which concerns technology.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b>

<a name="50210-32_para5">
The second test is important, and I shall quote the Home Affairs Committee, which said that it is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;essential that, before the system is given final approval, there should be exhaustive testing of the reliability and security of the biometrics chosen, and that the results of those tests should be made available to expert independent scrutiny, perhaps led by the Government&#039;s Chief Scientific Adviser.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para7">
The next issue is the high value of the database, which will be an extremely large target that will attract attack. Putting aside the weaknesses on biometrics, the Government have not even tried to answer how they will prevent those attacks, which will destroy the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para8">
Test three concerns cost, which has gone from &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion to &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion to &#163;5.5&nbsp;billion. Conventional wisdom puts the overall cost somewhere between &#163;10&nbsp;billion and &#163;20&nbsp;billion. Bart Vansevenant, the director of the organisation that runs Belgium&#039;s ID card system, has said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the amount of people you catch will not be worth the price of the infrastructure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you look at this from a distance and look at the goal, I&#039;m afraid a lot of money will be wasted and the real cost will be much higher than any of the figures currently suggested.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para9">
How will the Government control the cost? They do not have a good track record. Would that money be better spent on trying to stop illegal immigration, terrorism and benefit fraud?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para10">
The final issue concerns civil liberties and privacy. In the words of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher), this is the &quot;largest change in relationship between the individual and the state&quot;. Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There are huge questions about access to the national identity register: who has access to it, for what sorts of purposes, and how is that information to be used&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para11">
As the debate has progressed, it has become increasingly apparent that many organisations&#151;more than we thought&#151;will have access to the database, which means 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1744</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the scope for unauthorised access will be unmanageable. There is even the possibility that the data must be shared with other countries such as Ireland, because of the common travel area.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-32_spnew8"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 The Home Secretary introduced a new concept in his winding-up speech, during which he would not take an intervention. He said that his card will enable us to &quot;assert the right to be here&quot;. I do not know what that means. Is he telling my constituents and the people of Britain that they have no right to be here unless they assert it through his means of an ID card?
</p>





<p><a name="50210-32_spnew9"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes the same point as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. ID cards involve a completely new view of citizenship. Being a subject of the Crown is a right, which it is not for the Government to give or take away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para12">
The Bill deals with massively important issues, and we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have adopted a constructive approach.

The Liberal Democrat position is based on both principle and practice. At various points, it has been put to us that those two ideas are contradictory and that one must oppose the Bill on the grounds of either principle or practice.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-32_para15">
The Minister has challenged us a number of times to discuss the issues of principle, and I thank him for those challenges, which were appropriate. I boil the matter down to the extent to which one values privacy. Article 8&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights concerns privacy. It states that states have the right to breach the right to privacy, where such a breach is necessary and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1745</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proportional to the end that they are trying to achieve. That clearly shows that there is no absolute right to privacy and that it can be breached under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, a threshold needs to be set. The Liberal Democrat view is that the Minister&#039;s ID card proposals do not meet that threshold, and that the benefits he suggests&#151;if they can be realised&#151;are not sufficient to outweigh the disbenefits, in terms of the cost to the privacy of citizens of the United Kingdom.

</p>





<p><a name="50210-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The Minister certificated the Bill as being compatible with the European convention on human rights. There are elements that may be compatible, but there is a variation in the threshold that one may apply. There is a political difference here between Liberal Democrat and Labour Members and, indeed, between Conservative Front Benchers, because we set the threshold at a different level. That is a political judgment; both a legal and a political judgment needs to be made in this respect.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-33_spnew2"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 The point made by my hon. Friend the Minister was covered by the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;an identity card containing only a person&#039;s name, sex, date and&nbsp;place of birth, current address, and the name of their spouse, does not in itself raise issues of the right to private life under Article 8&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Neither does the obligation to hold or carry such a card engage Article 8.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-33_para0">

</p>





<p><a name="50210-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to remind us that the scheme being put forward is not necessarily comparable to ID card systems in other countries and goes a lot further. The hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) referred to the Home Secretary&#039;s unfortunate turn of phrase when he said that the cards will allow people to assert their right to be in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-33_para1">
The Government are essentially proposing to put us all on a criminal intelligence database and to treat us all as potential suspects. That creates a fundamental change in the relationship between state and citizen. The scope of the database that the Government propose is far more comprehensive than any that has been suggested elsewhere. Indeed, the Minister himself has said at various points that the scheme that he is putting forward is bigger and more complex than anyone else&#039;s. He said that with a certain note of pride, and then with a slightly hysterical look of fear as we came to consider the implications of doing something more comprehensive than is to be found anywhere else.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-33_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 Another paradox, and therefore a failure to justify the scheme, is that whereas British citizens&#151;people who have never had to prove to the state their

<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1746</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right to be here&#151;will have to have the cards, people who come here with no right to be here will not. That seems to be one of those ridiculous examples that identifies the fundamental flaws.

 My hon. Friend&#039;s intervention is helpful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-33_para2">
I should like to nail a red herring, if one can nail a herring, in relation to whether one has to carry the cards compulsorily. We debated that in Committee. Most of us carry our irises and fingers wherever we go. The point about being on the database is that people can be checked against it wherever they go&#151;whether they have their ID card with them is immaterial. The fundamental question is the extent to which the benefits derived in terms of catching people involved with terrorism and crime&#151;something with which we agree&#151;are so great as to justify holding all that data, and presumably using it and checking it regularly. Are those benefits worth the disbenefits of a citizen having to pay, having to go through the inconvenience, and having the potential loss of privacy? We come to a different judgment from the Government, and have consistently done so throughout proceedings on the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="50210-33_spnew6"><b> Mr. Alan Reid  (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a powerful case against the Bill. He mentioned inconvenience. My constituents, many of whom live on islands, will be faced with great inconvenience if they are forced to go to Glasgow to get biometrics taken for their ID cards. The Secretary of State for Scotland has said that the Home Office is considering a mobile facility, but that will take ages and it will cost a huge amount to go round the highlands and islands. The Government have not answered those questions at all.

<p><a name="50210-33_spnew7"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 My hon. Friend helpfully moves me on to the significant practical considerations. The Government have tried to write off or trivialise the matter. They have talked down the costs and suggested that they will be less than they are, but whatever happens, they will be several billion pounds more than zero. They have talked down the costs and the inconvenience. It could cost several hundred pounds for a family of four adults in a remote area of Scotland who simply want to renew their passports to go on holiday by the time they have travelled to a centre, had the biometrics taken and paid for the documents. That is a significant change from the current position, and the Government have not made enough of it.

We should move on to getting our NHS medical records database right because that gives immediate benefits to the citizen and would allow us to establish whether we could securely give access to systems at multiple points of contact with our public services. We should then get our national insurance records system right and ensure that there is one number per person in the country so that we can establish whether we are genuinely competent to run such identification regimes. We need to take those steps first and demonstrate that we can fulfil all those tasks before we consider an identity card scheme.

If the Government approached us in four or five years, we could have a reasoned debate about the matter. Even the Government say that the card will be pointless. In a couple of years, they will tell people to pay money and go through all the hassle to get their passports for something that is functionally pointless because a passport is good enough; an identity card as well would be unnecessary. The system and the scheme may change in the intervening period. We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.

Even if hon. Members support identity cards, they should seriously consider whether they want to support the Bill. It is clearly being introduced for political reasons.

That accusation is normally made against us. It is an absurd assertion.

<p><a name="50210-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow) (Lab):</b> 
 I shall be brief because I know that other hon. Members want to speak. My position has always been clear. I voted against the Bill on Second Reading and the more I hear about it, the less I like it. I shall vote against it again this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para0">
I agree with one point that the Home Secretary made. I do not agree with much that he said about the measure but he was right about the Tory Front-Bench position. It is pathetic not to be able to reach a decision about whether to vote for or against such an important measure on Third Reading. We have had a limited time for debate this afternoon but what are the reasons for that? The usual Front-Bench channels made agreements to discuss the measure on a Thursday, when there is one less hour for debate, so those on the Tory Front Bench are shedding crocodile tears.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para1">
Listening to the debates on some of the amendments this afternoon, I felt as though I was listening to discussions about angels on pinheads, because, however we amend the Bill, we cannot make it acceptable. What it sets out to do is fundamentally objectionable. The Joint Committee on Human Rights raised a host of objections to it, and I have just had a brief chance to read through the Government&#039;s response to them. It does not really answer them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para2">
On Second Reading, we debated issues such as whether the cards would become compulsory. I am absolutely sure that it will become compulsory to have this card, because the Home Secretary said on Second Reading that this was the first step towards compulsion. We also discussed disclosure to service providers, the police and people in the private sector, and the audit trail that will exist. The real problem with this measure will be the register, rather than having to carry a card.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para3">
The public&#039;s view on this will change. At the moment, we might find 80&nbsp;per cent. of people saying that they support the measure, but once they realise that they are going to have to have these things, their view will change. Once the next, short step is taken, as I believe it undoubtedly will be, and carrying the card becomes compulsory, public opinion will certainly shift. We are going down a very dangerous road.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para4">
Everyone here knows which people will be the most likely to be asked to produce their card when it becomes compulsory to carry one. All the evidence from every European country that has cards&#151;including those where they are voluntary&#151;shows that the people who are most often asked to produce their card are from minority ethnic communities. To pretend, as the Government did in their race relations assessment, that this measure will actually improve race relations, strikes me as absurd.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para5">
I do not like enabling legislation of this kind. A mass of detail remains to be introduced in secondary legislation, which means that it will never be properly debated in this place. Of course, we cannot amend secondary legislation, so whatever form it takes, we shall just have to take it or leave it. I am also unconvinced that the Home Office can produce information technology infrastructure that will work, which could perhaps be the saving grace in all this. This concept is fundamentally flawed in principle, and we should not be going down this road.

 I entirely agree with the speech that we have just heard from the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard). Indeed, he made his points with a great clarity that I could not surpass. I shall confine myself to speaking for just a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para6">
It is not right to say that the Bill has been properly debated. The Home Secretary is wrong about that. Had he been present during the Report stage, he would have appreciated that fact. He has only to look at early-day motion 684, which has been signed by many of his hon. Friends, to see what was omitted in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para7">
I am perfectly willing to accept that there are some benefits to be gained from identification cards. The question is: how do they weigh in the balance with the disadvantages? I agree entirely that the money involved in this provision could be spent very much better in dealing with its stated objectives differently. I am extremely sceptical about the ability of the technology to deliver, and, if it fails, very serious injustice could result. I question whether the measures will address the questions of terrorism or serious fraud, because a high proportion of such cases rest on questions not of concealed identity but of concealed circumstances or concealed intentions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para8">
On matters of principle, I shall confine myself to two points. First, I believe that this represents a huge extension of statism. We are changing the relationship between the individual and the state, and we should not do that without a really compelling reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para9">
Secondly, I entirely agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Walthamstow. Inevitably, what will happen down the track if this policy is to be made effective is that the citizen will have to carry and produce an identity card on demand. He is entirely right that that will bear down most oppressively on the ethnic minority communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-34_para10">
I have been in the House long enough to remember the old sus laws and what rows they caused. I do not wish to create a situation in which the ordinary citizen can be arrested for not carrying a card.

Not too long ago, Liberal Democrat Front-Bench Members voted in favour of a ten-minute Bill supporting the principle of ID cards.

That abolition of ID cards in 1951&nbsp;came on the back of the case of Clarence Willcock&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> He was a Liberal; quite right. He was stopped in the street, his card was demanded by the police and he refused to produce it. Lord Chief Justice Goddard said that ID cards were an &quot;annoyance&quot; and

 It is normal practice for the Opposition to complain about the lack of parliamentary time. We did so when we were in opposition, but on this occasion, I agree that inadequate time has been allotted for such an important measure. It should not have been crowded in on a Thursday and there should have been far greater examination of the detail. If I may say so, I know that the Home Secretary is not responsible for the allocation of time, but we should have had at least two days. I genuinely regret that, irrespective of one&#039;s views, inadequate time has been allotted to examine the measure on Report.

I remain unpersuaded that ID cards are needed. My right hon.

They face the same problems of terrorism, as we have seen in Madrid, corruption, illegal working and so forth.

 My right hon. Friend is right. In politics, as in life as a whole, self-knowledge is a valuable thing. The Home Secretary has gravely embarrassed himself by his behaviour. If he is not aware of that simple fact, he needs to go away for a bit of therapeutic reconditioning.

The arguments against the Bill are powerful. First, it involves a fundamental change in the relationship between the citizen and the state, to the disadvantage of the citizen. Secondly, as many hon.

If that were not the case, why do no fewer than 25&nbsp;out of the Bill&#039;s 45&nbsp;clauses provide for order-making powers? The Bill is littered with phrases such as &quot;the Secretary of State may at any time decide&quot;, &quot;the Secretary of State may by order&quot;, &quot;the Secretary of State may as he thinks fit&quot;, or &quot;regulations made by the Secretary of State may provide.&quot; That is not acceptable.

The argument to do with cost has been made, but I shall conclude with the argument about public opinion. The Government have propagated a very downmarket line of argument.

I have a responsibility to look at the issues, study the legislation, identify the arguments and make a judgment. It is risible to contend that we need simply say, &quot;Oh, the opinion polls show 80&nbsp;per cent. in favour.&quot; Everyone knows that there was mass support in Australia for the introduction of identity cards, but people there recognised the drawbacks when they saw the real implications.

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Mc.Avoy.]</i>

<a name="50210-37_time0"><h5>6.13&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50210-37_spnew0"><b> Ms Karen Buck  (Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I apologise to my hon. Friend the Minister for his drawing the short straw of replying to the Thursday Adjournment debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para0">
Before I begin, I want to declare the ultimate non-pecuniary interest. My feelings about St. Mary&#039;s hospital are motivated in no small part by the fact that over the past 25&nbsp;years it has seen me through serious illness, major surgery, a cancer scare and the birth of my child. So I am committed totally to the hospital and its place in what, if we get it right, will be one of the most exciting hospital developments that has ever been attempted in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para1">
The time is drawing near for a decision on the future of St. Mary&#039;s hospital in the context of the Paddington health campus. The fact that this has been a difficult decision to take&#151;it has been seven years in planning and development&#151;is not surprising, given the fast-changing backdrop of the development of health policy and the complexity of the specific scheme in the very heart of London. It is understandable&#151;indeed, it is right and proper&#151;that such a project should be rigorously scrutinised and meet the demands of the future, as defined in 2005, as much as it would have done when it was first conceived not far off a decade ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para2">
I have no argument about the fact that the scheme has been subject to rigorous scrutiny in the Department of Health and elsewhere, but my worry and the reason why I requested this debate is that some of the negative publicity that has accrued to the scheme over the years, and even the old ennui factor that is inevitably attendant on a scheme that has been so long in gestation, may have obscured some very important central facts and prevented us from the viewing the scheme and the new offers that are being made to facilitate it at this late stage clearly on their merits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para3">
I do not intend to dwell on some of that negative publicity, although it is important that its existence is not denied because it provides a proper context for the debate. I merely wish to point out that the whole concept of the Paddington campus has had its opponents from the beginning, and they have been largely motivated by opposition to the closure of Harefield hospital. That is in many ways understandable from their perspective, but I very much regret that the local concern that has been expressed has muddied the waters a great deal around the campus itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para4">
The key fact is that the Paddington health campus continues to offer us an extraordinary, once-in-a-generation opportunity to renew and improve health care in north-west London. The most recent business case presented to the Department just before Christmas has the backing of all three local primary care trusts, the strategic health authority, clinicians from all three of the participant hospitals and the medical school, patients and the patients organisations, Conservative-controlled Westminster city council, the Mayor of London and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. Indeed, in response to a question that I 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1759</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>asked a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister described it as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, &quot;imaginative&quot; and &quot;state of the art&quot;. I could describe a political&#151;with a small p&#151;coalition of that kind as implausible. In fact, I have never known that breadth and depth of support across agencies in 25&nbsp;years in public life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para5">
It is worth recapping for a moment the importance of the scheme and what it has to offer. Combining heart and lung services with acute general specialist services will dramatically improve patient care for the seriously ill, children and those with complex health problems. All the renowned expertise of the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals, Imperial college postgraduate research and teaching centres and St. Mary&#039;s hospital will be available to patients on a single site. The two hospital trusts and Imperial college have a tradition of research into improving health care, linking science to medicine. Harefield has the largest European heart and lung transplantation programme. The National Heart and Lung Institute at the Brompton hospital is an internationally recognised five-star research centre, and St. Mary&#039;s is a leading research centre into infection in its own right. Bringing together all that research with Imperial college&#039;s world-renowned expertise will enable a major centre for research to be created, which will strengthen London&#039;s standing internationally, as well as directly benefiting patient care. However, a few myths need to be demolished for the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para6">
Myth No. 1&nbsp;is that this is some kind of bloated super-hospital, a dinosaur from a bygone age and a over-ambitious amalgamation that is in danger of looking old-fashioned before it has even started. In fact, it is two hospitals on one site, with parallel academic development. It is not a single hospital, but a way to reduce costs by relocating three existing hospitals on to one site that is strategically located, with superb communications available to it that are not available anywhere else in north-west London. It is adjacent to Paddington station and, I hope, to a new Crossrail site, with easy access to Heathrow&#151;a location advantage that cannot be replicated on any other site in inner, north or west London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para7">
Myth No. 2&nbsp;is that the campus will lock London into a surplus capacity of NHS beds. In fact, the Paddington health campus assumes that the requirement for 15&nbsp;per cent. of routine surgery will be supplied by the private sector, and most routine elective surgery will be carried out in other hospitals in north-west London in any event. The campus has been designed to deal with complex tertiary work at St. Mary&#039;s and the new Brompton and Harefield, with St. Mary&#039;s also providing emergency services with appropriate backup for the local population, as at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para8">
Myth No. 3&nbsp;is perhaps the most important of the myths doing the rounds: there is a quicker, cheaper and easier alternative. Relocating the Brompton and Harefield and rebuilding St. Mary&#039;s on this inner London site is complex and challenging, but the value-for-money case is strong. The other options&#151;there must be other options because doing nothing is neither clinically nor financially viable&#151;remain tentative in financial and planning terms. Significant cost benefits could be enjoyed by pooling central services, such as administration, payroll, catering and a range of others. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1760</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>It is estimated that revenue savings of &#163;20&nbsp;million a year could be made, but they would not materialise under other options that involved upgrading the hospitals separately or using any other configuration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para9">
If we did not proceed with the campus, it would not reduce the need to move specialist heart and lung services away from Harefield hospital, or modernise the Brompton and St. Mary&#039;s facilities. If detailed capital and revenue cost plans for alternative options exist to demonstrate that they would represent better value for money, and all their details on the cost of such things as land assembly and planning permission have been scrutinised to the extent of those for the Paddington health campus, I am not aware of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para10">
All the arguments in favour of the Paddington health campus have been strengthened even more in recent days by the latest offer from Westminster city council to reduce the cost to the NHS of the land deal required for the campus. The council has offered to broker land deals in a manner that would cut both the cost and complexity of the scheme. That would represent better value than all previous options and would save the NHS in excess of &#163;60&nbsp;million more than the existing scheme. The capital surplus would be increased, the steady state operating position would be substantially improved and contingent liabilities would be greatly reduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para11">
Westminster city council can explain its own motives for the latest offer. However, it would be true to say not only that it is committed to maintaining a local hospital with international teaching excellence, but that it sees the scheme as a further step in the wider regeneration of the Paddington area. The retention and improvement of hospital facilities is thought of as not only being of direct benefit to people, but allowing further redevelopment throughout the Paddington basin. The campus is one piece of a jigsaw that has already included the introduction of the Heathrow Express, the refurbishment of Paddington station, the &#163;62&nbsp;million Paddington bridge project, the establishment of 97,000&nbsp;sq ft of office space and 922&nbsp;residential units, and substantial changes to education provision. There is more to come, including Crossrail&#151;the hybrid Bill will hopefully be introduced in the near future&#151;a potential business improvement district, the re-provisioning of the City of Westminster college, and a major new affordable housing development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para12">
Additional benefits have already included 7,000&nbsp;permanent jobs, thousands of construction jobs and huge investment in the local economy. That was much needed when we remember that despite the mythology of Westminster&#039;s uniform prosperity and the fact that it includes some of the most prosperous parts of the country, the four wards immediately surrounding Paddington are among the 10&nbsp;per cent. most deprived wards in the country. Other wards in the surrounding district are among the 30&nbsp;per cent. most deprived in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para13">
When critics say, as they sometimes do, that the campus development has been seven years in the making and has yet to reach fruition, it would be true to say, &quot;So has Paddington.&quot; The Paddington that we knew seven years ago when the health campus began to evolve is not the Paddington that we see now, because at that stage there were no academy schools or plans for the redevelopment of the secondary sector, no business improvement districts, and no immediate prospect of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the blight on the Crossrail development being lifted. The project has been fluid and constantly changing, so inevitably land assembly deals have had to be done. Additionally, the hospital has been subject to constant re-evaluation because as health needs change, capacity needs change. It would be unfair to make harsh judgments about the Paddington campus without appreciating the momentum of the whole regeneration scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para14">
If the final decision is taken to rebuild St. Mary&#039;s hospital alone, I am confident that a fine teaching hospital will continue to be available for my constituents. St. Mary&#039;s is not a hospital that is any longer fit for purpose, because many of its buildings are inappropriate for a 21st century hospital. It is absolutely essential to redevelop the hospital, ideally within the campus site. If it is not situated on the campus site, however, it will continue to provide first-class services. The quality of services within St. Mary&#039;s was recognised when it won the Dr. Foster&#039;s hospital of the year award three years ago, when it received its star ratings and when, only a few weeks ago, it was included in the latest wave of possible foundation status hospitals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para15">
I am more worried about the long-term viability of institutions that will not benefit from the scale and concentration of resources. Without the campus, health facilities in north-west London will continue to suffer from fragmentation and dispersal, with services for children in particular increasingly at risk. The failure to consolidate heart, lung and paediatric specialties would deny patients the opportunity to improve the quality of care for complex medical conditions in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-37_para16">
The case for the campus clinically, in terms of overall value of money and regeneration, is compelling. The chance, once lost, will not come again. Given the new financial impetus that has been afforded by Westminster city council&#039;s latest offer on land assembly, I urge the Minister to take back the message that the scheme must proceed. I look forward to hearing his comments and hope that we get the clearest possible indication that, after all these years, those who looked forward to having the most prestigious hospital teaching and research developments in Europe will, at last, be satisfied.

<p><a name="50210-38_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for this brief opportunity to add my comments in support of the remarks made by my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para0">
As has been said, the Paddington health campus is a large undertaking, but it is also a project whose time has come. It will offer all the people of London and, indeed, the country more generally, world-class facilities across a range of medical disciplines. It is an essential component of Westminster&#039;s regeneration plans for a highly visible part of our capital, the significance of which goes way beyond the local level. I endorse the hon. Lady&#039;s comments. She rightly said that Paddington is a much changed area, and that change continues. It is a little unfair to compare the plans with those of even six or seven years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para1">
The Minister is aware that a vast amount of preparatory work and expenditure have been invested to get to where we are today, and I urge him to recognise 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1762</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>how much has been achieved. That there have been difficulties and disagreements along the way is not surprising. The crucial point to note is that there is now a strong, influential and robust coalition of support for the scheme, both medically and politically. Any project that unites the Conservative leader of Westminster city council and the Mayor of London&#151;never mind hon. Members from opposing parties who have a direct constituency interest&#151;is surely also worthy of the Government&#039;s support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para2">
This has been described as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and few would demur from that description. Indeed, only occasionally can we say that all the planets are aligned in favour of such an important project being given the go-ahead, but that is now the case. There is nothing to be gained from delaying a decision until after the election. Political uncertainty is perhaps the project&#039;s greatest threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para3">
I understand that the rector of Imperial college, Sir Richard Sykes, has only this afternoon been in touch with No. 10&nbsp;Downing street to express that wonderful global institution&#039;s support for the scheme and, I have no doubt, to muse on the significant boost it would give to Britain&#039;s ability to continue playing a leading role in international medical and scientific research.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para4">
Westminster city council is, as we speak, engaged in discussions to reduce still further the public sector&#039;s exposure and to strike a more beneficial accommodation for the taxpayer with the private sector partners, whose positive contribution and needs in unlocking the project must also be recognised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para5">
I do not wish to rehearse the formidable points that the hon. Lady made, but here today and, I suspect, on many other occasions, the will for the project to succeed and bring its undoubted benefits to London and the country is very much apparent among the trusts and politicians involved locally. I urge the Minister and his Government to demonstrate their political will and support the Paddington health campus.

<p><a name="50210-38_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) on securing the debate. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) on his interest in the matter. I know that the subject is of real concern to my hon. Friend and other hon. Members. She has raised it before with Ministers and, as she said, with the Prime Minister. I have no doubt that the matter is also of great concern to her constituents and to many national health service patients in west London and throughout the United Kingdom. It will have significance to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para6">
In October 2001, the Department of Health announced that it intended to develop a new health campus at Paddington. I emphasise at the outset, as did my hon. Friend, that this is not a proposal to build a single super-hospital but a development that would bring together three major hospitals and a medical faculty on a single new campus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para7">
The proposed Paddington health campus scheme embodies a bold and exciting vision for the wholesale redevelopment and renewal of services and facilities that are currently dispersed across north-west London and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1763</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>exist, in many instances, in outmoded and unsuitable accommodation. It plans to combine this on the new site, bringing together the renowned expertise of the Royal Brompton hospital and Harefield hospital, along with St. Mary&#039;s hospital, a busy secondary and tertiary centre with a strong focus on serving the needs of Paddington. Imperial College postgraduate research and teaching centres will share the campus, which will embrace the use of technology to improve levels of patient care. The environment for patients and staff will include state-of-the-art facilities and diagnostics in both new and fully refurbished buildings, replacing run-down, old and unsuitable accommodation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para8">
This is a vision that the Government fully support. We see it as an excellent proposal not only for local health services but for the specialist services that will be provided to the wider NHS on the site. There is substantial support within the local NHS for the Paddington health campus, as the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said. I understand and appreciate this. We are working with the local NHS to find a sensible way forward for the campus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para9">
Any new proposal&#151;my hon. Friend alluded to this&#151;must offer the very best value for money and be affordable by the health economy. Before the Government can finally turn their support for the vision into a final commitment to proceed, we need to work through the business proposals to ascertain whether the numbers add up. Until now, the key challenge facing the campus project team has been to demonstrate value for money with acquisition of the land needed. That is not to criticise it&#151;any project board would have the same challenge. A scheme of this size or complexity has never been undertaken by the NHS, and transparently demonstrating its viability takes time, hence the apparent delays.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para10">
In 2001, the original outline business case estimated the cost of this redevelopment at &#163;325&nbsp;million. However, in 2003&nbsp;it was recognised that the price of the project had escalated way beyond its original OBC approval figure to &#163;800&nbsp;million. Given this rise in the cost, a review of the OBC and the management of the project was necessary, and this was undertaken in late 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para11">
The review team was led by officials from the Department of Health and included officials from the Treasury and the National Audit Office. I believe that it was right to conduct the review. In October 2004&nbsp;the review concluded that a revised OBC should be submitted by the project team to the Department. It was agreed that, when approved by Department officials, the OBC would be submitted to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury for consideration and approval.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para12">
The revised OBC was approved by North West London strategic health authority and submitted by the project team to the Department in December 2004, and it is currently being reviewed by Department officials. One key issue from the revised OBC is that the NHS needed to acquire land from Westminster city council and Paddington Development Corporation Ltd., a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1764</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>privately owned consortium. It is this complex land transaction, linked to a large PFI hospital contract, that has until now made this such a difficult project to progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para13">
However, the campus project team is right now considering an exciting new proposal whereby Westminster city council would enable the land deal for significantly better value for money than the proposal described in the current OBC. For Westminster city&nbsp;council, the campus project would be the final piece&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the regeneration of Paddington. It would provide key benefits to the local economy, including 7,000&nbsp;permanent jobs, thousands of construction jobs, millions of pounds of investment in the local economy and significant amounts of key worker housing in an area adjacent to some of the most deprived wards in London. The four wards surrounding the site are among the 10&nbsp;per cent. most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para14">
Full details of the proposal and its possible impact on the project should shortly be with the Department. They will be worked through as quickly as possible, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North and the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will accept that we cannot progress the work in detail until we have the final proposal in our hands. Work will, however, take place as quickly as possible, and I assure my hon. Friend that the Department and Ministers will do everything that we can, working with the local NHS, to expedite progress, to evaluate the proposal and develop it into an addendum to the original business case. Like her, I await those details with great interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para15">
Of course, not everyone shares my hon. Friend&#039;s enthusiasm for the project, as she openly admitted. The Paddington health campus plans have generated considerable controversy, not only in constituencies in the area but in others. However, the quality of building stock at Paddington, Chelsea and Harefield needs to be improved. Two thirds of the Royal Brompton and the vast majority of both Harefield and St. Mary&#039;s are long overdue for replacement. Those issues cannot be ducked and must be dealt with in the very near future, health campus or not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para16">
In addition, Harefield hospital will, in the not-too-distant future, become unsustainable as a viable specialist heart hospital. It is crucial for the success of single-speciality hospitals that they have access to a wide range of related sub-specialities. Harefield, which is several miles from local general hospitals, is not in a position to draw on the support of the wider range of specialties that are found at such hospitals. The high-quality work and legacy of Harefield hospital will be sustained at Paddington health campus through proximity with St. Mary&#039;s. Even if that were not the case, Harefield is on a greenbelt site, and therefore constrained by planning regulations. It is difficult for people who do not live in the local area to access it by public transport, and a major redevelopment at Harefield would have a knock-on effect on the surrounding hospitals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50210-38_para17">
It must be remembered that a large proportion of Harefield&#039;s patients will receive routine care and treatment at their local hospitals. Only patients 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1765</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>requiring specialist care would go to Paddington health campus. I am sure that the House will agree that that we should all be prepared to accept that hospital and community services must, from time to time, change if we are to continue to fulfil patients&#039; needs and improve services. Services should not remain static for ever, but must reflect advances in technology and clinical practice. Of course, all the planning and analysis is bound to create uncertainty. Throughout the transitional phase, staff involved in the scheme and those who have continued to provide health care to Paddington patients have worked tirelessly, despite their concerns. I pay tribute to all the staff who contribute to the excellent work of those hospitals.

<a name="50210-38_para18">
I can assure my hon. Friend&#151;and I hope that this is the promise that she was seeking from tonight&#039;s debate&#151;that Department officials are working closely with North West London strategic health authority, commissioners and providers of health care in Paddington and west London to arrive at the best solution quickly and expeditiously for the local health economy. Like her, I remain excited by the project and its potential. The Government and I want decisions to be made as quickly as is safe.
