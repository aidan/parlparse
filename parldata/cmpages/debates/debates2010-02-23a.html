 As of September 2008, there were 143 qualified midwives at the Kettering general hospital foundation trust and 161 qualified midwives at the Northampton general hospital NHS trust. It is, of course, the responsibility of trusts locally to ensure that appropriate midwifery services are provided. There are more than 25,600 midwives in the NHS. Trusts met the Government's commitment to recruit an additional 1,000 midwives a year early and are on target to recruit 4,000 extra midwives by 2012.</p>

 There is a shortage of seven midwives at Kettering general hospital, which is actually very good compared with the shortage nationally. However, the real problem is the shortage of band 6 midwives-the more experienced midwives. As a result of the shortage, newly qualified trainees entering the system are not undergoing the preceptorship that they are meant to receive. What will the Minister do to address that problem?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks a very important question. At the same time as recruiting and retaining midwives, we are also looking at how we can retain experienced midwives by offering a more flexible approach to work and through working in teams. That is the way forward, and I am pleased to say that the vacancies at Kettering should be filled-I am led to believe that 12 candidates are now ready to be interviewed for the remaining six positions. We are also working closely with the Royal College of Midwives on the preceptorship.</p>

 My hon. Friend points out that the funding for the posts exists. In fact, nationally there has been a 38 per cent. increase in the number of student midwives, so we are hopeful that we will reach our target. However, I would ask her to work with the trust and the Royal College of Midwives, and I would be happy to meet her and explain in more detail our programme of events for retaining midwives.</p>

 The Minister has not really explained where the extra 4,000 midwives will come from. The Government's own projections show that there will be an increase of only 1,000, but a 2009 memorandum on public expenditure states that between 2008 and 2012 an extra 1,500 will graduate each year. Yet the same memorandum projects about 1,800 new graduates a year. On my reckoning, that leaves us 3,000 short. Perhaps she can explain exactly where those 3,000 will come from.</p>

 I am glad to explain that to the hon. Lady. As mentioned in previous answers, we have been working most successfully with the Royal College of Midwives on a recruitment returners project. Actually, we are led to believe that a 38 per cent. increase in the number of students will deliver the target of an extra 4,000 midwives by 2012, and we are on schedule to achieve that. The extra money that has gone into midwifery has proved to be very successful, and of course we have made maternity services a priority, which is reflected in the latest NHS operating framework.</p>

 I am obviously grateful to the Secretary of State for that factual response. However, clearly he will be aware that the Isle of Man is a Crown dependency, that the reciprocal health care agreement has been in place since 1948 and that the Government's decision to end it at the end of next month was an arbitrary one without consultation. Has he given any thought to the impact on hospitals in the north-west of England, which could be affected by the decision, and to the position, in particular, of elderly people who go in their retirement to the Isle of Man and will be placed in financial difficulty when it comes to their health care?</p>

 I am aware that we are talking about a long-standing agreement, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman would accept that it relates to a different time, when lots of people from the north-west travelled to the Isle of Man for their holidays. The numbers travelling now are around half what they were in the '40s, '50s and '60s of the last century, so there is no longer any basis for the agreement as it stood. I am sure that he would agree that, right now, I have to look at securing the maximum value for money from every piece of Government expenditure. However, I hear the concern that has been expressed by those in all parts of the House, so I will keep the matter under close review, as I said to the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man when I met him on 19 January.</p>

The Royal Liverpool is a crucial project of great significance for health care and the economy in Merseyside and the north-west. I would like to make progress on it shortly, but I am not in a position to make an announcement today.</p>

 Fairly easily. The Department of Health has provided NHS London with an extra £1.5 million for this financial year, which it has confirmed meets its current requirements. The Department is also in discussions with NHS London authorities on the provision of further funding, and we are going through some figures that they have provided us with. At the moment they look to be figures for a worst-case scenario, but we want to go through the detail and examine what is needed. However, we are certainly clear that the health needs of Londoners will not be compromised and that the health needs of visitors will be met.</p>

 First, the figure that the hon. Gentleman gave is contrary to some of the figures that have been circulated recently, which have actually been larger. NHS London has put forward a figure of £41 million, as a cost spread over four years. That is based on planning assumptions that appear to be based on a worst-case scenario, and were made last summer. We know that there is a good deal more planning work to do, to ensure that we estimate the cost much more carefully and get the figures right, and that we must work with NHS London so that our health care needs are delivered.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to emphasise the value of specialist teams such as the one that she described. The strategy for adults with autism will include services for those with Asperger's. It will cover adults across the complete spectrum, as we discussed at the reception that you hosted recently, Mr. Speaker, at which many Members were present. I cannot pre-empt what the strategy will say when we publish it, but we have heard many strong arguments for specialist teams, particularly in relation to diagnosis. There is not just one model-my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn) cited one in Sheffield, but there are others around the country. I would certainly like to encourage those developments, while also enabling local flexibility so that variations can suit local circumstances.</p>

The hon. Gentleman must now accept that securing that vaccine was the overriding priority and that a contract had to be put in place to secure vaccines on that scale. Of course there are further discussions to be had with GSK to ensure maximum value for the taxpayer, and the hon. Gentleman would expect me to be pursuing those discussions, and we are.

 I said when we published the Green Paper last year that I was seeking broad consensus on this issue and that remains my objective. It is one of the biggest issues that we face as a society, and I think that the country is looking to politicians to work constructively towards a durable solution. Before we leap to criticise each other, we need to focus on the fact that there are people today in all our constituencies paying the cruellest taxes of all-the costs of care that mean that the more vulnerable people are, the more they pay. A national care service will create a national entitlement and end the local lottery in which councils set different rules. The principle of a national care service has been widely welcomed, and I call on all sides to help us to make it a reality.</p>

 I certainly agree and the hon. Lady makes an important point. The different geography and demography of local communities mean that home care will be more suitable in some areas than in others. However, in an area such as North Yorkshire, I think that telecare will have an important part to play in ensuring that people can be monitored daily without their having to travel to a clinic or hospital. There is great potential in this field, although of course it must be a local decision. It must not be imposed on people but, where people want it, it can be convenient for the public and can provide value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

 A consultation on our proposals to change car parking rules in the NHS closed last week. I hope the hon. Gentleman found time to contribute to that. The proposal is to phase out charges for in-patients. I believe it is unfair that people should not receive visits while they are in hospital from those who cannot afford the charges. The introduction of charges symbolised the NHS moving away from the patient and the public. If we can come up with a workable and fundable scheme, I believe it will be widely welcomed by patients and the wider public.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman and others have raised this issue. As part of the national carers strategy the Government have placed more than £150 million in primary care trusts' budgets to ensure that those primary care trusts could complement the money that we have given to local councils-some £720 million over the past three years-to provide respite care. The combined funding to the PCTs and to local councils for respite care is some £975 million last year, this year and the next. It is a matter for local decision making to assess local needs, but I hope that the hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. You will remember that on 9 February, at column 771, we had an exchange about the inadequate answering of parliamentary questions by the Department for Work and Pensions, and you gave me what I thought was very sound advice suggesting that tabling a further question on the Order Paper or raising a point of order on the Floor of the House would concentrate the minds of Ministers. I did indeed do that. Before the recess, I tabled a lengthy question asking when a range of questions-up to 30-would be answered. You can imagine that yesterday, when that question was due for answer, I was not very impressed to receive a further holding answer from the Minister of State. It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, in the light of our exchange and the significant number of unanswered questions, two of which date back to last year, that this is a case of Ministers treating the House with contempt. What may I do to get answers from Ministers given what I have already done?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order.

I hope that it will not be necessary continually to repeat this point. The hon.

That is largely because those homes are very poorly insulated. It is, I believe, the incontestable view of all that the need to improve the thermal insulation of domestic properties of any kind of tenure is of paramount importance, for obvious environmental reasons such as those related to global warming but also for financial reasons for those who occupy them and for social welfare reasons. It is a matter of practical fact that excess cold puts people's health, and indeed their lives, in jeopardy. We know that more people die during the cold months of the year in this country than in comparable countries, or even in countries with much more extreme climates, because of relatively poor insulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="100223-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10022358000202">The thermal comfort element of the decent homes standard now extends to private housing the same consideration that has historically applied to social housing, but there is a big gap between private housing and social housing, and to an extent between private housing and those in owner-occupation. The problem in the private rented sector is that the private tenant has no capacity whatever to make improvements through investment in insulation and so on, which would allow the thermal efficiency of their property to be improved. But nor, alas, do landlords necessarily have an incentive to improve, at least not in the current circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="100223-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10022358000203">As we know, the Government have already made significant steps, which I very much welcome, to bring about a change in the private rented sector. For example, the introduction in October 2008 of energy performance certificates means that all properties will in future have something that tells us how thermally efficient they are regarding insulation. In addition, the Government introduced in 2006 the energy saving allowance, which gives landlords up to £1,500 per property to introduce insulation improvements. However, the problem with that scheme, frankly, is that landlords often do not know that it exists; and even when they do, the incentives are still too small to make a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para0"><a name="10022358000204">I strongly welcome the fact that tenants can access the Warm Front scheme in England and the equivalent schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, that applies only to tenants who directly qualify for such assistance. I also welcome the fact that local authorities have power under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (England) Regulations 2005 to class as a hazard the very worst-insulated properties and to take specific action. However, that happens only in the very worst properties and not, alas, those that are bad, but not so bad as to attract the attention of local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para1"><a name="10022358000205">The "English House Condition Survey 2007" contains some startling statistics. In the jargon-which I am afraid is what this is-of the standard assessment procedure, the efficiency of property insulation is measured on an index from nought to 100, with 100 being excellent. The 2007 survey shows that the value of the housing stock in England increased from 42 in 1996, which was poor, to 50 in 2007, which is in the okay region of operation. That real improvement is because of Government publicity and the activities of social landlords and owner-occupiers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para2"><a name="10022358000206">Social landlords do the best in the survey-spectacularly. Their score on the index is 58, which is a good performance. Alas, for both owner-occupiers and private tenants, the score is still only 48, which is below what we regard as acceptable, and owner-occupiers still have a long way to go. However, there is a significant difference between owner-occupiers and private tenants, namely that the private rented sector, ironically, has a far higher proportion of very well insulated properties. Some 10 per cent. of private tenancies are in the very good category, whereas only 4 per cent. of owner-occupiers are. At the same time, although only 10 per cent. of owner-occupiers are in the worst categories, some 16 per cent. of private tenants are in conditions in which excess cold is threatening to their health. Some 400,000 people are in such private tenancies, of which 124,000 are described as vulnerable people-either the elderly or people who have sickness or disability problems that make them especially vulnerable to extreme cold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para3"><a name="10022358000207">The time has come when we need legislation to move things forward and to incentivise landlords, and sometimes to offer the stick as well as the carrot. The Bill therefore seeks to do a number of things. It seeks to introduce a  <br>

minimum thermal efficiency standard, which will say at the beginning that the very worst properties should no longer be in the private rented sector. That standard should progressively move up through the thermal efficiency ratings, so that landlords know that they have an incentive-the stick-to ensure that their properties are improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para4"><a name="10022358000208">The Bill also seeks to make it illegal to put a property on the private rented market if it can be improved at reasonable cost, even if it is already above the legal minimum as defined elsewhere in the Bill. That says to landlords that if cavity wall insulation, for example, which is relatively cheap in the scheme of things, can be used, it ought to be used. Landlords should be progressively forced to make such improvements. However, we also need the Government to look at incentivising landlords, as well as providing a stick. While it is not part of this Bill, I hope that we will see an extension of the existing scheme to give landlords an incentive to invest in the insulation of their properties by way of grants. We should also consider whether it is possible to reduce value added tax for energy-saving improvements to property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para5"><a name="10022358000209">Many hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens live in homes that are badly heated. Most of those homes are not simply badly heated because people cannot afford to heat them-although that may well be a significant part of the equation-but because the insulation is grossly inadequate for the purposes of modern living. It is in that light that the Bill is timely, because it will draw the attention of private landlords, their tenants and other agencies to the need to bring those standards up for environmental reasons, for the financial benefit of tenants and, in the end, for reasons of social welfare and health. For those reasons, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

It emerged at the start of the meeting that Trevor Phillips, the chair of the EHRC, had recently spoken to at least three members of the Committee about its consideration of the draft report and the publication of written evidence with the report. In our view, these discussions could constitute a contempt of both Houses in that they may have been an attempt to influence the views of certain members of the Committee shortly before it considered a draft report directly relevant to Mr. Phillips in his role as chair of the commission. We therefore recommended that the matter should be subject to investigation by the privileges Committees of both Houses, and so I ask the House to refer the matter in accordance with my motion.</p>

 I am a recently appointed member of the Committee that has referred this matter to the House for referral to the Committee on Standards and Privileges. As the subject of one of the telephone calls referred to by the Chairman of the Committee and-as far as I am aware-the only Member of this House who received such a telephone call, I felt that I should make my view on this matter clear. It is right that I tell the House that I do not believe that Mr. Phillips has acted in contempt. He wanted to discuss whether the proposed report would be fair because he believed-rightly, as it turned out-that parts of the evidence that the Committee received would be redacted in the final report.

I was shocked, as a newly appointed Committee member, to discover that this inquiry-the Select Committee's first inquiry into the work of the EHRC since its inception-had no terms of reference. Its only call for evidence was a notice reporting evidence from a group of commissioners who had resigned and inviting short statements in advance of evidence from Trevor  <br>

Phillips as chair of the organisation. I was able to attend only one evidence session, and I must say that it was more like a show trial of an individual than an inquiry into the work of an organisation.</p>

I think that he is right, although, given that the final report has not been drafted, I do not know whether it will be either unfair or inaccurate, and I will do my best, as a member of the Committee, to ensure that neither is the case. I believe, however, that the Standards and Privileges Committee should, as well as considering the report of the allegation of contempt by Trevor Phillips, also ask to see how the Joint Committee on Human Rights worked and consider carefully whether it operated in a way that was proper.</p>

If we are to preserve this vital concept, we need to use it well and sparingly, as was advised by the 1966 Select Committee on privileges. To imply that Members of Parliament might be inhibited in their work by a telephone call by someone whose career might be put at stake by a report that they are considering is, in my view, a misuse of this valuable concept.</p>

on any current issue or possible current issue, let me say that it was important to establish whether we should retain the whole idea of privilege. Our Committee was unanimous that we should retain it, as a vital protection for each and every one of us, and at any time. Having reported to the House and received a favourable response from the Dispatch Box, we hoped very much that our recommendation that there should be legislation on the law of privilege would be accepted and that a proper statute would be laid before the House before too long.</p>

 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. Our Committee indeed felt that, on the whole, privilege had been used properly, as it should have been. Nevertheless, we thought that something going back over 300 years deserved a new statute, and we recommended this. The Government responded perfectly favourably. The Opposition also responded favourably, but since then nothing has happened. The report is on the shelves gathering dust. As this Parliament ebbs towards its close, I hope that whoever is the Leader of the House after 6 May or whenever-that is, whoever is in the driving seat as far as Government business is concerned-will persuade the Prime Minister of the day that such legislation deserves priority in the new Parliament.</p>

 I welcome Members across the House back to our deliberations on this important Bill. I hope that Opposition Members will recognise that elements of the amendments are a result of our discussions in Committee, and that I have reflected on the points that were made and come back with what I hope are helpful proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para26"><a name="10022358000249">As I have said, the new clause and the amendment arise from the debates in Committee. We have listened carefully to hon. Members, and are therefore proposing these important changes, which are designed to clarify the local government ombudsman's role as a provider of redress for the pupil and parent guarantees. New clause 17 will amend the parental complaints system that will form part of the redress for parents and pupils alleging a breach of the guarantees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="100223-0005.htm_para27"><a name="10022358000250">During our debate in Committee, many Members raised concerns that from time to time, complaints relating to a school that could serve only to absorb unduly the time and attention of a head teacher and governing body, with no real potential for a beneficial outcome, might be made to the local government ombudsman. In Committee, I provided the assurance that section 207(5)(b) of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009-the ASCL Act-is already framed so that the ombudsman may decide not to investigate a complaint, or to discontinue it, if he believes that the complaint is vexatious. He will have this discretion with any complaint, including those made in relation to the pupil and parent guarantees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="100223-0006.htm_para0"><a name="10022358000251">Having listened to the debate, however, I have concluded that it would be appropriate to strengthen this discretion to provide an even stronger safeguard for heads and governors. So subsection (2) of new clause 17 will amend the ASCL Act to allow the ombudsman discretion in cases where the complaint is "frivolous or vexatious".  <br>

This will ensure not only that the ombudsman will be able to decide not to pursue complaints that are clearly not in the best interest of parties concerned-vexatious complaints-but also that he has a clearly stated power to decline or discontinue investigation where complaints obviously lack merit or would be disproportionately costly to investigate, given the potential benefits-that is, frivolous complaints. I hope that hon. Members will welcome this change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="100223-0006.htm_para1"><a name="10022358000252">Subsection (3) of new clause 17 is a technical amendment extending defamation privilege to head teachers. It amends section 216 of the ASCL Act to ensure that any statement made by a head teacher in correspondence with, or subsequently published by, the ombudsman in a decision does not lead to the ombudsman or head teacher being sued for defamation. This small but important change will enable head teachers to be entirely candid in their views, and permit their evidence to be given and considered more openly, which can only promote the proper investigation of complaints. The amendment merely extends to head teachers the position that already applies to governing bodies and local authorities under the Local Government Act 1974 or the ASCL Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="100223-0006.htm_para2"><a name="10022358000253">We have made it clear in previous debates on the guarantees that it is not our intention to enable parents and pupils to pursue civil claims through the courts if a local authority, governing body, other proprietor of a school or head teacher does not meet one or more of the guarantees. However, we listened to Members' concerns in Committee-including points raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)-and we agree that this could be made more plain. The amendment will ensure that this is clear on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="100223-0006.htm_para3"><a name="10022358000254">The amendment refers to "liability in tort", which covers, most importantly, both liability in negligence and liability for breach of statutory duty. It will put beyond doubt that parents and pupils will not be able to pursue claims for damages through the county courts based on the individual guarantees in the document. It is, of course, right to say that parents and pupils already have a number of pre-existing rights, which will be unaffected by the changes implemented by the amendment. It will apply solely to the impact of the guarantees themselves. The amendment does not need to seek to prohibit a claim under contract law, as there is no way in which the guarantees can create contractual relations between schools and parents. We consider that any claim for contractual liability would be entirely unsustainable.</p>

Given that we also have an education system in which 40 per cent. leave primary school without having mastered the basics of reading, writing and maths combined, there is plenty of scope for complaints under these guarantees, particularly under guarantee 2.2, on page 24 of the guarantee document, which states that</p>

The only thing missing is a consideration to given rise to a contractual obligation, but surely the consideration in this instance is taxpayers' money.

 The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point, but does he not agree that there is a difference between this Bill and the 1998 Act? The home-school agreement is obviously a contract-a specific contract between home and school, which people must sign. It is relevant to an individual parent, an individual pupil, an individual school and an individual family. That is why the Act excluded it in terms of contract. The position in the Bill is entirely different. It is not necessary to rule out contracts, because no contractual agreements arise as a result of the guarantees in the Bill.</p>

 That says something about the extent to which the Minister feels that the guarantees are worth anything. Normally, if a private sector service provider gives a guarantee for the quality of his or her work, that is regarded as a contractual guarantee, just as the home-school agreement could constitute a guarantee. Although the Minister may well be right, I believe-this was the thinking behind the provision in the 1998 Act-that it is safer to include this provision in the Bill to ensure that that no action can be taken under contract law in future. There is surely no harm in including it.</p>

 I am not a lawyer. We have had this discussion before, and the hon. Gentleman has conceded that he is not a lawyer either. I am advised, however, that there is no contractual agreement.

If, however-as is probably the case, which is why I will not be calling for a vote on this issue-the guarantees are not really worth very much and this is merely political posturing, the Minister is right, and it will not be possible to enforce these provisions in the courts, regardless of whether that is explicitly ruled out in the legislation.</p>

He has listened, to some extent, to the criticisms of clauses 1 to 3, and in response he has offered some small and rather modest gifts to the Committee and the House to try to dispose of a few of the problems that will arise if the guarantees are ever implemented, which we must doubt.

Indeed, if we read the small print of some of these guarantees, we discover that in the commercial sector people would get into serious trouble for seeking to present them as guarantees.</p>

He was in the Treasury back in the early days when all those delivery targets were set. They often focused on inputs rather than outputs, and then the Treasury realised that it had got it all wrong. Because he is so experienced and knows all the flaws of setting targets in this way, he should not, as Secretary of State, have come up with such a lot of nonsense: so many guarantees that are unenforceable, or focus on inputs. He must know that he has cobbled these guarantees together on the back of a fag packet. Although he has sought to do that to create some dividing lines for electoral purposes, the guarantees deserve to be put in the waste paper basket before the election, rather than being implemented in such a way that they will be extremely difficult for any parent or pupil to enforce, and will give the ombudsman service an impossible job.</p>

 This group of amendments concerns a very serious subject: serious case reviews. This is the first opportunity that we have had since the baby Peter tragedy, more than a year ago now, to put forward our proposals, which we have been making for some time, as part of the relevant legislation. It is particularly important that we can do so today because, as you might know, Mr. Speaker, we did not reach this part of the Bill in Committee, so we were not able to have any debate about the operation of local safeguarding children boards or, specifically, our amendments on serious case reviews.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_9"><a name="100223-0007.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="10022367000158"><h5 align="left">4.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para18"><a name="10022367000024">I want to talk about four sets of amendments in this group. The most important is new clause 1, which is complementary to amendment 39. We have tabled a series of similar and technical amendments-amendments 35 to 38 and 40 to 45. Three further amendments-46, 47 and 48-concern the inspection of the operations of local safeguarding children boards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para19"><a name="10022367000025">Let me start by commenting on the operation of serious case reviews and the way in which they are commissioned by local safeguarding children boards. It is fitting that we have are having this debate now, because on Thursday it will be the 10th anniversary of the tragic death of Victoria Climbié, whose name resonates hugely with everyone in this country who has any remote interest in the safeguarding of vulnerable children. I am sure that everyone will agree that much more still needs to be done to safeguard our most vulnerable people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para20"><a name="10022367000026">In the past few days, we have heard about a further case involving violence towards a child known only as baby Y in Haringey, following on from the baby Peter case in Haringey and the Victoria Climbié case, which happened in Haringey 10 years ago, as I said. Just last month, we heard the incredible details of the torture of the 10 and 11-year-old boys in Edlington, Doncaster, by two boys of a similar age who were known to children's services and other agencies. Those two young boys were lucky to escape with their lives and they were the latest tragedies in that part of the United Kingdom after a catalogue of no fewer than seven deaths in Doncaster in a five-year period, five of which merited serious case reviews.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>23 Feb 2010 : Column 182</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para21"><a name="10022367000027">The trouble is that few people in this country are convinced that the lessons of the serious case reviews in Doncaster, in Haringey and in other high-profile areas of this country that have experienced similar tragedies have seriously been learned by those in a position to do something about the situation and to make the safeguarding environment better for vulnerable children and families. Public confidence in child protection in this country has been hugely undermined, particularly after the baby Peter case. Social workers and other professionals involved in child safeguarding feel demoralised and undermined up and down the country. The system simply is not working, which is why we feel that a more drastic overhaul and more drastic and immediate action is required than the Government are prepared to countenance. That is why we have tabled these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para22"><a name="10022367000028">The truth is that the number of children who are dying at the hands of parents and carers has not materially changed since the death of Victoria Climbié, despite significant investment that the Government have made-nobody is denying that-and despite huge structural changes. However, I fear that many of those changes have meant that attention and resources have been diverted to overhauling the system rather than dealing with the problem at the sharp end. That has proved counter-productive in many cases, and that situation remains despite the large amount of legislation that has been introduced, much of which we supported. In too many cases, the outcome of that legislation has been to exacerbate the bureaucracy that now surrounds too much of our child protection system. All that has to change. The first steps needed to bring about such change must be to have greater transparency, greater accountability and genuine learning from mistakes, and the public's confidence that that learning is taking place must be restored. It is no longer good enough for the Government to say, as I predict the Minister will say in reply, that serious case reviews must remain secret. They cannot trot out the same old excuses about protecting anonymity and then cite the various children's charities that oppose change for whatever reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para23"><a name="10022367000029">Back in December, the Government produced, "Working Together to Safeguard Children", chapter 8 of which dealt specifically with the future construction of serious case reviews. We welcomed many of the proposals in that document, but we think that it did not go far enough. It dealt with time scales-I think everyone agrees that we need to speed things up-and the extent to which we want to gather information. We want it to be as wide and as comprehensive as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para24"><a name="10022367000030">We now seem to talk about comprehensive executive summaries, which are just executive summaries, but there is no guarantee that executive summaries will reflect the complete story, chronology and analysis of what went wrong that led to a serious case review. We should all be able to learn from best practice when serious case reviews are carried out, but we do not know where best practice takes place because serious case reviews are not published. I was amazed by one aspect of the baby Peter tragedy that blew up last November, because I had assumed, quite wrongly, that serious case reviews were available in full to a much wider constituency of professionals than they are. I would assume that directors of children's services and other key professionals would automatically have access to full serious case reviews so that they could read those reports, even  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>23 Feb 2010 : Column 183</b><br>
confidentially, learn from them and see whether there were potential echoes in their own authority of what went wrong in another authority and do something about that urgently. But, no-a very small constituency of people get to see serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para25"><a name="10022367000031">There seems to be very little urgency in some of the reviews. One case review, in Doncaster, of the death in October 2004 of a child who was known very robotically as baby B05, was not produced until 2008-almost five years later. We now know about the underlying structural turmoil that was going on in that authority, despite the fact that the authority was described by Ofsted as "adequate". At the same time, locally commissioned reports and other front-line reports clearly stated that there were serious problems in that authority. It took almost five years to produce a serious case review. One would hope that someone could learn lessons from that and make improvements, but it took too long to produce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para26"><a name="10022367000032">A few weeks ago, a leaked copy of the full serious case review of the Edlington case was obtained by the BBC, and the BBC "Newsnight" programme read that report in full. Alongside that report, which ran to just over 150 pages, it also read the accompanying executive summary-or comprehensive executive summary-which ran to just 11 pages, including the title page. The BBC could clearly see serious anomalies between the full-blown serious case review and the executive summary. Indeed, they bore little resemblance to each other. The BBC made that patently clear, yet even when the executive summary of the serious case review of Edlington incident was exposed as a sham, the Government and the authorities in Doncaster refused to produce, in any form, a fuller version of the summary or a slimmed down version of the full serious case review. They were completely in denial, and the serious case review of a horrendous case remains suppressed, secret and available to only a few individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para27"><a name="10022367000033">It is no wonder, therefore, that confidence in the child protection system in this country is at an all-time low. To this day, I still do not understand why the Government were so steadfast in their refusal to produce anything other than a discredited executive summary of what went on in Doncaster.</p>

<p><a name="st_o162"><a name="10022367000034"><a name="100223-0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="10022367000167"><b>Mr. Edward Timpson (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend share my concern that, if we had seen only the executive summary, we would not have been aware that, on 31 separate occasions, nine agencies were involved that could have intervened, and so possibly have prevented the subsequent events from taking place?</p>

<p><a name="st_o163"><a name="10022367000035"><a name="100223-0007.htm_spnew4"><a name="10022367000168"><b>Tim Loughton:</b>
 That, of course, is exactly right, and it is why we need much fuller accounts of what goes wrong in tragedies like the Edlington and baby Peter cases than can be provided in brief serious case reviews, however comprehensive their title calls them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para28"><a name="10022367000036">We definitely need a radical overhaul of how serious case reviews are commissioned, compiled and published, as well as of how they are subsequently learned from and acted on. We need that to restore public confidence in child protection, and morale in the social worker profession. We also need it to ensure that all the agencies involved in safeguarding children can see clearly where mistakes have been made and can work to ensure that they will not be repeated, on their watch and in their patch, in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para29"><a name="10022367000037">In the past 18 months, I have travelled widely around children's services departments. I visit local authorities most weeks to speak to the people in the front line and the ones who manage those departments. Some children's organisations claim that they do not agree that serious case reviews should be published in full, and I am sure that, as usual, the Minister will give us a litany of them before long. However, despite those claims, the overwhelming view among the child protection social workers at the sharp end whom I meet is that they would be in favour of the full publication of serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para30"><a name="10022367000038">Full publication of the reviews would be in their interests. More importantly, it would be in the interests of vulnerable children and families, so I was pleased to see the stance taken by the British Association of Social Workers, which was confirmed in <i> The Times</i><i> </i>just last week. The association is the professional body for social workers, and it is headed-very skilfully, I might say-by a former colleague of the Minister in this House. He has committed BASW to campaigning for full publication of serious case reviews. The association represents the professionals who have to deal with these problems every day of the week at the sharp end. They now see the merits of exposing the weaknesses in serious case reviews, as opposed to suppressing them and keeping them secret, as has happened for too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para31"><a name="10022367000039">In <i> The Times</i> of 18 February, Hilton Dawson said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para33"><a name="10022367000041">In addition, <i> Community Care </i>magazine<i> ,</i> the bible of social workers-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> That name causes some tittering from the Secretary of State, but the magazine is used very widely by the social worker work force. The magazine has also committed itself to the publication of serious case reviews, and has been waging a very forceful campaign to that end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para34"><a name="10022367000042">I quote from a recent copy of <i> Community Care</i>:</p>
<a name="100223-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="10022367000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Serious case reviews are usually published only in summary. This limits learning. <i> Community Care</i> recommends that reviews be published in full so that practitioners can use specific details to inform their practice according to their experiences and roles. There is some resistance but it is possible to publish without harming anonymity . . . Names can be removed and reviews could be collated and distributed centrally, thereby disassociating them from specific local authorities, teams and known cases. It would help if reviews focused on learning not recrimination."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para35"><a name="10022367000043">I fully agree with that. The purpose is not a witch hunt or a blame game. It is to find out what went wrong, to learn from it and to make sure that it is less likely to happen in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="100223-0007.htm_para36"><a name="10022367000044">We will never abolish cruelty to children outright. There are evil individuals in society who will always seek to do evil to vulnerable people, including children-incredibly. What we can do is to make it as difficult as possible for those people to be able to perpetrate their crimes, and to make sure that everybody is working together to ensure that those opportunities are as limited as possible for the perpetrators of such crimes.</p>

 It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman should be rather less surprised by the attitude of the British Association of Social Workers. The purpose of serious case reviews is not and should not be to seek individual blame, but unless a fuller account is given than the one that is available in executive summaries prepared by organisations, it may be much harder to see the resource issues and the issues of institutional practice and culture which underpin so many of the meaningful conclusions that should be drawn from such reviews.</p>

 I agree. It is not merely a case of identifying certain individuals who did not perform the job to the required standard. It is necessary to find out why. Were there enough staff to cover the cases? Was the case overload too great? That has been the situation in many local authorities. Were resources not available when they were needed? Was all the work going on in the department reactive rather than preventive? Were social workers spending far too much time at their computers, having to fill in assessment forms, as is now the case?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para0"><a name="10022367000047">According to Unison, up to 80 per cent. of a social worker's time in child protection is spent filling in assessment forms, rather than at the sharp end with those children. Surely the most likely way of preventing harm to vulnerable children and families is for a professional, well-trained, well-resourced and well-motivated social worker to knock on a door and spend quality face-to-face time with that vulnerable family and the child. The social worker would then be able to make an informed decision as to whether intervention was required and at what level, rather than trying to second-guess it from a computer screen or from papers a long distance away in an office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para1"><a name="10022367000048">Serious case reviews should consider and analyse such questions in order to draw conclusions and make recommendations. That cannot be properly communicated in the space of an 11-page executive summary, whether or not it is called comprehensive, and that is the sort of thing that we need to know.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the absence of more detail in serious case reviews makes it difficult to look for patterns? It is the analysis of patterns that is key in identifying the circumstances where intervention is necessary. He is probably aware of Birmingham's analysis, from which the council found that judgment was very poor. We need to analyse patterns, and for that we need detailed serious case reviews.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. It is no good just looking at a serious case review in isolation, though we need to do that in full. If there are clear systemic weaknesses affecting many children's services departments, that is a serious job for central Government to undertake, rather than a localised issue for a local authority. One of my amendments, which I shall come to later, deals with analysing the work of local safeguarding children boards, which refers to the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>

families involved would be revealed. Clearly, many social workers working at the sharp end do not buy that argument. I do not buy that argument; I never have. Publication is in the best interests of social workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para3"><a name="10022367000052">Inevitably, when there is a tragedy such as the baby Peter case, the Doncaster case or others, social workers are always panned first. It is always assumed that if a baby or child who was on a local authority's radar dies in gruesome circumstances, it must be the fault of social workers. In some cases, that is true; in many cases, the system is at fault, as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) said; and in many other cases, other agencies have not done their bit. In the case of baby Peter, the paediatrician, whom we have heard about in the news this week, potentially had some shortcomings, and the police did not come out of it very well, either. However, social workers are always at the front of the queue to be panned, and they are always at the back of the queue to be congratulated and praised when things go right. They usually do go right, but that does not make for good news on the front page of a tabloid newspaper.</p>

 The Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families heard evidence that many children's social workers are the least experienced in the work force. They are put on the most complicated and difficult cases at the beginning of their career, and they can arrive in post having had placements and training that did not include children's social work. We need the full picture to ensure that, as my hon. Friend rightly says, social workers are not hung out to dry when there is systemic failure and a lack of support for often young and inexperienced people who are doing their best. We need to ensure that the true picture is seen so that people are not made scapegoats when they are not personally at fault.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. We know that part of the problem is the huge case load placed on social workers, particularly those in child protection, and the worryingly high vacancy rates, which on average exceed 15 per cent. across various authorities, but in others, particularly those in London, are as high as 40 per cent. Newly qualified social workers, with hardly any on-the-job training in often complex and sensitive child protection work, are thrown in at the deep end with really challenging cases. However, social work is not a science or a clear case of black and white; it involves experience, intuition and sensitivity-qualities that one cannot learn just from a book, but must learn on the job, preferably alongside a mentor who has years of experience to pass on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para4"><a name="10022367000055">The morale of social workers has been so undermined, partly because of those high-profile tragic cases, that there is a serious problem with people going into social work. We have expressed serious reservations about the standard of training that many social workers receive; about the entry qualifications, which need to be higher, for a social work degree; about the low pass mark required to obtain that degree; and about the lack of on-the-job training for social work graduates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para5"><a name="10022367000056">That is why back in 2007, in the report that the Conservative party commissioned on the role of children's social workers, we made specific recommendations about newly qualified social workers and raising the standard of training.

Moira Gibb's social worker task force has taken on board many of those recommendations, but they should have been taken on a long time before we reached this desperate impasse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para6"><a name="10022367000057">There is a further question. Why would social workers not want to co-operate with a serious case review that was going to be published in full? Why would they not want to co-operate with an investigation, when their profession may or may not be at fault in the tragic death of a vulnerable child? However anonymous and unpublicised serious case reviews are at the moment, that did not stop the names of key players in the baby Peter case and other tragic cases being splashed all over the front pages of certain newspapers. It did not stop the identity of culprits and, indeed, of children and siblings being exposed and made available in a matter of seconds on the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para7"><a name="10022367000058">Clearly, it should be possible to publish a full serious case review without compromising the identity of the key players involved. That is why our amendments are heavily subjected to key caveats: first, that serious case reviews should be published in full only where such publication did not compromise the welfare of surviving children or siblings, and it would have to be shown that that was the case; secondly, that those serious case reviews would be duly anonymised; and thirdly, that they would be appropriately redacted where that was necessary, say, to protect the identity and sensitivities of surviving children and families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para8"><a name="10022367000059">We have researched widely how we think that the new system should be structured. After deliberations with social workers, directors of children's services, departments of social work, academics and others, we think that a practical and suitable way ahead is to base the model of publication of serious case reviews on the practice that has existed for many years in mental health homicide reviews. Mental health homicide reviews are published in full, with various names of individuals anonymised-they may refer to "Dr. A" or "Nurse B"-and they are made widely available. It is generally agreed that they are good, thorough learning tools from which a much wider constituency of professionals can learn from the mistakes that have been made and determine what changes to the system, locally or nationally, need to be made to try to avoid their happening in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para9"><a name="10022367000060">The mental health homicide review into the tragic killing of Jonathan Zito ran to 177 pages. It was a tragic, but thorough and worthwhile report. One could contrast that with the 16-page executive summary on the death of baby Peter, which was found not to be worth the paper it was written on and had to be rewritten after the whole case came to light back in November. Why cannot we use a model, if not based on, then certainly much closer to, that which already exists and has worked perfectly well for many years for mental health homicides? The practice in those cases is that following a murder involving a patient who has recently been treated by the local mental health service, there must be an immediate investigation to identify what urgent action needs to be taken within 72 hours-a succinct internal investigation that is urgently done and urgently acted on. That is followed up by a much longer-in the Zito case, 177 pages-in-depth review, which is then published, subject to the various caveats about protecting anonymity, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para10"><a name="10022367000061">In new clause 1, we suggest that following the death of a child in connection with local children's services, there should be an initial review within 72 hours, and then a full-blown serious case review commissioned by an author approved by a body established by the Secretary of State under an order made by statutory instrument. It would then be incumbent on the local safeguarding children board to publish the serious case review in full, excluding any information that might lead to the identification of living parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para11"><a name="10022367000062">Subsection (2) refers to the authorship of such serious case reviews, because another issue comes up when we look at how they are commissioned. At the moment, it is up to the local safeguarding children board to find an author for a serious case review and commission him or her to produce the report, which is then written and submitted to the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para12"><a name="10022367000063">We need to ensure that the professionalism, probity and independence of serious case reviews are protected if they are to be meaningful, credible and effective documents. The trouble is that after the baby Peter case, Ofsted produced a report revealing that, at that stage, no fewer than 41 per cent. of the serious case reviews that were being produced on behalf of local safeguarding children boards were unsatisfactory. The quality of the reviews was seriously called into question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para13"><a name="10022367000064">I have spoken to a number of authors of serious case reviews-professionals and academics who are regularly called on to write them. There is at least anecdotal evidence that in some cases vested interests can operate in the preparation of reviews. The LSCB appoints a familiar author to produce a serious case review, in the hope that they will not condemn too heavily the local authority in the care of which a child has been killed. The author of the review wants repeat business from the local authority, and so may go light on their criticism of it. I am not saying that that practice is widespread-I certainly hope not-but there is clear potential for a conflict of interest. Given the depths to which confidence in the whole system has sunk, we need to do more to safeguard the credibility and probity of serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para14"><a name="10022367000065">That is why we suggest in our new clauses and amendments that when a serious case review is required, the LSCB should request an author from a centrally held register of professional SCR authors. The Secretary of State should appoint a body to hold that register of authors-a similar but rather beefed-up version of a system of expert witnesses who can be called upon to appear in court. That body would be responsible for ensuring that the authors on its register came up to scratch, that they had the necessary qualifications, and that they were monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the quality of their work was up to scratch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para15"><a name="10022367000066">I do not really mind what that body is. It might be a children's charity such as Barnardo's, or it might be the Local Government Association, for example. Indeed, the various local authorities across London have already been using a pool system of serious case review authors to call upon. If we had such a system, the reports that were produced would be much more likely to be above reproach. We desperately need such a change to restore confidence in the whole system. If the reports were then put in the public domain, so that all interested parties  <br>

That is proposed in new clause 21, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, with which I have a good deal of sympathy. It is no good just producing a serious case review, published or not, if it does not result in action. There is no formal checking mechanism at the moment, and there will not be one even if the changes that were discussed in the Government's December document about having some sort of subsequent audit are put in place.</p>

 Absolutely. That is entirely in harmony with the approach in our proposals. We need a very clear wall between the commissioners and the authors of reports. For the same reason, we need to ensure that whoever comes in subsequently to conduct an audit has no agenda of their own or conflict of interest. However, that could still mean someone whose name is held on the register that we are proposing. Someone with the professionalism, background and training to carry out initial SCRs could also carry out the audit to find out whether a review had been acted upon. The answer to the hon. Lady is yes-her proposal is very much along the same lines as ours.</p>

Clauses 28 and 29, to which the amendments would apply, are very widely drawn in that they establish a statutory obligation to provide information to LSCBs for any or all of their functions. That could include the release of confidential information about children, parents, siblings or, in a clinical context, patients. I have a deal of sympathy with the GMC and the BMA, which are concerned that if people are statutorily obliged to provide information to an LSCB, when the purpose for which that information is required is not made clear, there is a serious risk to patient confidentiality. In addition, the CRAE has expressed fears about the breaching of child confidentiality, particularly regarding information given by one child about another. The requirement included in clauses 28 and 29 is very wide ranging, and we therefore think it should be modified. Our amendments would specify that such information could be required only in so far as it can be shown to be necessary for the compilation of an SCR, and on an anonymised basis.</p>

question regarding the Data Protection Act 1998, which specifically requires that information is collected for a specified purpose, because under the clauses, nothing will be specified. May we have more detail about specified purposes? On what grounds, for example, could an agency withhold information? Could it withhold information if it believed that there was a risk of breaking the confidentiality of a child, a pupil or a patient? The CRAE has further said that any sharing of information by public bodies must be necessary, proportionate and in the pursuit of a legitimate aim in order to comply with human rights law. The question of whether the clauses as they are structured comply with that is a serious one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para19"><a name="10022367000072">The final tranche of proposals in this group is made up of amendments 46, 47 and 48. Amendment 46 would require the Secretary of State, by regulations, to make provisions for Ofsted to conduct reviews of LSCBs' performance of their specified functions. Clause 30 provides that the Secretary of State</p>
<a name="100223-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="10022367000143"><ul><p class="tabletext">"may by regulations make provision".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para20"><a name="10022367000073">This is an old favourite in Committees-although we did not have the opportunity to make the argument there this time-because we think that "may" should become "will". Questions have been raised about the way in which local safeguarding children boards operate. For example, there is confusion about the boards' exact role and purpose vis-à-vis children's trusts. After the baby Peter affair, the Secretary of State made changes to the composition of LSCBs which amounted to adding two lay members, but I am not sure how that improved their quality other than by increasing the size of the tables around which the boards sit. I worry that any decisions that LSCBs make will always be subject to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para21"><a name="10022367000074">I have serious qualms about Ofsted's ability to inspect children's social care departments, because there is a severe shortage of children's social care experts working for, or on the board of, Ofsted, but the operation of LSCBs needs to be examined on a better defined and more regimented basis. If it is to be the inspecting body, Ofsted should also review the effectiveness of LSCBs as a whole. Are they working properly and how do they interact with other agencies? That is the purpose of amendment 48. We suggest that LSCBs should be able to name and shame those agencies that, for example, have not co-operated with them in the compilation of serious case reviews. That is the flipside to the earlier amendments that we tabled about the supply of information for serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="100223-0008.htm_para22"><a name="10022367000075">The amendment also has another purpose. As matters stand, Ofsted does not inspect the way in which agencies work with each other in child protection. Clearly, a common feature of the failings that lead to serious case reviews is the weaknesses in inter-agency working. We think that Ofsted needs to look at that area of child protection and the operation of LSCBs much more carefully. Joined-up working is always an important part of the process and too often it is one of the failings that contribute to the tragedies that we see.</p>

I make no comment on the suitability of the new clause, other than to say that I am aware of the technical problem about the operation of certain religious organisations that have genuine concerns about whether corporal punishment may be used. However, I am also aware that the Secretary of State requested, in his letter on 28 January, that Sir Roger Singleton look into that matter in more detail.

 I said it quite clearly: I said that the Government have already asked Sir Roger Singleton to look into the matter, because there are genuine concerns that need to be looked at. However, I do not know whether those genuine concerns will turn out to be real or whether they will require action and the sort of new clause that has been put forward. I would like to wait for the evidence, which I think is the Government's position. When we have the report, which is due by the end of March-I think that is the time scale-we can make an informed decision about whether any action is required. My response to the Liberal Democrat new clause, therefore, is that it is premature-to put it kindly-because none of us really knows at this stage whether it is required. I would prefer to wait for the evidence before making a judgment.</p>

If we look at the history of serious case reviews, we will see that Ofsted has judged that the quality of a very large proportion has been unsatisfactory. In many cases, the summaries have been criticised for not reflecting the issues behind the cases, and their timeliness has been incredibly suspect, with many occasions on which one has waited for years after a shocking event. There are also doubts about Ofsted and its inspections within the children's services framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para1"><a name="10022367000083">Some time ago, we had a briefing from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which remains concerned about the full publication of serious case reviews. However, it made several proposals that it thought would improve the process, including working on the summaries, improving the quality of the serious case reviews and putting in a compliance or audit check so that an arm's length body can pick up on recommendations and check up on subsequent action 12 months after publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para2"><a name="10022367000084">Just before we came into the Chamber today, my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) picked up a letter that we had been sent. The letter is from the Secretary of State to the NSPCC. No doubt, in due course we will hear on the Floor of the House exactly how the Government propose to improve serious case reviews. The letter says that the Government will try to improve confidence in the quality of serious case reviews. Ofsted seems to have been put in charge of that, even though we are not yet that confident of its operation in the realm of children's services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para3"><a name="10022367000085">Compliance reports should be made publicly available, setting out the actions to be taken in response to serious case reviews, but there is no indication that anyone will take an independent look at compliance. The reason why I want to emphasise that point is that subsection (2) of new clause 21, standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil, highlights the need for independence in checking the responses to a serious case review. The letter to the NSPCC also refers to the NSPCC's desire that executive summaries should be improved. It is therefore interesting that even now the Government are not going the whole way and are not even responding to the NSPCC's concerns about putting that independence into the equation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para4"><a name="10022367000086">I thank the Secretary of State for allowing me to read the serious case review on the Edlington boys. I read it on behalf of my hon. Friend, and I have to say that I was genuinely surprised at how I felt after reading it. Members who are present are well aware that I work closely with the NSPCC and that I am really concerned about child protection. However, I can put my hand on my heart and say that I came out of the room-my locked room-after reading the review and I thought that pages and pages of it should become compulsory reading for anybody working in the children's work force, including teachers and children's social workers. I was surprised at my reaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para5"><a name="10022367000087">The review was leaked, of course, to the BBC and the press. I will quote from them, rather than from my recollection, so that I do not reveal anything. There were 31 occasions on which nine different agencies failed to act on the two brothers, aged 10 and 11, who were convicted of torturing and leaving two boys for dead. That is 31 occasions on which there were communication problems, and there are other examples-Pearl Harbour is a classic example-of where all the signals were there but nobody put them together. In order to learn something we have to go through the communication failures. Trainee workers need to read all the points that were missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para6"><a name="10022367000088">Of course it is easy to be clever in hindsight-I am not making judgments about the people involved-but the lessons were there for training the work force.

the premise that we publish as much of the serious case review as we can without harming members of the family or other individuals who might be involved. I, too, picked up the points about the fuller publication of serious case reviews, which the British Association of Social Workers is supporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para7"><a name="10022367000089">I ask the Government today to reconsider the issue. I am not here to make political points: when I read that serious case review, I was staggered by the things in it that should be revealed to people already in the work force and those entering it. We cannot move on unless we learn those lessons. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches will therefore support the Conservatives' new clause 1. We would have liked to combine it with our proposals, but the point will be made that if we are to learn the lessons, there is a strong case for making more information public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para8"><a name="10022367000090">I understand from reading the serious case review from Edlington that it was the eighth such review that Doncaster had carried out in recent years. This leads me to ask what lessons have been learned from the previous cases, given that they have not been published. Not very many, it seems. Of course I take on board the enormous pressures on social workers, the lack of training and the high case loads, but if we picked up all those elements with total transparency, it would lead to a bigger commitment from society to addressing the deficiencies in the system rather than the people. We are therefore absolutely convinced that we need to move in completely the opposite direction. We cannot improve matters by a drip, drip, drip method of doing a bit more here and there. We need to start from the other end. Let us publish as much as we can without risking injury to anyone and without damaging reputations, perhaps of members of the wider family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para9"><a name="10022367000091">I should like to touch on the Conservatives' amendments 35 to 45. I, too, looked at the representations from the British Medical Association and the General Medical Council; what sensible representations they were. In clause 28, proposed new section 14B(2) states:</p>
<a name="100223-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="10022367000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The first condition is that the request is made for the purpose of enabling or assisting the Board to perform its functions."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para10"><a name="10022367000092">That seems a very wide request. I looked at the Bill's explanatory notes on the clause, but they left me none the wiser-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am relieved that I am not the only one who thought that they confused the issue, rather than clarifying it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="100223-0009.htm_para11"><a name="10022367000093">Although I quite understand the point that members of the medical profession are making-and I agree that the Government need to look again at this part of the Bill as it makes its progress through the other place-I am concerned that the Conservative amendments would narrow the options down too much. I believe that local safeguarding children boards will need to share information on issues other than just the serious case reviews. Those reviews might well be the most important aspect of the work, but they take place after something has gone wrong, and LSCBs should also be involved in prevention. Information should be shared, for example, in cases of child abuse and the sexual exploitation of children. A serious case review might have been undertaken on one member of a family, but information about another member of that family-baby P's sister, for example-might also need to be shared.</p>

 In what cases does the hon. Lady think it would be legitimate to place a statutory responsibility on various agencies to provide information to an LSCB?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, because it takes me on to amendment 88, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats. In it, we try to tackle that issue in a slightly different way. It proposes:</p>

 I thought that I had answered the hon.

It cannot be right to share information only in respect of serious case reviews, as the Conservatives suggest, because there are many other instances where it will be necessary, as I am sure that the Secretary of State will tell us. Equally, I cannot believe that every single function of the safeguarding children board will require such sharing of information.</p>

It is always one of my great concerns whether children and young people will seek help from organisations if they feel that information about them is going to be shared. Doctors sometimes work confidentially in the best interests of the child, but the child might not seek help if they felt that the information was going to be shared.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the concerns raised by the hon. Lady-and, indeed, the hon.

Does she not think, however, that GPs might be more reluctant to share information in the compilation of a serious case review if they thought that it was going to be made public? Would that not make it less likely that GPs would co-operate with the process for the very reasons put forward by both Opposition Front-Bench teams, which seem wholly to contradict the argument that they made about the publication of serious case reviews?</p>

 It is extremely important to change the culture when it comes to co-operation on serious case reviews. I find astounding the suggestion that professionals will hold back, as it is part of their job or their oath to their profession not to do so. As to the confidential aspects, we are talking about redacting and anonymising where appropriate.

children in the remaining voluntary settings. Professionals and concerned Muslims, for example, have found it difficult to persuade parents or children to make complaints about the use of physical punishment. As long ago as 2006, the leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain said the Muslim community was in a state of denial over child mistreatment in madrassahs, and that it was an unacceptable dereliction of duty not to protect those children for fear of being accused of cultural insensitivity. The issue has arisen because the concern was expressed by the Muslim Parliament. Madrassahs are estimated to run nearly 1,600 part-time, weekend or evening Islamic schools, teaching as many as 200,000 children overall.</p>

 It is true that many people think smacking should be banned across the board, but that view has been tested in this House. More recently, however, a gap in the current legislation has been identified. This new clause is not an attempt to rehearse the old arguments; rather, it is intended to be a positive contribution to achieving the ambition of ensuring that our children are protected.

 I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. Where a child is in the care of a local authority and it shares parental responsibility with the parents, who within the local authority would be categorised as the person with parental responsibility for the child who can therefore justify battery?

The reason why I am speaking at length today is because I want this Government to promise to address this serious issue.</p>

contents of new clause 1. However, I acknowledge that the recent changes made to the workings of serious case reviews and local safeguarding children boards by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State are also important and ought to be mentioned. I am talking about the fact that the boards should have an independent chair-that is one deficiency that I can see in the matters to which I wish to refer-and that two lay people should be members of these boards. I have met people from my local board to discuss the matters to which I wish to refer, so I am able to say that those lay people might find themselves in a difficult position. If they are to be effective, they will require a great deal of support, back-up and extra bureaucratic and research capacity in order to have the confidence to raise issues as the only lay members in a body that is otherwise dominated by professionals. My Front-Bench colleagues may wish to refer to that later.</p>

One related to a constituency case where a baby burned to death in a property. The baby's mother had a history of mental illness and other difficulties. At first she said that people from the neighbourhood had come into the house and burned it down-hon. Members will appreciate how damaging that was to the local community-but subsequently it became clear that she was responsible for the death of the child, which triggered the serious case review.</p>

It also makes it clear that at the birth of her baby, her attitude changed and she was a devoted and careful mother. Research carried out later, which came to my attention and was brought about by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, leads me to think that this is a classic case of what is known in the research field as "start again syndrome". I am grateful to the research commissioned by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for that discovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para12"><a name="10022367000139">I looked further into the case and discovered that both serious case reviews carried out within a year concerning the death of children were carried out by the same person, who was the regional chair of a charity that received grant aid from the local authority that was running the local safeguarding children board. I am troubled by that. Let me make it clear that the lady who authored the two serious case reviews did not receive any benefit as a result of the grant aid. I make no suggestion of anything like that, but none the less I am troubled by the idea that two serious case reviews in the same time frame can be carried out by the same person who is also acting in a lay and voluntary capacity and receiving a grant from the local authority that supports the local safeguarding children board.

<p>I am troubled by these matters, as well as by the phrases that express the idea that things that were not predictable could not have been prevented-if we applied them to other matters with which this House deals, we would all be very troubled by them.

 I understand that but, as I may be able to explain as I move into the argument, the law on this subject is perhaps a little more complex than the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para13"><a name="10022380000008">Let me go back to what I was saying.

It clearly infers-I want to get this out of the way-that those with parental responsibility for a child, within that meaning, could justify the battery of a child on the ground that it constituted reasonable punishment. The question that we must address is whether those in the list that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para16"><a name="10022380000017">The legal effect of section 58 of the 2004 Act-it might be helpful for the Secretary of State to listen to this-is to remove the defence of reasonable punishment in any charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, or of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm, under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, or in any charge of cruelty to a child under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. I think that we all want to avoid any disproportionate treatment, chastisement or punishment of a child that falls within the category of a charge of cruelty, wounding or grievous bodily harm. The problem arises in the context of case law and the interaction between that case law, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights, which I shall discuss in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para17"><a name="10022380000018">The defence of reasonable punishment dates back to 1860, when the characteristics were spelt out by the judiciary because there were no relevant statutes at that time. In one case, Chief Justice Cockburn said:</p>
<a name="100223-0010.htm_brev9"><a name="10022380000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">"By the law of England, a parent...may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child, inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para18"><a name="10022380000019">The legal position was that it was then left to the courts, or to juries, to decide what was moderate and reasonable in the view of an ordinary person in any particular case. Of course, people's views on such matters alter and evolve over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para19"><a name="10022380000020">I suspect that the Secretary of State well knows that between 1860 and 2004, a parent who was charged with a crime relating to an assault on their child was able to raise the defence of reasonable punishment. However, since the enactment of section 58 of the 2004 Act, that defence cannot be used unless the defendant is charged only with common assault, the victim is a child, and the defendant is the parent of that child or is a person acting in loco parentis.</p>

 That is where I am about to move to, but we needed to identify the parameters before moving to questions of substance and merit. It is arguable that there are circumstances in which people in loco parentis-that includes not just parents, but people with parental responsibility, so it is a reasonably wide category-should be able to take certain actions. The question is whether teachers and those in similar positions of responsibility should have the right in certain circumstances to take such action as would be available to a person in loco parentis, and whether they could therefore be justified in taking action that would amount to what one might call, in round language, reasonable chastisement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="100223-0010.htm_para20"><a name="10022380000025">I am sure that the Secretary of State knows that there are problems in schools. Evidence has recently been presented to me of teachers being subjected to extremely difficult circumstances, including violent behaviour. We must ask whether there should be a blanket prohibition on certain actions, without regard to the circumstances of the parent or other person in loco parentis. The definition of children includes not only five, six and seven-year-olds, but older children who might be described as youths. That applies not only to boys; I regret to say that these days it might also apply to girls. In some cases a school, or another establishment of the kind to which the Secretary of State and I agree that the rule might apply, might be in such a state that the person who is charged with maintaining discipline might not be able to run things. I have heard from supply teachers, fairly recently, that they have found it absolutely impossible to conduct any teaching in certain classrooms because of the degree of bad behaviour and violence exhibited.</p>

 I do not put it in quite such precise terms as the hon. Lady would like to draw me into doing. I am deeply concerned about the shift, since 1998, when the new standards were introduced.

 I am very sorry to disappoint the hon.

It was not to do with human rights; it was to do with the Conservative Government of 1996 doing the right thing-perhaps with, or perhaps without, his support.</p>

 The short answer to that question is that, as I said earlier, all such matters are subject to review in the light of the circumstances of the time. On the whole, one would rather not have corporal punishment in schools, but teachers and those who observe these matters have wondered whether the prohibition against such punishment is justified. That is an important question, as circumstances evolve.</p>

 I hesitate to ask, but does the hon. Gentleman recall whether he voted for or against the 1996 Act?

 The fact that the Human Rights Act was not passed until 1998 would not have prevented somebody from making a judgment based on the European convention on human rights in a case of the sort that I shall describe, because such a case could have gone to the Strasbourg Court. The fact that the Education Act was passed in 1996 not in 1998 does not matter that much, as the ECHR is the essence of the 1998 Act and the rule of incompatibility means that our legislation can be overridden.</p>

 I understand that entirely, Madam Deputy Speaker. However, the right hon.

For example, if a school was under siege by very violent pupils, is there absolutely no question about the fact that no form of physical punishment could be used by teachers? My question has to do not with the ECHR, but with what is needed in the interests of school discipline.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that school teachers are sometimes in loco parentis?

That is a very difficult line to tread.</p>

 That is exactly my point. I entirely agree that teachers are in a difficult position, and that it is easy to have a knee-jerk reaction either way. On the one hand, we can say that there must be absolutely no physical punishment of any description; on the other hand, however, we have to accept that there can be circumstances when it is impossible for a specific child in a specific classroom to be treated in that way.</p>

 It has been used in a great number of cases. As I said earlier, many of them turned on the application of the European convention on human rights through the European Court of Human Rights. One interesting case involved a person accused of engaging in unreasonable behaviour vis-à-vis a child. The jury acquitted the person in question, but the case was then overridden by the European Court on the grounds of human rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="100223-0011.htm_para7"><a name="10022380000046">I find this a very difficult issue. A jury in a criminal case might conclude, on the basis of the evidence given, that the accused should be acquitted. However, when the case is referred to the European Court, that Court can say that it does not care about a decision made under English or UK law. The European Court can say, "We have our principles and we're going to apply them, irrespective of other law." In effect, it can override our criminal law, and I find that very difficult to accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="100223-0011.htm_para8"><a name="10022380000047">What has happened since-this is obviously part and parcel of the proposed amendments to the Children Act 2004 as well-is that the Government have made an assessment of the extent to which, as an absolute rule, there must be no infliction of any physical punishment at all, whether reasonable or not. It appears that that prohibition applies even when the punishment causes a mere reddening of the skin and is permissible according to the legal analysis to which I referred earlier.</p>

The convention imposes severe constraints on the punishment of children, and from that flowed the consequences that the Secretary of State mentioned in the Act that followed. The concept of reasonable chastisement has been in our common law and understood in our legislation for a long time, and the European Court of Human Rights can and does apply United Nations treaties on these matters when developing its own case law.

 The Secretary of State is adopting the role of Confused.com and trying to arbitrate in the matter.

 The problem that the hon.

For the purposes of society in general, and also for the conduct of the school and the discipline within it, it is not a distinction that can easily be made. If the object of the exercise is to ensure that there is a proper balance of behaviour in the interests of society as a whole, including in schools, one cannot simply say that because it is a school, there can be no reasonable physical punishment whatever, but  <br>

there can be in loco parentis. I could spend some time, although I shall not, on the very wide definition of "in loco parentis".

 Further to the comments of the hon.

 I agree. I concede that this is a difficult area, but it is important that we do not lock ourselves into a situation whereby we apply an absolute principle based on the so-called philosophical attitude. There are moral questions that depend on the manner in which, for example, a school can and should be run in the interests of all the people in that school, including all the children in a class and the teachers themselves. There is a balance to be struck. That is what I am arguing for, and part of the purpose of our debates in the House is to try to draw attention to the fact that balances need to be struck.</p>

New clause 10 would make the situation more confusing, and I hope that the Secretary of State's response will be a revelation. However, I do not think that it will avoid the existing problem with getting the balance right between violent children on the one hand and the need for discipline in schools on the other.</p>

There is no prohibition on the use of force in those particular and prescribed circumstances, but the 1996 Act is clear that the use of force for punishment in full-time maintained schools and full-time independent schools is prohibited in law. Soon, part-time independent schools will be covered, too. It is illegal to use force for punishment, as opposed to protection.</p>

Member for Stone said it has been for many decades, for a parent or someone in loco parentis to use the reasonable punishment defence for the use of force, but not for causing harm such as actual or grievous bodily harm. The provision in section 58 applies only to common assault. As I said to my hon. Friend, it became clear when the issue was raised some weeks ago that there is a grey area within the definition of in loco parentis. Some individuals can be described as acting in loco parentis, and they could therefore use reasonable punishment outside of a full-time maintained school-where they cannot use that defence. To us, such individuals might look more like teachers than parents. An example would be the madrassah teacher, the Sunday school teacher or the sports club coach, and the question arises: can they use the reasonable punishment defence as a reason to strike a child legally?</p>

Member for Stone wondered whether we should extend the in loco parentis option for using force into full-time maintained schools, and argued that there may be-he did not say this absolutely-circumstances when a teacher should have the right to use the reasonable punishment defence to strike a child. That means that he wants to move from the grey area by making it possible to use that defence in schools. As I understand my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley, new clause 10 tries to go in precisely the opposite direction by defining someone acting in loco parentis only as someone who is genuinely the parent with parental responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="100223-0012.htm_para2"><a name="10022382000031">In replying to earlier debates, I said that as far as I was concerned, a teacher should not be striking a child whatever setting they are working in, but there is clearly a grey area in law. I then wrote to our adviser, Sir Roger Singleton, to set out my concerns about that grey area following discussions with the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, and particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley, and I asked Sir Roger to look into the issue and report back to me. He wrote to me on 27 January. In that letter, he said that he, too, was worried that there was the potential for people who were acting in loco parentis by teaching a child at arm's length from the role of parent being able to use the reasonable punishment defence. He referred to Saturday and Sunday school teachers, youth workers, music teachers or home tutors, and went on to say:</p>
<a name="100223-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="10022382000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">"There is another group-those carers without parental responsibility to whom parents may entrust their children, such as step-parents and grandparents, or...friends and babysitters-who may also"</p>

They would not be the parent under the definition referred to in the Bill, but might be seen by us as somebody who was acting in a parental way. If I, as a parent, sent my child to a Sunday school, I would not expect the Sunday school teacher to strike my child, but if I had entrusted them to a grandparent or a step-parent, the question would be whether I thought that that situation was more like that of the Sunday school teacher or someone acting with parental responsibility.</p>

New clause 10 would mean that only a parent or guardian would be able to use a reasonable punishment defence, so it would exclude not only the Sunday school teacher or madrassah teacher but the step-parent, grandparent, friend or babysitter. Many of us would think that that went too far, and that is why we are worried that the definitions in the new clause are too restrictive. That was certainly Sir Roger's concern when he wrote to me in January. He also wanted to know how this would operate in practice and how we would ensure that it was properly monitored.</p>

I guarantee to the House that I will respond to his report on the day that he makes it. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole spoke of wanting things done before we go into purdah. I do not know what timetables we are going to have- Lord Mandelson has not yet told me of his plans, nor of the Prime Minister's-but when the report comes out at the end of March, I will respond immediately. My expectation, and my personal view, is that the right thing for us is to do is to tighten up the law. I would rather move more in the direction of a tighter definition than of a wider definition. I am sympathetic to the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, but at the moment we do not know quite how to define this, and that is why Sir Roger needs to finish his work.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his clear exposition of where he stands.

It may be that he and I would not agree even on that, but at least it would remove a lot of the problems relating to the expressions "in loco parentis" or "parental responsibility", which the courts have extended in a whole variety of ways.

 The hon. Lady is right. It was because people in this House, and people with expertise and direct personal experience, including my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley, raised particular issues, that the matter is on the agenda. I fear that the hon. Member for Stone may want to broaden the agenda further than I, and probably those on both Front Benches, would seek to do. I am happy to consider a further amendment at any point, but I hope that we now have enough clarity to move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="100223-0012.htm_para8"><a name="10022382000042">Let me turn to the safeguarding issues that were raised-some hours ago, as it now seems-by the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, and then by my hon. Friends the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) and for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley). The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham contextualised this by looking back over the past year. He pointed to the fact that we have just passed the anniversary of the tragedy of the death of baby Peter and that we have had, since then, other individual acts of cruelty and suffering that are very distressing. He referred to our frustration and upset that this should have happened in Haringey after the death of Victoria Climbié, which was now 10 years ago, pretty much to the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="100223-0012.htm_para9"><a name="10022382000043">I think that the hon. Gentleman gave credit to some of the progress that has been made in the past year, although probably insufficiently so. We have had today the publication of Ofsted's second inspection report, following the first joint area review inspection a year ago, which gives a good report on Haringey children's services and the progress that has been made in the past year. I would like to put on record in the House my appreciation to the leader of the council, the director of children's services and the chief executive for the progress that they have made, which Ofsted has recognised today, while not for a minute suggesting that we are out of the woods. There is still more to do to ensure that children are fully and properly safe in Haringey, but there has been real progress there. There is also the work of the social work taskforce, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, under the chairmanship of Moira Gibb. This has been seen, by the taskforce itself, and by the wider social work world, as a real watershed moment-that was the language that it used to describe the extra investment, support, challenge and training that are now going into the social work profession.</p>

Gentleman talked about a collapse in morale, but in the past few months more people have come forward in response to our advertising and said that they wanted to be considered for training as social workers than at any time for many years. That shows that out of a tragic situation and tragic circumstances, there is a fuller understanding of the role that social workers play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="100223-0012.htm_para11"><a name="10022382000045">I was particularly heartened when <i> The Sun</i>, not a supporter of the Government these days, ran an editorial in September praising the work of social workers. That was one reflection of the changing mood over the past year. It is not right to say this is a time of only bad news for social work. In fact, out of a tragedy a year ago, and, I would like to think, through cross-party effort-at times it has not felt as cross-party as one might have thought it would be on such a sensitive issue as child protection, but let us put that to one side-we are in a stronger position than we were then. That is not least because of the work of the social work taskforce following Lord Laming's excellent report published almost a year ago.</p>

 I genuinely hope that we do get more people coming forward to be social workers who are of sufficient calibre and are trained to a sufficient standard to do the job that we desperately need them to. However, will the Secretary of State not admit that back in 2002, when there was a recruiting exercise for more social workers, a lot of people came forward but very few stayed the course and went on to be the child protection social workers of the great calibre that we need? We are in danger of the same thing happening now.</p>

 As the social work taskforce has stated, initial training, training within the profession, pay and progression and the supervision of social workers at the front line by management have all been inadequate for years. They are now being addressed, because of the taskforce's work, Lord Laming's impetus and the tragedy of baby Peter a year ago, in a way that is revolutionary and quite different from anything that we have seen in recent years. That is why I am cautiously confident that we will be able to look back on last year and say that 2009 was the year when, for the first time, we properly recognised, financed, resourced and supported the role that social workers play, particularly in the difficult area of child protection.</p>

 The rise in referrals, which means that harm is coming to the attention of the authorities, has been a real challenge for children's social services departments around the country. It has been the result of the heightened awareness of child protection issues among not just social workers but other individuals and professionals who work with children. The hon.

 I apologise to the Secretary of State for not having been very clear. By "serious incident notifications" I meant the notifications to Ofsted that are the formal process by which most serious case reviews are kicked off following the death of a child. The increase in serious incident notifications in 2009 compared with 2008 refers to those following the death of a child.</p>

The measures that we have debated today will take forward Lord Laming's recommendation in two areas-further strengthening the serious case review process and improving the working of local safeguarding children boards.

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="100223-0012.htm_para15"><a name="10022382000055">The statutory guidance "Working together to safeguard children", which we have updated in recent months in line with Lord Laming's recommendations, is an important step forward. We have already strengthened the requirements in that document to have thorough, comprehensive serious case reviews whenever a child is seriously harmed and to ensure that immediate lessons are learned and implemented before the publication of the executive summary and the completion of the full review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="100223-0012.htm_para16"><a name="10022382000056">I know that there is debate in the House about the publication of full serious case reviews, and it has arisen again in recent weeks because of the executive summary of the Edlington review following the tragic events in Doncaster last year. It is important to say that the executive summary of that serious case review, which Ofsted rated as a good summary, was drawn up under the old, more restricted guidelines for the preparation of executive summaries. It would not be state-of-the-art today. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole made powerful points about her reaction having read the serious case review, and I had the same reaction. I was shocked and surprised by the extent of multiple engagement of children's services in Doncaster with the child in question. Under the new guidelines, that would be more fully set out in the executive summary than it was under the one drawn up on the old basis.</p>

It is important to say that in the context of the remarks that we heard earlier about the importance or otherwise of children learning boundaries through punishment and physical harm. Those boys did not learn boundaries, and they lost any moral sense because they grew up in a family in which there was none. That was part of the problem.</p>

putting into the public domain the details of the harm suffered not just by those boys but by other siblings in the household. Those details could then have been seen by other children, young people and adults in the same part of Doncaster. That would have been the wrong thing to do not only for the boys who perpetrated the crime but for the victims of the crime, whose suffering is there for us to see in the serious case review, and for the other siblings, who were not named in the court case but are named in the review. The harm that they suffered, which is material to the case, would have been there to see. I defy the hon.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for being true to form by trooping out the usual suspects, including the NSPCC. I have some questions for him. First, why was the letter that he sent to the NSPCC, which contains information that is very germane to today's debate, released to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) at only 3.12 pm this afternoon, just before we started the debate, and why was it not made available to other Members of the House? Secondly, on the NSPCC, how many times has the NSPCC been mentioned in executive summaries of SCRs? Would the NSPCC have been mentioned in the executive summary of an SCR into the Victoria Climbié case, because it was certainly implicated in the full Laming report? It is most likely that that would not have come out in an executive summary.</p>

 I hear the hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not agree with it. I do not agree that the NSPCC is a "usual suspect", and I do not believe that it makes its arguments for self-interested motives as a way of trying to cover up its role in any cases. The NSPCC is an upstanding, highly respected, very professional organisation. To talk down its contribution to the debate by suggesting that it is trying to cover up its complicity in past failures is actually wrong and completely unfair. I do not know how many times the NSPCC has been in executive summaries-I have not checked.</p>

I wrote to the NSPCC today, because I wanted to be able to refer to its letter in the debate. In my letter to the NSPCC, I stated that it has raised serious issues regarding the monitoring of SCRs and the implementation of its recommendations one year on. We will ensure that when we publish our progress report one year on from the Laming review in the next few weeks, we will incorporate the NSPCC's views following our discussions and meetings.</p>

 Will the Secretary of State address the proposal in new clause 1 on the appointment of the author of SCRs? Is he satisfied with the current process for doing that in the light of the extremely enlightening examples given to us by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins)?</p>

 I was coming to that issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central made important points. He has raised questions in the past as to whether the authors of SCRs are properly independent.  <br>

As he knows, one reason why the first SCR into baby Peter was rejected and redone was precisely that it was not seen to be drawn up independently. Following Lord Laming's report this spring, we have now changed our statutory guidance to reflect the view that the SCR must now be independently chaired. That is a requirement in law. We also now have a training package for SCR chairs and overview authors to ensure that they are properly prepared for that work. Lord Laming's work addressed exactly the issue that my hon. Friend has raised. It is true that some SCRs were not independently drawn up-</p>

 Order. I apologise for interrupting the Secretary of State, but it is difficult for <i> Hansard </i>writers to hear him when his back is to the Chair.</p>

 I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker-I was addressing my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central. His points are important, and they have been addressed by Lord Laming's recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para2"><a name="10022382000073">Amendments 35 to 40 are on whether we should list agencies that contribute to SCRs. We are clear that the executive summary needs to have a much clearer time line of what has happened in cases. I do not think that that happened fully in the Doncaster-Edlington SCR, but it will under the new guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para3"><a name="10022382000074">Practitioners must be confident that they can disclose relevant information in co-operating fully with SCRs. I do not believe that any steps should be taken that would reduce the willingness of individuals to contribute to SCRs. That is not the right way to go. However, it is important-Lord Laming highlighted this in his report-to ensure that all information can be given in the SCR process. The measure clarifies that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para4"><a name="10022382000075">The amendments would mean that such information is provided only to SCRs. However, there will be occasions on which LSCBs have an obligation to collect information for reports that are not SCRs. For example, following the death of a child, the LSCB must ask professionals to provide information, so that it can produce the child death review, which it must now provide after the death of every child. That can go widely to involve, for example, deaths from road traffic accidents or sudden infant death syndrome, when it is important to get information from general or hospital practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para5"><a name="10022382000076">It is also important for the LSCB to know-this relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North-that adequate safeguarding procedures training is being done in our schools for full-time and temporary staff. Again, that is a matter for the LSCB. To restrict the collection of information only to SCRs would undermine child death reviews and that important staff training function. Again, I therefore urge hon. Members not to press their proposals to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para6"><a name="10022382000077">On amendment 88, which is on requests for information related to an SCR, it is important to ensure that the LSCB has proper information-sharing arrangements and protocols, and that they are properly kept under review. We are speaking to the agencies on those matters, and we will clarify the situation and revise statutory guidance to ensure that that is done properly. Again, we can do that without the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para7"><a name="10022382000078">Amendment 48 and consequent amendments are, in our view, unnecessarily restrictive on Ofsted's role. It is clear what the role of Ofsted is in inspecting the effectiveness of LSCBs. We will ensure that that happens through the regular area-wide reviews. We can also ensure that Ofsted looks at the compliance report that we will produce one year on after every SCR. However, in our judgment, we do not need to place the restrictions on Ofsted that are proposed in amendments 48 and 90.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para8"><a name="10022382000079">In a few weeks' time, we will publish our progress report, a year on from Lord Laming's report. We now have the national safeguarding delivery unit up and running, which is a step forward. We have already revised "Working Together", and will do so further following the input of the NSPCC and other organisations, to ensure that we have full, state-of-the-art executive summaries for serious case reviews, and that actions are properly implemented and monitored. We think that the restrictions in the amendments are unnecessary, and in particular we believe that to publish the full serious case review as a matter of policy-in the face of all the expert advice from all those people working in child protection-would be a backward step for children. It would put their safety at risk and mean that they, their families and other professionals would be less likely to co-operate. That would mean that we would be less likely to learn the lessons of terrible incidents in the future. It would be a retrograde step for child protection, and I urge the House to reject new clause 1.</p>

 I concur with the Secretary of State that we have had a good debate. It was a debate that we needed to have, because we missed having it in Committee. It has been constructive and measured, and almost non-partisan. But it ended with the Secretary of State not really giving us any assurance that we have moved on. He said that clauses 28 to 30 took the strengthening of serious case reviews forward. How? Serious case reviews are not even mentioned on the face of the Bill. We are only debating serious case reviews today because of our amendments and new clauses. Everything that the Secretary of State talked about has not happened, and the public do not have confidence that it will happen to the extent necessary for people to feel again that children and vulnerable families are being properly safeguarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para9"><a name="10022386000004">We had an interesting, if confusing, debate on new clause 10; at one stage it entered a parallel universe. I was very interested in the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), and it was very useful that the Secretary of State cleared up the confusion by saying that there is no confusion, and that we are not confused about what we are not confused about-and that what we are not confused about we do not know we are not confused about. That made everything very clear. I was disappointed with my hon. Friend the Member for Stone because it took him 11 minutes before he gave the issue of reasonable chastisement a European dimension. Clearly he is slow off the mark after the half-term recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para10"><a name="10022386000005">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) spoke to the new clause, and I concur with the Secretary of State that there is a grey area that may need to be addressed in legislation. The hon. Lady was right to say that the only reason why we are debating this issue today is that amendments were tabled  <br>

in Committee that we were not able to debate. The result is that Sir Roger Singleton has been engaged to look into those grey areas and report what action, if any, is required. So the job has been done. We now await empirical evidence of whether changes need to be made. By the hon. Lady's own logic, I would have thought that she would not press the new clause to a Division. We need to hear the evidence, not to prejudge it. In any case, smacking has always been an issue for a free vote on this side of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para11"><a name="10022386000006">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) made some pertinent points from real experience of horrific deaths in his constituency involving serious case reviews that had not passed muster-contemporary serious case reviews that were not complementary, and which raised serious questions about the independence of their authorship. One phrase he used that struck me in particular was "the culture of justification" of what had taken place. That is why we need a radical change. We cannot go on producing the same old serious case reviews with assurances that we now have comprehensive executive summaries and everything has been done under the new system. We are still not entitled to see the evidence. We still cannot see the proof that what went wrong has been properly laid bare, or that what needs to go right in the future will do, because the lessons have been learned. They will continue to be kept secret, and that is not acceptable. If we are to restore any confidence in the system of safeguarding children, transparency and accountability have to underlie everything to do with serious case reviews and learning the lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para12"><a name="10022386000007">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley) slightly confused the points that I made about our amendments and the functions of LSCBs. The clauses in the Bill refer only to the supply of information. The hon. Lady rightly said that LSCBs conduct a range of other useful functions, including training. It is right that they should do so, and our amendments would affect none of that. The amendments refer only to the supply of information, so she need have no anxieties on that score.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para13"><a name="10022386000008">The executive summary of the horrific case in Edlington, and the disparity with the full 150-page serious case review, blew the whole scam sky high. It has been clearly shown that there was no resemblance between the full serious case review-which was to be kept secret, available only to a small select body of people-and the 11 pages of comprehensive executive summary. There is no excuse for officials and councillors in Doncaster, either of their own volition or under instruction from the Secretary of State, not to publish if not the full serious case review, a much bigger version of it. A system in which the public are denied the full story-or, as in the Doncaster case, are actually misled about what really happened-can have no credibility. Without that information we cannot learn the lessons, rectify the mistakes, or move on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para14"><a name="10022386000009">The Edlington serious case review may not have been suitable to publish in full; I do not know. That is why the amendments contain serious caveats about publication not being detrimental to the welfare of surviving children or their siblings, and about anonymity. The families of the people involved in the Edlington case are sure that they want to know the full story. They want to see the  <br>

full serious case review published. Everybody in Edlington knows who all the characters are-if they do not, they can find all the names on the internet-and there is no excuse for not publishing that serious case review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para15"><a name="10022386000010">The Secretary of State made play of my comments about the NSPCC. It does much good work, but it has been changing its position on serious case reviews. Recently, in the letter to which he replied-although he did not give us sight of it until 20 minutes before the start of the debate this afternoon-it has come forward with further suggestions. If we have further serious case reviews that reveal further tragic events such as those in Edlington and Haringey in a year or two's time, the NSPCC might be brought round to our way of thinking-that the only solution is a full publication of serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para16"><a name="10022386000011">The Secretary of State did not once mention the British Association of Social Workers and the practitioners at the sharp end, day in, day out, dealing with horrific cases, including cases such as those that made the headlines in Doncaster, Edlington, Haringey, Birmingham and other places. They deal with that every day of their professional existence, and that organisation, which represents the very best of many of our social workers, agrees that the only solution is a full publication of serious case reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para17"><a name="10022386000012">I want to remind the Secretary of State of the words of a former colleague of his-the former Member for Lancaster and Wyre, a fully qualified social worker, who is now the head of the BASW. Hilton Dawson said:</p>
<a name="100223-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="10022386000550"><ul><p class="tabletext">"It's vital that these reviews are transparent and can be seen in full, subject only to the need to preserve individual anonymity...These reviews are vital learning tools and it is imperative that they are made widely available."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para18"><a name="10022386000013">The Secretary of State chose selectively to pray in aid certain organisations that share his view, but chose to ignore completely the 12,000 members of the professional body of social workers in this country, who now agree with a growing number of people that we desperately need full publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="100223-0013.htm_para19"><a name="10022386000014">We need a fundamental change in the culture of how we approach child protection. That is what the new clause and the amendments are all about. Only if we have full transparency and accountability, subject to the caveats that I have given, will we start to bring about that fundamental change; to restore public confidence in child protection, which has suffered such enormous knocks in recent years; to restore morale within the social work profession, which has taken a huge knock, particularly since the baby Peter scandal; and to ensure that all agencies involved in safeguarding can see clearly where mistakes have been made and work together to ensure, wherever possible, that they are not repeated on their watch or in their patch. That is why, I am afraid, no amount of praying in aid by the Secretary of State of the same suspects will give the assurances that the public need and are entitled to. That is why the time has come to have that fundamental culture change-and that is what our amendments and new clause offer: that is why it is so important to put new clause 1 to the vote tonight.</p>

 I should declare my interest as a barrister, albeit one who has not practised for quite a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="100223-0014.htm_para47"><a name="10022386000527">Part 2 of the Bill was not debated in Committee. Unfortunately-indeed, scandalously-it is not going to be debated this evening either. That is a great pity, because it contains significant changes. In our view, those changes should have formed a separate Bill in its own right, rather than being tacked on to this important Children, Schools and Families Bill. This is a shabby way in which to treat those involved in the family courts, from the judges through to all the other professionals, including those who work for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service and the expert witnesses who appear in the family courts day in and day out, as well as the families and children themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="100223-0014.htm_para48"><a name="10022386000528">The Opposition have consistently argued for more openness and transparency in the family courts. We have also regularly emphasised the need for greater consistency between the courts. The press have been allowed into the youth justice courts for the past 70 years, and Judge Nicholas Crichton pointed out to the Public Bill Committee that they have always been allowed into the family proceedings courts, which are of course magistrates courts. Furthermore, the press are allowed into the Court of Appeal when family cases end up there on appeal. Where the problem lay was in the county courts and the family division of the High Court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="100223-0014.htm_para49"><a name="10022386000529">Our family courts play a vital role in our justice system, but confidence and trust in them is eroded if their work is constantly shrouded in secrecy. That is exactly what has happened in the past. That is why we pressed the Secretary of State hard to take action, and we warmly welcomed his announcement in December 2008 of the new rules that were to come into force in April 2009. The rules of court were then changed to allow media attendance in all family courts, subject to reporting restrictions and to the court having the power to exclude completely, where appropriate. That was a significant step forward.</p>

year, so they have been running for only a short time. They are being undertaken in the magistrates courts in Leeds, and in the magistrates and county courts in Cardiff. There were originally plans to have a third pilot in the magistrates and county courts in Wolverhampton. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain what has happened to that third pilot, as it has not yet started.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para1"><a name="10022386000531">The whole idea behind the pilots was for anonymised judgments and reasons to be placed in the public domain. The benefits of that would be assessed, as would the resource implications of the measures. This was also discussed in the evidence-gathering sessions of the Public Bill Committee, in which Sir Mark Potter, the president of the family division, pointed out that the annual costs would be about £2 million. We are talking about a significant, although not huge, amount of money, at a time when the courts' budgets are under a lot of pressure. On the other hand, it is important that we get this right, as it represents another far-reaching step. Our view is that these measures require a full, thorough evaluation. What is the point of running a pilot if it is not studied and evaluated?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para2"><a name="10022386000532">We always assumed that the Government would allow the new arrangements to settle in before moving on to the next stage, which would be to amend the primary legislation on reporting restrictions and look into media attendance at placement and adoption proceedings. However, that is the essence of the provisions in part 2. We never dreamt that the Ministry of Justice would amend primary legislation by tacking on various clauses to another Bill, right at the fag-end of this Parliament, when the Government knew that there would be no time to debate these important proposals properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para3"><a name="10022386000533">The Public Bill Committee took evidence on part 2 from a number of experts who work in the family courts on a regular basis. The list was impressive. The president of the family division, Sir Mark Potter, gave evidence, as did Judge Nicholas Crichton, a well-known judge from the inner London family proceedings court, as well as Barbara Esam from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and a number of other experts. A key point is that, although they supported in principle much of what is in part 2, they all agreed that it was hideously complicated and that not enough thought had been put into it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para4"><a name="10022386000534">If we look at what the Government and those of us who want to see more transparency in the family courts are trying to achieve, we see that three key questions are involved: when can the press attend; what can they report; and what documents can they see? The answers are, in some ways, quite simple. I entirely accept that there are additional questions to be asked in relation to the third point about documents, because affidavits and skeleton arguments are increasingly relevant, and we must ask whether the press should have copies of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para5"><a name="10022386000535">It is also worth pointing out that insufficient attention has been paid to ancillary relief in the debate on transparency. This raises a specific issue, because financial information, some of which is highly confidential, is provided under compulsory disclosure. The Government should certainly look into that more carefully as the debate moves forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para6"><a name="10022386000536">On the question of how complicated the provisions are, I was struck by something that Sir Mark Potter said in his written note. He reinforced his point in his oral evidence as well, but in his written note, he stated:</p>
<a name="100223-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="10022386000554"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Bill is very complex. The technical and interlocking nature of its provisions places the judges, the parties and the media in an unsatisfactory position likely to lead to a number of practical difficulties concerning Judges' decisions to impose, or refuse to lift, restrictions in individual cases. In cases of high interest, parties and the media are likely to raise substantial queries and argue individual points in relation to the reporting of evidence which will necessitate the expenditure of precious judicial time in resolving them rather than getting on with the case."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para7"><a name="10022386000537">He also went on to explain that part 2 was needlessly complicated. Her Majesty's Government have achieved something that I thought was virtually impossible-namely, they have united everyone from one end of the spectrum to the other on this matter. That is certainly an achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para8"><a name="10022386000538">As I said, it would have been better to give these early reforms a chance to work and to get bedded down. Then, we could have taken a step back to see exactly when it would be necessary to amend the primary legislation. It would have been far better to do that by means of a separate family proceedings Bill. Given that the Government have already announced that they are going to carry out a major review of the family justice system, would it not have been better to allow that review to complete its work? A new family proceedings Bill will undoubtedly come out of that process, and these provisions could have formed an important part of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para9"><a name="10022386000539">We did not debate part 2 in Committee, yet the Government have already come up with a number of complicated amendments to it. They are completely rewriting their original part 2. Perhaps the Minister will think I am churlish to say that, however, because many of their amendments are ones that we asked for and that we support. Nevertheless, this is a chaotic situation, and it is causing a great deal of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para10"><a name="10022386000540">We are where we are, however, which is why we have tabled a number of new clauses and amendments. I want to speak first to new clause 2. Clause 40 currently introduces phase 2 of part 2-that is, schedule 2. Schedule 2 contains various amendments that alter the treatment of sensitive personal information. Under clause 40 as it stands now, however, the Lord Chancellor cannot make an order to commence schedule 2-or, indeed, schedule 5-unless he or she has carried out a review of this part of the Bill and set out its conclusions in a report to Parliament. That cannot take place for 18 months and it has to be done through an affirmative resolution on a statutory instrument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para11"><a name="10022386000541">There are various flaws in the procedure. That is why we tabled our own new clause, which builds on clause 40 by requiring the Lord Chancellor to commission a fully independent review of the operation of part 2 and of the impact of the new changes of April 2009 that allowed the media access to the courts. Furthermore, there is a third safeguard, because no review can take place until a full and separate review and an evaluation of the pilots has taken place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para12"><a name="10022386000542">New clause 2 is similar to the Lib-Dem new clause 19. In fact, original amendments 28 and 29 have been migrated into new clause 2. The Government's solution in amendment 123 goes some of the way, but it is simply not adequate because it talks only about an independent person carrying out the review and consulting the public.  <br>

In our opinion, that is just not good enough. Our new clause 2 is logical; it is in no way bureaucratic, and it contains sensible additional safeguards. I urge all hon. Members to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para13"><a name="10022386000543">We have tabled other new clauses and amendments.

Whether it is public or private law proceedings, an applicant may open a case high, as we put it, make a number of often quite important and unpleasant allegations relating to parties in the case, or make exaggerated claims about the child. Those will get reported. Then time passes. Perhaps the judgment is given and publicised in anonymous terms two or three weeks later. There is no obligation on the press to report that. It might be that quite a different situation is found to have existed as a result of what happened, but because we are in a situation of a first-day attendance, and what is news today has passed tomorrow, an unfair and difficult position is left-quite apart from the welfare of the child concerned."<i> --</i>[<i> Official Report, Children, Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, </i>21 January 2010; c. 126, Q206.]</p>

It deserves support because it is extremely simple and straightforward; there is no reason why it would not work very neatly and very well.

identification possibilities by way of pictures in the media and by way of recording people's voices. I urge the Minister to change the Government amendment or at least urge the other place to have a close look at what we would achieve by our new clause. We are almost at one on this, but not quite, so going that extra little distance would be a great relief to Conservative Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para28"><a name="10022387000009">We support most of the Government amendments. Some cover points that we raised in correspondence with the Minister, some pick up on points put during the evidence-gathering session, while others pick up points made in various written statements and documents made available to the Committee. The Minister has considered some of those points and come up with various amendments. However, some of the amendments are pretty weighty, and I find it worrying that they were introduced so suddenly, given that all the issues could have been thought through carefully at an earlier stage. Amendment 111-the "Nelson"-deals with fairly wide-ranging contempt-of-court criteria, amendment 126 adds another defence to contempt of court, and amendment 131 concerns the definition of how a person is involved in proceedings. It is ridiculous that such weighty matters should be put before the House at this late hour.</p>

We have given our pledge that we will not vote against them, because they are broadly in line with what we have asked for, but there is extra detail that is very substantial and complicated. I hope that she will explain exactly how the amendments will improve the Bill in the way that the Government have claimed they will, and how they will make it more acceptable to the various groups involved.</p>

We agreed that the April 2009 changes were excellent, but suggested that it would have been better had we paused at that stage. What is the point of pilots unless they really are pilots, and are assessed properly? At the time, we told the Government "Take a step back. Look at stage one. Look at the excellent announcements that you made about the changes in April 2009, and assess the way in which they are working on the ground. Talk to everyone involved in the family courts. The pilots only started in November; evaluate them, perhaps a year later, and consider the resource implications in a professional and focused way."</p>

 I agree with much of what the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) said. I do not intend to detain the House for long, not because the amendments and new clauses do not deserve extensive debate but precisely because they do, and because today's debate-which has been necessarily brief because of the time restrictions-has only confirmed a view that I have held for some time. I believe that we would be foolish to rush consideration of what is, in fact, a highly complex and sensitive area with no proper scrutiny in this place, and that we would risk drawing the wrong conclusions and making decisions of which we would repent at leisure. After all, we are being expected, in a debate lasting only an hour, to scrutinise nearly 20 per cent. of the Bill, including an entire set of clauses and two schedules-clauses 32 to 41 and schedules 2 and 3-that we did not even touch on in Committee, although they deserved serious scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="100223-0015.htm_para33"><a name="10022387000015">We know that this is one of the most controversial parts of a Bill which itself hardly lacks controversial content-including some of the other elements relating to home education, which we may touch on if we have time today and to which we also failed to give adequate time in Committee. We know that a long list of organisations have expressed concerns, and that, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said, they represent a broad spectrum, from children's organisations at one end to legal and other organisations in the middle or at the other end.</p>

They believe that there is a real risk of our legislating in haste, and that the issues are too important to be rushed through Parliament with a minimum of debate and the risk that we will end up with ill-thought-out provisions. They have told us clearly that they think that the changes envisaged in schedule 2 should result from a proper process of consultation and dialogue, and proper scrutiny in Parliament. Although I accept that the Minister has made an attempt today to respond to some of the concerns that have been expressed over the last few weeks and months and that she has talked to many of the organisations involved, I have no doubt that many of those concerns remain.</p>

While the Government claim to be taking the side of groups such as the NSPCC on the protection of sensitive information from serious case reviews, they appear to be taking the opposite side on many of the arguments.</p>

 I rise relatively early in this fairly short debate, partly to respond to the amendments tabled by the Opposition but partly to agree with both Opposition spokesmen that it is a matter of regret to us all that these matters were not debated in Committee. I sat through every Committee sitting, including the public evidence sessions, and I assure Members that it is pretty frustrating to sit there and be unable to make at least some comment on a part of a Bill for which one has some responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para2"><a name="1002244000039">I also rise to speak at this point in the debate because in the course of the public evidence sittings and throughout the period when this part of the Bill was being discussed outwith this House, including by the many organisations that have contributed to it, we listened to what people had to say, which is why we have tabled our amendments in this group. I hope that my comments will lead the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) to appreciate that I am doing all I can to try to be helpful and to assuage some of the concerns people have raised, even though they were not debated in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para3"><a name="1002244000040">I want to begin by considering why we have come to our current situation. I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman said at the beginning of his speech that he and the Opposition agree that transparency in the family courts is an important issue, and that they support that and find it unacceptable that the family courts differ so much from the rest of the Courts Service. For a number of years-in fact, since Lord Justice Munby's Re B judgment in 2004-we have been consulting on, and slowly changing, the extent to which individuals can share information from the family courts, and we have been able to move from a system that, for example, did not even allow a man or wife to disclose to their new partner the fact that they were involved in Children Act proceedings for contact arrangements for their child from a previous relationship. They were not allowed to talk to their MP about such issues either, and given that over the past year we have, for a variety of reasons, been very concerned about the relationship between the MP and their constituents, that is a pretty large hole in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para4"><a name="1002244000041">Those aspects of the system were clearly unhelpful for the people involved, and unhealthy for democracy and justice. We therefore changed the rules so that the situation is now more open and transparent, but always with checks and balances to make sure that the publishing of information, for example, is permissible only within a very specific framework. Those changes have proved to be relatively successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para5"><a name="1002244000042">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has mentioned that last year we introduced the family court information pilots, which are looking at the impact on the judiciary and the court system of publishing anonymised judgments online. Anonymised judgments were established not for the benefit of the media, but, rather, to see how the system impacts on the judiciary. They also protect the identity of those involved, which is a key factor in their success. Again, checks and balances are in place. The hon. Gentleman asked about Wolverhampton. Its pilot started in January, so it has been running for only two months so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para6"><a name="1002244000043">In April last year, we made a very important change to the rules of court, so that the media now have the right to attend most family proceedings. The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that they could attend the top and bottom ends, so to speak, of the family proceedings, but not some of the more central areas, such as the High Court. Again, we have put in place sufficient checks and balances to ensure that the courts can choose to exclude them, where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para7"><a name="1002244000044">The recent evaluation showed that the changes have presented few problems, and that the major block to their achieving their objectives is that the media are not attending family proceedings to the extent that we had expected, largely because they can report so little of the information that they might learn from the proceedings. Whereas the other measures that we have introduced have made a positive contribution to making the family courts more open and transparent, allowing the media to attend has not as yet added to that. The limits on what can and cannot be reported are such that the media do not, on the whole, bother to attend. Because the media are not allowed to report anything of substance, the public are not able to grasp how the family courts work, or how the courts reach very difficult decisions every day about children and families. The concept of open justice is all the poorer for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para8"><a name="1002244000045">That is why we have introduced these provisions. Their aims are to allow the media to report on the family courts more fully, to allow the public to be more aware of the work of these courts and the decisions they make, and to afford family courts the openness and transparency other parts of the judicial system have had for many years. We do not and would not tolerate such restrictions in other parts of the justice system, so these changes are long overdue, but I seek to persuade Members that while the changes we have made so far have been relatively successful, and while I hope those I propose in today's amendments will also be successful, they are all proposed with the privacy and safety of children in mind, and with checks and balances to ensure that that is achieved.</p>

I hope Members will agree to the amendments tabled today or late last week-I am sorry it took so long for that to happen, but that was entirely outwith my control. I say to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk that I would never dream of describing him as churlish, and I hope that, like me, he has come to this debate in a spirit of openness and with the aim of trying to take this matter  <br>

forward and of putting measures in place that will be better for the justice system and all those involved in it. We have considered the concerns raised, such as protecting privacy, while also ensuring the system can be as open as possible, and I hope these amendments will allay some of those concerns. We also want to ensure the integrity of the process in making a considered transition to a second, more open, phase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para10"><a name="1002244000047">First, let me address the amendments dealing with the issues of privacy and identification. Government amendments 113, 114 and 115 all deal with the publication of information contained within court orders. Taken together, these amendments will make it clear that, while the default position is that court orders in relevant family proceedings will remain publishable without the court's permission being required, the publisher will need to remove any identification information from the text or summary of the order before publishing. The publication of an order complete with any identification information that the order contains will require the court's permission. These amendments are offered in response to concerns raised about the important question of how best to ensure that orders in family proceedings may be made public without an excessive risk of identification of those involved. By placing the responsibility for redaction on the publisher, the Government are ensuring that no undue burden is placed on busy family court judges to have to check every family court order in order to make sure that identification information has been removed.</p>

 May I draw attention to the extra safeguards in our new clause 9, which differentiate it slightly from Government amendment 130?</p>

 I hope that, as I go into the detail of our amendment, that differentiation will become clear. However, let me say to the hon. Gentleman, as I have said before, that I am happy to look at some of these issues further to see if changes need to be made in the other place. I hope that he will forgive me if, for the moment, I stick to arguing my case as I have it before me. Those amendments seek to assist the operation of the legislation. I hope that they will satisfy some of the calls for additional clarity, because I accept that originally the provisions were rather opaque.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para11"><a name="1002244000050">Amendments 131 and 132 would plug the gap in ensuring that a person who has provided a statement to the court within the relevant proceedings would count, along with witnesses actually called to give evidence, as being "involved in" proceedings for the purpose of the Bill. On amendment 130, I accept that, as has been mentioned by the hon. Members for North-West Norfolk and for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), the addition of a list similar to that in section 121(3) of the Australian Family Law Act 1975 was strongly advocated by a wide variety of stakeholders. We have therefore accepted that it is appropriate to include in the Bill a list of what constitutes "identification information". Having said that, I believe that the Bill, as introduced, was fit for purpose and that provisions on what constitutes information "likely to identify" are equally so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para12"><a name="1002244000051">I am aware of the need for as much clarity as possible if the Bill is to work as intended, so the amendment builds on the Australian model and provides additional guidance for both parties and the media as to what  <br>

constitutes "identification information", highlighting the sorts of information that are most likely to be "identifying" and in respect of which particular care should accordingly be taken. In addition, amendment 117 adds a provision that mirrors section 97(2)(b) of the Children Act 1989 in prohibiting publication of information likely to identify the home address or the school of a child involved in proceedings. That would remove any scope for arguments as to whether such information might identify the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para13"><a name="1002244000052">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk made a number of points that have been raised by the judiciary and, in particular, by Sir Mark Potter, and I hope that he will accept that although amendments 115, 118 and 119 are technical, they address the points made by the senior judiciary. Amendments 118 and 119 would remove the additional explanations of what amounts to</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para15"><a name="1002244000054">Amendment 115 mirrors section 97(2) of the 1989 Act-and the Australian legislation-in referring to identification by members of the public, rather than by "one or more persons", which might have had the unintended effect of preventing publication in almost every case however little information might be made available. Within those provisions, however, not only do we wish to ensure privacy where required, but we wish to make reporting as open as it can be. We have, thus, responded to concerns in that regard too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para16"><a name="1002244000055">Amendments 116, 117, 118, 121, 124 and 126 would remove references to persons "referred to in" proceedings from clauses 34, 37, 38 and 41. That would mean that the publication of identification information relating to persons referred to in proceedings but with no direct link to them-I call this the David Beckham amendment, because it deals with cases where a child's favourite footballer or pop star is mentioned-would not be prohibited, as clearly that is not what is intended. Having said that, there may occasionally be exceptional cases where the court would need to protect a person who is "referred to" in proceedings, as opposed to more actively involved. Such a person might be, for example, a neighbour who has reported domestic violence to the police. The Government feel that the court's discretionary power to restrict publication in clause 37(2) will cover such situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para17"><a name="1002244000056">These amendments do not cover references to a person "referred to in" proceedings in clauses 35 and 36, because they serve a different purpose. In clause 35, the avoiding of an injustice to a person referred to in the proceedings, or the protection of the welfare of a child or vulnerable adult referred to in the proceedings, may well be a reason for permitting the publication of information. The court will decide this, and in so deciding whether to permit that publication, it will have to take into account the risk that would be posed to the safety or welfare of a person "referred to".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para18"><a name="1002244000057">A number of concerns have been raised about the contempt provisions for circumstances where the reporting restrictions are breached.

know, and had no reason to suspect at the time of publication, that the information already published was in breach of any of the requirements for an authorised news publication. Without the amendments, there would be a risk that someone republishing information already in the public domain could find themselves charged with contempt for publishing information that they could not have known was in breach of reporting restrictions. Although it is right and proper that the courts pursue those who knowingly publish information that is in breach of reporting restrictions governing family proceedings, it is also right and proper that those who seek only to inform the public in good faith are provided with a defence against being held in contempt of court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="100223-0016.htm_para20"><a name="1002244000059">Finally, we have considered the concerns about the review process that will be required prior to moving to a more open second phase. I understand that the hon. Member for Yeovil has particular concerns about this area, and I hope that amendments 122 and 123 will allay some of them. Our amendments would require that the Lord Chancellor commissions an independent review of part 2 of the Bill before the amendments concerning sensitive personal information in schedule 2 may be commenced. We recognise that it is in everyone's interest, particularly that of children, that we get the review process right and ensure that the initial set of changes are subject to a considered and robust examination-it would be in nobody's interest to do anything less.</p>

As I have said, if the Justice Committee were to include the pilots as part of the review procedure, I see no reason why that would not be perfectly acceptable. It might give the reviewer more credibility when the review takes place.</p>

 On one level, I have no objection to it in principle. There is much to be said for some of the things in it. However, I do not think that it is appropriate at this stage. I shall come to that point in a moment, but I want to finish talking about the review first.</p>

It will be something between 18 and 24 months, I would envisage, before the review will take place. That will give considerable time for the production of evidence for it to consider.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; I wanted to help her a bit on the subject of the pilots, following the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson). Would it not be better to put the requirement for a review of those pilots and an evaluation in the Bill? It would be easy to do that. Surely she can accept that point, as we move forward to make part 2 work through this process, which is phase 2 overall-well, perhaps phase 3, because phase 1 involved the changes that the Government brought in a year or so ago. The pilots were part of that, and obviously they need to be properly evaluated. To have such a provision in the Bill would, I am sure, satisfy the concerns of many of those who attended the Public Bill Committee hearing.</p>

effect through other procedures. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and I want to go as far as I can to allay concerns about what the review can and cannot do. That is partly why we suggest that the Justice Committee would play such an important role in setting out what the review can cover. It is important that the review should be seen by all concerned as entirely independent and robustly conducted. If it were to conclude that the second part should not go forward in its present form, that view would be taken very seriously. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman some comfort.</p>

It subjects the Lord Chancellor's power to amend the definition of "relevant family proceedings" to the affirmative resolution procedure, so that the amending instrument may not be made without the prior approval of both Houses of Parliament. I hope that that allays some of hon. Members' concerns in that regard. The purpose of that power is to ensure that we can respond flexibly and promptly should there be any subsequent legislative changes in the way that court proceedings are classified, so that the appropriate range of proceedings will continue to be covered. For example, "family proceedings" can be proceedings under part 5 of the Children Act 1989 dealing with child minding and nursery care regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="100223-0017.htm_para1"><a name="1002244000072">Let me explain why I cannot accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. It is partly because our amendments already address the concerns that have been raised-certainly those about the nature of the review, the move to phase 2, the Lord Chancellor's power to amend the definition of "family proceedings" and the clarity of identifying information. We have covered all those issues fairly comprehensively. I will start by making a more negative point: I have concerns about his call for a limit on the publication of financial information, which I think is misplaced. I do not believe that he or other Members on the Opposition Front Bench suggest that the need to protect information about a parent's finances is of greater consequence than the need to protect information about the children involved, but there are sufficient safeguards in place already, as the courts can decide whether it is appropriate to protect such information.</p>

I have already explained that the move to phase 2 is not a given, because the independent review, the parliamentary scrutiny that will follow, including the affirmative resolution procedure, are robust enough to ensure that whether phase 2 becomes a reality will be entirely dependent on independent scrutiny.</p>

They are not covered in the Bill, but I accept the tenor of his comments about such proceedings. I think that new clause 8 would backfire, because it would remove the Bill's protection from some of the proceedings that will be protected, and would not cover some of the things that he wants it to cover, but I would like to look at it again to make sure. I have some sympathy with him regarding the necessity of media scrutiny of entirely uncontested adoption proceedings. However, we do not, in the Bill, allow the media in to the final part of adoption proceedings.</p>

They are important to those who take the decisions that will keep children safe and also to the public, who have had doubts about some of the courts' actions and have called into question the effectiveness of the family justice system as a whole. That is why the changes are overdue. Clearly, we all agree that the family justice system should be more transparent and open.</p>

However, voices from all sides are telling the Government that there is still great concern that the involvement of the media in their cases will make children less, rather than more, willing to disclose problems and talk to professionals. The danger is that judges will have to make decisions in cases without having the full facts and evidence before them.

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="100223-0017.htm_para15"><a name="1002244000087">We know from his oral evidence and his written evidence to the Public Bill Committee that Sir Mark Potter has grave concerns that unless there is a provision such as we set out in new clause 7, whereby the publication of any case through the media could not take place until the judgment, a case may be reported in a local or national newspaper in a way that gives a completely different version of events from what has been played out across the whole case from start to finish. The media could give a skewed account that did not reflect the facts of the case as they played out. I ask the Minister to look at that aspect again.

we included in new clause 2-the anonymised judgments and the assessment and evaluation of the new rules introduced in April 2009-are very much in her mind as well. I ask her to be brave, to listen-as she has done, to her enormous credit-to the information that we have been giving her about our concerns, and to think carefully about why we should wait any longer for new clause 2 to become part of her Bill, as well as of our Bill.</p>

 One of the reasons why I am hesitant about the Opposition's new clause 2 is that part of it is superfluous. The pilots will have been completed long before the review takes place, so that evidence will already be in the public domain. I do not know whether that helps the hon. Gentleman.</p>

I am sad to say that in its current form, despite our best efforts to help the Government produce a workable Bill, it will not do what it is intended to do. Even those on the edges of the spectrum of interest in the Bill share that concern.

The authorities have been around, seen the Cootes and said, "You're all right. Just stay in touch with us. We do not have a problem with you looking after your own child."

The fact that they are abroad means that, to a certain extent, they can do what they want anyway, because the court order stops at the border. The Hallimond case is much harder, because the press in this country cannot report the documentation. The press abroad can, however, so there is no difficulty there.</p>

In social work, decisions about when and when not to intervene are critical judgments, and one needs to maintain an open mind and review the judgment. One can criticise the Department for making the whole system worse, but, crucially, the role of the family courts is to bring in that quality control.</p>

The quality control for that judgment is the family courts, but the problem is that it often fails. It does not always fail, because there are some very good judges, but other judges basically accept any old rubbish that is put up by the local council, and the judgment goes through. The Court of Appeal subsequently says, "Oh, that's all judicial discretion," so it does not correct the judgment.</p>

A national newspaper reporter might go to the court in London once or twice, but they will not know in advance about a miscarriage of justice; they will know only in arrears. The process fails because it does not look at the situation from the point of view of the parties.

in other words-she failed her parenting assessment. One would think that such an assessment, which I have in writing, would be rejected by the family court, but sadly it was not. The problem that we have with the appeal in that case is that the judge has not issued a written judgment, so the appeal will go in on the basis of no judgment being provided.

It is those children, too, who are being gagged by the process. It would be a criminal offence for a newspaper to report the name of a child who is 17 and is wrongly subject to a care order.

What is important about the whole process is being able to look at the experts' reports, all the evidence and the transcript of the hearing, and ask, "Is it reasonable for the state to intervene in the way in which it is intervening in this situation?" These are very traumatic processes. The two families who are in Spain at the moment faced the real prospect of a police officer in the delivery room to take the baby at birth under a police protection order.

We would rather that the Government put this part of the Bill on hold and waited until after the election, when the Government of the day could bring in a matrimonial family Bill of which this could be a part, so that rather than its being tacked on to a Bill that is being promoted by another Department, it would be a vital part of a free-standing justice Bill. I think that that is what people who work in the family courts-the judges, expert witnesses, solicitors and lawyers who are in those courts on a day-to-day basis-would expect.</p>

 I am very grateful to the Minister for that. As I am on a roll, is she prepared to accept new clause 7? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Perhaps I am pushing my luck a bit too far, but I believe that we have put a convincing, compelling case for new clause 7 as well. It supports what Sir Mark Potter, the president of the family division, has urged us to do. I do not want to be unkind to the Minister, because I am very grateful to her, but on that basis I intend to press new clause 7 to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="100223-0019.htm_para21"><a name="1002244001062">I hope to leave time for other hon. Members to say a few words, so I shall be brief. I would like to thank members of the Public Bill Committee. We did not always agree, but we had interesting and thorough debates on a number of issues. I would particularly like to thank the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) and for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) for their constructive approach in Committee. They will know from some of the amendments that we took note of some of their comments. I would also like to thank the hon. Members for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) for all their work in Committee. I thank everyone else, including my ministerial colleagues, for their support in helping me to reach this point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="100223-0019.htm_para22"><a name="1002244001063">The Children, Schools and Families Bill is one for the future of our country. It is possible only because of the improvements made over the last 13 years and that have been underpinned by record levels of funding in our schools and children's services, as well as the reforms passed by this House. It builds on a decade of ever-increasing standards of pupil achievement, investment in buildings and the work force and the development of one of the most robust children's safeguarding systems in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="100223-0019.htm_para23"><a name="1002244001064">The Bill contains numerous reforms for the future, which I would like to highlight briefly. We make a great step forward with PSHE-personal, health, social and economic education-as we make it compulsory from September 2011. One or two Members may wish to intervene on this issue, so let me make it very clear that faith schools will not be able to opt out of any elements of statutory PSHE, including sex and relationships education, and they will have to deliver the programme of study for this subject like every other school. Schools with a religious character will still be required to cover in their teaching of PSHE the full range of the content prescribed. Similarly, such schools will, like all others, be under a duty to deliver PSHE in a way that is compliant with the principles set out in the Bill.</p>

 I will give way to the hon. Gentleman and probably to some of my hon. Friends in a few moments, but I want to finish my statement on PSHE. There is nothing in the Bill that diminishes these principles or lessens their impact on faith schools. Although faith schools will, as now, be able to teach their faith's views on issues that arise within the teaching of PSHE, what they will not be able to do is suggest that their views are the only valid ones, and they must make it clear that there are a wide range of divergent views. For example, a Catholic school will be required to teach about contraception. In doing so, it will have to be accurate in the sense of providing the facts about contraception. It will have to be balanced in the sense of indicating that there are different views about contraception, but it would also be able to reflect the views of the Catholic Church about the use of contraception.</p>

As she will know, clause 11(8) refers to statutory guidance, and that guidance will go out for consultation. I should welcome a meeting with her-and any other hon. Friends-to discuss what should be included in the guidance, and to try to deal with some of her fears and concerns.</p>

<p><a name="st_o290"><a name="1002244001081"><a name="100223-0020.htm_spnew0"><a name="1002244002636"><b>Mr. David S. Borrow (South Ribble) (Lab):</b>
 As a gay man representing a constituency with a large Catholic population and a majority of faith schools, I recognise that faith schools should be able to explain to their pupils what their faith position is on many of these issues. Will my hon. Friend reassure me, however, that when the guidance is published, it will be framed in such a way that schools will not be able in any way to foster hatred, discrimination or any hostility towards same-sex couples or gay people within that educational framework? I should like an opportunity to meet my hon. Friend when these matters are discussed further, in order to ensure that the framework allows us all to be satisfied that both parties are happy with the outcome.</p>

 Of course I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. What we are trying to do is reassure faith schools that they will be able to teach PSHE in a way that is consistent with their religious characteristic and ethos. That is what the amendment does; that is the reassurance we seek to give. The amendment has to be read alongside the other parts of the clause, which describe certain principles that will also have to be upheld. We should pay tribute to the faith schools: for the first time they are saying that when PSHE becomes compulsory, not only will they need it to be consistent with their religious ethos, but they will accept that these other principles are also important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="100223-0020.htm_para1"><a name="1002244001085">In order to allow other Members to say a few words, let me conclude. Alongside PSHE, there are radical changes to the primary school curriculum, which will make a huge difference. We also discussed the guarantees, which are the state's offer on education for the future of this country. Report cards will result in a significant change in the accountability of schools. The licence to practice, with a guaranteed curriculum of continuing professional development, is also a huge step forward. I might also mention special needs and the inspection of schools by Ofsted to see how well they meet the needs of children, and the right of parents to appeal where local authorities do not amend a statement. There is to be alternative provision as well. For the first time, there will be mandatory full-time provision for those who are out of school but who have not been permanently excluded.</p>

 I thank the Minister for the courteous way in which he conducted the Committee proceedings, and for the three or four concessions he made to the Opposition. However, this Bill will not go down in history as one of the great education Bills of our time. It will not tackle the deep-seated problems in our education system that have resulted in 16 per cent. of 11-year-olds leaving primary school still struggling with reading, in 40 per cent. leaving primary school still struggling with reading, writing and arithmetic, and in 9 per cent. of boys leaving primary school completely illiterate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="100223-0020.htm_para18"><a name="1002244001107">One of those advisers is, of course, Graham Badman, whose report has infuriated tens of thousands of parents who have made huge sacrifices to educate their children at home, because they are not happy with the quality of education available at the local school, because they are concerned about behaviour or because they have a particular view about how their child's education should be delivered that is not available in the state sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="100223-0020.htm_para19"><a name="1002244001108">Those parents are right to be furious, and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) pointed out why on Second Reading:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="100223-0020.htm_para20"><a name="1002244001109">The provisions in schedule 1 undermine that basic right. At the heart of the provisions lies a deep confusion as to the problems Badman was seeking to address-are they safeguarding issues or are they about the quality of education? The terms of reference and the letter from Graham Badman to the Secretary of State appear to focus on the issue of safeguarding and whether home education is being used by some as a cover for abuse. But Badman himself seemed in his evidence to the Committee to be more concerned about the type of education being provided by home educators. The conflation of those two matters has resulted in home educators being subject to annual visits that appear to constitute an implicit suspicion that abuse may be occurring in the homes of the 50,000 families who educate their children at home. That is the cause of the anger. May I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) for the highly effective parliamentary and national campaign that he has organised on behalf of all our constituents who home educate their children?</p>

 What Badman did identify correctly was the need for support for home-educating families. There is no support; local authorities are not providing it. Ministers have moved on from the welfare issue that they started with and have tried to deny that they ever focused on it. They then said, "This is all about support," but there is nothing in schedule 1 about support and everything about a licensing system for parents who do their own thing. We need to put support in place and to work co-operatively and voluntarily with parents. We can then transform support for home education, build relationships between local authorities and not have this draconian piece of regulation, which, I am glad to say, will never become law.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The antipathy that the Government have created between local authorities and home educators has worsened as a consequence of these proposals. Chloe Watson from my constituency, who chairs the Home Educated Youth Council, has said that she has noted around the country a breakdown in the relationship between local authorities and home educators since the Badman report was published.</p>

Whitehall-knows best. It is typical of this Government that the only single, tiny element of the Bill that was deregulatory, and which the Secretary of State championed as deregulatory on Second Reading, is the one bit of the Bill that they have dumped-clause 42, which was referred to a moment ago.

 It is no use the Secretary of State shaking his head, because that is what the Government are saying in the Bill. The home education proposals should be chucked out of the Bill, and I hope that very little of the Bill will ultimately make it on to the statute book. I hope that in another place there will be a coalition of views, perhaps across parties on many issues, that a large component of the legislation should not reach the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="100223-0020.htm_para30"><a name="1002244001126">The Minister for Schools and Learners said in his opening comments that we have had an interesting and thorough debate, but many of us would question his use of the word "thorough". After all, we managed to scrutinise only 26 or 27 clauses of this 50-clause Bill in Committee, so 23 clauses received no scrutiny at all. Some clauses have received only superficial scrutiny today, and four out of the five schedules to the Bill have not been debated at all. One lesson that Labour Governments ought to have learned in the past 13 years is that legislating in haste, sticking legislation on to the statute book at the last minute and making concessions that we can barely understand to Conservative Members with 30 seconds to go before the end of a one-hour debate on 10 clauses is not the way that we should be legislating. I sincerely hope, for reasons not only of ideology but of good practical politics and administration, that many of the measures in the Bill that are ill-thought-out and that have not been debated properly, including the controversial measures on family courts, will not go through.</p>

I do not believe that even the Conservative party, which has traditionally been cautious about such issues, proposed to amend the legislation in that way. Now, we have this amendment that we have not had the opportunity to debate today and that cuts directly across the commitment in the Bill to promote equality and diversity.</p>

 Indeed, it will. In spite of what the Secretary of State and the Minister have told us, the sad risk is that we will have sex and relationship education that will mean that, however objective some of the information being delivered is, young people in some schools with some faiths will be told that they are less worthy and less equal and that they are participating in less legitimate forms of activity in their lives, because the Government's good intentions in this area have been stymied by this late amendment that we have not had an opportunity to consider. That makes me genuinely sad, because the Government, who might be just a few weeks away from the end of their period in office, have had a genuinely good record and reputation on challenging prejudice and inequality of opportunity. The Secretary of State and the Minister have let themselves down by allowing through, in the dying days of this Parliament, an amendment that will compromise what would otherwise have been some good proposals in this section of the Bill.

 I am pleased to have been able to secure this Adjournment debate on behalf of my constituents. Over my years as an MP I have had contact with a number of people with myalgic encephalopathy-usually known as ME-from all age groups, who have raised a range of issues with me. A common point is their frustration in being unable to carry on with their lives as they would wish, and not being able to access a range of services that might be needed, including education, employment, benefits and health services. My most recent encounter has been with a young person who, at a critical point in her promising career, has been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome-CFS-is now unable to work, and came to my surgery asking for action. I am going to reflect many of her concerns during this short debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para1"><a name="1002244001618">I am also in touch with the Dorset ME support group, and would like first to reflect on some of its concerns. It is estimated that there are probably more than 2,000 people in Dorset with ME, and the Dorset ME support group has more than 500 members. A representative made the following points to me. In spite of the chief medical officer's report five years ago, there are still too many GPs and other health professionals who do not recognise ME or sympathise with those with the condition. However, when they are good, they seem to be very good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para2"><a name="1002244001619">The representative said that the group's members with a diagnosis still want a diagnostic test to prove it, because of the doubt and suspicion that they sense, or are faced with, in others. We hope that researchers will address the need for co-operation rather than competition, so that progress can be co-ordinated and funds allocated in the most effective way. The Government have not been seen to be supporting CFS/ME research as urgently as they could. The group's representative says:</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="1002244001692"><ul><p class="tabletext">"I don't know if anyone has produced figures for the cost to the nation's coffers of the hours of work lost, the benefits paid out, and the cost of treatment for those fortunate enough to be able to access it. It does not appear to be being taken seriously enough...Having to cope with dealing with the benefits system is beyond many of our members which is why we have a full time benefits officer to assist them."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para3"><a name="1002244001620">My constituent points out that apart from the fatigue itself, problems with cognitive function make it hard, if not impossible, for many people to complete the complex forms required by the Department for Work and Pensions. Having to attend a medical, sometimes a considerable distance away within Dorset-for example, people from Gillingham have to travel to Salisbury-adds stress to an already stressed situation. Patients who are assessed by the DWP as fit for work, either before they start treatment or while receiving it, usually have their recovery period set back by nine months to a year, again at a cost to the NHS, never mind the cost to the individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para4"><a name="1002244001621">The Dorset ME support group says that in its experience, the high number of people with CFS/ME being found fit for work under the employment and support allowance regulations leads to a high number of appeals, presumably at considerable cost to the taxpayer. It states:</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="1002244001693"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Within the Dorset ME Support Group, all our ESA Appeals so far have been successful suggesting that the assessment system  <br>

is not fit for purpose where people with ME is concerned. Disability Analysts are trained to look at the disability and not the nature of the condition...Joined up government seems to be lacking."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para5"><a name="1002244001622">I therefore ask the Minister to liaise with her counterparts in the DWP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para6"><a name="1002244001623">In Dorset we have a CFS/ME service for children and young people, based in Dorset county hospital and Poole hospital, albeit with very limited funding. The Dorset ME support group secured funding from BBC Children in Need for a part-time child support worker to enhance that service by providing liaison between families, schools, out-of-school education providers and the clinic, and by providing continuing support to the child and family at home. That frees up health professionals' time so that they can concentrate on treatment programmes for the continuing flow of young patients. It has been pointed out to me that with the limit on funding, access to a doctor is limited. I seek the Minister's advice on that, because clearly the Children in Need funding will run out with important work still to be done. The Dorset ME support group says:</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="1002244001694"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We are aware that some patients feel neglected by the NHS once they have completed their course of treatment. If all patients 'stayed on', the service would grind to a halt."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para7"><a name="1002244001624">One of my constituents comments that</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev3"><a name="1002244001695"><ul><p class="tabletext">"we are lucky that we have a specialist unit for ME at Wareham Hospital but more funding is required for follow up sessions".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para8"><a name="1002244001625">I now turn to the core purpose of my debate, which is to highlight the views of a young person who has undertaken a considerable amount of personal research and has strong views on the way forward. She is concerned about some of the issues that I have already highlighted, and particularly about the use of the term "treatment". She has drawn my attention to the differences between myalgic encephalopathy and myalgic encephalomyelitis-I am struggling to pronounce them. The former was the title given to my debate, although I originally specified just "ME" as the title. My constituent has drawn my attention to a source that defines myalgic encephalomyelitis as inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, and myalgic encephalopathy as any non-inflammatory disorder affecting the brain. The same source goes on to state that some doctors and certain charities claim that the problem with ME is that there is no brain inflammation, which is represented by the "-itis" in encephalomyelitis. Certain organisations have therefore decided to keep "ME" in their name, but with the "E" standing for encephalopathy, which, as that definition shows, means disease or dysfunction of the brain without inflammation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para9"><a name="1002244001626">Many distinguished scientists have questioned the abandonment of the "-itis" part of the word. Dr Bruce Carruthers, author of Canada's guidelines on treating ME, wrote that</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev4"><a name="1002244001696"><ul><p class="tabletext">"-itis is well established in the name ME, and there is no good reason for changing it, since -opathy would not reduce our state of ignorance re ME but serve to further confuse everyone-perhaps that is one of the motives behind the suggestion."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para10"><a name="1002244001627">Professor Malcolm Hooper from Sunderland has explained the implications of changing the name of the illness, stating:</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev5"><a name="1002244001697"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Despite the claims of some psychiatrists, it is not true that there is no evidence of inflammation of the brain and spinal chord in ME; there is, but these psychiatrists ignore or deny that evidence".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para12"><a name="1002244001629">In general terms, it is suggested that up to 250,000 people are affected by the condition, and symptoms can vary from poor memory and concentration to debilitating fatigue and painful joints and muscles. It can affect all types of people and its causes are not fully understood. It is not a small problem. It is estimated that five times as many people in the UK are categorised as having CFS/ME as have HIV. More than 70,000 are so ill that they are bedbound and require round-the-clock care. The condition affects not only patients, but their families and friends. Schooling, higher education, employment, and subsequently income, social life and family life may all be affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para13"><a name="1002244001630">Yet how much do we really know about the condition and effective treatment? What is currently on offer? The Gibson report way back in 2006 made many important points, including the fact that the World Health Organisation holds an internationally recognised classification of ME as a neurological illness. The report made many more points about the need for research and a serious examination of the international evidence. It said that the necessary research must be funded immediately, so why is that not happening?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para14"><a name="1002244001631">My young constituent has been diagnosed with CFS, a complex disorder characterised by extreme fatigue that lasts for six months or longer. ME is a neurological condition as defined by the WHO. It can present with fatigue as a symptom, but that is not always the case. The causes of ME and CFS are currently unknown, although many scientific studies have shown links to viruses, immune deficiencies and exposure to chemicals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o533"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para15"><a name="1002244001632">My constituent has written to tell me that unfortunately, CFS and ME have become lumped together in the UK, allowing the medical profession to dismiss the neurological problems that ME sufferers face, and to deny access to tests that could allow more specific diagnoses. The problem with seeking medical advice on the subject of ME stems from the fact that doctors are under-educated in this area. Many still consider it a psychological condition-which, particularly in the light of recent research in other countries, is simply wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o534"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para16"><a name="1002244001633">My constituent points out that there are currently no treatments for patients categorised as having CFS/ME. Cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy are offered as a means of managing the fatigue aspect of the illness. The Medical Research Council has to date funded research only into the psychosocial aspects of the illness and the management of fatigue: £3 million was spent on a recent pacing, activity and cognitive behaviour therapy randomised evaluation trial, which examined CBT, GET-graded exercise therapy-and other fatigue management techniques, and £8 million was granted to allow specialist CFS/ME centres whose treatments are based on such techniques to be set up around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o535"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para17"><a name="1002244001634">Those centres and general practitioners, guided by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for CFS/ME, regard CBT as a treatment. However, my constituent believes that promoting CBT as a treatment is incorrect. If effectively delivered, it might help some people to manage their fatigue, but it cannot remove the cause of their illness. CBT is often used in assisting patients' recovery from cancer and other serious illnesses, and is based on the principle that impairment in daily functioning is due to one's distorted thinking or cognition, but in the case of ME, impairment  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="23" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>23 Feb 2010 : Column 275</b><br>
in functioning is not due to those things. If medical tests are done on people with true ME, they would show many abnormalities and physical reasons for impairment in functioning. However, patients diagnosed with CFS/ME rarely get access to any kind of medical testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o536"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para18"><a name="1002244001635">The Medical Research Council funding for biomedical research into ME is next to nothing in comparison with the funding provided for the perceived psychosocial aspects of the illness. The extent of biomedical research into ME has been questioned before. The Government have stated that the reason why the MRC has not funded any biomedical research is because there have not been any good or innovative applications. This is just not true: one scientist, who has applied for and been denied funding, says:</p>
<a name="100223-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="1002244001698"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We have applied several times to the MRC".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o537"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para19"><a name="1002244001636">This scientist has done some privately funded research into gene expression in CFS/ME.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o538"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para20"><a name="1002244001637">I do not doubt that there are others who have tried and failed to gain MRC funding, but it is very difficult to find out precisely which applications have been refused. There have been freedom of information requests from patients to find out why the biomedical proposals were rejected, but they have not been successful. It is possible to see how many applications have been made and how many were accepted and refused, but it is not clear which of those were biomedical proposals. Why can the MRC not be more open about this?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o539"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para21"><a name="1002244001638">My constituent tells me that since 2008 the MRC has set up a panel of experts to look into ME and the research on it. One problem with the panel is the wide range of disciplines covered by its members. It is difficult to see how that panel could work for the benefit of people with ME and their families if the members maintain such opposing views of the illness. As long as ME exists as a diagnosis, the range of conditions that probably come under this title cannot be addressed. It would seem to make more sense to distinguish sub-groups of ME and to acknowledge that research on those sub-groups is the logical way forward. Two years on, the expert panel has yet to take any visible action on the issue of biomedical research. That must raise the question of how urgent it feels the issue is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o540"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para22"><a name="1002244001639">For a balanced view of ME, the Government and the MRC should embark on a consultation of all interested parties. That would obviously include the patients themselves. The MRC and the Government currently get their information about patients from charities set up to help those with ME. However, my constituent believes that the two charities that the Government currently consult for advice on ME give particular emphasis to the need for care for, and support of, patients. She is concerned that that can only increase the misunderstandings about the illness, and in itself could suggest that all that patients need is support and sympathy. She feels that that need should go without saying, but that it should be acknowledged that until more is known about the biomedical aspects of ME, care for patients with the condition can not possibly be adequate or effective. In the short term, care is clearly very important, but for the benefit of future as well as current sufferers, new research must be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para23"><a name="1002244001640">The main charities talk about biomedical research, but are they taking enough action to instigate such work? There are, however, other charities that represent  <br>

the interest in research, and Invest in ME is one such charity. It holds an international conference every year-this year it will be on 24 May-whose aim is to highlight the need for a national strategy for biomedical research that will lead to treatment and a cure for this devastating illness. ME Research UK and the 25% ME Group-which represents the seriously afflicted-are two charities with similar mission statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o542"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para24"><a name="1002244001641">My own view is that until we know more about the condition, management of the symptoms is an important process. However, it is clear to me that the way forward is to fund biomedical research to find causes and treatments. I believe that that would unite everybody concerned with this debilitating condition. Until that research is done, no one can possibly claim to understand the illness fully, so treatment cannot progress. On behalf of my constituents generally, I call for a complete review of research into ME.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o543"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para25"><a name="1002244001642">To help address the unique challenges posed by a complex and poorly defined condition such as ME, I would like to call for the establishment of an independent scientific committee to oversee all aspects of ME research. I would like the Government and the Medical Research Council to work with ME sufferers and biomedical researchers to achieve a proper understanding of the condition, challenge unjust perceptions and consider the issue of research funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o544"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para26"><a name="1002244001643">The current NICE guidelines, by recommending CBT and GET, do not follow World Health Organisation guidelines, which categorise ME as a neurological condition. In failing to recognise the biomedical problems of ME sufferers, the NICE guidelines also fail to recognise the needs of ME suffers.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) on securing this important debate. As we all know, she has pursued a close interest in the subject on behalf of her constituents with the condition of myalgic encephalopathy. ME is a potentially severe and disabling illness, and most commonly affects people aged 20 to 40. I am not in the least surprised, therefore, that she reflects so well the comments of her young constituents.</p>

However, I want first to put on the record that we accept the World Health Organisation's classification of ME as a neurological condition of unknown cause. I realise from the hon. Lady's comments that that is an important acknowledgment. I was interested to hear of the work of the Dorset ME society, and I congratulate it on its efforts. I was also interested to hear of the provision made by the local NHS trust and of the views and experiences of her constituents. All that helped to paint a clear picture.</p>

work and social and family life. I acknowledge the points that have been raised so clearly by the hon. Lady. The case was clearly made that enhanced research, better services and a better understanding of the condition would all make a huge difference to the quality of life of people with ME.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o547"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para29"><a name="1002244001647">We know that care for people with ME has varied widely, and in the worst cases has sadly left some people with the condition feeling that their illness is not recognised by the health system. In particular, there is a need for them to have access to health professionals with an understanding of their needs, timely access to appropriate services and treatments, and more and better information, communicated in a more understanding and thorough way. It is clear to me that people with ME need and deserve better services, and over the past few years we have sought to address those concerns. The hon. Lady made some important points about the provision and availability of benefits, and I will draw those comments to the attention of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o548"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para30"><a name="1002244001648">On the NICE guidance, the hon. Lady will be aware that the Department of Health commissioned NICE to produce a clinical guide for the diagnosis, management and treatment of ME. The publication of those guidelines in 2008 was an important opportunity to change the existing situation for the better, helping both health care professionals and patients by providing advice based on evidence on how to best manage the condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o549"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para31"><a name="1002244001649">Having said that, I am very aware that there are concerns about some of the approaches used for managing ME outlined in the guidelines, and we have to work with patient groups, researchers and other stakeholders to establish what treatment, or combination of treatments, will best help patients to get better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o550"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para32"><a name="1002244001650">The hon. Lady referred to cognitive behavioural therapy and the concerns about it not being an effective treatment. Sadly, there is no cure as yet for ME, as we know. Treatment seeks to help people with the condition and their symptoms. I am aware that there are concerns about CBT, but I am also aware that it is known to be helpful to some patients, when applied appropriately and with mutually agreed goals and principles. As with many of the management strategies currently available, it is important that we test out the evidence base. That is why the clinical trial PACE-pacing, graded activity and cognitive behaviour therapy: a randomised evaluation-will be so important in testing the effectiveness of treatments, so that patients can make informed decisions about their care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o551"><a name="100223-0022.htm_para33"><a name="1002244001651">It is also important to emphasise that clinical guidelines are not mandatory. The purpose of such guidelines is to support clinical decision making. They are also intended to assist primary care trusts in service development and redesign, but ultimately health professionals are free to use their clinical judgement and, in consultation with their patients, to decide on the most appropriate treatment options, taking into account individual clinical factors. The guidelines recognise there is no one form of treatment to suit every patient, and emphasise that it is necessary to have a collaborative relationship between clinician and patient if success is to be realised. Although all patients want to get better, none should be coerced into accepting any particular form of treatment. Management should always be underpinned by an ethos of joint decision making and informed choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o552"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para0"><a name="1002244001652">The emphasis on empowering patients to become genuine and informed partners in their care is also a key theme of the national service framework for long-term conditions, which is a means to an end, the end being the improvement of services for people with neurological conditions across the country. People with those conditions will get faster diagnosis, more rapid treatment and a comprehensive package of care. We are now working with a range of key stakeholders-for example, the patient groups that represent those with neurological conditions-to identify and develop practical tools and advice that can help local services and organisations to deliver the national service framework. That means that services for people with conditions such as ME will progressively improve over the 10 years of its implementation, through to 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o553"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para1"><a name="1002244001653">As we know, it is important that the NHS sets its own priorities locally, in response to local need and local circumstances. We acknowledge that there have been many requests for national service frameworks or strategies for particular clinical areas, including ME, so we have established a national quality board to advise on future clinical priorities and the steps that might be taken to promote clinical quality in the identified priority areas. Improvement in the commissioning of local services is absolutely at the heart of our health service's capacity to achieve better results for patients, as well as better value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o554"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para2"><a name="1002244001654">As part of that, local involvement networks are critical in improving the commissioning of the right services. They play a key role in encouraging and enabling people to influence the commissioning and the provision of health and social care, and bring real accountability to the system. Part of how we improve services is by giving a stronger collective voice to patients and local groups associated with specific conditions such as ME. They can influence the decision makers to ensure that services are more responsive to their needs. Going by the hon. Lady's comments, I am sure that she is working closely with the relevant groups and people to ensure that voices are heard and responded to. The correspondence and representations that the Department of Health receives from patients and patient groups show clearly the determination to influence local decisions. I would encourage people to continue with that involvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para3"><a name="1002244001655">The hon. Lady rightly referred to young people and children, who have particular needs when they have ME. That is why services for children have been given such prominence by this Government. Nearly all children who are severely affected by ME, as well as many who are moderately affected, will require the provision of home tuition and/or distance learning. A critical element of care will therefore be the assessment and provision of educational needs. Children should have access to as much education as their condition allows, and local authorities have an absolute responsibility to ensure that they do so. An educational plan for a child or young person with ME is not an optional extra but an integral part of their treatment. Educational needs should be identified in the diagnostic process, and adequate provision of continuing education demands close liaison between GPs, community paediatric services, education services and, of course, the young person and their family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para4"><a name="1002244001656">As the hon. Lady said, research is the key to developing new treatments, transforming care and finding a cure for this debilitating condition. Research into ME continues  <br>

to be a strategic priority area for the Medical Research Council. The MRC is one of the main public funders of medical research, receiving its funding through grant-in-aid from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The MRC remains committed to supporting scientific research into all aspects of ME, including evaluations of treatments and studies of the biological basis of the condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o557"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para5"><a name="1002244001657">In 2008-09, the MRC spent £728,000 supporting four separate projects in this particular area. Nevertheless, we recognise there is scope for an expanded research programme for ME. The MRC has set up an expert group, chaired by Professor Stephen Holgate, to consider how best to encourage new research into ME, and how to bring researchers from associated areas into the field. The expert group arranged a small research workshop on ME at the end of last year, and the results will be published on the MRC website in due course. We also need to address the fact that not enough proposals for research are coming forward for consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o558"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para6"><a name="1002244001658">We are aware of a recent high-profile study that suggested that xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related  <br>

virus, or XMRV, is present in a large proportion of people with ME. These results have received widespread media attention. They are potentially exciting, but it is important to note that reports from two separate UK studies do not support the finding of a link between XMRV and ME. It is clear that further research will be required to replicate the original findings, and to show a causative link between XMRV and ME. The MRC's National Institute for Medical Research has a research programme on infection and the replication of retroviruses, including XMRV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="100223-0023.htm_para7"><a name="1002244001659">I thank the hon. Lady for bringing this important subject to the attention of the House. I commend the efforts made by her and others to raise awareness of it, which I believe will contribute to a change for the better. I hope that she will agree that the Government recognise the importance of the issues that she has raised, while understanding the immense challenge of ME and taking steps to address it.</p>
