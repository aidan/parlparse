 (Con): If he will make a statement on the security situation in Northern Ireland.  [29664]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51123-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 We continue to see dramatic improvements in the security situation compared with the height of the troubles and paramilitary attacks continue to decrease. Those dramatic improvements could not have occurred without the enormous sacrifices made by the security services over 35 years. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the award of the George cross to the Royal Ulster Constabulary by Her Majesty the Queen. That award recognised many cases of exceptional valour, which we remember again today.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51123-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Although conventional terrorism is obviously under control, it has been replaced by a ruthless form of racketeering, which is being carried out by both loyalist and republican paramilitaries. Does the Secretary of State share my concern that parts of the Province are descending into anarchy? Surely now is not the time to disband the two Territorial battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment.
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51123-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 On the home battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment, discussions are currently taking place about compensation for those affected and their families, and I hope that it will be as generous as possible, because they deserve no less. On the overall situation, it is true that there is still too much criminality. Indeed, the feud between the loyalist groups in the summer was largely about gangsterism rather than the original political objectives of the Loyalist Volunteer Force and the Ulster Volunteer Force. It is also true that there is still criminality among republicans, and the Assets Recovery Agency and the Organised Crime Task Force are cracking down on it together with the police.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51123-01_spnew2"><b> Dr. William McCrea  (South Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): A BBC television programme that was aired last night revealed that the police have warned a friend of the late Robert

<br>&nbsp;<br>McCartney that there is a threat to his life from the Provisional IRA. How does that sit with ministerial statements that the Provisional IRA has turned its back on terrorism, and why will that organisation be rewarded in a debate later today?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51123-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I have received no evidence from the police or any other quarter about a threat to Robert McCartney witnesses or friends by the Provisional IRA, but I have received reports that individual republicans in that locality have made threats. Those matters are being dealt with by the police and arrests have taken place, and we will continue vigorously to crack down on such activities.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51123-01_spnew4"><b> Lady Hermon  (North Down)</b>

 I know that the hon. Lady takes a close interest in that matter, which she has discussed with me, and I am grateful for her interest. We hope that some of the loyalist groups will start to engage with the de Chastelain commission, and it is important that they do so. I understand that some preliminary contacts have been made and it is important that they progress to allow us to reach the same end as that achieved with the Provisional IRA.

The Independent Monitoring Commission October report covers March to August this year, but there were loyalist riots in September over the Blackrock parade and the LVF has stated that its feud with the UVF is over. To emphasise the point raised by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon), have any loyalist paramilitaries met the decommissioning commission? If the LVF means what it says, it should give up its weapons, too.
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51123-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I think that the hon. Lady is referring to the Whiterock parade, but she has made an important point. I agree with her that it is important that the LVF, the UVF, the Ulster Defence Association and any other loyalist paramilitaries give up their weapons and engage with the de Chastelain commission, as the hon.

<a name="stpa_1">Will the Secretary of State make it clear that the Government will provide sufficient assurances in their forthcoming guidelines on community restorative justice to ensure that nothing like the appalling practices reported by the rape crisis and sexual abuse centre can recur?

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51123-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Yes, I am happy to provide that unequivocal assurance. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter, because a great deal of mischief and misinformation has been spread about community restorative justice schemes. The guidelines for the new schemes will be published on 5 December by the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), when he meets the Policing Board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Let me make it emphatically clear that, whatever claims are made by Sinn Fein members or others, these schemes, which operate in republican communities among others, are currently unregulated. We intend to bring them under proper regulation if they wish to attract public funds, although no provision has been made for that. I can unequivocally state that under our guidelines nobody who has been involved in paramilitary activity or organised crime would be allowed to work on the schemes. Appointments principles would be overseen by an independent body. There is no way in which those schemes will have a policing role in determining guilt or innocence. They will have no investigative role and will have to work with all the statutory agencies, including the police service.
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51123-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 I am grateful for those words, but can the Secretary of State also assure the House that he will provide an independent statutory basis for complaints against members of community restorative justice schemes? He will know that at present there is real fear on estates in Belfast, Derry and elsewhere that if these schemes are licensed by the Government, that will amount to licensed control by paramilitary mafia.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51123-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 It is emphatically not the case that any community restorative justice schemes that we endorse will in any way allow for control by paramilitary mafia, militia, or whatever else the hon. Gentleman chooses to call them. I agree with him on that. He should remember that these proposals stemmed from the community justice review some years ago and were widely endorsed on a cross-party basis. We needed to establish proper guidelines and regulation of what is now a bit of a free-for-all. In doing so, there will be an opportunity to consult, as the hon. Gentleman will see when we publish the guidelines on 5 December. We will consult him and other parties, as well as others in Northern Ireland, on the exact terms of the guidelines.

</p>


<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51123-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Angela E. Smith): </b> 
 The Government are determined to focus resources on front-line services, not bureaucracy. Yesterday&#039;s announcement on the review of public administration included a new Education Authority replacing the functions of the five education and library boards and other support bodies. Through these fundamental changes, along with the existing measures to cut administration costs, I am determined to ensure that our children and schools see tangible benefits.
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51123-01_spnew14"><b> Mary Creagh: </b> 
 How will the organisation reforms that my hon. Friend sets out help to deal with the impact of falling pupil numbers in schools in Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51123-01_spnew15"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to highlight the issue of falling pupil rolls. There are about 47,000 empty desks in Northern Ireland&#039;s schools, and if no action is taken that figure could rise to 80,000 over the next 10 years. The new structures that I announced yesterday will ensure that we can be more responsive in dealing with that while placing a greater emphasis on strategic planning across Northern Ireland&#039;s schools estate. A failure to tackle the issue would put unacceptable pressure on school budgets. The measures announced yesterday will ensure that we go a long way towards tackling it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51123-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. David Anderson: </b> 
 The administrative changes may well result in people losing their jobs. Will my hon. Friend assure me that the work force will be taken care of, with, if possible, an agreement on no compulsory redundancies? Can the review look into the cost of duplication through segregated services? We should move much more towards an integrated education system so that we can save money and provide a better service.
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51123-01_spnew17"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 It is too early to talk about possible job losses, because current functions still need to be carried out, but I assure my hon. Friend that we will do everything possible to ensure that any redundancies are voluntary. As the Secretary of State announced yesterday, we are establishing a Public Service Commission to ensure that the work force are fully engaged and involved in the decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">My hon. Friend asked about duplication in the schools estate, which has been highlighted. The Good Friday agreement includes a commitment to integrated education. I have also given a commitment that parents&#039; wishes will be adhered to.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51123-01_spnew18"><b> Sammy Wilson  (East Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): The Under-Secretary made much of the reforms or changes that were announced yesterday. A cursory glance shows that, on top of the Department of Education, we will have a new Education Authority, a new Education Advisory Forum, a new director of children&#039;s services, a new Public Service Commission, a new Northern Ireland Network for Youth and new district youth networks in council areas in Northern Ireland. Is that pruning or increasing administration? What costs does she hope to save through the announcement?
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51123-01_spnew19"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 I think that the hon. Gentleman is having some sport with his question. There are currently 67 public bodies, which have been whittled down to 20. There are five education and library boards for a population of 1.7 million, but the new Education Authority, which replaces the five boards and the support bodies, will make a fundamental difference to organisation and cut bureaucracy. I give him a clear assurance that, as a result of the announcement, we are cutting the number of bodies that deal with the same issues.
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51123-01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Under-Secretary give the comparative administrative costs of the education system of Northern Ireland and those for the rest of the United Kingdom? Will she confirm the importance of ensuring that as much money as possible goes directly to pupils on the front line?
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51123-01_spnew21"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The purpose of the changes that we announced is to ensure that money goes directly to front-line services. I am not satisfied that the current administrative structures achieve that. It is difficult to give a comparison of costs because of the different structures in Northern Ireland and in England. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman if I can provide more detail for him. However, the purpose of the changes announced is to ensure that schools are not disadvantaged by overly bureaucratic systems that take money away from schools and put it into bureaucracy.
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51123-01_spnew22"><b> Kitty Ussher  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Under-Secretary agree that ending segregation in schools has an important part to play in the sustainability of the peace process? Will she undertake to discuss with colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills whether there are lessons to be learned from the operation of faith schools in divided communities in other parts of the United Kingdom?
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51123-01_spnew23"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 I assure my hon. Friend that I am in regular contact with my colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills about several issues. However, we have to bear in mind the different situation in Northern Ireland. When I talk to head teachers&#151;indeed, the headmaster of Portora Royal school wrote to me today&#151;I find the collaboration between schools from different sectors, which aims to ensure that pupils are brought closer together, encouraging. It is important when we consider the future in Northern Ireland that schools co-operate and collaborate to ensure that there is no sectarian divide in education.

 (Con): Although it would have been better if yesterday&#039;s announcement on the change to the Department of Education had been made in the House, we support the principle of trying to reduce administration costs. However, how much will it cost to dismantle the grammar school system? Why are the Government intent on destroying the best education system in the UK?
</p>





<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51123-01_spnew25"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should get his facts right before speaking at the Dispatch Box. There is no dismantling of the grammar school system in Northern Ireland. However, we are getting rid of selection. He may find it acceptable that 95 per cent. of children on the Shankill never get a chance of a grammar school education&#151;I do not. Every child should have the opportunity to reach their full potential. He should examine the proposals more closely.

 (SDLP): I note the Under-Secretary&#039;s comments about the consequences of the review of public administration in education and health. The jury is out on that for the moment. However, is the Secretary of State fully aware of the impact of some aspects of the review of public administration on local democracy? Is he aware that all political parties, with the exception of the military wing of Sinn Fein, oppose the proposed changes to the number of councils? If the proposals go ahead as planned, a canton or two somewhere will be under the control of one political paramilitary organisation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51123-01_spnew27"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 We are looking to devolve power to local councils, and one important issue is the role of those councils. Under the proposals put forward by the Secretary of State yesterday, far more functions will be carried out by local government than before. It is worth noting that the voluntary and business sectors across Northern Ireland have broadly supported our proposals to devolve more power to local councils.

 I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.

 I am doing everything possible in that regard; I was doing so last week in New York, and the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela E.

Indeed, only yesterday in Belfast, I met the executives of Citigroup, a very exciting project that has already brought 375 jobs into Belfast. Belfast was chosen by Citigroup over other locations in Europe, including Dublin, because it is a much better place in which to invest. These are high-quality jobs, and we are continuing to bring them in. It is not a question of the Northern Ireland economy being too small, but the business community says&#151;it agrees with me on this&#151;that the economy needs to be much more entrepreneurial and enterprising, to build a stronger private sector right across Northern Ireland.

 (Con): Does the Secretary of State agree that the selling point for investment in Northern Ireland is not subsidy but the excellence of the location and the work force? May I press him further on co-operation with the Republic of Ireland, which has already worked very successfully in tourism?

</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51123-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. We are anxious to take every opportunity to get more investment, including from companies based in the Republic of Ireland. We want them to come to Northern Ireland and to see that there are better opportunities there and a less overheated economy. That was one of the reasons why Citigroup decided to locate in Belfast. It could have chosen the south&#151;indeed, it might have been drawn there in the past&#151;but Northern Ireland, especially with its skills base, is now a very attractive place in which to invest.

I also agree that at a time when we face global competition from China and India, let alone more immediate competition in eastern Europe, we need to consider all investment opportunities, including co-operation across the border, to maximise opportunities for the whole island of Ireland.

Members of the business community, both in New York&#151;where the comments were made&#151;and at home in Northern Ireland, prefer honesty. Honesty about the Northern Ireland economy means saying &quot;Yes, the economy is doing better than ever before, but the private sector is too small compared with the public sector, and there is therefore a question of sustainability.&quot; The business community wants a Secretary of State and a Government who recognise that and want to expand small businesses and the private sector, as indeed we do.

 Does the Minister accept that if regeneration is to succeed, whether in loyalist areas or in other parts of Northern Ireland, there must be meaningful peace and stability? Does he accept that without a much more transparent decommissioning of arms in all parts of Northern Ireland, there will never be that peace and stability? Will he therefore make the decommissioning process more transparent?

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51123-02_spnew16"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman will know, the decommissioning process is ongoing. We have already received the report from the Independent Monitoring Commission following the IRA&#039;s statement in July. We are committed to ensuring that the process is transparent and open, and to building on the strong economy that Northern Ireland can have once the peace process continues. I know that the hon.

 The Government are particularly keen to engage with elected politicians and community groups. We recognise the need for regeneration not just in loyalist areas but in republican and nationalist areas, but we must also ensure that the Government take on board some of the challenges faced by loyalist areas. That is why a taskforce headed by the civil service is considering what we can do for loyalist and Protestant communities throughout Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_7">What went wrong?
</p>





<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51123-03_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 What has happened is that an assessment was made of the number of vaccines that would be necessary. I remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we ensured with the manufacturers that more than 14 million doses would be available this year. At the end of October, however, it appeared that there would be a shortfall because more people were demanding the vaccine. The Department of Health then ordered a further 200,000 doses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_8">To be fair to the Department and the others involved in the planning, I should say that if everything had gone to plan, in the region of 2 million doses would probably not have been needed. It is correct to say that the demand for the doses has risen considerably, obviously as a result of people&#039;s concern. As I said, those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1508</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsible had built a very large contingency into their plans, but it appeared at the end of October that it was not large enough, and that is why they asked for more.
</p>





<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51123-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 At least the Prime Minister, unlike the Secretary of State, has not blamed general practitioners. On 5 October&#151;that is, not at the end of October&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), the shadow Secretary of State for Health, wrote to the Secretary of State. In his letter, he expressed concerns about the availability of vaccines. He did not get a reply until yesterday afternoon, less than two hours before the Secretary of State made her statement in this House. The British Medical Association also warned the right hon. Lady that it had similar concerns. Why did she not respond to those concerns?
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51123-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, let me inform the House of what took place earlier this year in respect of the doses that were ordered. In accordance with the normal practice that has applied since 2000&#150;01, a meeting was held with the UK vaccine industry group, at which the number of doses thought to be necessary for the year was worked out. This year, about 4 million more doses were ordered than was the case, say, five years ago. As a result, there should have been easily enough doses to cater for people over 65 and those at clinical risk. As I said a moment or two ago, the number of doses ordered meant that there should have been a probable surplus of 2 million. That is why people thought that there would be enough to cover any eventuality, including increased demand arising from the heightened concern about flu in recent weeks. It was at the end of October that it appeared that that was not the case. In early November, therefore, a further 200,000 doses were ordered. That will mean that the number of doses manufactured is somewhere in the region of 14.5 million.
</p>





<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51123-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The Prime Minister has referred to 14 million doses, but that is exactly the same as the number of doses that a Health Minister, last year, told us was being made available last year. So 14 million doses last year, 14 million this year: is it not true that the Department of Health cannot tell the difference between England and the UK? In its letter to GPs this week, it said that there were only 11 million people in the at-risk groups, and 14 million doses of vaccine. However, the first figure refers to England and the second to the UK as a whole. Is it any wonder that GPs and others are in despair at the inefficiency and incompetence of the Department of Health and the Secretary of State? If the Department can so comprehensively bungle the routine administration of the seasonal flu vaccine, what confidence can people have in its ability to cope with a pandemic of bird flu?
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51123-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As I have explained to the right hon. and learned Gentleman, over the past few years we have increased enormously the number of doses available. It is correct that a 100 per cent. takeup among people aged over 65 and those at clinical risk would amount to 11 million doses. However, the biggest takeup that there has ever been amounted to only 70 per cent. So even taking into account the UK-wide factor, the planners estimated earlier in the year that there would be a surplus of 2 million doses. Last year, there 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1509</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>were more than 1 million surplus doses that had to be destroyed. It is sometimes difficult to plan accurately. They built in a large contingency, but it appears that that has not been enough and therefore they have ordered more doses.
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51123-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The Prime Minister has yet again compared figures for those at risk that relate to England with figures relating to doses for the UK, as the Secretary of State did yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_9">Now let us look at another example of incompetence. Four weeks ago, the Leader of the House, when asked if the Government could guarantee energy supplies to business and domestic customers this winter, said, &quot;Yes, they can&quot;. Does that guarantee still stand?
</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51123-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Of course there will be difficulties with gas prices, because of the cold winter we are likely to have. The energy suppliers have made it clear that they are doing their level best to ensure that demand is properly met. There is not, as far as we are aware, a problem for domestic users. There is a problem for high-level industry users, but the only way to deal with that is to ensure that the industry can meet as much demand as possible from abroad. On the whole, industry prices for domestic consumers in the UK are way below the European Union average. We are not the only country with the problem, but it is not a problem that lies within the remit of Government to resolve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51123-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Now we know that when this Government give guarantees, they last roughly four weeks. The Leader of the House also said that Government would plan and prepare for this winter, but the Government commissioned studies on gas supplies for large manufacturers only two weeks ago. Why has it taken until November&#151;when winter has already arrived, gas prices are almost five times higher than they were a month ago and manufacturers have been forced to switch from gas to oil to generate electricity&#151;to find out whether business can cope this winter? Should not that have been done months ago?
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51123-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I do not think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman seriously suggests that we should have a planned economy, in which the Government buy in&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps that is what he is suggesting. Let me just tell him the facts. UK energy prices&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, this is a rather strange situation. I do not know whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman is suggesting that the Government should buy in energy from abroad. The Government work with the industry to ensure that it can meet demand. I repeat the fact that UK prices are actually the cheapest in the European Union and UK domestic prices are 40 per cent. below the European Union median. It is true that there will be an extra &#163;10 billion of investment in additional energy supply, but it is not something that Government on their own can resolve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51123-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 If the Prime Minister thinks that gas prices for British industry are cheaper than gas prices for European industry, he is living in a dream world. I suggest that the Government should have done what they are now doing some months ago. The Met Office 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1510</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>warned us months ago that we were likely to have the coldest winter for more than a decade. The CBI and others have been warning for months of possible gas shortages. Why have the Government ignored them for so long? Why, on flu vaccines and gas supplies, have the Government proved so thoroughly incompetent? Is it not clear that the Government are on the skids and that the Prime Minister has lost his grip and is incapable of dealing with the challenges that the country faces?
</p>





<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51123-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Even the right hon. and learned Gentleman found it a bit of a stretch to link flu jabs with gas prices. As opposed to the situation in respect of the vaccine for flu, in which we sit down with manufacturers and help to ensure that enough is ordered, the gas market and prices depend on demand and the amount of gas available for electricity users and others to buy. The idea that the Government should make up the shortfall is utterly absurd.
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51123-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I am not saying that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51123-03_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Well, I do not know what the right hon. and learned Gentleman is suggesting, other than points that seem absolutely absurd. We are doing our level best to make sure, for example, that we have additional infrastructure that allows us to import more energy. That we are doing, but what we cannot do&#151;even this Government&#151;is affect the current situation in the energy market, which is a product of all the reasons that we know about and which, I repeat, Government alone cannot resolve.

Although Bradford is united in its horror, shock and grief, does the Prime Minister agree that this is a time for sober reflection, not a time to call for the routine arming of the police or for the restoration of the death penalty?
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51123-03_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As my hon. Friend says, it is important that we see, in a considered way, what more can be done. As he knows, since January 2004 anyone convicted of possession of an illegal firearm receives a mandatory five-year minimum sentence. Measures under the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will ban the sale, manufacture or import of realistic imitation firearms. The new Serious Organised Crime Agency, will come into effect next April. With the agency, we are looking at the additional measures necessary to deal with organised crime. With organised crime, as we have done with antisocial behaviour in a completely different context, there will be a need for special and particular measures to deal with a very brutal new type of organised criminal gang that operates not just in this country but in other countries as well. We shall come back to the House with such proposals when we can.

<p>
<a name="51123-03_para6">
<a name="stpa_10">May I return to the opening question from the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)? As the Prime Minister has acknowledged elsewhere, those of us who disagreed with him over an aspect of the Terrorism Bill&#151;90-days imprisonment without charge&#151;did so as a matter of principle. Does he recognise that the Northern Ireland measures before the House this afternoon also raise matters of proper principled judicial process? Those of us who support the Good Friday agreement readily accept that the issue must be resolved, but if justice is to be seen to be done it is surely imperative that those who have committed terrorist atrocities appear in court and answer for their crimes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51123-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I think that the right hon. Gentleman knows why we have to deal with the issue. We have to deal it with it for a very simple reason: under the provisions of the Belfast agreement&#151;the Good Friday agreement&#151;those convicted of offences before that agreement, in other words, before April 1998, have been released under the prisoner release scheme. We were always going to have to deal with the situation of those suspected of, or being pursued in respect of, crimes committed before April 1998, and that is what we are trying to do. The proposals were published about two and a half years ago and are a necessary part of ensuring that we follow the process through to its conclusion. I understand the anger that they provoke; it is very natural, especially from those who suffered so much from acts of IRA terrorism. However, I believe that they are a necessary part of securing the overall agreement.
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51123-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Kennedy: </b> 
 Why will not the Prime Minister provide direct linkage in the legislation to the early release scheme, which involves a proper court process? Many who, like the Alliance party and others, have worked tirelessly for reconciliation in Northern Ireland are asking a simple question: why will not the Prime Minister put the victims of terrorism higher up the priority list?
</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51123-03_spmin12"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The special judicial tribunal has the powers of a criminal court. It is true that this is a special procedure, because the circumstances are special. As for the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s remark about putting the victims of terrorism higher up the political agenda, it is precisely for that reason that, over the past eight years, I have worked to try to make sure that the Northern Ireland peace process succeeds. If it does succeed&#151;we have come a long way in eight years&#151;it is sometimes because we do things that are uncomfortable and difficult, but none the less necessary. It is called, I am afraid, making difficult political decisions.

 The main part of what the Crown Prosecution Service is doing now is working in a far more integrated way with the police to make sure that charges are properly brought and that therefore prosecutions can be successfully mounted. In respect of sexual offences, although there is an increase in the number of recorded crimes, it is important to realise that that is in part because we are asking more of the victims of sexual offences to come forward. Sometimes, however, it is difficult to secure convictions in those types of case, but we continually look at how we can improve the situation.

 The facts are that so far this winter there have been no gas shortages and supply and demand have remained in balance. Demand from gas is being met by deliveries from the North sea and the rest of the UK continental shelf, the interconnector, imports through the Isle of Grain and storage. We are also seeing a reduction in demand from gas-fired power stations and some large industrial users of gas in response to increased prices.

National Grid&#039;s daily report for 21 November shows short and long-range storage as being at 100 per cent. and 98 per cent. respectively. Medium range remains at 66 per cent. pending the new Humbly Grove facility, which is in the process of filling up.

<a name="stpa_2">The serious point is that in terms of the gas market, supplies are taken from storage from time to time. They are then filled up. Let us remember that the North sea is this country&#039;s natural storage. The market is building&#151;it is a matter for the market, not for the Government&#151;more storage facilities, with 10 new projects under way. Reports from National Grid this morning say that what is happening to the spot gas price is irrational. It tells me that it is awash with gas at the moment.

The particular problem is with the intensive users of energy, who use gas as the feedstuff for producing chemicals, for example. They&#151;not the Government&#151;have chosen to buy on the spot market. It is one private company signing a contract with another, and they are suffering from very high prices. We are concerned about that and we are working with them, but as was said during Prime Minister&#039;s questions, the market is a liberal, commercial, privatised market in which judgments are made by private companies. We do not need someone posing as a shadow Stalinist Minister of Power saying that the Government should take command. To put the matter in context, the companies in question, although important British industries, represent 0.2 per cent. of companies that use gas and 0.05 per cent. of all companies in the UK. I am not complacent, but we have to put the present concerns in an intelligent and factual context.

However, let us look at the prices for medium-sized businesses&#151;the hon. Gentleman might want to know the facts as opposed to the bluster. For such businesses, the latest figures available&#151;for the summer&#151;show that the price of gas is 17 per cent. lower than in Germany, 4 per cent. lower than in France and 4 per cent. lower than the EU median, and the price of electricity is 49 per cent. lower than in Germany, 10 per cent. lower than in France and 20 per cent. lower than the EU median.

In summer, I met representatives of the oil and gas industry operating in the North sea and the UK continental shelf to make sure that they were doing the repairs and had the spares necessary to ensure that they were in the best possible position this winter. I met the supply companies on two occasions&#151;my officials have done so more often&#151;to make sure that they are in the best possible position this winter. In November, the industry suggested that there were one or two other actions that we might wish to investigate, and of course we listened to their advice.

If those people hear that there may be energy cuts from reports that, in fact, are inaccurate, scaremongering nonsense, they may fear the effects of the cold weather that we are now experiencing.

<a name="stpa_10">Next Thursday, the Minister will chair the Energy Council of Europe. How does he plan to deal with what the European Commission has identified as serious malfunctions in the European energy market? While we    are connected as a liberalised market to a malfunctioning market there are serious concerns about the way in which the latter market will impact on our market. What progress does he plan to make next Thursday in sorting out that market? He has held meetings with representatives from industry and UK continental shelf operations, but what meetings has he had with the Environment Agency to ensure that there is minimal impact on the environment and that we maximise the economic benefits this winter? Finally, while there are arguments about our relative position in Europe, the reality is that prices are going up this winter, which is a serious concern for the economy, especially for those parts that may be shut down.

 The hon. Gentleman raised two or three serious matters. I chair the Energy Council during our presidency, and it meets next week, on 1 December. We have made it clear from the beginning of our presidency that the issue of market liberalisation in the rest of Europe was at the top of our agenda&#151;indeed, it is the top item on the agenda next week. The Commission has published two major reports on the issue, and it has made it quite clear that there are &quot;serious malfunctions&quot; in the European market. We will discuss that with Ministers, and we need to take action, because we have market liberalisation in the UK, and we need it across the European Union. That is the policy, and it should quickly become practice.

Energy demand in China, for example, is increasing by 15 per cent. a year, and the hurricanes have not helped. There are therefore serious difficulties, but we must do our utmost to protect people to whom we refer as the fuel-poor. I tend to think of them as elderly and other vulnerable people who will be cold this winter. We have taken action on several fronts, as I detailed earlier, to protect that high-priority group.

For that reason, when the details of the energy review are announced by the Prime Minister, possibly quite soon, it will be a review of energy as a whole, contrary to what some people are speculating, and the future of coal will be one of the focuses of that important review.

 There will be a degree of scepticism about the Minister&#039;s claims about relative prices in Europe and the UK, but leaving that on one side, he has rightly highlighted, in answer to the question from the Liberal Democrats, the importance of the single European market in energy. When he came before the Trade and Industry Committee a few weeks ago, the Minister said that that was the highest priority, but there is not much sign of progress yet. He speaks about forcing compliance on other countries when he chairs the meeting next week. How does he intend to do that? Does he think that there is a realistic chance of making a breakthrough in those crucial negotiations? The market is determined by Governments, and the British Government have a golden opportunity to help resolve it.

 There has been progress. The market has been the major focus during our presidency. The Energy Council does not meet till next week. Meanwhile, with our strong approval, the Commission has published two major evidence-based hard-hitting reports.

I hope that might become more fashionable on the Opposition Benches. I have given the House some evidence already. Let me also say&#151;I am surprised that the party of the market is not parading this more than I&#151;that between 1990 and 2004, British industry paid an estimated &#163;7.9 billion less than German industry for gas.

 We have touched on some of that in relation to the importance of market liberalisation. The dialogue with the industry which, as my hon.

The Langeled pipeline to Norway is being built. There are many, many other projects, including upgrades of the interconnector, which will mean that in terms of the infrastructure of terminals, LNG and pipelines, we will have capacity for some 26 per cent. more gas in a year or so than we currently have. So the infrastructure and the investment by the private market are there.

 The Minister will understand that we in Scotland find it extraordinary that there is a gas shortage and rocketing prices, when we produce eight times the amount that we consume&#151;indeed, land at St. Fergus alone six times what we consume. He mentioned infrastructure, but does he accept that much of the problem in the UK as a whole with supply and rising spot prices is due to the lack of investment in the pipeline system over many years, leading to a lack of flexibility and capacity for storage to meet periods of exceptional demand? He spoke about improvements in infrastructure, but when can we go back to manufacturers in our constituencies and tell them that there is no chance of interrupted gas supplies in the future?

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges the strong partnership between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. I have mentioned the investment that is now taking place, which should make an impact on the price issues. I repeat that for most of the economy, certainly for the domestic customer, the spot gas prices are not the relevant feature; they are for those companies who are the intensive users, using gas as the feedstuff for chemicals and other materials, who have chosen freely, as part of the private market, to sign such contracts, which often enable them to reduce their own demand at difficult times. But I hope that, with the extra supply of gas and more generally with the announcements that we have recently made about connecting up the Scottish islands to the national grid in terms of wind power, the situation will steadily improve. I expect it to.

Equally, the Government failed to take decisions in the Energy White Paper, and now we are to have an energy review by the Prime Minister.

 The Minister said that Britain does not need a strategic gas reserve, as we have for oil, because of the reserves in the North sea. Will he describe the circumstances and the legal powers under which, in an emergency, he could require private companies to sell into the market?

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51123-06_spnew14"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 As I have explained, the contracts that some intensive users freely sign mean that in certain circumstances they will take less gas than in normal times. Some companies make money by selling it back to the grid. That is the reality of the market in that situation. It would be in only the most extreme and    unlikely circumstances, in serious emergency conditions, that the state, via the national grid, might have to intervene. I answer the question because the hon. Gentleman asked it, but no rational commentator anticipates such a situation.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51123-07_spnew0"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister has openly acknowledged that we now import gas through the interconnector. That has profound political implications, particularly with regard to the energy mix. Does he have a long-term policy on whether there should a limit on an acceptable level of gas imports?
</p>





<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51123-07_spnew1"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 My own Member of Parliament has asked me an important question. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I always think that how one votes is a secret. The hon. Gentleman raises an important question about national security and the geopolitics of energy policy, and that is a matter of growing concern. In 2004 we became a net importer of gas, as the hon. Gentleman knows, and in a year or so we will become a net importer of oil. Therefore, we are moving from energy island to a heavy dependence on imports of energy, notwithstanding the issues around coal and the contribution of renewables, and so on, which I could go into if we had more time. Therefore, as the Prime Minister said at the Labour party conference in Brighton&#151;I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was there on that occasion&#151;we now need rigorously to consider issues relating to our depending on some unstable parts of the world, and that will be an important dimension of the new energy review.
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51123-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister has accused Opposition Members of scaremongering about the prospect of cuts in the gas supply. May I therefore direct him to the comments made by the hon. and learned Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O&#039;Brien), a former Minister with responsibility for energy, in January 2005 in Westminster Hall, when he said that gas supplies could indeed run short if there were a cold snap this winter, or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1523</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>next winter? Will he take time to familiarise himself with those remarks, and perhaps look into what the hon. and learned Gentleman meant by that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51123-07_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 We all recognise that the balance between energy supply and demand for two or three years is difficult. That is to some extent why we are having this discussion. Why is that? I am advised that it is partly because the rundown of oil and gas from the North sea and the rest of the UK continental shelf has happened at a faster rate than was being predicted only a few years ago. It is also because&#151;it is regrettable but it is where we are&#151;the heavy investment by the market in infrastructure, such as pipelines, liquefied natural gas terminals and the rest, is only now coming on stream, or will be in a year or so. I rather wish that it had been there a year or so ago. Of course I do. But there is this time lag. There is a tightness in the market, but domestic consumers will not be affected and most of business will not be affected, although high prices are now a global phenomenon. However, there is the issue, and I am repeating myself now, of the heavy users, which is where the difficulty is, if people have chosen, rightly or wrongly&#151;it is their commercial judgment&#151;to buy on the spot market.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_15">Registration officers are appointed, accommodated and paid by local authorities, which also provide their pensions. However, because they are statutory officers, they have no legal employer, and only the Registrar General at the Office for National Statistics in Pimlico has the power to dismiss them. A registration officer has duties and responsibilities imposed by the Marriage Act 1949, the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 and the Registration Service Act 1953.

The Registrar General will hear an appeal, but only if new material evidence is available. My Bill will result in the post holders becoming employees of the local authority. Notwithstanding that, they would retain their statutory duties under the Registration Acts. My Bill will also result in consequential amendments to the Registration Service Act 1953.
</p>

<a name="stpa_17">The Bill has the full support of the Government, the Registrar General and the Front-Bench spokesmen for the two major Opposition parties, whom I thank for their support. It also has the full support of the representative organisations of the employees whom it will affect, namely their professional organisation, SORO, Unison, the employer&#039;s organisation and the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_18">My Bill is non-controversial. It would bring the employment of registration officers into line with all those currently employed by local authorities, and would impose no additional financial burden on local authorities. When registration officers change their status and become local authority employees, there will be no redundancies and their existing pay and conditions will be unaffected. Moreover, there will be consultation in accordance with a national joint council agreement that is being negotiated between the employer&#039;s organisation and Unison.

<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the number of Ministers whom I have dealt with, in both the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, in an attempt to correct the anomaly that this Bill would right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_20">Following my early lobbying, I learned that the White Paper &quot;Fairness at Work&quot; contains a proposal to allow existing employment rights to be extended to all statutory officers and that section 23 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 provides a way forward. The DTI embarked on a consultation exercise on section 23 of the 1999 Act in 2003, which is known as the employment status review, and a statement about the use of section 23 is expected towards the end of this year or the beginning of the next.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_21">Section 23 allows the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to make an order, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, to extend to persons who do not currently enjoy them certain employment rights, but an employment order under section 23 has not yet been made. In parallel with those DTI procedures, the Treasury planned a major reform of the civil registration service, the first since the service was established in 1837.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_22">In September 1999, the Registrar General published a consultation paper, &quot;Registration: Modernising a Vital Service&quot;, which resulted in the publication in January 2002 of the White Paper &quot;Civil Registration: Vital Change&quot;. The Government announced that civil registration reform would be delivered by means of the order-making powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, and another consultation document, &quot;Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change&quot; was published in 2003. The document proposed that the titles of superintendent registrar, registrar of births, marriages and deaths or additional registrar of marriages should disappear, and that local authorities should become the legal employers of all those involved in the civil registration service, in which case the demarcation between registration officers at marriage ceremonies and registering births, deaths and marriage events would cease.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_23">The first of two planned draft orders, the Regulatory Reform (Registration of Births and Deaths) (England and Wales) Order 2004, was laid before Parliament on 22 July 2004. It is the largest regulatory reform proposal ever presented to Parliament, with 68 articles and 15 schedules amending 20 Acts. The House of Commons Regulatory Reform Committee report on the first draft order was published in December 2004. It rejected using delegated legislation to reform the civil registration service or the part of it that deals with births and deaths. A second regulatory reform order was planned to reform the civil registration service relating to marriage, but it has not been laid. The House of Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee also rejected the first draft order. Both Committees regarded the overall package of proposals as an inappropriate use of the powers in the 2001 Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_24">On 16 November this year, the Financial Secretary launched a further consultation paper, &quot;Registration Modernisation&quot;, which sets out how local authorities are to be given greater responsibility for the delivery of the local registration service. It also contains details of other important changes to modernise civil registration. Some of these changes will require primary legislation, and further delays are inevitable. Because of that, I beg leave of the House to introduce this Bill, which in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1526</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>meantime will remove the uncertainty that has hung over the employment of registration officers for so long and which will deliver them the right of appeal to an employment tribunal should they be unfairly or constructively dismissed. Surely that is what this House wants in the 21st century? I therefore commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51123-08_spnew0"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 I was going to start by saying that I hesitate to intervene in a matter in which the hon. Gentleman has such expertise, but as you know, Mr. Speaker, I rarely hesitate to do any such thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_25">I want to say a few words because I have been contacted by a registration officer, who has expressed some concern about the process that the hon. Gentleman has described and the way in which it has been conducted. My reservations are more about process than about content, although I must say that when I see a Government paper that begins with, &quot;The modernisation of&quot;, my blood runs cold and I have serious reservations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_26">I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman&#039;s long-standing interest in the subject and his expertise, and I defer to them. I am glad to see that the Financial Secretary is on the Front Bench, because the Bill that the hon. Gentleman is introducing has two problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">First, I suspect that he is trying to implement what should be Government policy by using the private Member&#039;s Bill route. I say to him in all friendliness that if he thinks that that will be a method of quickly delivering the solution that he seeks, he could not be more mistaken. Whatever date he selects for his Bill, it will already be some way down the order because most of the primary slots have already been taken. There is therefore little chance of its being debated and agreed by the House. I hope that he does not raise too many expectations about his Bill, because choosing this route is naturally hazardous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">Secondly, the Bill is at cross purposes with the very consultation process that the hon. Gentleman openly describes. As recently as 16 November, the Financial Secretary said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;the Government announced that they would actively consider other ways of delivering the key elements of civil registration modernisation.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 51WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">He went on to say that the consultation paper, &quot;Registration Modernisation&quot;, had been published on the same day. That paper gives a deadline for reply to the consultation in February.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_30">My question is therefore this: is it reasonable to expect the House to agree to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Bill, which deals with matters in the consultation paper, when the consultation has hardly started and before the end period for the consultation in February? That strikes me as being a somewhat bizarre way of going about things and, to put it mildly, puts carts before horses. I appeal to the House not to approve the Bill today but to wait until the consultation process has been completed. There is some unease among registration officers about the speed with which this has been done, about whether full consultation has been allowed, and about whether individual officers have been able to express their point of view fully.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_31">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have a quiet word with his colleague, the Financial Secretary, so that they can sort out exactly what they are trying to do&#151;the Government on the one hand and the hon. Gentleman on the other&#151;and try to match more closely the consultation process with the suggested track of the Bill. If it survives today, some of us will be keeping a very close eye on it in the hope that it does not ultimately conflict with the consultation process or with the unease that is being expressed by registration officers outside the House.

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_35">Northern Ireland and Irish terrorism have, over the generations, presented unique challenges to this House, to Governments of both parties, to the forces of law and order, and to society, particularly in Northern Ireland but also in the rest of the United Kingdom. This House, and successive Governments of both parties, have been faced with difficult&#151;often exceptional&#151;problems to deal with. As a result, Ministers have had to adopt exceptional policies&#151;and, in recent times, abnormal measures&#151;to normalise Northern Ireland, so that today it enjoys more peace, stability and prosperity than ever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_36">I believe that the proposals in the Bill should be considered in that light. It sets out to deal with one of the most difficult and sensitive issues that the Government have faced in the long and complex process of taking Northern Ireland forward&#151;that is, those terrorist suspects who are &quot;on the run&quot; outside the reach of our police or our courts.

<a name="51123-08_para12">
<a name="stpa_37">Anyone who is, or has been, involved in trying to make political progress in Northern Ireland will know that having to take difficult decisions is no new experience. The former Prime Minister, John Major, knew that only too well when he took the decision to begin the engagement that would ultimately lead to the Good Friday agreement. That engagement with the IRA at that time was difficult&#151;very difficult. It was unpalatable to many people, not least in this House, but it was right. And because it was right, it had the support of the then Labour Opposition. John Major and his colleagues, Lord Mayhew, Lord Brooke, and the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) paved the way for the Good Friday agreement signed under our Government in 1998. Their role was as crucial as it was courageous. It was attacked and criticised just as our Government are today, but it had the support of the then Labour Opposition.

<a name="stpa_38">The agreement required all sides to compromise and meant taking immensely difficult decisions, not least that on the early release of prisoners, which was completed in 2000. Victims of the troubles were, understandably, in uproar at the sight of murderers or former terrorists walking free, but it was the right thing to do to seal the agreement. However, it left unresolved an equally difficult matter: the issue of what to do about those who had committed terrorist offences before 10 April 1998 and who, had they been in prison at the material time, would have been part of that early-release scheme.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_39">It is important that the House recalls that this has not suddenly materialised. I remind the House that it was raised with the British and Irish Governments at Weston Park in July 2001, but, rightly, was not dealt with then because not enough progress had been made on bringing an end to paramilitary activity. It was raised again in April 2003 in the talks that led to the joint declaration between the British and Irish Governments in May 2003, and a statement for the record was published at that time. It was not dealt with then&#151;again, rightly&#151;because not enough progress had been made on bringing an end to paramilitary activity.

<a name="stpa_40">It is not disputed that the IRA statement of 28 July, ending its violent campaign was of great, indeed historic, significance. That statement, with the subsequent decommissioning of the totality of its weaponry, verified   by General de Chastelain&#039;s Decommissioning Commission and the two independent clergymen in September, has fundamentally changed the political landscape. So now is the appropriate time to deal with this difficult issue.

 Order. We must let the Secretary of State speak.
</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51123-09_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The point that the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) rightly made is the first matter that we should consider. It is probably the most sensitive issue in the Bill&#151;I understand that. There is a question of balance and of whether we can get more people accounted for, brought to justice and convicted, if the evidence justifies that. The victims then have at least the satisfaction that the people who are now on the run outside UK jurisdiction or who might be uncovered by the historic inquiries will be brought to justice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51123-09_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson  (Strangford) (DUP):</b> 
 Does the Secretary of State accept that the figures for deaths and for victims who lived but are scarred physically and mentally do not reflect the total number of deaths resulting from the Sinn Fein-IRA campaign of genocide, especially against the Protestant community? Does he accept that many deaths resulted from fathers and mothers with broken hearts and children who committed suicide because they could not face the reality of how their loved ones met their deaths at the hands of those murderous scum?
</p>





<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51123-09_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Indeed, I do. I fully agree with the hon. Lady. She knows better than me many of the victims and many who felt that life was not worth living after their loved ones were blown up and their lives destroyed. I greatly appreciate that point. As I shall make clear later, the Bill is aimed at bringing closure and an end to the murderous IRA campaign, which the 28 July statement achieved and was confirmed by General de Chastelain&#039;s statement on 26 September. The Bill is aimed at ensuring that the armed campaign is over and that there are no future victims of the IRA.
</p>





<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51123-09_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Robinson: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for giving way a second time. Does he realise that the Bill will bring not closure but more anger and pain, because those people relied on the Government to allow them to see justice done to those who perpetrated the heinous crimes?

 That will happen if people are convicted&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> There may not be sufficient evidence to convict them, but if they are convicted, they will have a criminal record and have to give DNA and other intimate samples.

She knows from first-hand experience, as do many of her colleagues, the suffering that has gone on. All I would say to her&#151;I stress that I do not make the point adversarially&#151;is that, at the moment, the people whom the Bill covers are on the run, outside UK jurisdiction. There is the prospect&#151;no more but no less&#151;of bringing them into UK jurisdiction and putting them through a process of justice. If the tribunal convicts them, it will mean that they have a criminal record. That should be some comfort to the victims.

<a name="stpa_43">My point is that the Bill is about the closure of a dark, awful and murderous terrorist campaign by the IRA.

They were cold cases. No action has been taken over the deaths of loved ones who served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and in the Army.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51123-09_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I find that suggestion reprehensible. The problem that my right hon. Friend and others are refusing to face up to is that these people are not being brought to justice now&#151;[Hon.

In the case of the historic inquiries, we are trying to use the new techniques available, including DNA, to track people down. This includes some of the cases involving murdered police officers rightly mentioned by the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley).

 The right hon. Gentleman made his point very powerfully, and I understand it. I would just make this point in return. He will recall the absolute outcry when the Conservative Government started talking to the IRA. Those early negotiations began a process&#151;

<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1533</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which this legislation is concluding&#151;which led to the statement by the IRA on 28 July that no one here ever thought that it would make, namely, that it was giving up its armed, vicious, murderous terrorist campaign. The Bill is part of that process&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, it is, because it is part of the process agreed with the Irish Government in 2003&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51123-10_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51123-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The point is that the Bill is part of the process announced in 2003, and part of the process that has led to the historic experience for the people of Northern Ireland of the IRA ending their terrorist war. There will therefore be no Provisional IRA victims in the future, as there have so grievously been in the past.
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51123-10_spnew2"><b> Mark Durkan  (Foyle) (SDLP):</b> 
 In his opening remarks, the Secretary of State said that the Government had not moved earlier on this legislation because the IRA had not moved sufficiently on decommissioning. Of course, the Bill will benefit not only the IRA but the loyalist paramilitaries, who have made no moves on decommissioning whatever, so where is the logic there? The Secretary of State also suggests that the Bill somehow flows from the Good Friday agreement. Let me remind him that when the agreement was signed, yes, we sold it and promoted it on the basis that there would be prison releases within two years. We were told at the time that the key date for prison releases was after the date for the completion of decommissioning, but the Government then dropped that. We also assured the victims of crimes that had not been solved that their cases would still be pursued, even if it meant that the perpetrators would serve only two years in jail. That is what the victims were told by Ministers and by the parties, and that is why the victims are being betrayed by the Government today.

 No. However, rightly or wrongly&#151;the hon. Gentleman takes the view that it is wrong, and I respect that; indeed, that view is being expressed very vehemently today, and I understand that&#151;Her Majesty&#039;s Government entered into two agreements that have led to this Bill being introduced. The first was an international agreement with the Irish Government, and that cannot be lightly disregarded. Any responsible Government would have felt that that was the right thing to do to get to where we are&#151;and we have got there. Secondly, as part of the negotiations that led to that process and then to the 28 July statement by the IRA, yes, this was one of the factors in those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1534</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>negotiations and an agreement was made there. Yes, this is following the 28 July statement, but it was part of the process that led to this historic change by the IRA, which I know was welcomed by the hon. Gentleman and every other hon. Member.

<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51123-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson  (Belfast, East) (DUP):</b> 
 Why is the Secretary of State attempting to hang his argument on the fact that the Bill affects on-the-runs? The majority of people who will benefit from it ran from no one. It will affect everyone who committed a terrorist crime before 10 April 1998, not just those who are on the run. Will he please explain why there are to be two different standards: one in D&#225;il Eireann and one here in Westminster? In D&#225;il Eireann, the killers of Garda McCabe are not to be brought within the scope of this legislation. Is a garda in the Republic of Ireland more valuable than an RUC man in Northern Ireland?

 No, of course not. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but the Irish Government are responsible for bringing to justice&#151;or not, as the case may be&#151;cases within their own jurisdiction. That case does not fall within UK jurisdiction. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Irish Government have chosen to address this issue by pardoning people. We are not doing that. We are making sure that people are brought to justice. He is right to say that the Bill affects not only those on the run outside UK jurisdiction but, potentially, those who are the subject of the Chief Constable&#039;s historic inquiries investigation. That investigation will involve a difficult process, and if it uncovers those who have been responsible for awful atrocities such as that in Enniskillen, for example, they will be arrested, charged and brought to justice.

 I started taking interventions some half an hour or more ago, at which time I was explaining that Mo Mowlam started the process by acknowledging that victims had suffered grievously during the Northern Ireland conflict. We all know that, in many respects, their cases had been appallingly neglected for decades, by all Governments. That is why she brought victims&#039; issues to the heart of Government with the creation of the world&#039;s first Minister for victims. That is why the memorial fund was set up, and why we have recently provided it with a further &#163;1.5 million. It is also why Her   Majesty the Queen recognised the valour and sacrifice of the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the George Cross, and today marks the fifth anniversary of that award.

On a number of occasions, he has said that the choice is between allowing people to go free and putting them through the process that he has outlined.

 The Secretary of State referred to the ongoing historic inquiries, and I presume that he includes the Saville inquiry.

However, the absurd position is that if members of the Parachute Regiment are charged as a result of the Saville inquiry, they can clear their names only by going through the full judicial process, because one has to plead guilty to benefit from this system.

 As I understand it, the Secretary of State is saying that if a former serving soldier were charged and chose to try and resist acknowledging guilt, and opted to go through the whole judicial process, he might clear his name, but he could be found guilty. If he were found guilty, could he then use the new procedure to walk free? If he could not, he would in a sense have been blackmailed to accept a false rap and plead guilty in advance so that he could use the new procedure.

 I thought that I had explained the position very clearly, but I am happy to clarify it again for the hon. Gentleman, because it is an important matter for him and, I suspect, for the whole House. It is certainly very important to me. The paratrooper, or any other member of the armed forces, would face a choice. He could plead not guilty or guilty to the charge. Let us say that the Saville inquiry identifies an individual, who is then the subject of investigation by the police, arrested, charged and faces prosecution. He can then choose. Normally, he would go through the existing criminal justice system&#151;the normal Crown court route. He could plead his innocence throughout, but if convicted he could, in principle, serve a very long prison sentence. I took a deliberate decision&#151;I need not have done so&#151;to avail a soldier in that position of the option of the special process, which could leave him with a conviction, but still pleading his innocence, and with release on licence, so that he did not have to serve the sentence.

 I congratulate the Secretary of State on giving way so much. I know that the whole House appreciates it. In answer to his most recent example, the big difference, which he does not seem to have spotted, is that no soldiers asked to go to Northern Ireland.

It is a form of logic that amounts to casuistry to defend a measure that has been contrived to deliver a deal between the Government and IRA-Sinn Fein on the grounds that the special arrangements will also be opened up to soldiers and police officers. Like my hon. Friends&#151;I feel somewhat humble speaking in the presence of those who have served in the armed forces on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland to defend them against terrorism&#151;I find it morally repugnant that we are being asked to approve a Bill that treats agents of the Crown on a par with brutal and ruthless terrorists.

Indeed, in a number of interviews the Secretary of State explicitly linked the Bill to the precedent of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 to justify the measure. However, as other hon. Members said, the measure appears nowhere in the 1998 agreement. It is a product of a bilateral side deal between the Government and Sinn Fein-IRA in 2001. That distinction is important because when it came to the legislation on early release, the Government relied heavily on what was said in the agreement and on the public endorsement of the agreement in the subsequent referendum.

 My hon. Friend is making great progress, but will he take up this one point with the Secretary of State? The right hon.

 My right hon. Friend is correct. When the Secretary of State says that without the deal at Weston Park, we could not have seen an end to the IRA campaign of terror, the House has to ask how that squares when set against the undertaking by Sinn Fein in the 1998 agreement that henceforward it would rely exclusively on democratic and peaceful means to attain its objectives. The logic of the Secretary of State&#039;s argument is that we have to do this because we could not trust Sinn Fein to stick to the word solemnly given in the 1998 agreement, now bound into an international treaty.

His article in <i>The Times</i> yesterday contained a similar reference. I agree that both initiatives were important and welcome. My party and I want the republican movement to complete&#151;at last, belatedly&#151;the much-promised transition from terrorism to democratic and peaceful politics, but I also want to be confident that that process is permanent and irreversible.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51123-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State mentioned the importance of finding out what happened and making sure that people have some sort of closure, but clause 7, headed &quot;Exemption from arrest etc&quot;, makes it clear that if someone has been granted a certificate of eligibility, no power to obtain information about anything that that person has done in connection with the certified offences may be exercised. We will therefore be unable to find out anything about the offences alleged to have been committed by a person who holds a certificate, so the chances of convicting that person and then letting him out on licence, by which the Secretary of State sets great store, are extremely slim.
</p>





<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51123-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a compelling point. The process in the Bill is not one known to any court in the United Kingdom. Once a certificate has been granted, the defendant is immune from arrest or detention and the tribunal will have no power to set bail or to impose bail conditions. A terrorist could therefore return to live in the next street or next door to the victim whom he has wronged. The police will have no power to enter premises or to search either people or property and they will have no power to take fingerprints or samples. Even evidence that the perpetrator gives about himself in order to obtain a certificate is, in the Bill, explicitly made inadmissible in any proceedings before the tribunal. In practice, once someone has got a certificate, no effective further investigation can take place. As my hon. Friend points out, the rules seem to have been drafted to provide the smallest possible chance that any case before the tribunal will end in a verdict of guilty. That is a travesty of both judicial process and the rule of law.

 I can only speculate. Given that I do not believe that the logistical argument about court business has any weight, I conclude that the reason is to do with pandering to the reluctance of Sinn Fein-IRA to recognise the courts&#151;to recognise British justice and the legitimacy of the courts of the United Kingdom operating in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_112">The Secretary of State made great play of the fact someone who is convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment under the special measures would be released only on licence. There is a crucial difference, however, between that provision and the 1998 legislation. In 1998, to be eligible for early release someone had to serve a minimum term. A fixed-term prisoner had to serve at least a third of his sentence before qualifying, and a lifer two-thirds of his expected term. Under the Bill, even if someone commits a serious crime that is unconnected with terrorism&#151;to pluck an example at random, let us take someone who is convicted of a bank robbery&#151;he will not forfeit his licence or have it revoked unless he receives a prison sentence of five years or more. That is a serious gap in the licensing arrangements.

It does not include a deadline by which a perpetrator must admit what he did to acquire a certificate. It provides no penalty whatever for refusing to tell the whole truth. My understanding of the South African experience is that someone&#039;s failure to divulge everything that they had done wrong was in itself an imprisonable offence if other misdeeds subsequently came to light.

<a name="stpa_114">Clause 5 explicitly envisages second or subsequent applications for certificates from the same individual. That is grotesque.

Nor is there any obligation for the defendant to appear before the tribunal. All he need do is send a letter to the certification commissioner. As was pointed out, he will then be entitled to full legal aid. He never has to turn up in person, and his lawyers can subpoena witnesses, perhaps including victims, and cross-examine them. The defence can seek discovery of sensitive material, and try to embark on fishing expeditions. Not once, however, will the defendant be required to appear.

<p><a name="st_218"><a name="51123-18_spnew14"><b> Mr. Carmichael </b> 
: Is not the situation even blacker than the hon. Gentleman paints it? If, having undergone that process, the defendant is convicted, for want of a better term, he would probably have cast-iron grounds for appeal, as he was not present to instruct his defence during the trial.
</p>





<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51123-18_spnew15"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman, who is an experienced lawyer, makes a good point that we look forward to pursuing on Report and in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_115">The lack of any obligation on the defendant to appear in person is of more than just procedural importance. The Government have consistently said that they have tried to put the interests of victims at the heart of the Bill, but the Bill denies those victims even the symbolic justice of seeing the terrorist who has perpetrated wrongs against them appear in court in person, either to own up publicly to what he has done or to have responsibility imposed on him by the judgment and subsequent sentence of the court. The House should insist that to bring about peace with justice in Northern Ireland, terrorists and paramilitary organisations should bring themselves within the rule of law. The Bill, however, sets aside the rule of law and proper process to implement a back-stairs political deal. Far from bringing about truth and reconciliation, I fear that it will conceal the truth and prolong the bitterness and grief of families who have already endured years of suffering. It is counter-productive and plain wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_116">I hope that the Secretary of State, having listened to what has been said by Members from all parts of the House, may yet pause. I hope that the House will tell him tonight that it wants him to take the Bill back and think again.

 I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this important debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">Only two Members in the Chamber were present for most of the negotiations that led to the signing of the Good Friday agreement. At the time, however, many hon. Members, in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain, were aware of all the implications of the agreement. The Democratic Unionist party did not agree with the Belfast agreement, and it still does not. Its view was genuine and sincere, but I disagreed with it, because the Good Friday agreement was the only way we could make progress in Northern Ireland. When we examine, as we must, the nature of the release of paramilitary prisoners under that agreement, its implications for our debate will become clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">The people of Northern Ireland in the referendum, and the people of Ireland generally, voted in support of the Good Friday agreement. In doing so, they voted to support the release of paramilitary prisoners, but in a context that included many other things. It was a difficult pill for everyone to swallow and, although I will support the Bill this evening, it still is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">I want to deal with one or two issues mentioned by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) with which I agreed and which the Government could perhaps take on board in Committee and in the other place.
</p>





<p><a name="st_222"><a name="51123-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Robathan </b> 
: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, who knows that I have great respect for him. Was he ever asked to introduce a Bill such as this while he was Secretary of State?
</p>





<p><a name="st_223"><a name="51123-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 Yes, I was. I was coming to that in a moment. Part of the difference between what happened in 1998, when the people of Ireland voted for the Good Friday agreement, including the release of paramilitary prisoners, and the situation later was, as I said, that the context was very different. However, there is no doubt that at Weston Park in 2001, the issue was discussed. I was not part of that at the time, but two years later, in 2003, when the joint declaration was published after a long period of negotiations and discussions at Hillsborough castle, it appeared in the public domain. It did not form part of the main joint declaration because there was no agreement on it, but it was out there in public. So it is no real surprise to us all, although perhaps some of the details might be different, that the principle of the Bill was out there in the open.
</p>





<p><a name="st_224"><a name="51123-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 One of the points that have been made is that that deal was done exclusively with Sinn Fein-IRA, both at Weston Park and at Hillsborough. Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether that was so, or whether any of the other parties were involved in discussions on the Bill?

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">There are two issues that the Government ought to consider with a view to the Bill being accepted by people in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom generally. First, the Government should consider seriously some of the amendments that are likely to be proposed. A number have been mentioned this afternoon, including the hugely important one about the victims appearing in court at a time when the person concerned may not have appeared. I hope the Government will listen to the amendments proposed. The difference between now and 1998 is that there has not been a referendum and the context is clearly very different.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">Secondly, it is extremely important to accompany the measure with other measures.
</p>

: Can I take it from what the right hon. Gentleman has just said that he would support an amendment to ensure that the people in question had to appear in person in court to answer for their crimes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_229"><a name="51123-19_spnew8"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I would have a great deal of sympathy with such an amendment, but I would take the same view as the hon. Member for Aylesbury and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State&#151;we will examine the details of the amendments when they are tabled. What I am saying is that the amendments are worth considering seriously, and I hope the Government will be in a position to answer some of these points in Committee and in the other place.
</p>





<p><a name="st_230"><a name="51123-19_spnew9"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm whether the Government gave an undertaking to Sinn Fein that republicans would not appear in court? Was that a categorical assurance? May we have an amendment to make sure that they do appear in court?
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="51123-19_spnew10"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 If my memory serves me right, the publication in 2003 would have included that provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">The point that I am trying to develop is that time goes on, and the word &quot;progress&quot; rather than &quot;closure&quot; is sometimes important in this context. We made progress in Northern Ireland as a result of the Good Friday agreement, including having to take some very unpalatable and difficult decisions. If the Bill is to have the same effect, it must be accompanied by other measures, so that the whole community in Northern Ireland feels comfortable with the progress that we are making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">The hon. Member for Aylesbury made an important point in this regard. Although I welcome the statements made by the IRA in July and the decommissioning in September&#151;everybody welcomes that&#151;we must recognise that the Independent Monitoring Commission has a job of work to do, and that we cannot allow continuing criminal activity among the IRA or loyalist organisations to be in any way tolerated. The policing arrangements have now to be accepted by the republican movement in Northern Ireland, just as everybody else accepts what is, after all, part of the Good Friday agreement.

 I pay tribute to the work that my right hon. Friend did in getting us to the point where the IRA gave up its terrorist campaign on 28 July. For the record, I confirm that his memory is correct.

<a name="stpa_125">There are further issues that we should consider. Of the political parties in Northern Ireland, clearly it is only republicans who want the Bill to go through. My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle will make his own speech, if he catches the Deputy Speaker&#039;s eye this afternoon. The Unionist parties have made their position clear, as has the Alliance party. It is imperative, therefore, that measures are taken to give some sort of reassurance right across the community in Northern Ireland about other issues that people need to consider. My hon. Friend will raise some of those later.

<p>
<a name="51123-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_126">There is also the matter of the Royal Irish Regiments and the home battalions. I refer not to the decision to run those battalions down, but to what happens in the future. That, after all, is a major redundancy issue affecting whole communities in Northern Ireland. Not only people in the Royal Irish Regiments, but people who work in ancillary services will lose their jobs. In order for the legislation to be accepted, it is vital that it is accompanied by other measures to provide reassurance across the board.

I now realise that it is not really about closure, because it is hard to get closure about the sudden death of someone one loves, but it is about coming to terms with that loss. The Bill is about giving the relatives of the victims some control back, after an event in their lives that was totally out of their control. As the Bill stands, it does not provide a reasonable and balanced process to achieve that outcome. Let us examine the problems with the Bill and what we might do collectively to improve it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_137">At the outset, I note that the Government take wildly different approaches to terrorism and terrorists, depending on whether the terrorists come from Northern Ireland or elsewhere. On 9 November, the Prime Minister fought hard for the legislative power to detain terrorist suspects without charge for up to 90 days, but on that same day his Government introduced legislation to give Northern Ireland terrorist suspects on the run from the authorities the right to return home free from any danger of arrest or incarceration after a limited quasi-judicial hearing. In my view, that is a contradiction. Why do Ministers think it consistent to seek to allow those suspected of terrorism in Northern Ireland to return without sentence while detaining for 90 days those who have not even been charged with anything?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_138">In general, I favour the approach adopted by the Government in Northern Ireland. I support their serious efforts to address the motivations behind terrorists, even if that directly contradicts their so-called war against international terrorism. I even agreed, as the Liberal Democrats collectively did, with the early release of politically motivated prisoners, which was one of the most difficult aspects of the Good Friday agreement. It was a bitter pill for many law-abiding people to swallow, not least the victims and the relatives of those victims. However, it was accepted, because it was part of the wider package agreed by the participants at the talks process in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_139">The Bill has sparked an even greater storm, because across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland it was not recognised as part of the Good Friday agreement, and it was not part of a cross-party agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_140">Let us remember who the on-the-runs are. They are people suspected of terrorist acts who have never faced the courts, or they have escaped from prison. They include those suspected of involvement in all kinds of atrocities; the hon. Member for Aylesbury apprised us 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1567</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of a number of those. It is obvious that this should be addressed in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of all the people of Northern Ireland, not only the on-the-runs, nor the organisations from which they derive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_141">Unfortunately, however, that was not the case. The first proposals for dealing with the on-the-runs came from the British and Irish Governments at Weston Park in July 2001. It was not part of a package that all the participants had negotiated and agreed to. We heard confirmation of that from the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). It was asked for by Sinn Fein and, as far as I can tell, agreed to by the British Government. It was bipartisanship but of an unusual sort, because the two parties were Sinn Fein and the Government. Those original proposals amounted to an amnesty. At the time, Liberal Democrat Members stated very clearly that we would not accept such an amnesty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_142">Matters developed until the joint declaration in April 2003. The Secretary of State said that there was no written agreement with regard to the content of the Bill. In a sense, he is right, but then there is the dubious status of the attachment to the joint declaration. As he noted, it says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;The applicant would not be required to be present at the trial.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_143">I fully understand why a member of Sinn Fein or the IRA would interpret that as some kind of commitment, because it was proposed by the Government. However, very importantly, the Secretary of State confirmed today that no written agreement was made with Sinn Fein. That is important because, unless he is implying that a verbal agreement was made with Sinn Fein, it means that the Government have the latitude to improve the legislation here and in Committee without compromising any secret deal with Sinn Fein or the IRA. I do not need to speculate about whether there was a secret deal. If the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister stand by that statement that there is no secret deal, the Government are not constrained to reject proposals of the sort that are being made by us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para17">
<a name="stpa_144">I recognise that the Government have to some extent moved on the issue since the original statements at Weston Park. The Bill proposes that an offender who wishes to return to Northern Ireland will have to apply to a certification commissioner. The case is then heard by a special tribunal presided over by a retired judge. There will be a special prosecutor to put the case for the state. There are various complicated appeals processes. As it stands, however, it is so far outside the normal judicial process that one has to ask why the Government do not simply use the procedures that are already there. If the crucial element in all this is licensing, I do not see why we are not discussing a simpler Bill which, although unpalatable to many, would unquestionably have much more support than the Bill that we are considering.

<br>&nbsp;<br>is not even there. How can anyone regard that as full judicial process? How can anyone regard it even as a process that can work?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para19">
<a name="stpa_146">Various explanations have been given for this but I find none of them plausible. First, it is simply not victim-focused. That is completely wrong. An appearance in court would give a limited sense of relief to some victims and relatives&#151;small consolation, but it would be a start. It would clearly show that what the offender did was criminal and continues to be wrong, even if they were released on licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-20_para20">
<a name="stpa_147">The second, related point is about the status of the court. We believe that the qualifying offender should be tried before the Crown court since one of the justifications for the Bill is that it generates full judicial process. If the Government want full judicial process, they should use it rather than creating a parallel quasi-judicial system.

 I, too, wish to express my condolences to my hon. Friend. I also pay tribute to the courage he has shown by being here and leading our Northern Ireland team in the debate. That sends a clear message to everybody about the importance of the issue to him and to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_148">I do not believe that the question that I want to ask has been addressed so far. If the people called to the cases that we are considering cannot be arrested or detained, I presume that they cannot be questioned. If that is the case, it is impossible to have any process that could be called justice; it makes a farce of the proposals.

<p><a name="st_246"><a name="51123-21_spnew1"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. I hope that the Minister in his summation will explain in what exactly the defendants can expect to participate if they are not involved in the most important element in the eyes of the victims&#151;a personal appearance in court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_149">In addition, and connected to my hon. Friend&#039;s comments, if justice is not seen to be done, the Government send hopelessly mixed messages to terrorists of the past and vigilantes of the present and future. Again, the Government provide an extraordinary defence of the non-use of courts. The Secretary of State&#151;I appreciate that he needed to leave to meet some relatives of victims&#151;said that he did not want the process to jam up existing courts. However, did not the same Government repeatedly tell us that the number of on-the-runs was relatively small? In that case, why would the process jam up the courts?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_150">If the Government regard the courts as jammed up by the process, what exactly is the legal system in Northern Ireland for? There is no more important subject to the relatives of the victims nor those who cherish the rule of law than the trial of people who escaped justice for some of the most atrocious terrorist offences. If the best that the Government can do is tell us that they are worried that the courts will be jammed, I challenge the Minister to state the more important cases to which we must give way.

<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1569</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>existing one is not joined-up government and is disrespectful to the considerable needs and psychological requirements of the relatives and victims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_151">The Government could expand the legal system. That would be perfectly logical and I am sure that hon. Members of all parties would understand if there needed to be greater appropriation to fund the expansion of the existing legal service in Northern Ireland. Again, we find a contradiction&#151;the contradiction of cost. Not so long ago, in a Standing Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) proposed the increase in size of Diplock courts from one judge to three. The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward) opposed that suggestion. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;One issue as well as fairness that it is appropriate to consider in any judicial system is cost to the taxpayer.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_152">He went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;Those judges would have to be recruited and trained, and accommodation would have to be provided for them. If necessary&#151;of course we would do this if we were to move to that system . . . That would have significant financial implications.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 8 November 2005; c. 25&#150;26.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_153">So one of the key reasons the Minister cited for opposing the expansion of the number of judges on the Diplock courts from one to three was cost. But think of the cost of creating this new, parallel system to try what we are told is a relatively small number of on-the-runs. It is utterly inconsistent to oppose the relatively modest cost of expanding the size of a Diplock court while completely ignoring the financial implications of these proposals. I believe that all hon. Members would accept that, for the sake of justice, costs should be borne. The Government cannot justify what they said on the matter of the three judges, but this simply highlights the tactical and non-strategic way in which they have introduced this legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_154">Thirdly, the Government still resist an explicit linkage between the return of the on-the-runs and the return of those exiled by paramilitary organisations. Thousands were driven from their homes by loyalist and republican paramilitaries, even after the signing of the Good Friday agreement. The latest Independent Monitoring Commission report backs this up. It covers the period from March to August 2005, and states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;we believe there have been a number of instances during the period covered by this report where people have been forced from their homes by paramilitary groups or by their members&#151;PIRA, RIRA, the UVF and the UDA . . . We have yet to find evidence that any paramilitary group is generally allowing the return of those it has exiled, or is considering doing so. The PIRA statement of 28 July makes no specific reference to this issue.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_155">We accept that, while some exiles might be petty criminals, others simply fell out with the local paramilitary godfathers. This is a forgotten aspect of the peace process. In 2000, the Northern Ireland Select Committee noted the difficulties in quantifying the scale of the problem, as victims naturally feared reporting the intimidation that they were experiencing. It is obvious that they would. It is perverse to allow some paramilitaries to return in safety while those exiled by the paramilitaries are kept away. We feel that certification should be linked to a positive report on this matter by the IMC.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_156">Fourthly, the grounds for revoking a licence were set very narrowly in 1998. All paramilitary activity constitutes a threat to democracy and the rule of law. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1570</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>During the loyalist violence this summer, however, Ministers treated as different the actions directed by paramilitaries against those &quot;from their own community&quot;. A commitment to end all violence was supposedly at the heart of the recent IRA statement. It makes sense, therefore, to link the licence terms of the on-the-runs to the condition that there will be no engagement in any criminal activity, either by the individual or by the organisation with which they associate. This really must include exiles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_157">Our fifth core concern is the lack of a sunset clause in the Bill. Already, the hon. Member for Aylesbury has rightly pointed out the danger of creating a get-out-of-jail-free card that can be manipulated by the on-the-run in question, rather than achieving a settlement for the victims. Victims need a time frame for those accused of a particular offence to come forward. The uncertainty would otherwise present yet another trauma. Have they not suffered enough, without this extra open-ended wait?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_158">In recent months, there has been little sense of an inclusive process that takes into account the whole community. We have seen a series of trade-offs between the Government and the republicans, and a parallel process of minor concessions to the DUP, presumably to balance out the concessions to the IRA and Sinn Fein. If the Government are exclusive, they will not create the consensus on which we absolutely depend for the restoration of devolution. Imposing unjust measures over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland will destabilise the process rather than consolidating it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_159">In its present form, the Bill looks like yet another concession. If it applied, in some high-profile form, to the legal system throughout the United Kingdom, I would question whether the Government would carry the vote. The reason they could well do so in this instance is that, being Northern Ireland legislation, the Bill is not as provocative as some of the other highly criticised legislation that we have debated recently. Being able to get the Bill through, however, is not a good enough reason to force it through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_160">Very little of what we say in the House directly affects the lives of the public, but our decisions do make a difference. There is no risk that the Government will lose face by doing the right thing. Indeed, their acceptance that the Bill should be changed will register only fleetingly in the public perception, but the changes will make all the difference to victims and their families. I would not regard movement by the Government as a sign of weakness. I would regard it as a sign of strength, and, crucially, a sign of compassion. By the same token, changes in the Bill do not constitute a defeat for Sinn Fein or the IRA. If promises made in the past by the Prime Minister or anyone else were unreasonable, it is obvious that those unreasonable promises should be seen for what they are, and that the case for a more reasonable settlement should be accepted today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_161">I ask the Government to show that they are serious enough about doing the right thing to change the Bill to meet the psychological needs of the victims, without dragging us through the normal process of brinkmanship and rejection between the two Houses between now and December. If the former perpetrators of terror are really serious about the peace, they will understand the reasons for the changes. Like other hon. Members, I know from meetings I have attended that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1571</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>former terrorists do understand the consequences of what they did. I appeal to them directly: surely, in their hearts, they recognise the needs of victims too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_162">To those who have threatened us with the collapse of the peace process, I say this. Do the Government really believe that the peace is so fragile and flimsy that it will be brought down by a number of important but ultimately minor modifications to the entire body of law in Northern Ireland? I believe that it is more robust than that, because I have faith in what has been said. I urge the Government to believe their own words about that peace, and act with the courage of their convictions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_163">No one can pretend that the Bill is about victory for the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionist party, the Alliance party in Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic and Labour party or any other party. No one can pretend that this is a direct tussle between the Government and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which also has major problems with the Bill. It is not about us. It is about the relatives&#151;relatives who, bewildered, came to see their dearest lying injured or silent and lifeless in a hospital; relatives who stood there unprepared and uncomprehending that this could have happened to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_164">I would like to find a way of supporting legislation to bring all this to a close, but as things stand, I cannot. That is why, along with the Conservatives, we tabled the amendment, and we shall vote accordingly later. There is too much emphasis on protecting the accused, and too little emphasis on supporting the bereaved. I understand that for those on the run it will be hard, but it will be easier than the sudden loss of someone, without warning, on a day that began as normal and ended in bereavement. I know that facing a court, and facing relatives in court, is hard for a defendant; but it is not as hard as waking every morning knowing that, for the rest of your life, someone whom you loved will never walk into your house again, and missing that person more than words can say.

<a name="stpa_166">When we negotiated the Good Friday agreement and when it was put to the public in the referendum, yes, prison releases were certainly part&#151;albeit a very difficult part&#151;of the process. However, in the context of the referendum campaign, people asked hard and difficult questions about outstanding cases, including those for which there had been no convictions. People asked whether there would be an amnesty or a wipe-out or whether the files would be closed. Assurances were given by Minister upon Minister, including the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, that all the outstanding cases would continue to be pursued and that those who had issues to face would be brought to court. It was said that, if convicted, they might have to spend only two years in jail, but they would appear in court, they would be convicted and they would spend time in jail. That is what the victims were told at that time. It was on the basis of that expectation that many people struggled to vote in favour of the agreement and did so. What is happening now betrays the commitments and promises that were given at that time. It is dishonest and disingenuous for the Government to claim that the Bill was always going to happen as it is simply a logical extension of prior agreements. It contradicts assurances and explanations that were specifically given at the time of the agreement and the referendum.

<p>
<a name="51123-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_167">As the Secretary of State and others have confirmed, the whole question of the on-the-runs first arose in the context of the Weston Park negotiations. Those were peculiar negotiations in which the two Governments talked to different parties about different issues. Yes, we were in the same premises, but we were all on a different agenda. The SDLP was being talked to about policing and the question of public inquiries in respect of the Finucane, Nelson and Hamill cases. Sinn Fein was talked to about OTRs, as that was the issue that it had raised, and decommissioning. The Ulster Unionist party were talked to about decommissioning and the institutions. We were all being talked to about different things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_168">The Governments came forward with declarations and promises at Weston Park and I note that the Secretary of State said that the Government feel that they are duty-bound to honour commitments. We were given commitments at Weston Park. The public were given commitments post-Weston Park in respect of the process set up to establish whether inquiries should go ahead. We were told that if Judge Cory recommended public inquiries, public inquiries there would be in certain cases. That promise was not honoured, even though it was part of an international agreement between the British and Irish Governments.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) says that we did not have guns. Weston Park was the third occasion since the Good Friday agreement on which the then SDLP leadership of John Hume and Seamus Mallon complained to the

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government about how the process was conducted, particularly about the privileged and exclusive negotiating position given to Sinn Fein and, to a degree, to the Ulster Unionist party. It was also the third occasion on which the Prime Minister gave us what we regarded as a counsel of cynicism at the time&#151;&quot;You guys, your problem is you don&#039;t have guns&quot;.

 The hon. Gentleman is making a profound criticism of this Government&#039;s handling of the peace process. Does he agree that the privileged status given to Sinn Fein-IRA during that process has been devastating for the fate of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland? Does he also agree that the Government&#039;s management of the peace process has ensured that republicans and their advocates have a strengthened political position, while the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, who have stood honourably for constitutional nationalism, have lost out, as have their electors?

 In many respects, what is devastating to the SDLP is neither here nor there. I do not want to go down that road.

<a name="51123-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_170">In the Hillsborough negotiations, different parties again found themselves talking to the Government about different issues. There was to be a joint declaration at the conclusion of those talks, and it was originally to have five annexes. One of those annexes was to deal with the subject of OTRs.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_172">The Government responded by reducing the number of annexes from five to three. Instead of being an annexe to the joint declaration, the OTR paper was to be published coincidentally and in parallel with it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_173">That was a dishonest move. It was a deal that was a non-deal, in that it allowed Sinn Fein to say that it had secured provisions on OTRs but had not accepted sanctions.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_176">The Bill springs from the commitments made to Sinn Fein at the time of the Hillsborough declaration. However, other commitments were made in the Hillsborough declaration that the Government still show no urgency about honouring. I could take this from the Secretary of State if every other commitment had been honoured to the letter and in the spirit in which they were given, but they have not been. A case in point is the joint declaration, at the SDLP&#039;s behest and supported by the Alliance party and some others, that consideration would be given to establishing a forum for victims and survivors. It still has not happened. All that we are told is that the new victims commissioner will look at the issue. Surely one point of having a victims and survivors forum is to allow victims and survivors themselves to advance ideas and proposals on how to deal with the issues of truth, remembrance and recognition that are so important to them. That is an outstanding promise from the Good Friday agreement that has still not been delivered to victims.

In the same way, as other hon. Members have mentioned, victims&#151;especially those who witnessed the crime in which they lost a loved one&#151;could be compelled to be a party to proceedings with which they fundamentally disagreed, whereas the alleged culprits do not even have to appear. They can stay in the comfort of their home&#151;in the comfort of their holiday home in some cases&#151;and just receive a text message to confirm what has happened. They will find it harder to download a new ring tone than to obtain the benefits of the new system.

One of the good things that the Government have done in recent years&#151;I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Torfaen&#151;was to provide the resources to establish the cold cases review, or the historic inquiries team, which offered the assurance that the files would not remain closed, people would not be allowed to escape any liability and the truth would be pursued. The legislation will fundamentally undermine that commitment, because it will mean that if anyone is named by the review or has anything to hide, they can sit and wait in a calculated way. They do not have to take a chance and apply to benefit from the legislation, because there is no time limit as an incentive to disclose their involvement. That is normally what happens with tax and other amnesties. Instead, they can sit back and wait and see if a police officer ever knocks on their door about a particular crime. If the police officer knocks and the person is charged, they can play the Bill like a trump card. They can say, &quot;Right, we&#039;re going to benefit from what Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams have negotiated in the OTR concession.&quot; That will apply to everybody&#151;not just republican paramilitaries, but loyalist paramilitaries and people in the state forces involved in a crime, whether committed by them directly or committed by paramilitaries and in which they were complicit, whether through collusion or other forms of crime solicitation.

It will be harder to appear on the X Factor than to benefit from the procedures that the Government are setting up. They will be open to anyone who has anything to hide about any crime.

The Secretary of State has moved from the Prime Minister&#039;s argument yesterday, that an anomaly needed to be resolved, to the argument that the Bill is about bringing people to justice and making them answerable to justice. However, it is such a bespoke system, with so many guarantees and so many comforts and privileges for the accused that it is an amnesty in all but name.

That is why there is a distinct change in the representation from Northern Ireland. That is why there is a difference among Unionists in Northern Ireland today.

Friends, we have had some synthetic rage and we have had thunder and lightning, fire and brimstone. He even once accused me of being a bully, which brought to mind a parable about pots and kettles, but we will pass over that.

Why are Sinn Fein-IRA not making moves to move things forward? Why are they not letting the exiles back? Why are they not stopping the punishment beatings? Why are they not taking a grip on the criminality? Why are they still providing a paramilitary police force? No one says, &quot;You do that and then we will consider your on-the-run people.&quot; It has all been the reverse, and every time yet another concession has been wrung from Government, which has decreased enormously the amount of confidence that the people of Northern Ireland have in the peace process.

When I considered the case&#151;I am choosing my words carefully because I do not want the case to be identifiable as I do not know what has happened to the victim or to the terrorist&#151;I realised that the terrorist lived three or four doors away from the member of the security forces whom he had tried to blow up in his car. For the past 12 years, that person had been in a wheelchair, living with the pain but knowing that justice had been done. The proposition was that 12 years later the terrorist would be released to go back home to the same street.

There will be confrontation between victims, their families, descendants of victims and the terrorists, who have paid no price for what they did. That is a fundamental denial of justice, and this therefore is a thoroughly bad Bill.

 When we last debated security in Northern Ireland, the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) spoke movingly about his hand being placed on the head of a curly-haired child who was weeping at his father&#039;s coffin, and this afternoon we heard the passion of the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea). I cannot speak with such passion and direct knowledge. I am not a victim of the terror in Northern Ireland, but I grew up knowing the troubles. I was born in 1969, and the terror we have seen in Northern Ireland, the peace process over the past eight years and the subsequent developments have been the backdrop to my entire life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_226">When I was thinking about today&#039;s debate, it occurred to me that when I was a teenager in the 1980s I was studying the history of the current situation in Northern Ireland while still living through it. I am now a mother myself, and despite the fact that my eldest child was born after the Good Friday agreement, we still today, as we debate these measures, have uncertainty and no directly elected Northern Ireland Government. I am sure that all mothers in the United Kingdom want their children to grow up in a world where the violence is at an end for ever, with Northern Ireland living in peace and harmony. Although there are real problems in Northern Ireland&#151;as a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, I see and hear about some of them, although I bow to the expertise of hon. Members who represent seats in Northern Ireland&#151;we have gone a long way. I join other hon. Members in paying tribute to Secretaries of State past and present for their work in trying to bring that difficult situation to an end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_227">The Good Friday agreement marked an historic breakthrough. The subsequent referendum and meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly showed what enormous progress was made between 10 April and 1 July 1998. Seven years later, however, the Northern Ireland Assembly is suspended and direct rule from Westminster is again in place. We have seen some major milestones and some major slip-ups on the road to lasting peace, which we all want to see. I welcome the fact that the IRA has recently decommissioned its arms and formally announced the end of its armed campaign.

<a name="51123-25_para11">

Surely the point of the whole process is that we should return to devolved decision-making, whereby the people of Northern Ireland are ruled by their directly elected representatives and not from Westminster.

 I am trying to address that point. We must deal with the remaining issues in Northern Ireland, whether that involves the Bill as drafted or whether that involves amending the legislation. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a directly elected Government, and they should decide not only matters of security, but all issues. Matters such as water rates or school reform should be dealt with not from Westminster, but from a devolved Northern Ireland Assembly. The issues that the Bill addresses must be tackled one way or another.

<a name="51123-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_231">I have some concerns about the Bill, and for me there are two benchmarks. First, we have seen the pain and pressures that the prisoner release programme created in Northern Ireland, but the prisoners who were released&#151;republican or loyalist&#151;all served time, even if many of them had their sentences cut very short for the crimes that they had committed. Internationally, the most comparable situation occurred in South Africa, where the truth and reconciliation commission meant that the perpetrators of crime had to face their victims.
</p>





<p><a name="st_286"><a name="51123-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Wallace </b> 
: Does the hon. Lady agree that there are two key differences between the South African truth and reconciliation commission and the prisoner release programme in Northern Ireland: first, in South Africa people had to come forward within a time limit to avoid the risk of getting no amnesty; and, secondly, the people who attended the tribunals had to admit all their crimes, and if they were subsequently found not to have done so they lost the protection of their amnesty? Perhaps such conditions should apply to this Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_287"><a name="51123-26_spnew2"><b> Meg Hillier: </b> 
 I was just coming to that. I was trying to judge whether the Bill measures up to two important benchmarks. The hon. Member for Aylesbury pointed out that those who did not attend the truth and reconciliation commissions faced a sanction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_232">Does the Bill measure up to the two criteria that I highlighted? Yes, it does, in the sense that the perpetrators will at least face some justice, but, no, it does not in the important sense that it does not even require them to attend the tribunals in person.

The loathsome Bill is corrupt not only because its intended outcome is to assist murderers to escape punishment but because of the process used to achieve that goal. It defies reason that, under the Bill, accused terrorists will not even be asked to waste their precious time attending court for the farce of a trial.

<a name="stpa_253">I was propelled into active politics after a school friend of mine was murdered by the Provisional IRA. He had just left school and was in his first job. The IRA bombed the premises of the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, for which he worked. He was just a teenager, and his life was taken from him. No one has ever been found guilty of having planned that operation, but a Member who has not taken his Oath in this House was in charge of the Provisional IRA for the area in which this person was bombed and killed.

<a name="stpa_254">One evening in 1978, shortly after I became an elected representative, I was preparing to go out when I heard a very loud bomb explode. The target was close by. As it transpired, it was the La Mon House hotel. I went immediately to the site, and I witnessed the most horrific scenes. The bombers had hung their device on the security grille over the hotel window, and attached a large can of petrol to it. When the bomb was detonated, it sent a huge fireball through the hotel, incinerating all those in its path. Twelve innocent people were burned alive in that attack. Their charred remains were a gruesome image, and all who saw it will carry that image in their minds for the rest of their lives. What was their crime? They were attending an evening dinner with the Irish Collie club, a dog club. Gerry Adams was arrested and questioned about the attack, and was later released. The Bill will ensure that no one spends a single day in prison for those murders.

I asked in the House for a public inquiry, but sadly it was refused. I think that the refusal was based on the fact that, as my hon. Friend said, Gerry Adams&#039;s fingerprints were all over that atrocity, and he was arrested in the back hills of Castlereagh some time after it. What rights does my hon.

They would allow time-limiting of the use of the application system for the terrorists, and open up the system to victims so that, if necessary, cases can be heard in absentia. That would give victims real closure, and those responsible for the crimes would have to serve their sentences.

 I would like to set out the background to the Bill as I see it. Since 1997, we have come a long way. In 1998, we had the Good Friday agreement, leading to the early release of 440 prisoners, and we have also had devolved government. With only 14 early releases being returned to jail for breach of the licence conditions&#151;a 97 per cent. success rate&#151;it would appear that the action has been significantly successful.

<a name="51123-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_260">Even though devolved government has proved to be difficult to uphold, 1998 and 1999 saw the Patten commission producing a raft of proposals relating to crime and policing. Today, of course, we have heard much about Weston Park in 2001, when the commitment was reiterated to move the peace process forward. Consideration of on-the-runs seemed to emerge from that. In 2004, we had the Independent Monitoring Commission and this year saw the IRA statement ending the armed struggle. September then saw the historic act of decommissioning. Even more

Northern Ireland is, I believe, a better place in 2005 than it was in 1997, and there has been a 40 per cent. reduction in security-related incidents since 1997. In parallel, unemployment has dropped by 54 per cent. Many, both within and outside the House, should feel a good deal of satisfaction and pride for their role in delivering increased prosperity and stability to Northern Ireland. In view of the steps that I have outlined, it is arguably the case that the Bill is, as the Secretary of State has argued, an evolution of everything that has gone on before.

Furthermore, the requirement for the certification commissioner to put an annual report before Parliament provides an additional level of scrutiny, which I hope is welcomed by right hon. and hon.

If the individuals involved were required to make personal appearances in court, it would go some way to reducing the mistrust of the Bill, as we have already heard today. The ability of the defence to subpoena witnesses sits uneasily in the Bill if personal appearances are not required. I imagine that we will hear a lot more about that in Committee, in this House and in the other place. The lack of a requirement to plead guilty is also a challenge, but we must remember that the normal judicial process does not demand a guilty plea. Surely there should be an opportunity for people entering the process to be proven not guilty if the evidence and argument show that to be the case.

<a name="stpa_280">If we are to draw a line, if we are to move forward, as we would all like to do, and if we are to create a United Kingdom where every part of that United Kingdom is as normal as the other parts, Sinn Fein-IRA must make a declaration that they have not just renounced the bullet or not just put away their arms, but that they have indeed entered fully into the democratic process. They need to take their seats and to argue their cause on the Floor of the House. They should take their place on the Select Committee. They should play a full and constructive part in building that Northern Ireland, which we all accept is part of the United Kingdom unless and until a majority of its population decides otherwise. We would respect that verdict, although I hope that that does not happen.

<a name="stpa_281">What have the Government done? They have introduced the Bill, which they had no need to introduce. It is not part of the Belfast agreement&#151;nor was it in the Government&#039;s manifesto&#151;but it is a gesture of appeasement towards those who have not properly embraced the democratic process. The grotesque juxtaposition of introducing the Bill on the very day that the Government were seeking to pass some of the most draconian legislation that the British Parliament has ever had placed before it is extraordinary, and it is indeed differentiating between terrorists.

They are on the run, but would anyone in Her Majesty&#039;s Government be happy to give them a little certificate because someone had been sent along to The Hague to say, &quot;Well, give them a certificate. They&#039;re free now.&quot;? Those are the standards that the Government are trying to impose in a part of the United Kingdom for which they are responsible.

Again, I say to him that the Bill is not by any definition emergency or urgent legislation. It is legislation over which we should take our time. The Bill must be subject to the most critical scrutiny and examination if there is to be any chance at all of creating something from it in which any of us can take any pride at all. As it is, the Bill is a shoddy document. It is fit only for ripping in half&#151;as I now do&#151;and nothing else.

Will he either take the Bill away, which would be the best thing that he could do, or, at the very least, agree that the Select Committee or a Joint Committee of both Houses should be given six weeks to examine the Bill, go through it, take evidence and come up with something that is a little more worthy of the oldest of Parliaments and the greatest bastion of democracy? We are besmirching our reputation if we give a Second Reading to this Bill today.

<p><a name="st_328"><a name="51123-30_spnew0"><b> Dr. Alasdair McDonnell  (Belfast, South) (SDLP):</b> 
 I am worried about the Bill because it is extremely far reaching. On the surface, as we have heard, it will affect on-the-runs&#151;members of the provos who may be suspected of serious crimes. However, other elements of the Bill deeply worry me. There are members of loyalist paramilitary groups, and there are renegade members of the special branch police and Army intelligence who colluded with, prompted and handled Ulster Volunteer Force killers and, indeed, a few from the IRA. Cases are ongoing and we shall hear information shortly about some of the activities in north Belfast when members of the UVF conducted operations with the knowledge of the security services in which they killed a number of innocent people&#151;both Protestant and Catholic&#151;just to keep themselves amused. Some of those people will be absolved by the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_288">There were members of the security forces who acted outside the law. Hon. Members referred earlier to people acting within the laws of engagement, but I shall not go there at the moment. However, there were members of the security forces who acted above and beyond the laws of engagement and the normal instructions to which they operated. Again, some of those people will be wrapped up in the Bill. Hon. Members of all parties feel threatened by the Bill because it is a catch-all measure that will absolve a lot of people from facing justice and accounting to their victims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_289">I shall make only a couple of quick points because time is running out and other hon. Members wish to speak. It is fairly clear that the Bill does not stem from the agreement. It is an add-on and a side deal. Perhaps it was initiated by Gerry Adams and the provos, but even he dissociates himself from it and denies that he had much to do with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_290">The Bill does not deal merely with people who were sought pre-1998, as the Prime Minister said yesterday; it applies to anyone who might be charged, now and in the future, for 2,100 unsolved murders. It is open-ended and limitless. Anyone who is guilty or associated in any way with any one of those 2,100 murders effectively gets cleared of it. That includes 300 state killings that were in some way suspicious.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_291">Not only does the Bill deny the victims justice, but, worse than that, it denies them the very truth that they need for closure. As there is no time limit, those involved in killing those 2,100 people can sit in their living rooms while they wait in comfort to see whether the police ever come knocking on the door. If the police do come knocking, all those people have to do is apply, from the comfort of their homes or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) suggested, their holiday homes, for a certificate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_292">Sinn Fein specifically negotiated that those people do not even have to go to court. Regardless of Mr. Adams&#039;s denials, we are well aware of what happened. When the Bill was announced last week, Mr. Conor Murphy, another absent Member of the House, welcomed it before he had fully read it and realised what was in it. The contrast and distress for me&#151;other hon. Members have made the same point, but it cannot be emphasised often enough&#151;is that victims and police officers, under 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1601</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>threat of penalty, can be compelled to turn up in court. Yet the perpetrators of some of those heinous crimes will not have to turn up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_293">My hon. Friend said that the SDLP will table amendments to undo the Bill&#039;s worst aspects. If we are talking just about a small number of people who are outside our jurisdiction, let us limit it to that. If that is the bitter pill that we have to swallow, let us swallow it, but let us not make the measure all-dancing, all-embracing and all-inclusive, so that we do not know where it will end up two or three years down the road. It has to be limited, tidy and exact. People have suffered&#151;some for 20 years, some for 25 years, some for 30 years&#151;and I pay tribute to my colleague, the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea), who expressed that well. People who have suffered are entitled to some closure, truth and honesty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_294">We have clarified that the deal was initiated as a separate side deal, starting at Weston Park and continuing at Hillsborough, between Sinn Fein and the Government. They did not involve us. We were often kept negotiating on something on the margins. All other parties were excluded from the discussions. The deal is far too vital for one-to-one negotiations, from which the vast majority of interests were excluded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_295">We warned of the dangers, but others went ahead. Time and again we made it clear that the deal was way outside the remit of the agreement and what people voted for in 1998. That is a matter of public record. We published different proposals on victims and the truth that is needed for victim satisfaction. We raised our concerns time and again in Downing street and with the two Governments. Our detailed proposals for the truth process for victims are a long way from any attempt to cover up, to exclude or to collude on the past, which is what is happening to a large extent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_296">Under separate legislation passed to implement the Good Friday agreement, on-the-runs would, at worst, have had to serve a maximum sentence of two years. Even if no one had to go to prison under this Bill, the victims&#151;those who have suffered and whose lives can never be put together again, who are the main people in all this&#151;should not be denied the truth, yet that is precisely what the legislation would do. My colleagues and I intend to propose as many amendments as we can to ensure that the innocent victims&#151;some dead, but some still living and suffering&#151;get a better deal than the Bill as it stands offers them. If we cannot get justice, we will work to ensure that at least they get the truth. To my mind, the Bill offers victims nothing&#151;not even, as was suggested earlier, the limited benefits that victims got through the truth process in South Africa.

Judging by the speeches made this afternoon, I am not alone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para9">

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government&#151;have presented to the House today. As right hon. and hon. Members&#151;I congratulate the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)&#151;probably all know, Sir Jack has Alzheimer&#039;s. Today is his birthday. He is not aware that it is his birthday, but it is the reason why I always remember the date on which the George cross was awarded to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It was rightly, though belatedly, awarded to mark the courage, dedication and sacrifice of 302 dead officers&#151;302 police officers. It grieves me&#151;as I know it would grieve Jack if he were aware of it, but as I said, mercifully he is not&#151;that the Government are proposing that the murderers of policemen and women in Northern Ireland will never have to stand in court or face any tribunal; they will never have to apologise, put their hand up and say, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I have done wrong.&quot; The Bill as it stands will never require them to do that. It must not leave this House without the firm requirement that whoever is guilty of perpetrating the most heinous of crimes, against not only police officers but the innocent people who were in La Mon House and the relatives and friends of the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea), be held to account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_298">All those people deserve the right to life to be respected as much in Northern Ireland as it will be respected in the rest of the United Kingdom. I say that as one who, once upon a time, was proud of the Government, when they made the European convention on human rights part and parcel of our domestic law. I was proud because the Government sent out the message to the world&#151;not just to Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom, but to the world&#151;that they respected human rights, the right to life and the right of everyone within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom to an effective remedy for breaches of that convention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_299">The Bill proposes a certification commissioner&#151;a wonderful title. I have no idea what it means, apart from being the title of the person who will recommend an amnesty for people who have committed the most terrible crimes. It also creates a special tribunal, a special appeal and a special prosecutor. My goodness, what an array of new appointments and gimmicks. I apologise to whoever takes up one of those offices for referring to them as gimmicks, but I mean it&#151;it is gimmickry. It is not an adequate and effective remedy for those who have suffered through the years in Northern Ireland. I am ashamed and deeply embarrassed that my Government have introduced the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_300">I appreciate the fact that the Secretary of State met the widows and families of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers, but with respect, he and his fellow Ministers cannot appreciate the depth of hurt and the enormous trauma experienced by a family when someone&#039;s life is taken by terrorist bombing and killing. Having spoken to RUC widows and families, I am sure that they would tell the Secretary of State that the first injury caused by losing a loved one was dreadful. I can tell him with confidence, as I am sure they have already told him, that the second injury is caused by their own Government giving an amnesty to those murderers, which is as deeply affecting and upsetting as the first injury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_301">I made a rather cross intervention on the Secretary of State&#151;I apologise, but I was annoyed; there is a great deal of anger in the House this afternoon&#151;to emphasise the fact that the Home Secretary and successive Home Secretaries have spoken in the House about increasing

It is on the record that when the Criminal Justice Bill was proceeding through the House in 2003, the Home Office wrote to all Members serving on the Bill Committee to say that, under its provisions, Northern Ireland should not be perceived as becoming

He has been trying to persuade the rest of us of that case without success, bar with a few hon. Members.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> With one hon. Member, in fact. If that is the case, will he confirm that where there is new and compelling evidence against anyone who benefits from the legislation, whether they are loyalist or republican paramilitaries or anyone else, there is joined-up thinking in the Government so that if there is new DNA evidence or if witnesses come forward, the Home Secretary&#039;s assurance to me that Northern Ireland would not be a safe haven for criminals means that those people can face another trial at any time in the future? The legislation does not come into force until 2007, and I should like a categorical assurance in the House that the Government will not obstruct the police if they wish to bring before the courts anyone found guilty of any crime in Northern Ireland.

 I am most grateful for that assurance from the Secretary of State. I would like the additional assurance that if, in the Government&#039;s mind, the provisions of the Bill amount to a trial, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which extends to Northern Ireland and drives a coach and horses through the old common law rule against double jeopardy, will apply. The Government legislated for Northern Ireland to assure the people of Northern Ireland that where new and compelling evidence becomes available at a later date, even if there had been a previous trial, as will happen if the Bill goes through, those who escape facing the courts and proper justice under the Bill will still be prosecuted under the Criminal Justice Act. I should be enormously grateful for such an assurance, which would go some way towards alleviating the great annoyance, anger and bitterness created by an unnecessary Bill being driven through the House.

I hope that when Members vote tonight, they will bear that in mind.

<a name="51123-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_304">I welcome the Secretary of State back to the Treasury Bench. It is right that he has been away talking to victims, but may I update him a little on what has been happening in the Chamber? We have been debating the Bill for the best part of five hours and, apart from his predecessor, quite understandably, saying a few words of faint praise for the Bill, no other Member has done so, except for a strange speech from the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks), who read a handout from the Whips Office. It was a painful experience.

<a name="stpa_305">We have had some exceptional speeches from Labour Members&#151;from the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and the hon.

It is even more significant for the Secretary of State that every democratic party in Northern Ireland is opposed to his Bill. We had powerful speeches from the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and from the hon. Members for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) and for Foyle (Mark Durkan). Surely they should be listened to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_306">I watched the Secretary of State carefully, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) that he spoke with patience, allowed us a considerable number of interventions and proved again that he is a proper Member of the House of Commons and a true parliamentarian. However, in the 25 years that I have been in the House, I have never seen a Secretary of State so isolated on Second Reading. I have never seen so few Government Members speaking in support of a Bill. I have never seen the Benches so thin.

<a name="stpa_307">It is a sad day and I genuinely feel sorry for the Secretary of State, but I do not believe that it is his fault&#151;the fault lies elsewhere. At this late stage, he needs to consider not just that every party in the House is against the Bill, and not just that every democratic and peace-loving Member from Northern Ireland is against the Bill, but that so are the Police Federation for Northern Ireland and the victims to whom he has just been speaking.

<a name="stpa_308">Will the Secretary of State cast his mind back to a little earlier today to Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time when we were fortunate&#151;the ballot sometimes works in mysterious ways&#151;that the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) had Question 1, which was a very significant question, the Prime Minister&#039;s answer to which was deeply inadequate? It will be recalled that a little later during Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time there was a moving question from the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh), who rightly mourned the police officer who was tragically murdered in his city at the weekend. Most of us find it difficult to understand the difference between bringing to justice those who murdered the police officer in Bradford, those who committed awful atrocities on 7 July in this city, and those who will, in effect, have an amnesty under this legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_309">We also find it bizarre&#151;the Secretary of State rather lost his timing&#151;that the Bill was published and received its First Reading two weeks ago, at the same time as the Terrorism Bill was being pursued. Does he not feel that there is something slightly wrong about trying to lock up people for 90 days without charging them on the one hand and giving this complete amnesty on the other hand? Did it not make it worse for the victims in Northern Ireland that that was happening at exactly the same time?As I say, I want to be fair to the Secretary of State because he knows that I have respect for him, but it was deeply insensitive for it to be happening at exactly the same time.

<a name="stpa_310">The Secretary of State mentioned closure again and again. I am afraid that that has become a meaningless word&#151;and if he would take a little advice from me, it would be best not to use it again. I am sure that he now regrets saying that the main reason for the legislation is that the courts are log-jammed and it will help. That cannot be a satisfactory reason for bringing forward legislation that will do such harm.

We have established from the Secretary of State that there has been no threat from Sinn Fein and the IRA that violence will be resumed if the legislation does not go ahead. We have heard from the hon. Member for North Down, who is an expert on human rights, that we could well be in breach of human rights legislation and be taken to the European Court of Human Rights if we proceed. So just why are we going ahead with the Bill at such a pace? Just what happened at Weston Park in private? What deal was done between the Prime Minister and Sinn Fein-IRA? We need to be told before we decide to vote tonight. If no deal was done, there is no sense in proceeding with a Bill that has been so mauled during its Second Reading debate and has so little support. Even at this late hour, I hope that the Minister will withdraw the Bill and consider it further, possibly in a Special Standing Committee, as my hon.

<p>
<a name="51123-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_313">I cannot say the same to the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks), who will not be surprised by that. Whenever he ascends to the high office to which he undoubtedly aspires, I hope that he realises that some things in life are more important than political ambition. There are high principles in politics and justice that are worth preserving, and his contribution to this debate did nothing to persuade any of us that he understands those principles in the context of the Bill. I hope that he will take the time to come to Northern Ireland and meet some of the victims groups, and I certainly intend to send a copy of his speech to all the victims groups with which I am in contact. The central theme of his speech was, &quot;It is time to move on and get over it.&quot; I hope that he will have the courage of his convictions and visit Northern Ireland to tell people that to their faces. I do not think that he has the slightest understanding of the hurt and pain that the Bill is causing in Northern Ireland.

<a name="51123-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_314">I echo the comments of the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon), who spoke with considerable passion about the sense of injustice felt by RUC widows. I know that many of the other victims in Northern Ireland, such as the families of police officers and of Ulster Defence Regiment, Royal Irish Regiment and Army soldiers, share that sense of injustice. Indeed, the issue is not confined to Northern Ireland, because the families of soldiers who served in Northern Ireland have been denied justice, too. As my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) reminded us, many hundreds of civilians also lost their lives in the course of the troubles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_315">As has been said, the issue was not included in the Belfast agreement. I was involved in the negotiations leading up to the agreement, which I voted against for a number of reasons, including the provisions on the early release of terrorist prisoners. Nowhere in the agreement is there a justification for the Bill. Indeed, in an earlier response to an intervention, the Secretary of State acknowledged that the deal that he has done with Sinn Fein does not emanate from the agreement, although the Prime Minister has sought to draw such parallels. The argument has been advanced that the Bill is unfinished business and that we need it to achieve closure, but I respectfully inform the Secretary of State that in my opinion it will not achieve closure for many of the victims in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_316">Last Thursday evening, my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) and I met a large number of victims from south Armagh and Fermanagh, which are the areas with the largest number of unsolved murders in Northern Ireland. Hundreds of murders in which the perpetrators have not been brought to justice were committed in south Armagh and Fermanagh.

She lost her mother in the poppy day massacre in Enniskillen in 1987, which the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), mentioned earlier. I have heard Aileen conduct radio interviews, and she has shared her views in the national media with considerable dignity. The strength of her argument on this issue is unanswerable: Aileen, like so many of the victims who have suffered as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland, feels that she will suffer doubly because of the injustice caused by this Bill.

There is indignation that the perpetrators can remain anonymous throughout the process and do not have to appear before a tribunal to account for their crimes. It is an aberration to describe that as justice or due process. That simply does not wash with people in Northern Ireland. I am afraid that the legacy of the Bill will be that murder, intimidation and terrorism have proved successful for individuals who have engaged in such activities.

<a name="stpa_320">The Secretary of State made it clear that the purpose of the Bill is to meet a demand that has been made by Sinn Fein-IRA. That demand is coming from nowhere else but one source, and one source only. I accept that not only Her Majesty&#039;s Government but the Irish Government are party to the agreement that has been reached. The Irish Government are happy to support a deal that permits the murderers of RUC officers to walk free, yet say in their own jurisdiction that the men who murdered Garda Jerry McCabe will not benefit from the process. The hypocrisy of that position shows the extent to which double standards are applied in dealing with Sinn Fein-IRA. Of course, I do not wish the murderers of Jerry McCabe to benefit. I have met Garda McCabe&#039;s widow&#151;a fine woman who has shown much courage in highlighting her case in the Irish Republic. Today, we met the widows and family members of RUC officers who were murdered and they cannot understand why that double standard should apply.

That is a basic right, but the Bill does not afford the victims the right to put a case that the perpetrators should not receive the certificates that they seek. Victims should also have the right to make a statement in the presence of the offenders when they appear before the tribunal&#151;if they appear. As my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East said, when offenders have not come forward, surely victims should have the right to approach the commissioner to establish whether the police have evidence or information about the person or persons responsible for the murder of their loved ones and to ascertain whether there is any intention to pursue tribunal proceedings against those individuals&#151;yet not even that right is accorded them.

Victims groups ask how the Government are recognising them in the process. Such recognition is not apparent in the Bill. Let me be clear&#151;the victims do not want blood money, but they are entitled to reparation and compensation for their loss. The Government need to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_324">FAIR&#151;Families Acting for Innocent Relatives&#151;in south Armagh recently submitted an application for a memorial centre for victims. As I said earlier, south Armagh is one of those areas where there has been high loss but low detection and conviction of the perpetrators. The Government could not even give the group the money for the memorial centre. They chided the victims group and said that it had to prove that it was engaging in cross-community activities. In south Armagh, that means working with Sinn Fein and republicans&#151;the same Sinn Fein whose councillors on Newry and Mourne council prevented the victims group from hiring a community hall in Newtownhamilton. Thankfully, those councillors have been surcharged and I hope that they will be kicked out of office. The Government expect the victims to work with Sinn Fein in south Armagh, and if they do not they will not get the money for their memorial centre. What an appalling way to treat the innocent victims of terrorist violence. This shows that the Government have double standards. It is time that they gave proper recognition to the victims.

<a name="stpa_325">I welcome the appointment of the victims commissioner&#151;the Secretary of State knows that&#151;but the commissioner and other groups must be empowered and given due recognition in this process. There is too much money involved. I wonder how much this process will cost the taxpayer in the United Kingdom. I suspect that it will be millions of pounds. Would it not be better to give that money to the victims of IRA violence in Northern Ireland? Even just to build a memorial centre in somewhere like south Armagh would not cost the Government that much, but they cannot even get that right.

Should not the Government listen to these senior police officers and catch on? They should drop this legislation and stand by justice and democracy.

He made a good speech today, and he should vote against it, as should the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier). She pointed out the Bill&#039;s deficiencies, and she should vote against it. As the right hon. Member for Torfaen appeared unwilling to introduce it, he was replaced by the right hon.

I believe that he was appointed because he was acceptable to the IRA and Sinn Fein, and that is why he is introducing this disgraceful Bill. I feared that the Belfast agreement might be built on sand, but I hoped otherwise. But as we have seen, Danegeld has been paid, and the thing about Danegeld is that one keeps on having to pay it.

What will be the next concession? The Saville inquiry was a concession to the IRA, costing &#163;200 million and rising. I expect that charges against soldiers will result from it, because otherwise there would be no point in making that concession to the IRA.

The terrorists were plotting to blow up the changing of the guard at Government House and they would have killed hundreds of people. An outrage was being planned.

The historic investigation could therefore easily bring charges, although the soldiers were acting in good faith, on instructions from the Government and from their commanders, and prevented a dreadful atrocity.

<a name="stpa_332">The other case is even worse. In May 1987, eight IRA terrorists who were armed to the teeth drove a JCB with a bomb on it into Loughall police station and exploded the device. They were then ambushed by soldiers and police officers who had been so instructed by the Secretary of State. That took place with Government approval. I would say that it was a great success in the battle against the IRA, but I fear that that is not how it strikes this Government and this Secretary of State. This Government passed the Human Rights Act 1998.

<a name="51123-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_355">I shall give a very brief analogy. A few years ago, I and some other hon. Members visited Rwanda, where there had been the most awful genocide. I walked through the bones and skulls of some of the victims of that genocide, and then attended one of the court sessions. About 850,000 people had been massacred, and I said to the Justice Minister, &quot;We have all these courts set up, and we are going to send people to prison, yet we are talking about reconciliation. Can we get the reconciliation if we go down that path?&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para19">
<a name="stpa_356">What a na-ve question for me to ask. The Justice Minister said, &quot;We have to have the justice before we can have the reconciliation.&quot; That is the point that hon. Members of all parties have tried to make today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para20">
<a name="stpa_357">The Secretary of State said that we can never bring an end to the victims&#039; hurt. That may be true, but we can make that hurt worse. I suspect that that is what the Bill will do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para21">
<a name="stpa_358">The Secretary of State did not help the process with his article in <i>The Times</i>. He wrote that those returning would face the prospect of a &quot;full legal process&quot;, but that is untrue, as they will not have to appear in court. He added that they would have to go through a special court before being let out on licence, but let out of where, let out of what? Those people will not have been inside for a single day. What a misleading article it was.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para22">
<a name="stpa_359">There is not time for me to go through all the Bill&#039;s flaws, as I want to give the Minister an appropriate time in which to respond, but I will say that I see the Bill as yet another concession to the IRA. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby asked, what will the next concession be? What will provoke it? Will it be that the IRA starts to make threatening noises again? That is unacceptable in a democracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para23">
<a name="stpa_360">I do not mean this as a personal comment to the Minister, but he will not be surprised to hear that we will take this Bill very seriously if it reaches Committee.

 I appreciate the tone of today&#039;s debate. This is a difficult subject, with lots of raw emotion. I hope that the House will understand if I limit the number of interventions that I take, as I have only a short time in which to respond to a long debate in which very serious issues were raised. However, to show that the Government are not afraid of debate, I point out to the House that the programme motion&#151;which I hope will be approved&#151;allows for a long discussion in Committee. I assure hon. Members that I shall welcome prolonged consideration, and that provision has been made to allow the Committee&#039;s deliberations to go beyond the normal period.

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para24">
<a name="stpa_361">I found the speech of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) very moving and honest. I appreciate the effort he made to come to the House in today&#039;s difficult circumstances. On behalf of the Government and Labour Members, I want to express to him and his family our condolences at his loss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-33_para25">
<a name="stpa_362">I am also grateful to hon. Members of all parties for their efforts in addressing the very difficult issues associated with the Bill. I hope that I will have an opportunity to deal with some of the matters that have been raised, but I shall start with the question of victims. That subject has been at the heart of many of the contributions made today.

Members for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) and for North Down (Lady Hermon), without thinking of the victims of the crimes that are the subject of the Bill before the House. I had the opportunity to meet victims, including Aileen Quinton and Willie Frazer, when the Bill was published two weeks ago. Yesterday, I also looked in the eyes of widows of policemen who had been killed in a brutal and cowardly way by members of the IRA. I have also met the children and parents of people who have been killed and seen the dignity with which they carry themselves. Nobody in this House can understand their pain, and nor can we look those people in the eye without recognising the further pain that this Bill will bring.

 I have offered to meet victims. I met victims yesterday and I make an offer today to meet with any victims&#039; groups.

<a name="stpa_366">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen and the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_368">We wanted to ensure that the Independent Monitoring Commission&#151;whose reports are being considered&#151;had the chance to recognise what the IRA has undertaken. As part of the political peace process and as part of the building blocks for that process, this measure has been introduced. And, yes, I do say to the right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates), to the hon. Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) and to my hon. Friends for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks) and for Vauxhall, that we introduced the Bill at this time for those reasons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_369">The Bill, if it passes all its stages, will not come into effect until 2007 and we will have an opportunity to judge how the IRA performs between now and then. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) said, we need to restore the institutions in Northern Ireland, so that local people can decide local priorities.
</p>





<p><a name="st_353"><a name="51123-34_spnew6"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 If the Minister is as concerned as he says he is about victims, why are the Government stabbing new grievances into their grief and calling it closure? In relation to the Minister&#039;s last comment that the Bill will pave the way for the restoration of the institutions, I ask what will not happen if the Bill is not passed? What will be denied us, in terms of the institutions and the agreement, if the Bill is not passed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_354"><a name="51123-34_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware that part of the discussions at Weston Park and part of the reason that the Bill has been taken forward is because it was part of the building blocks to get people to make the statement in July in the first place.

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_370">I wish to make it clear for hon. Members on both sides of the House that there are tight eligibility criteria for the scheme. People cannot qualify for the scheme if they are members of Continuity IRA, the Real IRA, the UVF, the LVF or any specified organisation. They cannot be involved in terrorism now and qualify for the scheme. They cannot have been involved in offences after 10 April 1998 and qualify for the scheme. They cannot have received a sentence for any further crime and qualify for the scheme. That is an important aspect.

<a name="51123-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_371">Some Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall, the right hon. Members for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and for East Hampshire, and the hon. Members for Aylesbury, for Foyle and for Montgomeryshire have called the measure an amnesty. That is a debatable point and people will argue about it, but individuals will come before a court, they will be prosecuted and could be found guilty; a situation where individuals could be subject to criminal prosecution and released on licence is not an amnesty as I understand it.

<a name="51123-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_372">Several Members referred to non-appearance in court. That is a serious matter and it was raised by the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell), my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen, the hon. Members for North Down and for Montgomeryshire, my hon. Friends the Members for Foyle, for Hackney, South and Shoreditch and for Ochil and South Perthshire and the hon. Member for South Staffordshire. Non-appearance in court is a difficult issue. We have taken a judgment, because we want to get individuals through the scheme. We want them to qualify for the scheme, to come to account and to face justice as a result of a criminal record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_373">For the reasons that we have outlined we support the Bill as it stands, but as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said we shall examine amendments in Committee, tabled by the hon. Member for South Staffordshire or others. We shall consider what has been said on both sides of the House today, including the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen and others. We shall consider the issue in Committee and in another place, and reflect on the all the points that have been made.

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_374">There will be a tight licence under the legislation. If convicted individuals breach the licence, become members of, or involved in supporting, specified organisations get involved in terrorism or are convicted of other crimes, they will face recall and imprisonment. Under the early release scheme that we introduced, individuals have lost their licence and faced the consequences.

<a name="51123-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_375">My hon. Friends the Members for Ochil and South Perthshire and for Hackney, South and Shoreditch asked about end dates for the scheme. The Secretary of State will have the power to set an end date and we shall consider that in due course unless the scheme comes to a natural end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_376">I want to mention two further issues. My right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen, the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and the right hon. Member for East Hampshire mentioned exile. The Government certainly do not support the process of exiling. It must end and we utterly condemn activities of groups on either side of the community that are aimed at intimidating individuals in Northern Ireland. I understand the concerns that have been expressed today. It is our intention to listen to suggestions during the passage of the Bill to ensure that we tackle the question of exiling and ensure that intimidation does not occur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_377">The second point relates to interaction with the historical inquiry team. It is not our intention, in any way, shape or form, to undermine the efforts of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in reinvestigating old murders. Those investigations can take place until the Bill comes into effect. The PSNI can continue to pursue them, irrespective of their eligibility for the scheme. The Bill is about seeking justice, to ensure that individuals are given criminal records, that victims know who has committed the crime and that individuals are held on licence if they are convicted after 2007.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_378">We have included the armed forces and security services because we feel that it would be unfair and impractical to hold an individual on a terrorist basis

<br>&nbsp;<br>who could be released after 2007, whereas an individual from the military could be charged with a similar offence and find themselves in jail for that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_379">This is part of the political peace process. It is the key to getting where we are today. It is the key to the future. It is the key to ensuring that there are no future victims in Northern Ireland. The Government&#039;s concern is to ensure that we do not create future victims. That is why I commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="51123-37_time3"><h5>7.31 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_374"><a name="51123-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Michael Meacher  (Oldham, West and Royton) (Lab):</b> 
 I wish to raise the case of Susan May in the light of continuing concerns about the safety of her conviction and against the background of new material that has come to light in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_384">Mrs. May was imprisoned on 5 May 1993, convicted of murdering her elderly aunt, Mrs. Hilda Marchbank. Mrs. May was Mrs. Marchbank&#039;s devoted niece and carer. She has always maintained her innocence, and having served the sentence set down by the court and now been released, she still strongly insists that her name should now be cleared.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_385">The trial judge said that the main plank of the evidence against Mrs. May was the forensic issues, and I therefore start with those. The three forensic experts from the Forensic Science Service, were Mr. Michael John Davie, Dr. Javaid Hussain and Dr. Wilfred Basely. In June 1996, Mr. Davie was discredited in the Court of Appeal in the case of the Crown <i>v.</i> Doheny, where the conviction was overturned. The Forensic Science Service carried out an internal investigation, the Holman report, regarding Mr. Davie&#039;s conduct in Mrs. May&#039;s case, and was concerned that his work had fallen short of the standards expected. At second appeal, the prosecution asked that Mr. Davie&#039;s evidence should be withdrawn. I should add that the defence was only recently made aware of the contents of the report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_386">Regarding the second of the forensic experts at the trial, Dr. Hussain, in May 2004 forensic science students at Paisley university carried out an examination of the evidence that he presented at the trial. He had testified that in his opinion he was &quot;certain&quot; that the three stains were in blood. Dr. Hussain&#039;s area of expertise was fingerprint detection and enhancement, not blood analysis. The students pointed out that the tetra-amino biphenyl test Dr. Hussain used was not a test from which he could draw so certain a conclusion and that it is only a very general screening test. As they said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;Almost any biological material, in addition to blood, would show positive by this method.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_387">Indeed, Professor Jamieson, who was formerly a police forensic expert and is now professor of forensic sciences at Glasgow university, has commented that it is very clear that in Mrs. May&#039;s case the prosecution forensic experts made declarations well beyond their remit which were prejudicial and damaging.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_388">Turning to the third forensic expert, after the trial, Mrs. May&#039;s then solicitor sought for appeal purposes the assistance of a Forensic Science Service expert, Dr. Basely. That solicitor&#039;s behaviour at that time was considered to be &quot;actionable&quot; by Bindman & Co. solicitors who took over representation of Mrs. May&#039;s case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_389">My second main point is that Mrs. May&#039;s trial solicitor had been advised by Mr. Gartside QC to procure &quot;independent&quot; forensic expert advice for the defence. That advice was not acted on. The Criminal Cases Review Commission has chosen to use the Forensic Science Service, the same service that carries 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1630</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>out work for the police, for its forensic analysis of Mrs. May&#039;s case. Again, I simply make the point that a conflict of interest must occur when the same forensic laboratory is asked to represent both parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_390">The third general issue is that the use of DNA evidence in court by the FSS has been growing over the past 15 years, and many convictions have been secured on the basis of such evidence. There is, however, growing disquiet, because the criterion for DNA identification has been raised from identical readings at six locations to identical readings at 10 locations. Even that is now being described as unsatisfactory by Dr. Jefferies, the founding expert in the DNA field, who prefers identification on the basis of identical readings at 15 locations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_391">In Mrs. May&#039;s case, when the police took the cleaner to the house three days after the murder, they did not ask whether she had seen stains on the wall when she cleaned the house on the day before the murder. Her evidence, which was key to the prosecution case, was only sought some four weeks after Mrs. May&#039;s arrest, which was seven weeks after the murder. The cleaner was never given the opportunity to see the stains on the wall. The stain was not taken off the wall until five days after the murder, and it did not arrive at Dr. Basely&#039;s laboratory until 29 April, which was about seven weeks after the murder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_392">My fourth point concerns the disclosure of evidence to the defence by the police, which fell well short of complete openness. There are a number of examples of non-disclosure or only part disclosure in Mrs. May&#039;s case, and I shall briefly present three of them. First, a red car was seen parked outside the house on the night of the murder at approximately 12.45 am. Although the engine was running, there was no one in the car, which was there for 15 minutes. The defence did not draw the jury&#039;s attention to those facts. The three occupants have never been identified. Two separate witnesses saw the car. The defence was told that it was never found. Since the second appeal, it has come to light that the police did in fact locate a red car fitting the description. It belonged to the sister of a violent burglar, Michael Rawlinson, who had been drawn to the attention of the police as having been involved in this murder by two people who knew him. The sister had advertised and sold the car within three days of the murder. Forensic evidence taken from the car was never processed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_393">Secondly, in the police log for the first day of the investigation, clothing &quot;fibres&quot; are recorded as having been found on Mrs. Marchbank&#039;s hand. When taken to the forensic laboratory, they were described as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;visible fibres from left hand&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_394">When that exhibit appeared in Mr. Davie&#039;s statement, which is the document from which the defence started its investigation, he had recorded them as &quot;hairs&quot;, which would have been of little interest to the defence because in 1992 hairs were not able to provide a person&#039;s identification. Further investigation has shown that the police could not match any of Mrs. May&#039;s or the deceased&#039;s clothing with those fibres. The jury was robbed of significant discussion regarding the origin of the fibres because of the mischievous labelling of the exhibit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_395">Thirdly, the jury were told of an exhibit labelled, &quot;Craftsman Baker Paper Bag&quot;&#151;a rather odd description&#151;which turned out to be a paper bag

<br>&nbsp;<br>containing meat scraps that tested positive for blood. There were finger marks on the outside of the bag that should have been tested but were not. All that I can say&#151;I do not think that one could go further than this&#151;is that that exhibit presents an innocent source of blood from which it is possible that Mrs. May could have made the stains on the day prior to the murder, but it was lost to the trial by a sloppy or mischievous forensic process.

<a name="stpa_396">I call on my hon. Friend the Minister to insist, on behalf of the Home Office, that the Criminal Cases Review Commission adopt a policy of forensic examination that is completely independent of the Forensic Science Service, the organisation that carries out most of the police forensic analysis. I further call on her to instigate a system of total disclosure to the defence of all case evidence, from whatever source, that is relevant to this case, without the need for itemised requests.

<a name="stpa_397">After a clearly flawed process, in forensic and legal terms, before and during Mrs. May&#039;s trial, those are the minimum conditions required for justice to be seen to be done.

<p><a name="st_375"><a name="51123-38_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) for giving me the opportunity not only to provide brief responses to the specific points that he raised, but to explain how this case has been handled so far. He will be familiar with much of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_398">I know that my right hon. Friend has maintained an interest in the case. I also know that since her conviction, Susan May has pursued her case with two appeals against the conviction, two applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and a complaint against the police. I should like to take the opportunity to say something brief about each of them. Afterwards, I shall deal with the specific points about disclosure and the Forensic Science Service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_399">I am glad that we have a system that enables the Criminal Cases Review Commission to consider and reopen such cases, because I believe that if there has been a miscarriage of justice, we are most likely to be able to determine it through that mechanism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_400">Let me start with the first appeal. Four years after her conviction, Susan May lost her first appeal on 14 February 1997. The Court of Appeal rejected the fresh medical evidence that Susan May had suffered a memory gap about the circumstances of her aunt&#039;s death and said that it did not regard the conviction as unsafe. The appeal was followed by the first Criminal Cases Review Commission review. The case was one of several that was transferred to the commission from the Home Office in April 1997 following its establishment under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995. The commission considered an application from Susan May and concluded that it was worthy of further judicial scrutiny. In November 1999, the CCRC referred it to the Court of Appeal.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1632</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_401">In 1993, Susan May also made a complaint against the police, but because of her impending criminal trial, it remained on the table and stayed there until 1998 while she pursued her first appeal. Greater Manchester police carried out the investigation of the complaint under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority in accordance with the procedure that then pertained. In July 1999, an investigation report was submitted to the Police Complaints Authority, which issued a statement to the effect that the complaint had been investigated to its satisfaction. After that, the investigation report was submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service, which closely examined the report and concluded that there was no evidence that could secure a conviction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_402">The next step was to consider disciplinary action and, on 21 October 1999, Greater Manchester police submitted their proposals to the Police Complaints Authority. The Police Complaints Authority concluded that all bar one of the 22 allegations had not been substantiated because there was insufficient evidence to prove that any police officer had breached the police discipline code. The substantiated allegation was to do with an early interview by the police. It took place before Susan May&#039;s arrest and before she was cautioned. As my right hon. Friend said, she wanted to make the point that she should have been regarded as a suspect and not a witness, thereby having full protection under the law. The Police Complaints Authority agreed with her, and that became one of the subjects of Susan May&#039;s second appeal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_403">At the second appeal, the Court of Appeal heard arguments on the bloodstained handprint on a wall at the murder scene and the treatment of Susan May as a witness rather than a suspect, thereby denying her the protection under the law in relation to various comments that she made. The appeal judges ruled that her conviction was not unsafe and dismissed the second appeal on 7 December 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_404">Let me consider the second review by the CCRC. In August 2002, Mrs. May made a renewed application to the commission, and the second review is still going on. As my right hon. Friend knows, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss in detail the specific issues involved. I have inquired into that. The case is complex and I understand that the CCRC is carrying out several lines of investigation. A decision about whether to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal&#151;I reiterate that that is a decision solely for the CCRC&#151;will be made once its investigations are complete. In deciding whether to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal, the commission will apply the statutory test of whether there is a genuine possibility of the conviction being quashed. The decision on whether a conviction should be quashed rests with the Court of Appeal. That process means that I cannot deal with some of the detailed matters that my right hon. Friend raised.
</p>





<p><a name="st_376"><a name="51123-38_spnew0"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> 
 It would be extremely helpful if we could have an indication of the time scale of the review being carried out by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. If the Minister cannot give us such an indication, will she at least take the message from the House that it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1633</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>important that the commission now expedite the matter, given that the lady has now been released and wants some closure so that she can live her life afresh?
</p>





<p><a name="st_377"><a name="51123-38_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 I assure my hon. Friend that I shall communicate to the chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission the views that hon. Members have expressed in this debate about the importance of bringing this matter to a conclusion. Of course, that is a matter for the chairman, but I shall ensure that he is made aware of the feeling in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_405">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton mentioned two specific issues relating to the case. The first involved disclosure. I should start by pointing out that the common law disclosure arrangements that applied up to April 1997 were superseded by a statutory scheme in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, which pertains thereafter. We have recently strengthened the 1996 Act in part 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The relevant amendments came into force on 4 April this year. Although the legislation has been amended, its fundamental principle remains the same: that justice depends on full and frank disclosure by the prosecution of all relevant material.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_406">Under the Act, the prosecution is under a statutory obligation to disclose to the defence all material which
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;might reasonably be considered capable of undermining&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_407">the prosecution case, or of assisting the defence case. This duty applies throughout the trial. This is a strong test designed to ensure that the defence gets the material that it needs and that the trial focuses on the points at issue. To ensure that the prosecutor has all the necessary information, there is a statutory code of practice, which has recently been revised, and which obliges the police to retain, record and reveal all relevant investigative material to the prosecutor. I might add that the Criminal Justice Act 2003 strengthens the scheme of prosecution disclosure. Under the unamended Act, two different prosecution disclosure tests applied, one before the defence had produced a defence statement and one after. We have amalgamated those into a single new test, the effect of which will be to ensure that the defence gets discloseable material at an earlier stage than hitherto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_408">My right hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion that all case material should be handed over to the defence is, I fear, unrealistic in most cases. Many cases generate large volumes of investigative material, and under my right hon. Friend&#039;s proposed arrangements it would fall not only to the prosecutor to consider unused investigative material, but to the defence as well, thereby duplicating effort. Considerable time would be wasted in considering large volumes of material that did not satisfy the disclosure test. It is also important to note that some material cannot be handed over to the defence. This includes so-called sensitive material, such as that relating to the identity of informants. Such material might sometimes have to be withheld from the defence on public interest immunity grounds, provided, of course, that the court had made an order to that effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_409">To conclude, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 already contains a strong disclosure scheme that provides adequate safeguards for the defence. The key is for practitioners to apply the Act 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1634</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>correctly in all cases. We have a responsibility in all aspects of the prosecution service and elsewhere to ensure that it is properly applied.
</p>





<p><a name="st_378"><a name="51123-38_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 It would be useful to put on record that, in this case, neither the volume nor the sensitivity of the material was used as an argument for barring the disclosure of information which I believe could have ensured that this lady would have been proved innocent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_379"><a name="51123-38_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 I said that I would draw the attention of the chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to the debate. He will note what my hon. Friend has said. I am trying hard not to make specific comments about a case that is under consideration by that body, which is the proper body to decide on these matters. I am trying to deal with the general issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_410">My right hon. Friend raised a general issue about the Forensic Science Service, and about the circumstances in which its services should be secured. The Forensic Science Service is an executive agency of the Home Office, and is the principal provider of impartial forensic science services to the police and other investigating forces. It provides information to support the investigation of crime and evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts, and it also gives independent advice to the Home Office and others who serve the administration of justice, including the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_411">The Forensic Science Service works within the criminal justice system for both the defence and the prosecution, and takes pride in its impartiality. I think it perfectly possible for an independent forensic science service to provide proper advice on different occasions and examine evidence scientifically for different parties in circumstances such as these. I think we should make it clearer that the duty of experts giving evidence should be to the court and to justice. The Criminal Procedure Rule Committee has published a consultation paper that examines the issue of expert evidence and responsibility in relation to the court. While there may be contestability in regard to particular issues of expert evidence, it is important that the court should be satisfied about the expertise, and satisfied that it has been deployed properly in specific cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_412">I asked about the different tests in the Susan May case to which my right hon. Friend referred. I was told that the tests for the police were for blood, while those for the commission were for DNA. Two different processes are involved. The tests for the commission were carried out in Birmingham, and a report on the results was compiled by a Forensic Science Service employee in Wetherby. Those involved in the DNA tests were not involved in the original inquiry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_413">I believe that it is quite possible for a body such as the Forensic Science Service not to seek to justify an initiating decision, but to provide impartial, accurate, expert evidence in cases such as this. If there is evidence that demonstrates that it has failed to do that in a particular case, it should be taken into account by the Criminal Cases Review Commission in its review.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/debtext/51123-39.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_380"><a name="51123-39_spnew0"><b> Mr. Meacher: </b> 
 I made it very clear that three of the forensic science experts who were brought in as witnesses had since been discredited. No one is casting 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2005 : Column 1635</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>aspersions on the Forensic Science Service in general. All I am saying is that it is important for the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have access to wholly independent evidence. I am sure that those who are concerned about the case would be satisfied if the CCRC were to seek such evidence from a wholly independent source, in the light of the very bad experience in this case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_381"><a name="51123-39_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 As I have said more than once, how the CCRC conducts the review is a matter for it. The principle is important. My right hon. Friend was probably involved, as I was, in campaigning for an independent body to be able to review miscarriages of justice. It cannot provide that independent function if Ministers tell it how to conduct its business. However, as I said, I will ensure that the chairman of the CCRC is made aware of this debate and all the points that have been raised in it. That is, I think, the only appropriate assurance that I can give from the Dispatch Box.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51123-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_414">We want the criminal justice system to be fair, open and accessible. Those who believe that they have a genuine grievance, as does Mrs. May, should have recourse to redress. Her case to date, since her trial and conviction, has been exposed to a great deal of scrutiny. She has used the criminal justice system in pursuit of justice for herself and it is right that she should have the opportunity to do so. She has a further opportunity in the present review of the CCRC. We look forward to its result.
