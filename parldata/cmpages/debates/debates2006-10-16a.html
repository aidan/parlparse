action across all Government Departments. I confirm to my hon. Friend

public, private and voluntary sectors in a new war on tackling economic
inactivity and to mobilise resources across the public sector and into
the private sector. As part of that, we will certainly consider any
request for flexibility when we think that that can make a difference.
Whether it is on the 16-hour rule or elsewhere, we are prepared to work

that there was to be no alternative to the existing Post Office card
account. However, there will be a range of alternatives. Some are
already in place, and some are being brought in by the Post Office. As
I have said throughout, there will also be a successor
Government-backed account for those who do not take up any of the
other, better options that are available now and that will become
available in the near future.</p><br>

review of the funding of political parties. He has been asked to
produce recommendations that, as far as possible, are agreed between
the parties. Sir Hayden will publish an interim assessment on Thursday
this week. He has been asked to report to the Prime Minister with his
final conclusions before the end of December this year. Once we receive
those conclusions we will consult, and we will make decisions in due

Does he agree that, if any of the recommendations suggest that funding
should be capped, such capping should apply equally to all who donate
to political parties, including trade unions, private individuals and
businesses, and that there should not be discrimination against
individuals or the private sector? The trade unions have to play their
full, open and transparent
part.</p><p><a name="0610167000172"><b><a name="61016-0003.htm_spnew124"><a name="0610167000573">Mr.

Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life said in 1998, the trade
unions are the most regulated of all donors? During the 18 years of the
Conservative Government, the trade unions suffered one adverse change
after another in their financing regimes, while nothing whatever was
done in respect of companies. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is
leading with his chin on the issue, because there is one unquestionable
improvement that we must make in regulation, which is to ensure that
the unregulated funding of local parties by unincorporated associations
such as the midlands industrial council is brought to an end. I note
that although he spent just &#163;11,000 during the four-week
election period in 2005, he received a total of &#163;55,000 in the
eight months before the election was called from Lord Leonard Steinberg
and the midlands industrial council, and I assume that he spent that,
too. That shows that there is a glaring loophole continuously exploited
by the Conservative party, enabling them to spend large sums of money
and not account for them before the election period kicks
in.</p><br>

high-sounding comments from the Opposition, who said that they wished
for as much transparency as we and the Liberal Democrats wished for.
Such comments have been repeated, but I note, too, that the
Conservative party exploited a loophole in the law that allowed

there are three essential ingredients, and he has already touched on
some of them. First, there must be proper capping of individual
contributions. Secondly, there should be a firm regime to prevent the
abuse of enormous spending in constituencies outside the election

Thirdly, there should be proper transparency about the way in which all

the Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life reported in 1998, it
recited all the changes that had been made in respect of the trade

concluded:</p><a name="61016-0003.htmbrev_6"><a name="0610167000436"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We

sounds interesting, but in the United States it has spawned a vast
evasion and avoidance industry. We are more likely to get true
transparency if we have controls on spending that apply at all levels
of political parties&#146; spending and in respect of all kinds of
donors, including shady organisations such as the midlands industrial

touched on the point that I wish to make very strongly. There is a
strong body of opinion in our party that there should be much lower
limits on spending, which should be much better policed, so that no
party becomes the hireling of big business, rich people or, indeed, the
state. We should retain our independence by having much lower levels of
spending and, therefore, much lower levels of
donations.</p><br>

Hain):</b> With permission, I wish to make a statement on
political progress in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="0610167000185">Between
11 and 13 October in St. Andrews, both the British and Irish
Governments engaged intensively, late into the night and from early
morning, with the Northern Ireland political parties. That we were able
to defy the sceptics and cynics, and secure the St. Andrews agreement,
opens the way to a new dawn for democracy in Northern Ireland: a new
democracy based&#151;for the very first time in Northern
Ireland&#146;s tangled history&#151;on the twin foundations of the
rule of law and power sharing. Without question, it may come to be seen
as a pivotal moment in Irish
history.</p><p><a name="0610167000186">Those
two foundations stand together or fall together: on the one hand,
unequivocal support for the police and unequivocal support for the rule
of law; on the other an absolute commitment by all the parties to share
power in a restored Northern Ireland Executive. Delivery on both those
foundations was absent from the Good Friday agreement; now it is in
prospect. That is a measure of what was achieved at St.
Andrews&#151;arguably the fulfilment of the hopes expressed on Good
Friday eight years ago. The agreement has been placed in the Library
and is available in the Vote
Office.</p><p><a name="0610167000187">All
the parties at St. Andrews were crystal clear on one point at least: in
May, Parliament had legislated for closure, one way or the other, on
the political process. Four years since the Executive and Assembly last
sat, there had been set in statute a clear end
point&#151;24 November&#151;by which the political
parties would agree to locally accountable government for the people
they represent, bringing direct rule to an end. The alternative, as I
have made clear, is that the Assembly would dissolve. Incidentally,
were the parties to unravel St. Andrews at any stage in the coming
weeks and months, dissolution would follow as night follows day, and
both Governments would move on to formulate plan B. There is not a
choice between St. Andrews and something else; there is a choice only
between St. Andrews and
dissolution.</p><p><a name="0610167000188">Since the
House set the 24 November deadline in statute, there have been
important indicators that the context within which political
development can take place has been changing: changing fundamentally,
changing for the better and, I personally believe, changing for good.
Northern Ireland had the best parading season for four decades, with
not a soldier on the streets on 12 July&#151;something unthinkable
just a year ago, when 115 live rounds were fired by loyalist
paramilitaries at police and soldiers during the Whiterock parade. This
year, Whiterock passed off peacefully, following a cross-community
dialogue.</p><p><a name="0610167000189">Loyalist
leaders have given me assurances that, as the IRA has done, they will
now work to ensure an end to their paramilitarism and criminality. Last
week, for the first time ever, the leader of the Democratic Unionist
party, the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), met
the Catholic Primate of Ireland, Archbishop Brady. The House will want
to congratulate the right hon. Gentleman and Baroness Paisley on their
50th anniversary last Friday.</p><br>

for government committee, with all the parties face to face in the
room, did important and constructive work on a range of issues central
to the good governance of Northern Ireland. Above all, there has been
further compelling evidence that IRA violence has indeed ended, a
judgment confirmed decisively on 4 October in the report of the
Independent Monitoring Commission, which also confirmed in paragraph
2.17:</p><a name="61016-0003.htmbrev_7"><a name="0610167000437"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
leadership has maintained a firm stance against the involvement of
members in criminality, although this does not mean that criminal
activity by all members has stopped. The leadership&#146;s stance has
included public statements and internal directions; investigating
incidents of breach of the policy; the expulsion of some members; and
emphasising the importance of ensuring that business affairs are
conducted in a legitimate
manner&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0610167000191">The
Government firmly believe that the circumstances are now right to see a
permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland, with the
restoration and the full and effective operation of the political
institutions. Anyone with experience of the political process in
Northern Ireland will know that it is never easy, that the negotiations
are always tortuous and tough, and that there is always a danger of
things unravelling. St. Andrews, like Good Friday, was no exception;
but the harder the negotiations, the more likely it is that any
agreement that comes out of them will
stick.</p><p><a name="0610167000192">There
were two main issues to be resolved at St. Andrews if we were
to achieve restoration of the power-sharing Executive: the need for
support for policing and the rule of law across the whole community,
which would enable, in due course, the safe devolution of policing and
justice to the Assembly; and changes to the operation of the Good
Friday agreement&#146;s
institutions.</p><p><a name="0610167000193">On
support for policing, I want to spell out to the House what that means
by referring to paragraph 6 of the St. Andrews agreement. It means
fully endorsing the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It means
actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with
the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas. It means playing a full and
active role in all the policing and justice institutions, including the
Policing Board.</p><p><a name="0610167000194">For
many years now, all in this House have joined the Government in
demanding support for the PSNI from every part of the community. My
hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) and his Social
Democratic and Labour party colleagues&#151;especially John
Hume&#151;have shown courageous leadership in making that a reality.
With one in five&#151;rising to one in three&#151;PSNI officers now
Catholics, and the service deploying with local consent right across
Northern Ireland, including south Armagh, policing has been
transformed.</p><p><a name="0610167000195">But no one
present will now underestimate how significant it will be if the
republican movement can accept and endorse the agreement drawn up at
St. Andrews. Based on last week&#146;s discussions, I am confident
that it will do so, and that that will make for a decisive and
irrevocable break from a past of violence and criminality. It will give
absolute confidence in an authentically new Northern Ireland of hope
and peace and the rule of law. I believe that, when that active support
for policing and criminal justice is seen to be delivered, there will
be sufficient community confidence

devolution of justice and policing from the British Government by May
2008.</p><p><a name="0610167000196">It is
important to acknowledge, however, that devolution of policing is
already very substantially down the road. Following the Patten report,
direct rule Ministers relinquished matters of real importance. The PSNI
has already been accountable for five years to the Policing Board,
comprising local elected and independent representatives, to the Police
Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, and to district policing partnerships.
The remaining devolution of policing and justice is largely
institutional, focusing more on the courts and the administration of
justice than on operational policing, which in the past has been so
controversial to nationalist and republican
communities.</p><p><a name="0610167000197">Although
nationalists and republicans had major concerns over the primacy of
national security being vested in the Security Service, the St. Andrews
agreement makes it clear in annexe E that there is full accountability
for all domestic operational security matters, because they will be
exclusively undertaken, not by MI5, but by the PSNI, which is, of
course, fully accountable in Northern Ireland&#151;including those of
its officers who may be secondees to MI5. We stand ready, moreover, to
develop procedures and establish protocols on MI5&#146;s activities,
to provide any reassurances necessary on
accountability.</p><p><a name="0610167000198">Taking
Northern Ireland out of a divided past and into a shared future can be
done only on the basis of agreement on fundamental principles: the
principle of consent; the commitment exclusively to peaceful and
democratic means; the sharing of power within a stable, inclusive
partnership government; equality and human rights for all; and mutually
beneficial relationships developed between north and south and within
these islands. Those are the fundamental principles of the Good Friday
agreement, and they will always remain the bedrock and foundation of
the political settlement in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="0610167000199">However, the
Good Friday agreement allowed for changes to be made to the operation
of the institutions to make them more responsive and effective, and,
following discussion with all the parties, we have made an assessment
of them in annexe A. The Government will introduce legislation to enact
appropriate changes and other aspects of the St. Andrews agreement
before the statutory November deadline, once the parties have formally
endorsed the terms of the agreement and agreed on that basis to restore
the power-sharing
institutions.</p><p><a name="0610167000200">We have
now set out a clear timetable for restoration. Tomorrow, a new
programme for government committee will begin regular meetings at
Stormont to agree priorities for the new Executive. Crucially, parties
will, for the first time, together be represented at leadership level
on that Committee, as on the existing preparation for government
committee.</p><p><a name="0610167000201">We have
asked the parties to consult on the St. Andrews agreement,
and to respond by 10 November to allow time for final
drafting of the Bill to be taken through the House. Once that happens,
and on the basis that the St. Andrews agreement is endorsed, the
Assembly will meet to nominate the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister on November 24, the deadline for a deal.</p><br>

worked tirelessly over so many years, that we are at this point. Their
energy, time and patient attention to the detail of this issue has been

on the Policing Board? It has to include encouraging people in

Republic should surely be confined to changes in that country&#146;s
constitution or system of
government?</p><p><a name="0610167000211">The
Opposition support the institutional changes set out in the St. Andrews
document, in particular those relating to ministerial accountability
and collective responsibility. Subject, of course, to seeing the text
of the new legislation, we hope to be able to offer the Government our
support when they introduce the Bill. We also welcome the
Government&#146;s changes of policy on capping and additional relief
for pensioners when the new rates system is introduced, and their
change of heart on the retention of academic selection. Will the
Secretary of State introduce a new Order in Council to repeal the
complete ban on all academic selection that the Government imposed
earlier this year?</p><p><a name="0610167000212">I
wish the Government well in the course that they have set. The ultimate
prize on offer is indeed great: a peaceful, stable and prosperous
Northern Ireland, with a shared future for people from all traditions,
based on democracy and the rule of law rather than on terrorism and the
gun. It is an objective that I believe unites all of us in this House,
and success in that endeavour is in the interests of us
all.</p><br>

Hain:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support for what
we achieved at St. Andrews. Despite the questions that he is entitled
to put to me and the answers that he is entitled to get, cross-party
consensus on these matters is important at this critical moment. I also
thank him for in-principle support for the Bill when we introduce
it&#151;probably in the week starting 20 November, to get it in
before the deadline of 24 November. I have discussed with him the fact
that the Bill will have to be taken through using emergency procedures
and the Opposition&#146;s support will be critical to deliver what we
intend.</p><p><a name="0610167000214">I agree with
what the hon. Gentleman said about full support for the police and all
the different elements of that that he described, including
co-operating with investigations. That is vital. Any party that aspires
to hold ministerial office, let alone any democratically elected party,
ought to support the police, full stop, and the policing situation that
they are being asked to support has been completely transformed, as I
described.</p><p><a name="0610167000215">On the pledge
of office, the hon. Gentleman will see in annexe A, paragraph 8, that
the preparation for government committee is being asked to consider
that matter. It is important for at least four of the parties that the
issue be addressed. We shall have to see what emerges from that
consideration and where we can take it.</p><p><a name="0610167000216">The hon. Gentleman asked when an
ard fheis will be called. That is a matter for Sinn Fein&#146;s
internal procedures, but the agreement contains a reference to the Sinn
Fein executive, the ard comhairle, which needs to meet sooner rather
than later. He is right to say that we will need to know by 10 November
whether we are in business&#151;whether we are in a position to
proceed with the emergency Bill with all-party support, or not. That
will be crucial.</p><p><a name="0610167000217">On community
restorative justice, I can give the hon. Gentleman an absolute
guarantee that there is no question of it being an alternative to the
rule of law or policing. Indeed, any CRJ schemes that are supported and
officially recognised&#151;we are consulting further on
that&#151;will have to comply with the rule of law and have to have
the police almost embedded within them, as happens in a number of cases
now. I give the House the pledge that I gave the Policing Board last
week: if we do not get the arrangements for community restorative
justice schemes right and if we do not satisfy everybody, broadly
speaking, we will not do them. It would be better not to have them than
to create a climate of uncertainty or ambiguity about what is
involved.</p><p><a name="0610167000218">On
recruitment standards to the PSNI, the Patten report was clear that
people with serious paramilitary backgrounds should not join the PSNI,
and we have no plans to move away from that. Recruits to the PSNI,
whether regular officers or community support officers, will have to
have the same rigorous standards of entry applied to them. There is no
intention of changing
that.</p><p><a name="0610167000219">On
an election or a referendum, the different parties are thinking about
that matter and plan to come back to us. We await the outcome of their
deliberations. On academic selection and rate capping, as of
now the Government&#146;s policy remains as it was prior to St.
Andrews. We need to see the implementation of the agreement and
delivery of the legislation in the week beginning 20 November, with
all-party support for that,

November. That being the case, included in the legislation will be the
removal of the ban on academic selection. Quite separately, if the
agreement is implemented&#151;if not, we will proceed with our
policy, as was our original intention, based on long
consultation&#151;and signed up to, including those crucial steps to
legislation about which the parties need to tell us by 10 November and
the nomination of the First and Deputy First Minister on 24 November,
we will impose a

&#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> I welcome the
statement and my early sight of it. Good progress has been made and it
can work, particularly because the most recent Independent Monitoring
Commission report suggests that the IRA&#146;s activities have been
massively reduced, although not to zero, and that many of its
structures have been
dismantled.</p><p><a name="0610167000221">I was also
pleased to see annexe B, which shows true progress on a Bill of Rights
for Northern Ireland and on a single equality Bill, both of which will
be essential if we are to see a truly shared future for the people of
Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="0610167000222">My
first question relates to the apparent removal of a cross-party vote to
confirm the election of the First and Deputy First Ministers. That was
a fundamental principle of the Good Friday agreement, under paragraph 5
of strand 1. Why has it been
removed?</p><p><a name="0610167000223">It
seems that some work will be done on generating structures for a
department of justice. We fully agree with that intention, but it is
not clear whether the matter will be determined by the Executive or by
the Assembly as a whole. Will the Secretary of State say whether the
department will be established by the Assembly or by the
Executive?</p><p><a name="0610167000224">It seems
that, when a decision is to be taken, the options are an election or a
referendum. If the Government choose an election, they need to explain
why they proposed in the Northern Ireland Act 2006 to postpone the
election from May 2007 to May 2008, specifically to give the Assembly
time to bed down and govern Northern Ireland for a year. I am not sure
why there is a debate on this matter, given the Government&#146;s
robust arguments on the issue at the time. Can we have clarification,
given the enormous interference in election dates that we have
had?</p><p><a name="0610167000225">In the interim
period from now until March, there is a danger that the Government will
continue using Orders in Council, which cannot be amended, with regard
to legislation affecting Northern Ireland. May I have an assurance
that, during that period, there will be a moratorium on any significant
legislation in order to allow the Assembly to pick up the reins on such
decisions?</p><p><a name="0610167000226">In the
spirit of celebration that may have broken out, my hon. Friend the
Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) asks for an assurance
that the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry, which unquestionably would
be in greater demand as tourists flock from Scotland to Northern
Ireland, will be
reinstated.</p><p><a name="0610167000227">The Secretary of State will know
that the promise of funding was held out and was rudely grabbed away.
It is a serious issue, so may we have an assurance that that
strategically important service will be revisited and will get the
funding that it needs?</p><br>

observation about deadlines. I predicted that the 24 November deadline
would slip. On many occasions, I sought an assurance from the Secretary
of State that it would not and he said that it would not, but in
reality there has been some slippage. I understand the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s strong rationale for that slippage, but, given that
it is very likely&#151;it is obvious, in fact&#151;that he will
seek to lift the condition of having a fully established Executive on
24 November and that that decision will slip to March, what assurance
can we have that, if there are further roadblocks and difficulties
between now and March, the March deadline itself will not slip? The
right hon. Gentleman was very robust and has been clear in the
documents that have been shared with me that March is an absolute
deadline, but, once again, we have seen those deadlines slip. He knows
my concern. If deadlines are seen to slip, we could carry on living
with slippage and deadlines for the foreseeable future and that will
not lead to the lasting peace and the effective devolution that we
seek.</p><p><a name="0610167000229"><b><a name="61016-0003.htm_spnew138"><a name="0610167000587">Mr.

grateful for it, because we need to move forward together.</p><p><a name="0610167000230">To take up his last point on
slippage, we never expected that implementation would take place
on 24 November. What we insisted on was that there had to be
a deal, and that we have. There had to be a deal and we have a deal.
Indeed, we have the nomination of the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister on 24 November, so we have carried out our promise
to the House in that respect.</p><p><a name="0610167000231">The 26 March
deadline&#151;that incorporates the 14 March deadline for
the nomination of Ministers by the parties and the 26 March deadline
for the running of the d&#146;Hondt system and the restoration of
self-government&#151;will not slip. As I said in my statement, if
anything unravels, the Assembly will be dissolved and Stormont will be
shut down, as it would have been and still could be. If something
unravels between now and 24 November, Stormont will shut
down&#151;that would mean the end of costs, salaries and the rest of
it. That is what we have committed ourselves to, with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s support.</p><p><a name="0610167000232">The hon. Gentleman is right
about the IRA&#146;s huge change. In particular, I draw his attention
to paragraph 2.17 in the Independent Monitoring Commission report of 4
October, which referred in terms to the disbanding of the IRA&#146;s
structures that were responsible for the &#147;procurement,
engineering and training&#148; of its military operation&#151;in
other words, the disbandment of its military capacity.</p><p><a name="0610167000233">We have reconsidered the
question of a cross-party vote and the appointment of the Executive as
a result of inter-party negotiations. It was important for the right
hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and his party to get
the Good Friday agreement amended in that respect, and the way in which
we have reframed it has been accepted by the Social Democratic and
Labour party. We can take that matter forward.</p><p><a name="0610167000234">On the department of justice,
clearly the provisions are laid out for how that will be decided in
terms of the Executive making recommendations and the involvement of
the Assembly.</p><br>

Water charges is one. If we do not make progress on that, not only will

Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) and those in the rest of Great

Ireland and the structure of law and order enforcement. Those matters
must be kept. We have the promise, but not the delivery. As I have said

There will be a big hole in the budget amounting to some &#163;200

there will be an investment gap of between &#163;200 million

complaints system under which Osama can complain about being got at by
MI5, but the Omagh victims cannot complain about being let down by MI5.

Secretary of State. First, in relation to the devolution of policing
and justice, can he confirm that it is not an automatic process but
entirely the case, under the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 2006 passed by this House, that before such devolution
can take place the First Minister has to give his approval and approval
is required on a cross-community vote of the
Assembly?</p><p><a name="0610167000261">Secondly,
while I know that the Secretary of State is planning for a
smoothly operating Executive, the St. Andrews agreement touches on the
possibility of a breach of the terms of the agreement. Can he confirm
that the party that defaults will be penalised, not every party as has
been the case in the past? Can he also confirm that the Government will
not act out of kilter with any recommendation from the IMC in
sanctioning defaulting
parties?</p><p><a name="0610167000262"><b><a name="61016-0003.htm_spnew152"><a name="0610167000601">Mr.

on the latter point in line with established practice in legislation
and I am grateful for his offer of support.</p><p><a name="0610167000263">Devolution of
policing and justice is not automatic. All the parties, including Sinn
Fein, supported the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,
for which the House voted and which received Royal Assent in July. It
provides for the nomination of a First Minister, Deputy First Minister
and then a cross-community vote for the timing of implementing
devolution. However, I hope that people will consider the
practicalities, too. As I said in the statement, huge parts of
operational policing have already been devolved in practical terms.
What remains is important but has more to do with the administration of
justice.</p><p><a name="0610167000264"><b><a name="61016-0003.htm_spnew153"><a name="0610167000602">Michael
Connarty (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab):</b> First, may I
thank the Secretary of State and all the parties for the tremendous
advances that they have made, not only at St. Andrews, but in all the
years that I have been a Member of Parliament and travelling backwards
and forwards to Northern Ireland? Hearing people from Northern Ireland
parties arguing about matters such as water and rates would hearten the
many trade union members I met when I gathered a trade union meeting in
Northern Ireland a few months ago because those issues concern
them.</p><p><a name="0610167000265">However, as the
leader of the DUP said, all must be based on a 100 per cent., unfailing
commitment to the rule of the law. When does my right hon. Friend
anticipate that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will not fly in
and out of south Armagh, as it did when I previously visited that part
of the Province, but operate normally by driving in and out of that
southern part, in safety and security, knowing that all the communities
and parties in the area support
it?</p><p><a name="0610167000266"><b><a name="61016-0003.htm_spnew154"><a name="0610167000603">Mr.

believes the Government is putting the future of the Post Office
network and of Royal Mail at risk by their continued failure to take
the tough and overdue decisions needed; further believes that many
local post offices have closed or are under threat because of the
uncertainty over the future of the subsidy to rural post offices after
2008 and the withdrawal of public sector business from the network,
including the pension book, the television licence, passports and the
decision to withdraw the Post Office card account when the existing
contract expires in 2010; shares Postcomm&#146;s concern that over
6,500 remaining rural post office branches are vulnerable and could
close over the next few years; further believes that the Post Office
network provides significant social and economic benefits and can play
a key role in tackling financial exclusion and helping rural and
deprived urban communities to survive and thrive; further believes the
delays in finalising the investment package for Royal Mail is
undermining Royal Mail&#146;s ability to compete in the postal market
following liberalisation last January threatening jobs and Royal
Mail&#146;s market share; and therefore calls on the Government to
end this paralysis in decision-making at the heart of Government so
that the Post Office network and Royal Mail can make the investments
they need with greater certainty about a sustainable and stable
commercial
future.</p></ul><p><a name="0610167000280">Royal Mail and
the Post Office are in crisis. If anyone should doubt that, or ask why
we are holding this debate today, they need only read page 2 of
today&#146;s <i> Financial Times</i> and last week&#146;s report
from Postcomm. The report backs up the warnings that Liberal Democrat
Members of Parliament have been giving for at least the past year and,
unfortunately, confirms our worst fears. For those hon. Members who
have not read the <i> Financial Times</i> today, it contains a piece
headed</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_9"><a name="0610167000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Thousands

and Industry, so we believe that it is well sourced. It suggests that
the Government intend to make a statement before the Christmas recess
about that cull.</p><p><a name="0610167000282">The
Postcomm report was equally alarming. It shows that decisions by the
Government, as well as their lack of decision making, have caused the
current chaos. In other words, the Government have been getting it
wrong and have failed subsequently to put it right. I do not think that
I have ever read a report from an independent regulator that contains
such stinging criticism; it is probably unprecedented. It talks about
the Government&#146;s failure to deliver on tough and overdue
decisions, and about the possible cutting of nearly 6,500 post offices
in the rural network that are making a loss.</p><p><a name="0610167000283">The Liberal Democrats&#146;
argument today is that the problem has been caused by the

Royal Mail by stealth. They are under-investing in Royal Mail and are
not backing it, and as a result private competitors are winning market
share and undermining the Royal Mail, its employees&#146; jobs and

stealth, and she ought to be aware of that.</p><p><a name="0610167000290"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew173"><a name="0610167000622">Mr.

the whole House to send a clear message to the Government. There is a
huge campaign in this country against what the Government are

&#147;very important&#148; or &#147;important&#148;.
Significantly, the percentage rose substantially among the unemployed

90-year-old people, because it is the only one they can get

Government have been following completely contradictory policies. They
are trying to say that they want to save the post office network, while
taking business away. Last year they were subsidising, through the
social network payment, to the tune of &#163;150 million. In the same
year, they took business worth &#163;168 million out of the post
office network. According to Adam Crozier, five years ago 60 per cent.
of the revenue of the average post office came from Government
business; in two years&#146; time, it will be down to just 10 per
cent. That is the size of the cut in post office revenue. It is not the
fault of the customers or of technology; it is the fault of those
people over there who are making the

all agree that one of the worst decisions taken in recent months was on
television licences. It was a bad decision for two reasons. First, as
the hon. Gentleman said, it withdraws business from post offices, but,
secondly and even more importantly, it means that an awful lot of
people will not get their TV licences and will have to go to court over
the next few months. What does the hon. Gentleman suggest the BBC

hon. Gentleman spoke to BBC managers, he would hear from them that the
Government were unable to guarantee the future size of the network, so
they were not able to ensure that a network would be in place for TV
licence payers to use. That was one of the main reasons the BBC refused
to go ahead with a contract with Post Office Ltd. Once again, it was
the Government&#146;s failure that led to the
problem.</p><p><a name="0610167000312"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew187"><a name="0610167000636">Michael

reasons can be cited for the failings of the post office network and
the lack of confidence among sub-postmasters. The first is the Post
Office card account, which represents more than 10 per cent. of annual
income for the average post office. For many months, uncertainty about
the future has been evident, but we observed at parliamentary questions
today&#151;probably thanks to the Liberal Democrat Opposition
day&#151;that Department for Work and Pensions Ministers went further
than usual to say that there might be a future for the Post Office card
account. If that proves to be the case, it will be very welcome, but we
want to see more details before we can believe the weasel words of
Ministers. We also want to be sure that individuals are able to choose
the Government account rather than be pressurised to move their
business to a bank.</p><br>

Swinson (East Dunbartonshire) (LD):</b> Does my hon. Friend
agree that it is not just the revenue lost to post offices by the
withdrawal of the Post Office card account, as the footfall is
relevant, too? In common with the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris
Bryant), I toured sub-post offices in my constituency this year and
some estimated that 40 per cent. of their footfall came from benefits
and POCA. There is the further point that other services within the
post office will also be lost if POCA is
withdrawn.</p><p><a name="0610167000316"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew190"><a name="0610167000639">Mr.
Davey:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right: that is
precisely why it is so damaging for the Government to keep withdrawing
all these services. It creates uncertainty. Sub-postmasters or
sub-postmistresses want to invest in their businesses, but in order to
do so they must know that there is a future. They want to know that the
contracts will stay with them and that they will be able to secure some
return on the investment, but the Government have created a climate of
huge uncertainty.</p><p><a name="0610167000317">Social network payments are the
next issue. We know that they are due to run out in 2008, yet the
Government have given no indication whether they will continue or at
what level. Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses simply will not
invest beyond 2008 because they do not know what income they will
receive. It might all be to do with the spending review, or perhaps the
Secretary of State has been told to find a lot of savings for the
Chancellor. If so, our fears are magnified. Failing to support post
offices in rural or deprived urban areas creates real
problems.</p><p><a name="0610167000318"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew191"><a name="0610167000640">Miss

with the Government&#146;s handling of post offices is the lack of
imagination. Only last year did they establish a set of pilots, looking
at new services such as home delivery, mobile post offices,
partnerships with pubs, local authorities, police stations, pharmacies
and others, and host services with satellite post offices. All those
pilots are welcome, but they have come very late. We have been arguing
for more innovative approaches for a long time, but the Government have
left it late without putting the investment behind the pilots to ensure
that they work.</p><p><a name="0610167000321">There
have been other problems with the Government&#146;s thinking on post
offices. A particular concern for the Liberal Democrats are the
restrictions that Royal Mail Group forces on Post Office Ltd, which
force restrictions on postmasters.</p><p><a name="0610167000322"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew193"><a name="0610167000642">Sir

the restrictions forced on postmasters in respect of the business they
can take from other postal providers, is my hon. Friend not concerned
that Royal Mail, facing competition, is beginning to get its own
employees to look for new business for Royal Mail? In one of its
videos, it appears that it is encouraging people to look at who goes
into the post office and to steer them away from the post office so
that they go direct to Royal Mail. If these people are to have their
hands tied behind their back by Royal Mail, it seems a complete
betrayal by Royal Mail to take away the business that they can get only
from Royal Mail.</p><br>

particularly disturbing. Since 1 January, post offices could have been
working with 17 other licensed operators to bring in more letters or
parcels business, but Post Office Ltd has prevented that from
happening. As he suggested, it is working the other way; it is a
negative because Royal Mail is trying to take that business away.
Therefore, those restrictions need to be removed and we need to have

clarification about which measures the hon. Gentleman thinks are a
solution to which problems? I am following his logic and, by and large,
I agree with him. His party&#146;s policy of the part-sale of Royal
Mail will address the problems of the lack of investment in Royal Mail
and stand to replenish a large part of the pension fund, but does not
he accept that we need to segregate that from the problems of the
network? That policy is not a solution to its problems and, if his
argument is to hold together today, as I think so far it is doing, we
need to explore other solutions to those
problems.</p><p><a name="0610167000325"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew196"><a name="0610167000645">Mr.
Davey:</b> I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. Part of our
policy is to have significant new investment in the network and to
create an investment fund from the sale of 49 per cent. of the shares
in Royal Mail. We believe that that will produce &#163;2 billion that
could be invested in the network. Royal Mail would then be free to
borrow on the capital markets to invest in the automation that it
needs. Our solution will provide money for the Post Office network and
freedom to borrow on a commercial basis for the Royal
Mail.</p><p><a name="0610167000326"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew197"><a name="0610167000646">Mr.
Duncan:</b> This is a grown-up, sensible debate, but the
ability of the Royal Mail to borrow or to act like that does not
necessarily help all those tiny rural or urban post offices that are
privately owned and perhaps linked to a shop. Therefore, the investment
that the hon. Gentleman is talking about will not necessarily benefit
them one penny.</p><p><a name="0610167000327"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew198"><a name="0610167000647">Mr.
Davey:</b> Of course it will because the investment can come
through in terms of extra training, and extra support for business
development, marketing, ICT and all the things that are needed for
those private entrepreneurs. Moreover, the proposals that I have
mentioned to remove restrictions will enable them to develop their
business far more with mail operators. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman is aware that the mail business is the most profitable and
the biggest business of the average sub-post office. Therefore,
allowing that to expand is the best way to ensure the viability of the
network.</p><p><a name="0610167000328">The Government
should have been pressing the banks to enable the Post Office network
to join the Link network. If that could be accessed through every
sub-post office around the country, so that every sub-post office could
be used as an ATM, that would be a great way not only to end financial
exclusion but to ensure the footfall that my hon. Friend the Member for
East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) mentioned, so that business went into
every post office. Therefore, we have made some very attractive
proposals for reform and investment that we believe will deal with the
problem.</p><br>

with the Deputy Prime Minister is that he has often put forward 10-year

housing, and none has produced any of the things that were promised, so
it does not fill me with confidence to know that the Deputy Prime
Minister is now in charge of the future of the post office network.
</p><p><a name="0610167000337">I am delighted that,
in the past year or two, Royal Mail&#146;s performance has improved,
but it faces three major challenges, of which the Minister will be
aware. First, there is the challenge from competition; secondly, there
is the challenge posed by 20 years of under-investment; and, thirdly,
there are problems caused by the pension deficit, which mean that it is
competing with one arm tied behind its back.</p><p><a name="0610167000338">As 17 licensed operators compete
with Royal Mail, the competition is fierce and very real. Companies
such as Deutsche Post, TNT Post, DHL and Business Post are taking
market share from Royal Mail. At the moment, they are taking only 3 to
4 per cent., but most commentators believe that that figure may be set
to explode. The 500 big business mailers alone represent 50 per cent.
of Royal Mail&#146;s turnover of &#163;6 billion, so those private
sector competitors could take a big slice of the cake relatively
quickly. That would seriously hit Royal Mail&#146;s finances. There
are already some early signs of that, in terms of Royal Mail cutting
back services. We are experiencing earlier collections and later
deliveries. In some parts of the country, if people do not post their
mail before 9 o&#146;clock, it is not collected until the next day.
However, their delivery does not come until 3, 4 or 5 o&#146;clock in
the afternoon, and that makes a complete mockery of next-day delivery
promises. That is a cut in service.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="16 Oct 2006">

service, too, because the junk mail that Royal Mail now promises to
deliver is set to increase in volume many times over. That is a real
concern, and Royal Mail has gone to the ridiculous extent of punishing
a postman for explaining to ordinary citizens how they can get the
mailing preference service. That is a complete disgrace, but it shows
the desperate measures that Royal Mail is taking because of
competition. However, if we consider the lack of investment, we can see
what is at the root of Royal Mail&#146;s problems.</p><p><a name="0610167000340">I have to make a confession:
before I came to the House, I was a management consultant, and the
industry in which I consulted most of all was the postal services
industry. I had the privilege of going to 40 countries and looking at
their postal administrations, so I am afraid that I know an optical
character reading machine and a remote video encoding unit from my
elbow. The automation in Royal Mail is pretty poor compared to that of
our competitors. The Germans and the Dutch, for example, can sort 95
per cent. or more of their mail by machine, but in the UK the figure is
about 50 per cent. That is how far behind we are. Just imagine the
impact that that has on a firm&#146;s cost structure. The estimates
of how much investment is needed vary; some people say that &#163;2
billion or more is needed, but the Government have offered less than
&#163;1 billion, so the investment crisis in the Royal Mail is very
real.</p><p><a name="0610167000341">On top of that,
there is the pensions deficit. I agree with the Minister that there has
been progress on that issue. He has allowed Royal Mail to make good its
deficit over 17 years. That is a long time, and it is not the time-line
given to private companies, but at least it will enable Royal Mail to
make good its deficit. The Government have underwritten that by
&#163;850 million, but that still leaves Royal Mail with annual
contributions of around &#163;750 million per annum to make. That is
a dead-weight cost that Royal Mail has to meet before it can make
profits and invest in its business&#151;and when it is fighting
competitors, it is a real dead-weight
cost.</p><p><a name="0610167000342"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew205"><a name="0610167000654">Mr.
Weir:</b> I do not disagree with much of what the hon.
Gentleman has said, but I am confused. If it is his policy to privatise
the mail delivery service, given the problems of competition and cost,
how would a privatised Royal Mail compete while continuing to fulfil
its universal service obligation, which is important to rural areas?
Would that obligation not come under pressure from
privatisation?</p><p><a name="0610167000343"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew206"><a name="0610167000655">Mr.
Davey:</b> Let me spell it out for the hon. Gentleman. In the
public sector&#151;the Government want Royal Mail to remain in the
public sector, as does the Conservative party, unless it has changed
its policy recently&#151;the Royal Mail cannot go to the private
market to obtain the money required to invest for the automation that I
have discussed. It relies on Treasury handouts, and the record over
many decades shows that the Treasury has not given it the money it
requires to invest, so it cannot compete or become efficient. Our
proposal enables it to borrow on capital markets, so it

It can compete, so we will bring new life to the Royal Mail.</p><p><a name="0610167000344">I am concerned
that the Government, faced with those three challenges, have not done
more. We are waiting with bated breath to hear when they will make an
announcement about the future of Royal Mail. Royal Mail management have
submitted a modest proposal to the Government, in which they suggest
keeping Royal Mail in the public sector, while allowing 20 per cent. of
shares to be held by employees. Management agree with us that that will
give employees an incentive to perform well and improve productivity,
as their future will be tied to that of Royal Mail. The Government
balked at that modest proposal, and we must ask why. I think that that
is to do with the Communication Workers Union, and the 213 Labour Back
Benchers who signed the early-day motion saying that they should not
accept the proposal<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i>
Ministers are not prepared to make tough decisions, because they are
still in hock to the unions and to their Back Benchers. The Secretary
of State is not prepared to make decisions that would put Royal Mail
back on its feet, and secure the investment that our post office
network needs.</p><p><a name="0610167000345">Our party has
taken tough decisions. We have submitted proposals that work for Royal
Mail and for post offices. That is the way to ensure that we revitalise
the Post Office and Royal Mail. I would like to end by asking the
Minister some specific questions. First, when will the Government end
the uncertainty for Royal Mail and the post office
network?</p><p><a name="0610167000346"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew207"><a name="0610167000656">Mr.

Government&#146;s policy is determined by Members who signed the

because he has made my point for me. I hope that the Minister will tell
us when the uncertainty will end, because the National Federation of
Sub-Postmasters needs to know the answer when it comes to the House on
Wednesday. Will he pledge to stop his colleagues in the Department for
Work and Pensions undermining the Post Office card account, even before
the contract is renewed? Will he pledge to stop taking Government
business from the network? Will the Government stand up to the CWU, and
give Royal Mail employees shares in their future? Will he give post
offices freedom from the restrictive practices imposed by the Royal
Mail Group? If can give us positive answers to those questions tonight,
it will be a real step forward in the debate. I fear, however, that he
will not do so, because although we have tabled a reasonable motion, it
is clear that he will oppose it. We hope that colleagues on both sides
of the House will join Liberal Democrat Members to send a message,
because we believe that it is time to save our post office network and
Royal Mail. The House should speak for the country, and for 4 million
petitioners, and back our
motion.</p><br>

interventions, because the debate is
important.</p><p><a name="0610167000365">I want to
spend a short time, however, reminding the House about the
Government&#146;s record on the network to date. In total since 1999,
the Government have committed a funding package of well over &#163;2
billion for the network. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton
might not agree with our policies, but I suggest
that it stretches credulity to claim that they are &#147;acts of
vandalism&#148; against the network or evidence of a
&#147;do-nothing&#148;
policy.</p><p><a name="0610167000366">Our funding
package for the network includes the provision of some &#163;750
million over the five years to 2008 to maintain rural post
offices&#151;&#163;150 million a year. That funding, backed up by
the requirement for Post Office Ltd to prevent all avoidable rural post
office closures, has helped to keep open thousands of offices that
might otherwise have closed. The policy of no avoidable closures was
extended earlier this year and will remain in place while the future
strategy for the network is being
finalised.</p><p><a name="0610167000367">We
recognise, however, that not all the initiatives
undertaken&#151;whether by the Government or by Post Office
Ltd&#151;have been as successful as we would wish. However, whether
we like it or not, the truth is that post offices are not being used as
once they were, and the trend is accelerating. The business is going
through a sustained period of change, and needs to adapt to
customers&#146; changes in lifestyle and habits; for example, 75 per
cent. of people have their pensions and benefits paid directly into a
bank account, compared with the 23 per cent. who choose a Post Office
card account.</p><p><a name="0610167000368"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew218"><a name="0610167000667">Mr.

variety of causes. For example, I was trying to make a point about the
Post Office card account: 8.5 million of the 10.5 million
pensioners have their pension paid into a bank account, while only 2
million have opted for payment through POCA. As a result of the
dramatic advances in technology in recent years, we have seen
unprecedented changes in the communications and banking industries. As
we all know, for many people text messaging, the internet and e-mail
have become part of their everyday lives, virtually replacing
traditional written communications. People, young and old alike,
increasingly use phone or internet banking, cash-point machines or
direct debits to pay their

trends that I have mentioned are having a pronounced effect on the
levels of demand for social and personal mail services, for bill
payments and for licensing transactions at post offices. Motor vehicle
licensing is going through a period of rapid change. Last year there
were 860,000 renewals online, and this year online renewals are running
at an annual rate of about 3 million. There can be no turning back the
clock&#151;although that is not to underplay the fact that Royal Mail
has moved from losing &#163;1 million a day a few years ago to
profitability under the leadership of Mr. Allan Leighton and
his board. That has been achieved through the hard work and dedication
of its work force throughout the
country.</p><p><a name="0610167000378">We all have to
accept, and work with, the fact that changing lifestyles and modern
technology have clearly changed the market in which sub-post offices
operate. It is too often forgotten that the post office network
operates in a commercial marketplace. The services that the network
provides, including lottery tickets, foreign currency, telephony, bill
payments and financial services, are in direct competition with other
retailers and providers. There have, of course, also been some very
notable successes in certain areas, such as foreign currency: the Post
Office is now the UK&#146;s number one provider of foreign exchange
services, with 12 million transactions last year. It is also the
largest independent provider of travel insurance, with 1 million
policies sold annually.</p><br>

of supporting it also leaves it vulnerable to leaner organisations.
Although the number of post offices has been reducing for decades,
there are still 14,300 branches, which is almost more post offices than
all the major banks and building societies combined. By way of
contrast, Tesco, the most successful retailer in the country, has a

Post Office Ltd supports in rural areas alone. As the Postcomm report
recognises, a large part of the network is making a loss and is being
supported by the social network payment&#151;it is worth &#163;750
million over the five years to 2008&#151;for uncommercial rural
offices.</p><p><a name="0610167000386">Maintaining
a network of such size is hugely expensive and the cost is rising: Post
Office Ltd expects to lose &#163;4 million every week
during the current financial year. The reality is that too many offices
are chasing too few customers to be viable. The smallest 20 per cent.
of rural offices&#151;some 1,600 branches&#151;serve fewer than 100
customers a week and generate an average loss of almost &#163;8 every
time one of those customers does business such as buying a stamp. The
800 smallest offices, which have an average of 16 customers a week,
lose &#163;17 on each transaction. Over one third of business in the
rural network is done in the largest 10 per cent. of
branches.</p><p><a name="0610167000387">There are
some 6,500 rural social branches, which lose around &#163;150 million
a year. While these branches represent 45 per cent. of the network in
total, they account for less than 7 per cent. of overall income. Having
too many branches with too few customers is clearly the root of the
problem across much of the network, so we need to strike a balance
between meeting and funding the reasonable needs of people who rely on
the post office, and making prudent use of taxpayers&#146; funds, on
which there are competing
calls.</p><p><a name="0610167000388"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew233"><a name="0610167000682">Mr.

that we need to take some tough decisions. Because they will be tough,
we have to be as sure as we can be that they are right ones, but I want
the House to be absolutely clear that the Government&#146;s forward
strategy will continue to support the network to ensure that post
office services will be maintained in rural or vulnerable communities,
where they fulfil a key social and economic role and help to combat
financial and social exclusion. We shall also seek to ensure that
services are delivered as efficiently as possible and, where

again today the concerns about the Post Office card account, but we
must recognise that even before the Department for Work and
Pensions&#146; decision to make payment into account the normal way
for people to receive their entitlement, almost half of recipients had
already made their own choice to have their pension or benefit paid
into a bank
account.</p><p><a name="0610167000405">The Post
Office card account is one of 25 different accounts that can be used to
access benefit and pension money over the post office counter. Every
bank, and the Nationwide building society, has at least a basic bank
account that can be accessed in any post office. Some 70 per cent. of
Post Office card account customers already have a bank account, and 20
million people could access benefits at a post office. However, only 10
per cent. of those people do
so.</p><p><a name="0610167000406">The
Post Office card account contract runs until 2010, and its successor is
still being decided. As Alan Cook, the managing director of
Post Office Ltd, said of the Post Office card account at the Treasury
Select Committee inquiry into financial inclusion on 9 May
2006:</p><p><a name="0610167000407">&#147;You
cannot do much with it at all, you go to a post office, you take the
cash out. If you take too much out by mistake you cannot put any back
in. It literally is an encashment vehicle. I think we can produce a
card account that has more capability, which would enable you to access
cash in different ways and pay bills. I believe that would be a big
step forward for current customers that we regard as socially excluded
who do not wish to make, for whatever reason, the bigger step towards
taking out a current account. We could produce a successor

Post Office Ltd is working on new products with significantly greater

to benefit payment issues, the future of the Post Office is clearly a
significant cross-cutting issue for the Government, with a number of

had a clear duty to act in the interests of licence fee payers and to
ensure value for money for the public. It rightly put the process out
to competitive tender, and Post Office Ltd was undercut by a

the Post Office, are urgently looking at strengthening the competitive
position of the Post Office in ways that remain compatible with its
social obligations. What people must recognise is that the huge costs
associated with supplying cash, IT, marketing and training to such a
large bricks-and-mortar network make it increasingly difficult for Post
Office Ltd to compete commercially and effectively for Government and
other business when faced with lower-cost competitors. We continue to
look for ways in which we can use the network, but it is the duty of a
responsible Government to provide services in a way that gives the
public a choice of how to access them, and offers value for
money.</p><br>

the subject of Post Office Ltd, my key message to the House is that the
Government recognise the scale of the challenges facing the network.
They recognise the important social and economic role that post offices
play, particularly in rural and deprived urban communities, and they
recognise that where post offices playing that role can never become
commercially viable, there will be a continued need for public funding
to ensure the provision of Post Office services. We are listening to,
and understand, the concerns of sub-postmasters and others.</p><p><a name="0610167000420">For the Royal
Mail the Government&#146;s ambition, as set out in our manifesto, is
to see a publicly owned Royal Mail fully restored to good health,
providing customers with excellent services and its employees with
rewarding employment. Only a few years ago, as I mentioned earlier, the
Royal Mail had annual operating losses of &#163;318 million and the
quality of service was poor. The Government put in new management and
made available more than &#163;1 billion of finance facilities to
help turn the company around. In 2005-06 Royal Mail, as a group, had
operating profits of &#163;355 million. The quality of service had
been improved, with 94.1 per cent. of first class post being delivered
the next day and 10 of its 15 licensed targets being met. Quality of
services remains the company&#146;s top
priority.</p><p><a name="0610167000421">That
could not have been achieved without a willing, able and dedicated work
force. It is right that employees should be rewarded for their part in
that turnaround. They received more than &#163;1,000 each following
the successful completion of the renewal plan in 2005 and more than
&#163;400 this year. Working conditions for employees have also been
improved during this period, with the introduction of a five-day
working week and many sorting offices being provided with IT equipment
to provide remote learning opportunities for staff. The
company&#146;s range of policies and programmes have been redesigned
to help and empower female employees, and it has been recognised as
among the top 50 places where women want to
work.</p><p><a name="0610167000422">Royal
Mail still has several challenges to face. The postal services market
has been fully liberalised since 1 January 2006. Royal Mail
has had to become more efficient to enable it to compete in such a
market. One of its main rivals is already piloting end-to-end services.
Added to that, Royal Mail has had to tackle its pension fund deficit,
which stood at &#163;5.6 billion at the end of March
2006.</p><p><a name="0610167000423"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew249"><a name="0610167000698">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> As someone who was a
member of the Committee that considered the Postal Services Act 2000,
may I ask whether the Minister accepts that one our arguments during
those proceedings was about the relative unfairness of the Royal Mail
alone having to meet the cost of the universal service obligation?
Other companies that come into the marketplace should also be required
to meet the obligation, especially if they intend to offer a national
service. Are the Government examining that
matter?</p><p><a name="0610167000424"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew250"><a name="0610167000699">Jim

business strategy that will transform the business over the next five
years. It involves the introduction and deployment of new sorting
equipment and more efficient ways of working, and the rationalisation
of the mail pipeline. That will need investment, and the Government are
prepared to put in place the finance required to achieve that
transformation. The Secretary of State set out the proposed finance
framework that was agreed in principle with Royal Mail in his written
statement to the House on 18 May. The measures in the framework allow
the company to stabilise the pension deficit and give it the funds that
it needs to transform the business.</p><p><a name="0610167000426">The detail of the finance
framework has not yet been finalised. The documentation is being drawn
up, but, most importantly, the company and the Government need to agree
on how the work force should be incentivised to deliver the
transformation. The Royal Mail board has made it clear that it strongly
believes that an employee share scheme is the best way to do that, and
has submitted a proposal. The Government are prepared to consider
options for incentivising employees in Royal Mail, including an
employee share scheme in the context of a publicly owned business,
under which shares would be held in a trust for the benefit of
employees, and could not be transferred to
non-employees.</p><p><a name="0610167000427">The
motion states that the delay in finalising the finance framework is
damaging Royal Mail. In reply, I would say to Liberal Democrat Members
that although the finance framework is not yet in place, the company
has been preparing for the implementation of its strategy and has made
other operational changes to improve its efficiency. It has not been in
a state of paralysis. The Government are actively considering Royal
Mail&#146;s proposals, but will not be pushed into making decisions
without a thorough examination of the proposals that have been put to
us. I understand that that is called due diligence in the business
world. It would not be right for the Government, who are entrusted with
looking after the taxpayers&#146; shareholding in Royal Mail, not to
carry out proper due diligence before making an informed
decision.</p><p><a name="0610167000428">The
Government strongly believe that Royal Mail can compete in a fully
liberalised market and meet its obligations to provide a universal
postal service. A successful Royal Mail is good for the shareholder,
the management, the employees, the taxpayer and the UK as a
whole.</p><p><a name="0610167000429">In
both the post office network and Royal Mail, the endeavours of both the
Government and the businesses will ultimately depend for their success,
as ever, on the skills, dedication and sheer hard work of
sub-postmasters and employees, which we often tend to take for granted,
but which should never be underestimated or overlooked. As my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made clear, we are determined to
give the post office the certainty that it needs by putting the network
on a long-term stable footing. We are equally determined to continue to
help Royal Mail on its way forward. I commend the amendment to the

Crozier has said, Royal Mail could fulfil its legal obligations with
just 4,000 branches. When the Labour party came to office, there were
almost 20,000 branches, but despite repeated manifesto pledges to keep
post offices open, there are now only about 14,000. Under the Labour
Government, a quarter of the network has disappeared, and the cuts fall
hardest on the most vulnerable in our society.</p><p><a name="06101618000007">Of course,
the reason that post offices are closing is that many are losing money.
Despite the subsidy that the Government hand to Royal Mail each year,
the network still loses over &#163;100 million a year. The majority
of rural post offices have a very small customer base&#151;1,000 of
them have fewer than 50 customers per week. Much of the change from
profit to loss in recent years is due, as we have been discussing
today, to declining income from transactions that relate directly to
Government.</p><p><a name="06101618000008">Post
offices used to be the only place that a range of services could be
accessed, but times have changed and they are changing fast. People now
pay their bills online, they have their benefits paid directly into a
bank account, TV licences are no longer available from a post office,
and people can even print stamps to put directly on the items that they
want to post. These developments cannot be reversed. What is missing
from the debate is any clear Government strategy for the role that our
post offices should fulfil, because the Government do not appear to
have one. That is why two post offices have closed every working day
under this
Government.</p><p><a name="06101618000009">One of the
things that is keeping post offices open is the Post Office card
account. POCA is a very simple form of account, into which only benefit
payments can be made. Over 4 million people use such accounts and the
average post office branch has 355 customers a week collecting their
benefits through the scheme. The Government&#146;s decision to
abolish it is one of the

transactions are responsible for 10 per cent. of a
sub-postmaster&#146;s net pay. The National Federation of
Sub-Postmasters has said it believes that this decision</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_15"><a name="06101618000123"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will close thousands of post

million people calling for the Post Office card account to be
saved.</p><p><a name="06101618000011">Even before
the card is officially withdrawn, the Government have been trying to
encourage benefit recipients to move from claiming their benefits in
person at their local post office, for which the branch receives a
payment, to having the benefit paid directly into their bank account.
It is clear that the Government&#146;s decision to abolish the
account poses a major threat not just to rural post offices, but to
urban ones, which in many cases matter just as much. To make matters
worse, the Government have not clarified what they intend to do to
ensure that benefit recipients continue to receive a decent service at
their local post office. If that is confusing for elderly benefit
recipients, they should look at the economics of the
POCA.</p><p><a name="06101618000012"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew256"><a name="06101618000140">Mr.
Weir:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the situation is
worse than that? In many rural areas the banks moved out many years ago
and there is no alternative to a post office, so when people no longer
have access to POCA or a post office, they will end up paying more of
their money to get their own money out of ATMs, if they exist, or to go
into the local town by public transport, if that exists, to get their
money.</p><p><a name="06101618000013"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew257"><a name="06101618000141">Mr.
Duncan:</b> Yes, there is a problem of rural isolation all
over the country&#151;in Scotland, and even to some extent in my own
constituency. Essentially, people who do not have a car are stranded.
Some might say that people have to go to shop for food, and if they can
go to Sainsbury&#146;s they can find their way to a post office.
However, that is not always true for the elderly at the time that they
need to go to get their money. There are growing problems of rural
deprivation. The modern world is leaving in a state of isolation a lot
of people who cannot go as fast and as actively as many of
us.</p><p><a name="06101618000014">The Government
claim that it costs &#163;1 to pay into a POCA and only a penny to
pay into a bank account, but Ministers have repeatedly refused to
answer questions about the financial arrangements behind the scheme, so
the real costs of the POCA remain unclear. The card account is hugely
important to people who do not have bank accounts and at least 1
million of our most vulnerable people cannot get a bank account. They
may have been in prison or do not have the necessary credit
rating&#151;there are many reasons. Such people are heavily, if not
entirely, dependent on the POCA. Furthermore, the account is a vital
source of revenue for post offices. If the Government choose to replace
it only with a limited, targeted scheme, that may help those without a
bank account. However, the financial cost to post offices will still be
great. As the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir
Robert Smith) said, this is an urgent matter and decisions need to be
taken now. If such a process is already in train by the time that we
hope to be in government, the danger is that there will be nothing left
for us to reverse. The solution is not to abolish the

Here, at least, we have a lot of overlap and agreement between the

secure its future and that of individual post office branches by
letting them open up to new markets, and new customers, with new
products.

Indeed, it is why we have been calling on the Government to rewrite
sub-postmasters&#146; contracts to allow them to act as agents for
other businesses, including private mail services. Just as many pubs
that were tied to one brewery are now free houses, so post offices
should be released from their ties and made able to offer a broader
range of services. The post office network plays an essential role in
combating financial exclusion. If that role is to be preserved, the
Government need to take urgent steps to give sub-post offices freedom
to gain the new business that they so desperately
need.</p><p><a name="06101618000021">Conservative

in the main Chamber and that is good. The timing is especially
appropriate given the huge lobby on Wednesday by the National
Federation of Sub-Postmasters. It will not only take place in the name
of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, but is supported by
Citizens Advice, the National Pensioners Convention, the National

criticism. However, I believe that he genuinely has the interests of
all those who use the Post Office card account at heart. He is doing
his best within a machinery, which, as any of us who has been in
government knows, cannot always do exactly what one would like. He has
done his best and he has spoken to the all-party group on sub-post
offices. However, I hope that we will get some definitive answers. I
blame the Department for Work and Pensions for much of the mess because
it devised the method of changing the way in which benefits were paid.
The Minister who introduced the change left the Department when it was
being implemented and is now in a different guise.</p><p><a name="06101618000024">For me, the main issues are
choice and the valuable service that the Post Office provides

a huge hole in the community that the post office serves and the
provision of social benefits there. We want to find ways in which to
prevent
that.</p><p><a name="06101618000025">I

some of the programmes that it broadcasts and the way in which it has

would have some concrete answers by the autumn. I know that the
Minister has been advised that the autumn will carry on until 12
December&#151;or even 21 December&#151;but it would be helpful to
get the answers earlier than that. Many people do not realise that most
sub-post offices are small businesses run by private individuals making
investment decisions, and that they need to know the framework in which
they are operating. They therefore need to know the Government&#146;s
mind on these matters, when so much now depends on Government
decisions. Postcomm has also challenged the Government to recognise
that.</p><p><a name="06101618000052">Last week, it
was a matter of concern to hon. Members when the Leader of the House
stated at business questions that the collapse of the postal market was
a problem for the Post Office. Actually, the postal market is doing
quite well at the moment. He talked about the internet and e-mail, but
internet trading is resulting in the postage of a lot more packages and
parcels. One of the social inclusion issues that is possibly not being
properly addressed is the future role of the Post Office in receiving
parcels and handling the postage of items for special delivery. The
universal service obligation appears to require only about 4,000 post
offices. A great deal of the debate about the future of the rural post
office network has been about access to benefits and to the means to
pay bills. However, if those other services are not there to support
the post office, and the post office closes, the access to the postal
network, to commercial transactions and to cash for small businesses
will also go. The wider benefits of maintaining the network are
therefore extremely important.</p><p><a name="06101618000053">The most
disappointing aspect of the way in which the BBC made its recent
decision is that it did not take all its licence payers into
consideration. It has said that PayPoint is a replacement for the post
office for those who still want to pay for their television licence in
person. However, it has not taken into consideration how sparse the
PayPoint network is in rural areas. Its decision has therefore greatly
restricted access for licence payers in those areas. The BBC should
have used its imagination to work with the Post Office to develop a
rural product that would allow people to continue to access the same
service in rural areas to which it believes its urban licence payers
are entitled. The BBC needs to look again at that
decision.</p><p><a name="06101618000054"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew276"><a name="06101618000160">Mr.

assurances on how many of its branches would remain open. That relates

a village, which has no shop or bank, loses its post office, it has
lost everything. The same, however, applies in many urban areas. In my
urban constituency, Chesterfield, whether in a large housing estate or
the former pit villages of Poolsbrook and Duckmanton, residents who
lose their post office and are told that they can catch the bus to
Chesterfield or Staveley town centre might not actually have a good bus

be delivered to them. Therefore, its protection must be at the heart of
how Royal Mail is treated by both the regulator and the Government. I
urge the Government to take on board the point about ensuring that that
service can be delivered and is not watered down. If collection comes
before delivery in a particular area, there is no way to turn mail
around on the same day. The protection of that universal service is
vital and requires effective funding of Royal Mail and a recognition of
how much Royal Mail has done to try to address the challenges of
competition, how much the work force have done, and how much the work
force deserve to be awarded and recognised for what they have done. A
trustee share ownership scheme, in which shares are owned for the
benefit of the work force and cannot be distributed outside that
scheme, seems an excellent way of thanking the work force for what they
have achieved and rewarding them further as the company continues to
build and take on competition.</p><p><a name="06101618000062"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew282"><a name="06101618000166">Michael

David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I welcome the opportunity
to take part in this debate. I have taken careful note of the recent
exchange, as I shall no doubt refer to the points made.</p><p><a name="06101618000066">The debate is opportune, with
the lobby on Wednesday, to which I am sure that some of my
sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses will come to talk to me. We have
had the Postcomm document, which is an interesting read&#151;it is
rather long on analysis, but not so helpful on how matters can be taken
forward. Nevertheless, it is a detailed document containing a lot of
useful information, and I hope that the Government will respond to it
formally in due course. Other reports have come forward, such as the
recent Age Concern report, which highlights the importance of sub-post
offices in rural and urban communities. As I represent what I call a
semi-rural constituency, I see the implications for both.</p><p><a name="06101618000067">The debate is also opportune
because I had the good fortune to meet some of my parish councils and
sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in Bisley in my constituency,
and we discussed all the issues that have been raised today. The
Minister was saying that sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were
becoming more optimistic, but, without mentioning any names, that was
not necessarily the view that I heard from those who were present,
several of whom were either in the process of trying to sell or had
already sold their post offices. Later, I shall refer to one glowing
example of how things can be turned round. The post office concerned,
in a small village community, has shown that it can move
forward.</p><p><a name="06101618000068">What should
we be doing? Certainly, we should not be privatising Royal Mail as the
motion suggests. That is the worst possible way forward, and I share
with my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael
Connarty) support for the CWU. It is the worst way forward for two
clear reasons. First, how will taking away one of the network&#146;s
most profitable parts, Royal Mail, help that network? Secondly, how can
we then expect the Royal Mail to bail out that network? I do not know
much about business and competition, but I would have thought that the
one thing that that new organisation would not feel any obligation
about would be moving more business towards the post office network, as
it would be in direct competition with it.</p><p><a name="06101618000069">Some would
allege that that has been one of the problems with the business. In
recent times, there has never really been an attempt to co-ordinate the
three parts of the business. We saw that under the last Government, and
sadly my own party has not done enough to bring Parcelforce, Royal Mail
and Post Office Ltd together so that a wonderful organisation can be
used properly. I remind Members that that organisation is held in the
highest esteem, as has been demonstrated by opinion poll after opinion
poll. People trust the Post Office. If politicians received some of the
ratings that it has received, they might feel a little more confident
on returning to their
constituencies.</p><p><a name="06101618000070">I

some of the debris. But although some may want us to think that

the community are the answer, it would be helpful if the banking system
itself recognised the advantages of the postal network rather than
seeing it merely as a
competitor.</p><p><a name="06101618000071">Time
after time, I am told that if only all the banks would use post offices
in the rural network as an opportunity for people to obtain money, we
would begin to see them acting as I should like them to
act&#151;altruistically. Sadly, however, because they have had basic
bank accounts foisted on them with their arms forced up their backs,
they are taking their revenge by making it clear that they will offer
the most limited service possible in post offices. That is wrong,
unfair and
unsustainable.</p><p><a name="06101618000072">I hope
that we shall see some new developments. Alan Cook has been quite
impressed by the way in which the new savings bank has embarked on its
link with the Allied Irish bank, which has begun to take hold and is
doing well&#151;again, in the face of stiff competition from the rest
of the banking network. Foreign exchange business has been a boon to
the Post Office, as has the reselling of premium bonds. It may seem
very old-fashioned, but in this day and age it gives people security,
and there is nothing wrong with
that.</p><p><a name="06101618000073">I challenged my

may I raise another issue? My hon. Friend talks as though competition
were a good thing, and I am sure that others will make the same point.
Does he remember when &#147;power cards&#148; were taken away from
post offices and&#151;at least in my area&#151;introduced in petrol
stations? The service then collapsed. Now PayPoint has taken over the
payment of television licences. I believe&#151;because we have not
been told the facts&#151;that it is being used as a cost-cutter, to
undercut and attack the post office network and ensure that PayPoint
becomes the only option in town. What guarantee can we have that once
it has won the business from the Post Office, it will continue to
deliver it in a suitable fashion that benefits the customer? We have
heard about the difficulties in rural
areas.</p><p><a name="06101618000075"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew286"><a name="06101618000170">Mr.

not go into the case to which my hon. Friend alludes, but I will say
something about the BBC and PayPoint. I do not intend to dwell on this
for long, but it has not been mentioned so far. In many places PayPoint
does not exist, and, like my hon. Friend the Member for South
Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), I have evidence that post offices
that have tried to open it have been prevented from doing so. Worse,
they have been prevented in the very areas where pensioners in
particular need a point of access to television licences. I heard what
my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said about people
having a justifiable reason for not obtaining licences. I will not go
down that route, but I will say that unless it is guaranteed that
people will be able to obtain television licences in all the areas
where they could do so by means of the old service, by definition the
service has been degraded and has
deteriorated.</p><p><a name="06101618000076"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew287"><a name="06101618000171">Julia

people that the nearest service is only a couple of miles away, there
is often no bus service to the neighbouring village. A trip to buy a
television licence at the nearest PayPoint may therefore involve a
significantly longer journey than is being
suggested.</p><p><a name="06101618000077"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew288"><a name="06101618000172">Mr.

the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), I have my own problems with the
BBC at the moment, although for slightly different reasons; but I issue
this challenge. If the BBC cannot prove that it can offer at least the
same quality of service, it must take some pretty drastic action in
respect of the organisation to which it has offered the contract. That
contract is not acceptable: it represents a deterioration, and it will
cost the BBC dear because it will accrue less revenue
subsequently.</p><p><a name="06101618000078">In a
sense, I have already poured cold water on the role of banking. I have
doubts about the idea that we are recreating a banking network,
although I wish that we were. My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the
problems with competition, and, as I have said, the Post Office has
made some moves in that direction. But another issue has not been
mentioned, although it is very important, particularly to the 2 million
Post Office card account holders&#151;a figure given to me by the
Post Office&#151;who are unlikely to be able to draw their money in
other ways. I think that credit union opportunities should be linked to
the savings that we could make. Everyone who would like access to a
credit union should be able to do so through the network. Problems are
identified too often, and this would be a good solution. After people
had drawn their cash by means of whatever follows the Post Office card
account&#151;a similar arrangement, I hope&#151;they could save
through credit unions. That would provide all the advantages that the
socially excluded do not currently have, and we ignore it at our
peril.</p><p><a name="06101618000079">Let me make a
point about the changing nature of the network. When people talk to me
about sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, I sometimes hear
criticism of what they are trying to do. I only wish that more people
understood what some of them run their businesses on. It is all well
and good for us to say that they run an unprofitable business; at
national level that means that millions of pounds are unfortunately
going in the wrong direction, but it also means that the people who are
trying to run the business are doing so for a very small return. That
is the problem with the &#163;150 million so-called rural subsidy.
Very little of the money actually reaches the sub-postmasters and
sub-postmistresses: it is off the bottom of the accounts, so to speak.
Some of it, admittedly&#151;although very little&#151;is intended
to help reorientate businesses, and some is intended to encourage
people to change the nature of their
businesses.</p><p><a name="06101618000080">The
business that I said I would mention is a very small post office,
Oakridge, in my constituency. The idea was to reorientate it by moving
it to a different site, investing in an internet caf&#233; linked to
an advice centre and arranging meetings there. Michael and Kim
Gorney&#151;Kim is the postmistress&#151;were able to take
advantage of rural renaissance funds, but it is interesting to note how
many hurdles they have had to negotiate. The project is

story, but it demonstrates that things can be done if the attitude is
right.</p><p><a name="06101618000081">In many
villages, however, there will be no private-enterprise solution. The
only solution will be some form of social enterprise. In my view, the
organisation that should be key to that in rural areas is the parish or
town council. I declare an interest: I am still a town councillor. My
town council bought the post office, so we have some expertise in
keeping them going. There was a threat that the post office would leave
the premises where it had been for many a year. The position is
different in other areas, though. When I went to Bisley, I challenged
the parish and town councils to have regular meetings with
sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses to establish whether there were
services that they could provide jointly through the postal network.
Again, that is not the basis of the entire solution, but it should
help.</p><p><a name="06101618000082">If we are
sensible about how the common agricultural policy should be funded
under pillar two&#151;with money finding its way into rural service
provision, which is a good thing&#151;we have to find similar ways of
matching local initiative with available money. Parish and town
councils can, through the famous 3p on the rates, find some money, but
we also need to lock in national money, as in the case of the CAP and
the operations of the central Government.</p><p><a name="06101618000083">I finish by emphasising that we
need security, so the network must be supported, and also stability in
that people must know exactly where their businesses are going. We need
to recognise that the role of the state is crucial: there is no
alternative.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61016-0004.htmordayhd_8"><a name="06101618000132">6.31

sub-post offices, of which there are many in my constituency. Last
week, I was pleased to meet representatives of the National Federation
of Sub-Postmasters in Wales. We are, of course, talking about people
working in the private sector, but we all acknowledge the importance of
their adhering to the highest standards of public service. It was clear
from talking to them that they are worried about the uncertainty of
their investment decisions and the value of their businesses, which
often are their retirement pensions.</p><p><a name="06101618000085">The Minister provided something
of an answer to those worries when he said implicitly that there were
too many branches and too many sub-post offices: what that does for the
social functions of the sub-post office, I do not know. Clearly,
sub-postmasters and mistresses have their worries. Rural sub-post
offices act as focal points for the community in paying pensions and
benefits and providing other services. In some places, sub-post offices
provide only a limited range of goods, but in others sub-postmasters
and mistresses have taken the bull by the horns and provide a
surprisingly wide range of vital, if low-key, goods and services. Many
of those services would not be viable without the post office element.
If that element goes, we face the closure not only of sub-post offices
but of vital small businesses in rural areas.</p><p><a name="06101618000086">There are multiplier effects,
as people using the sub-post office to collect pensions or benefits are
more likely to spend locally, and a pound spent locally tends

the pilot schemes that operate at present&#151;it will be interesting
to see how that reads in <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow&#151;but what I see
in my constituency is a van that visits for just an hour or two.
Before, the sub-post office was open all day, all week, so the effect
of the changes can be clearly seen, as the pilot schemes will show when
the results are published. The closures have also forced people into
their cars, but I am not going to pursue all the green issues this
evening, as I want to keep my remarks

that the hon. Gentleman will pay tribute, as I do, to the Post Office

rural areas. We have also seen some innovative schemes, using village
halls and other facilities. Even with the support that the Government
now provide to rural post offices, 1,200 of them have closed in the
past six years. That shows the scale of the problem, and many more will
close unless the Government continue to provide support on a similar
scale.</p><p><a name="06101618000089"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew291"><a name="06101618000175">Hywel

hon. Gentleman will also know that while cars are a costly luxury in
cities, they are a necessity&#151;sometimes even two to a
household&#151;in his and my constituency. The coincidence in Wales
of high car ownership and low wages is not surprising, particularly in
rural areas such as ours. If local services disappear, we shall face
rural depopulation&#151;an issue that fails to secure the attention

is very convenient for the DVLA, which fails to advertise the fact that
the duty can be paid through the Post Office&#151;a method convenient
to customers. What comes first here: the customer or the DVLA? Clearly,
it is the DVLA. Many people do not want to divulge information over the
phone or down the line. It is a small point, but it is symptomatic of
the corrosive effect of uncertainty on the morale of sub-postmasters.
That was certainly the impression that I gained. People want to provide

deal briefly with the Post Office card account, which has been

That is the measure of the impact on my constituency with 3,960
pensioners and 7,810 people in all, as I said. I also have a list to
demonstrate the effect on other constituencies in Wales. I noted, for
example, that 14,810 people use the POCA in Merthyr Tydfil and
Rhymney&#151;probably the poorest constituency in Wales apart from
that of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr.
Davies), which also has a high level of card use. If the POCA is to go,
we must have a replacement. The Minister referred to one earlier, but
if we are to have a proper replacement, it should be possible to use
the Link system. I am concerned that the banks are closing out the Post
Office, which is anti-competitive.</p><p><a name="06101618000094">Finally, will the Minister
clarify what Government Departments are doing individually to promote
the Post Office in bringing services closer to people in rural areas?
There is huge potential for using new technology in such areas. What is
being done to support post offices in providing facilities such as
face-to-face interviews for passport applications, for example? If we
are to proceed in that direction, individual postmasters have to take
decisions now. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point in

automated council tax, gas, water and electricity payments, are being
cut from 11.2p to 7p per transaction? What about the DVLA? Surely much
more could be done to ensure that its service is firmly entrenched
within post offices and sub-post offices. That is vital in terms of
supporting businesses in post offices and sub-post
offices.</p><p><a name="06101618000103"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew295"><a name="06101618000179">Mr.

there are obstacles in the path of post offices that want to try to
reopen. There are some bright spots. In a village called Syderstone in
my constituency, there is a rotating sub-postmaster who is operating
from the village hall, which shows imagination and initiative. I am all
for that. However, the vast majority of those small post offices and
their sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are hanging on by their
fingertips. There is huge uncertainty. I do not believe that the future
has ever been more uncertain or more bleak. What we need from the
Minister is not empty rhetoric but action today, because not just
thousands of sub-post offices are at risk. We are talking about tens of
thousands of people who work in sub- post offices. We are talking about
hundreds of thousands of people, particularly vulnerable groups such as
the elderly and disabled, whose lives are being put at risk. Their
quiet enjoyment of village life in constituencies such as mine will be
put at risk if post offices close, because they are the centre of those
villages.</p><p><a name="06101618000116">As we have

south Manchester have seen at first hand the damage that the Government
have inflicted on the network.</p><p><a name="06101618000118">In recent years, the post
office network in Manchester, Withington, has been devastated by the
closure of a number of sub-post offices across the constituency,
including Beech Road post office in Chorlton, Burton Road post office
in west Didsbury, Mauldeth Road West in Withington, Barlow Moor Road in
Didsbury, and Parrs Wood Road in east Didsbury. More recently, Chorlton
Crown post office was privatised&#151;a decision made by Post Office
Ltd without any consultation about the sell-off. It is outrageous that
the Post Office can make such a decision to franchise post offices on
purely commercial grounds, and that it need consult local people only
on what services will be provided, and on at what times the post office
will be open. Meanwhile, the Government stand idly by and refuse to
intervene.</p><p><a name="06101618000119">I draw

a stop to that, we will be lucky to have any Crown post offices left.
It is worth noting, too, that a number of Crown post offices that have
been franchised have quickly closed. We need to ask ourselves why those
sub-post offices are closing, and why Crown post offices are being sold
off, thereby damaging the future of the network. The answer is fairly
straightforward: Government policy is systematically undermining the
viability of the post office network. The post office reinvention
programme should have been called the post office closure programme,
because, effectively, that is all it did. Like the hon. Member for
Stroud (Mr. Drew), I do not blame
sub-postmasters.</p><p><a name="06101618000120"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew306"><a name="06101618000190">Mr.

post offices but do little other than systematically remove business
from them. As a result, it is increasingly difficult for sub-post
offices to secure a long-term future. Similarly, it has been made more
difficult for Crown post offices to be profitable in future. Post
Office bosses admitted to me that one reason that they chose to
privatise Chorlton post office was that the Government&#146;s
decision to end the Post Office card account in 2010 will remove more
and more business. Some sub-postmasters have suggested that the end of
the Post Office card account will effectively be the final nail in the
coffin. In Chorlton in my constituency, Merseybank estate is among the
top 5 per cent. most deprived areas. The sub-postmaster there says that
he has serious concerns that if the Post Office card account ends in
2010, he will not be able to make a living. It will be a major blow not
only to him, but to all the people who collect their money at the post
office through the POCA, and who use that money in the few remaining
shops in the area. Those shops will face closure if the post office is
closed.</p><p><a name="06101618000122">If the
Government really believe that post offices play an important role in
local communities, why have they systematically deprived them of

matters.</p><p><a name="06101620000002">I wonder how
we have reached this position on rural sub-post offices&#151;and,
indeed, urban sub-post offices. We thought that we had won the battle
in 2002, and that we had finally decided the future of the post office
network for a generation. Certainly, no intimation was given that the
Post Office card account was a temporary arrangement that would be
removed after the contract had ended. As many hon. Members have said,
we are concerned about the uncertainty that the network faces. I shall
return to that in a moment, but having heard what the Minister said, I
fear that that uncertainty is becoming the certainty that many of our
smaller post offices will be
lost.</p><p><a name="06101620000003">I
heard what the Post Office said about closing a very large number of
post offices, and I heard, too, what the Minister said today. He cited
with approbation a lady from Crewkerne in Somerset&#151;a town not
far from my constituency&#151;who said that people think that they
want post offices, but in fact they do not. What an insult to the
postmasters and postmistresses across the country who know perfectly
well how much communities value their post offices, and what an insult
to the 3 million, perhaps 4 million, people who signed the national
petition. What an insult to the people who put their name to the
petition that I presented to the House just before the
recess, and which was signed by more than half the residents in the
village of Nunney. In addition, the Minister seemed to
suggest that the customers were the wrong sort of customers. He
suggested that we lived in inconvenient places, and that we persist in
living in small villages where there are not enough people to use the
post office. I am sorry, but that is the way we live, and that is why
we want a service for the people whom we represent in our villages. It
will not always be the most efficient arrangement, but it is a social
good, and that is what the Government must
recognise.</p><p><a name="06101620000004">Earlier,
the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) appeared to make a
concession, when he suggested that there would be a range of products,
whatever that means, to succeed the Post Office card account. We do not
want a range of products&#151;we want the Post Office card account,
and we want a simple mechanism to enable people to go to the post
office and collect their pension or benefits in cash. Ministers may
have forgotten, but that is how many people live their lives in this
country. They budget on a weekly basis with cash in hand; they do not
want a bank account, and they do not want to go overdrawn. They want
the opportunity to carry on as they have done&#151;yet there is the
threat of the end of the POCA contract, the loss of business from TV
and DVLA licences, and changes in tariff in respect of utilities. In
addition, the fact that the social network payment will end in March
2008 has caused uncertainty. The Minister cannot give us certainty on
any of those issues. As a result, people cannot make investment
decisions about their post offices. They cannot sell them, because no
one can go to a bank with an adequate business plan to secure the money
that is
needed.</p><p><a name="06101620000005"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew309"><a name="06101620000603">Greg

only for the people who want to use the post offices, but for the
communities in which those post offices are situated, because it is not
just post office services that are affected. When I presented my
petition on behalf of the people of Nunney, they pointed out that their
post office not only provides post office services, but offers dry
cleaning, sells tickets for the local pantomime, and provides a social
service for the elderly and infirm in the village. All those things
will be lost if we lose our sub-post offices. We have already lost the
Crown post offices, as my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester,

the Government do not care about it. I find no reassurance whatever in
a Cabinet committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, which is
supposed to be bringing things together. All the evidence is that

another huge blow, whether or not the BBC has been constrained by the
Government&#146;s failure to provide network guarantees. Why has the
Post Office not been allowed to bid for the 70 new passport centres?

Indeed, it is fair to say that the social network payment is on the
credit side of that equation. However, while that subsidy continues for
the moment, the progressive withdrawal of Government services is
fundamentally undermining the entire post office network. Postcomm
reported that Post Office Ltd has lost &#163;168 million of revenue

Many hon. Members have mentioned the Post Office card account, which is
worth &#163;1 billion to post offices over the term of the contract.
It is used by some 4.5 million people, who now face uncertainty. Some

because of them? He may have received in his constituency&#151;as I
have in mine&#151;constant anecdotal evidence of the Government
undermining, or trying to undermine, take-up of the card account; in
fact, it is the efforts of postmasters and postmistresses that have
made POCA such a

Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> Order. The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)
should try to leave some space between interventions&#151;this is
beginning to look more like Question
Time.</p><p><a name="06101620000028"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew320"><a name="06101620000614">Danny
Alexander:</b> That is something I have not yet had the
opportunity to take part in, but I hope that I will one
day.</p><p><a name="06101620000029">I agree with both
interventions. One of the reasons why POCA is so popular is that it is
a post office-based product; it is simple and easy to use. We now know
from an answer given earlier at Work and Pensions questions that people
will face multiple POCA options. In the light of the interventions made
during the debate, will the Minister guarantee that pressure will not
be applied to current POCA users about the option they should choose
when the change is made? There must be a free choice and people should
decide which option is best for them. If there is a repeat of what
happened when the pension book was taken away, when enormous pressure
was exerted through phone calls and mailings to persuade
pensioners&#151;against their better judgment in many cases&#151;to
move away from use of the post office, it will be a travesty of the
sentiments the Government have expressed
today.</p><p><a name="06101620000030">We have heard
about the television licence contract being taken away from post
offices, but the Minister&#146;s response is, &#147;It wasnae
me.&#148; Apparently it is not his fault but that of the BBC.
However, in a letter to me, Ms Pipa Doubtfire, the head of revenue
management at the BBC, gave the lie to the idea that Government policy
had no influence whatever on the decision. She said
that</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_21"><a name="06101620000593"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Post Office,
which now has fewer than 15,000 branches, could not give us any
assurance that its network would not continue to
decline&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101620000031">In other words,
if the Government had made a clear commitment to the long-term
viability of the network the BBC&#146;s decision might have been
different.</p><p><a name="06101620000032"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew321"><a name="06101620000615">Michael
Connarty:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
reply from the Post Office, it is clear to members of the Communication
Workers Union that those who run the Post Office, Mr.
Leighton and Mr. Crozier, have no interest in the
sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters network. The reply to which the
hon. Gentleman referred was made on behalf of people who have no
interest in that part of the network. They indicated to the BBC that
they could not guarantee that the network would not shrink, because
they do not actually care about it. Like the hon. Gentleman, I want the
Government to care about
it.</p><p><a name="06101620000033"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew322"><a name="06101620000616">Danny
Alexander:</b> I, too, want the Government to care about the
post office network, but my quotation was not from the Post Office but
from a representative of the BBC, which should also care about the
future of the post office
network.</p><p><a name="06101620000034">If the
Government had made a long-term commitment, the result might have been
different. In the meantime, people in the highlands and islands and
other rural areas sometimes face round trips of 50 or even 100 miles to
buy a TV licence, whereas before they could have gone to their local
village post office. One of my constituents received a letter telling
her the location 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="16 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="16" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>16 Oct 2006 : Column 650</b><br>of the nearest PayPoint. She lives in Gorthleck, on one side of Loch
Ness, and was told that the nearest place where she could collect her
TV licence was &#147;seven miles away&#148; in Drumnadrochit. The
letter failed to mention that the body of Loch Ness was between those
two locations, and the round trip would actually be about 80
miles.</p><p><a name="06101620000035">There is a huge
lack of joined-up government. We have heard that a Cabinet Committee
under the Deputy Prime Minister has been appointed to look into the
problem, and I wish it well. However, there is no real appreciation of
the value of post offices, especially those that serve rural and
deprived urban areas. In many such places, the post office is the only
access point for public services, where people can get access to cash
and other basic financial services and, indeed, experience basic
community interaction. The people who need those services
locally&#151;the elderly, the disabled and those without access to
transport&#151;will suffer most. It is no surprise that Age Concern
found that 99 per cent. of older people in rural areas consider their
local post office to be a lifeline
service.</p><p><a name="06101620000036">The
Government make the point that it is not worth continuing to support
post offices serving only a few people&#151;but in many cases those
are the people who need the service most. Like many Members, I too
conducted a tour of villages in my constituency during the summer, and
an old lady in the village of Tomatin, whose post office had closed
three months before, said that she was now expected to travel 15 miles
to Inverness to collect her pension. That may work when public
transport is running, or in the summer months when there is no snow and
ice on the roads, but in the winter it is almost impossible for her to
collect her pension using her
POCA.</p><p><a name="06101620000037">Before
Ministers kill off the so-called loss-making parts of the post office
network, they should reflect on research that shows that every pound
spent on rural post offices delivers &#163;4 in measurable social and
economic benefit to the communities that they serve. About
&#163;3.7 billion-worth of expenditure in rural communities is
directly facilitated by having a local post office as its anchor.
Closing post offices means closing local shops, increasing transport
costs for vulnerable groups and, in some cases, threatening the
long-term sustainability of the community as a
whole.</p><p><a name="06101620000038">The
Government&#146;s policy seems to be to allow the life of the post
office network to drain away rather than to kill it with a direct blow.
Perhaps it is a Blairite conspiracy to make the first decision on Prime
Minister Brown&#146;s desk the elimination of much of the post office
network&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Or Prime Minister
Hutton.</p><p><a name="06101620000039">Today, the
<i> Financial Times</i> said that the Government&#146;s plans, when
they are finally announced, will involve the closure of thousands of
post offices. When the Minister responds, will he confirm that? In his
earlier remarks, he said that the figure would not be 6,500 post
offices. As he knows what the figure will not be, will he tell us
whether the actual number will be, more or less? What will be the
import of his policy&#151;when it is finally
announced?</p><p><a name="06101620000040">Either
way, the British public deserve better. They deserve a full and open
debate, where the Government put their plans openly on the table and
people have a chance to comment on them. More than that, the British
people, 4 million of whom have signed petitions,

hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton said when he opened
the debate, the Liberal Democrats have set out a clear, coherent and
sensible plan for getting investment into post offices and the Royal
Mail. We are the only party to have done so today; for example, we have
not heard from the Conservatives what their policy would be.</p><p><a name="06101620000041">We need the Government to see
the broader social and economic value in a network of post offices
across the country; the post office is often the only official presence
in rural and deprived urban settings. We need to be willing to direct
more Government services through those outlets, not fewer. Post Offices
can help to decentralise services and allow direct engagement. They can
help promote financial inclusion and they can be the hub of their
communities. We need to end the spiral of decline in the post office
network in which this and previous Governments have connived. We must
provide investment to give hope to hard-pressed sub-postmasters and
postmistresses and to the communities they serve. By supporting the
motion the House will make it clear that thousands of post office
closures cannot, will not and must not be
tolerated.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61016-0004.htmordayhd_14"><a name="06101620000600">7.18

Fitzpatrick:</b> With the leave of the House, I will try to
respond to some of the points made during the debate and make some
concluding
remarks.</p><p><a name="06101620000043">The hon.
Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), among others,
asked about people who cannot use a bank account, or even open one. We
have said that there will be a new Government-funded product for people
who cannot pay into a bank account. There will be a successor to POCA
and the Department for Work and Pensions is negotiating about it. I
hope that also covers the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Vauxhall (Kate
Hoey).</p><p><a name="06101620000044">The hon. Member
for Rutland and Melton asked about the costs of POCA. He asked why
every payment made into a bank account costs the taxpayer 1p but every
payment into a POCA costs &#163;1. The difference is because it costs
only 1p to move money electronically from DWP systems to
customers&#146; bank accounts, while the POCA cost is &#163;1
because it includes payments to sub-postmasters, Post Office central
costs, marketing, call handling and call
centres.</p><p><a name="06101620000045">The hon.
Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) pointed
out that customers were worried that they might become overdrawn. The
17 basic bank accounts that can be used in post offices in the same way
as POCA do not have overdraft facilities. If that does not answer his
point exactly, I shall be happy to write to him if he wants to drop me
a note.</p><p><a name="06101620000046">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the universal service provision being
watered down. I can assure the House that the provision of the
universal postal service order remains at the heart of the
Government&#146;s policy. The Government enshrined it in legislation
for the first time that Postcomm&#146;s primary duty is to ensure the
provision of the universal postal service. It has defined the USO, and
where it proposes changes it is obliged to

fully into account. As the hon. Gentleman might know, at present it is
consulting on the concerns expressed on collection times, particularly
in rural areas.</p><p><a name="06101620000047">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) claimed that
sub-postmasters are prevented from having a PayPoint terminal in the
retail side of their business. There is no restriction on
sub-postmasters having a PayPoint terminal. I will drop him a line as
he does not appear to be in his place. He also asked about whether
there is a restriction on sub-postmasters providing a PayPoint terminal
at sub-post offices. There is no restriction on sub-postmasters having
a terminal, provided that the terminal is not used for transactions
categorised as key products and services. BBC licensing work has not,
and never has been, covered by that restriction.</p><p><a name="06101620000048">My hon.
Friend also asked about credit unions. Benefits and pensions can be
paid into credit union accounts. I think that he is aware that the
Government are investing &#163;36 million through the growth fund to
help credit unions grow, and I am sure that he supports that.</p><p><a name="06101620000049">The hon. Member for Manchester,
Withington (Mr. Leech) raised the question of a directly
managed, or Crown, network. Let me clarify that there are fewer than
500 directly managed, or Crown, branches in a network of more than
14,000. The rest&#151;some 97 per cent.&#151;are sub-post offices
that are already operated as franchises. Directly managed post offices
represent only 3 per cent. of the network, yet they made a loss of some
&#163;50 million last year alone, and losses are predicted to rise to
&#163;70 million this year. That is money that could be better used
for the benefit of customers, and it is absolutely right that Post
Office Ltd take action to find a more cost-effective way of providing
the main post office
service.</p><p><a name="06101620000050">The hon.
Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) claimed that Post Office Ltd was
prevented from bidding for the 70 passport authentication-by-interview
offices. The Post Office was not prevented from bidding. Having
reviewed what it could offer, the Post Office made the commercial
decision to withdraw from the tender process. However, the planned
interview offices will not take any existing business away from post
offices or offer any alternatives to the passport check-and-send
service available from selected post
offices.</p><p><a name="06101620000051">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)
said that I rejected the figure of 6,500 post offices in my earlier
comments. What I said&#151;I think the record will show
this&#151;is that I was not going to be tempted to make a comment on
any number, and 6,500 was one of those that I was not going to comment
on.</p><p><a name="06101620000052">The post office
network as it presently stands is unsustainable, and it must change to
meet today&#146;s needs. People are choosing to access services in
new ways, and to ignore that would be foolish. The Government recognise
the important role that post offices play in rural and deprived urban
communities, and, in drawing up our plans, we will take full account of
their needs.</p><p><a name="06101620000053">In response
to Members who accused the Government of abandoning or neglecting the
Post Office, the figures are clear and contradict that: &#163;2
billion has been invested since 1999, including &#163;550 million
invested in the Horizon

the &#163;150 million spent per annum in 2003 to 2008 to protect the
rural network. However, notwithstanding that investment, Post Office
Ltd lost &#163;2 million every week in 2005-06, and this year the
loss is expected to rise to &#163;4 million per week.</p><p><a name="06101620000054">Sub-postmasters
know the situation better than anyone, but even they recognise that
things have to change. We are working closely with them to deliver the
certainty that they are asking for: a long-term strategy that equips
the Post Office for the future. The post offices run a number of
experimental pilots. We discussed them earlier and I will not repeat
what was said. But the results are positive and they are being
examined.</p><p><a name="06101620000055">Changing
technology means that people are not using post offices as they once
did: 8.5 million pensioners&#151;out of 10.5 million&#151;now get
their state pensions paid into a bank account, and 98 per cent. of
people making new state pension claims have chosen to have that paid
directly into their bank, building society or post office account. An
increasing number of people choose to renew their tax disc
online&#151;&#151;more than 3 million people have done
that so far this year, compared with 860,000 in 2005. Nevertheless, the
Post Office still provides one of a number of ways in which the
Government can deliver services, and it still has an important role to
play.</p><p><a name="06101620000056">Members have
raised questions about the Post Office card account. The Department for
Work and Pensions is in discussions with the Post Office about what
should happen after 2010, which is the year earmarked for the phasing
out of POCA. The aim is to ensure that people have a range of choices
about how they can access money at the post office. Labour recognises
the important social role that the Post Office plays, and the
Government will take that into account.</p><p><a name="06101620000057">The Opposition parties have no
credible alternatives. The Conservative party briefing for this debate
is markedly light, as the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey mentioned. The Tories&#146; statement of aims and
values, &#147;Built to last&#148;, has nothing to say about Royal
Mail or the post office network. The only idea that their leader has
apparently had was confided to the <i> East Anglian Daily Times</i>
during the Tory party conference. He is quoted as
saying:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_22"><a name="06101620000594"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Rural
Post Offices could be saved under a future Conservative government by
giving them lottery terminals&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101620000058">There we have it. There are, in fact, no
limits on sub-postmasters asking to have lottery terminals in their
store.</p><p><a name="06101620000059">At their
spring conference, the Liberal Democrats voted in a brand new policy
for Royal Mail and the post office network. They would separate Royal
Mail from the post office network in order to privatise it. They say
that they would use the proceeds of the privatisation to fund a string
of additional programmes. That is the classic Liberal Democrat policy
of assuming they can fund ongoing spending commitments from a one-off
receipt. That is fairyland economics from the Liberal Democrats, and I
think that they know that. They appear to have made no credible attempt
to work out how much their programme would cost, and they are making an
open-ended commitment to maintain, or even increase,

either.</p><p><a name="06101620000060">It is
frequently stated that the network plays an important social role, and
we agree. But rapid improvements in technology and wider changes in
society have had a heavy impact on the many services traditionally seen
as being the preserve of the Post Office. We have to accept that the
Post Office operates in a commercial marketplace. The service that the
network provides, including lottery tickets, foreign currency,
telephony, bill payments and financial services, are all in direct
competition with other retailers and providers. We have a strong
management team in place at the Post Office and we have tasked it with
turning the business around. The company is continuing to develop and
introduce new services and business
activities.</p><p><a name="06101620000061">Members
from all parts of the House have made clear their concerns for the
future of the network. We recognise the calls for urgent decisions, and
we are aware that there has been a prolonged period of uncertainty
about the future direction of Government policy in respect of the
network. I can assure Members that a funding support package of
&#163;150 million a year is in place to maintain the network until
2008, and we are carefully considering the options for the network
beyond 2008.</p><p><a name="06101620000062">There
has been substantial activity behind the scenes in obtaining and
assessing data on the network, and on how that feeds into possible
options for future shape and size. We are not yet in a position where
we can say that we have the answers, but I can tell Members that they
should rest assured that we are listening and that their concerns will
be reflected in our decisions.</p><p><a name="06101620000063">The Government have an

Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> We now come to the
debate on the green tax switch. Mr. Speaker has selected the
amendment in the name of the Prime
Minister.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61016-0004.htmordayhd_15"><a name="06101625000156">7.45

Huhne (Eastleigh) (LD):</b> I beg to
move,</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_25"><a name="06101625000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House
notes with alarm the rise in carbon emissions since the Government took
office in 1997; believes that this record is in part due to the steady
fall in taxation derived from green taxes from 3.6 per cent. of gross
domestic product in 1999 down to 2.9 per cent. last year; notes opinion
poll support for a green tax switch from people onto pollution; urges
the Government to move from rhetorical assent on the need for action on
climate change to serious policy proposals which will set annual
targets to cut carbon emissions, allowing for natural variations from
year to year, and establish an independent monitoring body to report on
progress; and therefore calls on the Government to increase green taxes
on new high-emission cars and on aviation while using revenue generated
to cut direct taxes, particularly on low earners, so that there is no
overall rise in the burden of
taxation.</p></ul><p><a name="06101625000004">The
motion is about green tax and a green tax switch, a fundamental
principle of which is that we should as a society be taxing pollution
rather than people and we should be taxing bad things rather than work,
risk and effort. On that basis, if we were to engineer a change in the
structure of taxation towards green taxation by raising, as the Liberal
Democrats have proposed, &#163;8 billion a year extra in
green taxes, we would be able substantially to reduce taxation on
incomes, in particular by lifting 2 million people out of income tax
altogether; abolishing the 10p first rate of income tax; cutting
tuppence from the basic rate of income tax; and, by raising the
threshold at which the higher rate applies from &#163;38,000 to
&#163;50,000, taking out of the higher rate of taxation more than 1
million people, which is broadly the number who have been brought into
the higher rate during the period of Labour Government.</p><p><a name="06101625000005">The key reason for the green
tax switch is as part of a comprehensive package&#151;not the whole
of it, but a part&#151;to tackle British carbon
emissions.</p><p><a name="06101625000006"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew327"><a name="06101625000161">Mr.
Peter Lilley (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</b> Before the
hon. Gentleman goes any further, will he confirm that the switch will
work only if the green taxes that he proposes fail to work and
therefore fail to reduce the tax base on which they are
levied?</p><p><a name="06101625000007"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew328"><a name="06101625000162">Chris
Huhne:</b> No, I do not concede that. As the right hon.
Gentleman, whose knowledge of economics is extensive, knows well, an
ongoing price change is needed to engineer an ongoing change in
behaviour. I shall return to that theme later in my speech, and if he
wishes to intervene at that point, I shall be happy to give way to
him.</p><p><a name="06101625000008">The overwhelming
reason to implement green taxes is the extreme urgency of tackling
climate change and global warming. Nine of the hottest 10 years on
record have occurred since 1990. In Britain alone, this summer was the
hottest since records began in 1659; in 2002, we suffered two floods
that were supposed to occur only every 30 years; we have had the
wettest six months since records began in the 18th century; and the
incidence of storm surges, flood damage and droughts is
increasing.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="16 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="16" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>16 Oct 2006 : Column 660</b><br><p><a name="06101625000009">Globally, the
evidence is also compelling. In the past 10 years alone we have
suffered the most powerful el Niño effect ever recorded in
1997-98; the most devastating hurricane in 200 years in Hurricane Mitch
in 1998; the hottest European summer on record, in which 26,000 more
people than usual died in June and July 2003; the first south Atlantic
hurricane ever in 2002; the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in
Antarctica in 2002; and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in the gulf of
Mexico and the destruction of New
Orleans.</p><p><a name="06101625000010">The science
has become more alarming, not less so. It is based on ever more diverse
evidence: on land temperature measured by thermometers; on temperature
measured by balloons and satellites; on ice cover and ice thickness; on
melting permafrost; on sea temperature and sea flow; on the height of
waves; and on the incidence of storms, cyclones and typhoons.</p><p><a name="06101625000011">At the level of rhetoric and
targets, there is now a clear consensus among those on the Front
Benches of the three main parties in this House, but there is not a
consensus on the level of action or of delivery. We see the reality
when we look at the Government&#146;s record on climate change: our
carbon emissions have increased by more than 3 per cent. since 1997,
and we are meeting the Kyoto targets to which we have signed up only by
accident, because of the reduction of emissions from the electricity
generating sector thanks to the switch from coal to gas. We need to do
much more if we are to sustain our efforts and establish a position
from which we can argue for others also to take action.</p><p><a name="06101625000012">Economic instruments are
clearly crucial and valuable and the EU emissions trading scheme is the
best system, because the incentives go deep and accumulate as behaviour
changes. Companies can make even more by selling allocations when they
save carbon emissions, unlike merely saving a tax. However, the scheme
covers less than half of total emissions and it should be tougher, both
at EU level, with national plans, and by adding in sectors such as
aviation, shipping and freight, and by auctioning more and allocating
less.</p><p><a name="06101625000013">The reality is
that the scheme will not cover the gaping hole in the UK&#146;s
climate change efforts, which is the transport sector. As the Select
Committee on Environmental Audit reported in July, transport is the
only sector where emissions have consistently increased since 1990. It
is the key problem in the Government&#146;s emissions plan.</p><p><a name="06101625000014">The Select
Committee report on reducing carbon emissions from transport pointed
out that with the addition of international aviation and shipping,
total carbon dioxide emissions from the UK transport sector have
increased by 18 per cent. since 1990. That is in contrast with every
other sector of the economy, including farming, the public sector,
business and the domestic sector, where the reductions in carbon
emissions from 1990 to 2004 have been respectively 53 per cent., 28 per
cent. 12 per cent. and 2 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06101625000015">Transport stands
out, and there is no mystery as to why that is the case. The truth is
that the Chancellor beat a retreat in the face of the fuel duty
protests and since then green taxes, largely taxes on fossil fuels, as
a share of national income have been falling steadily; down from 3.6
per cent. of national income in 1999 to 2.9 per cent. last
year.</p><br>

sharper relief by an analysis of recent trends in the relative costs
within the transport sector. The real costs of motoring have declined
in the past six years while the average real cost of airline tickets is
around the same as it was in
1996.</p><p><a name="06101625000017"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew329"><a name="06101625000163">Mr.

be disadvantaged by the party&#146;s plans to curb cheap domestic air
travel. He went on to say that Inverness airport would not be included
because it was on a peripheral area and nor would Aberdeen because it
was a long way from the centre. It seems to me that that argument could
be made for a lot of airports in the UK. Is the hon. Gentleman going to

respectively.</p><p><a name="06101625000025">There
are two potential policy instruments that could in time help us to
resolve the problem. The first would be road user charging, based both
on congestion and on emissions; the second would be personal carbon
allowances, recently floated by the Secretary of State for Environment
and Rural Affairs. However, both are some way off technologically and
the key objective, faced with the urgency of climate change, is to move
quickly. We have maybe no more than 10 years to reduce carbon emissions
substantially and an honest policy should be based on existing
technologies.</p><p><a name="06101625000026">The
experience of voluntarism in, for example, the car sector has not been
a happy one. The voluntary agreement signed up to by the car makers to
reduce average carbon emissions to 140g per kilometre by 2008 is,
frankly, for the birds. At the current rate of progress, the UK would
not achieve that until 2022. We have broken promises in the vehicle
sector from manufacturers and the case for going beyond voluntarism is
a strong one.</p><p><a name="06101625000027">That is why
we have added the proposal for changing the rates of vehicle excise
duty on new cars, with an eye-catching and mouth-watering &#163;2,000
a year on those gas-guzzlers that are emitting more than 220g of carbon
per kilometre. The object of that policy is to change the cars that
people buy so that we have a change in behaviour and a change in the
effect of the system.</p><p><a name="06101625000028">The Select Committee pointed
out that, in particular, the new band G introduced by the Chancellor is
ineffective and the rate charged needs to be much higher. As things
stand, the VED paid by the owners of the highest emitting 4x4s and

price and works out at half the cost per gram of CO2 emitted
than lower emitting hatchbacks in band

cost of half a tank of petrol or, in the case of an upmarket 4x4 such

what the reputation of the Chancellor as a green Chancellor hangs on.
Our proposal is for a far sharper rise at the top end to deal with what
the Department for Transport identified as the trend towards higher
emitting cars outweighing the technological improvement in fuel
efficiency. Otherwise our proposal is closely modelled on the proposals
put forward by the Energy Saving Trust and the Sustainable Development
Commission. The Department for Transport itself commissioned some work
from MORI, the opinion polling organisation, to check on the likely
impact of the different price bands for vehicle excise duty of the sort
that we are putting forward. That study suggested that 72 per cent. of
new car purchasers would alter their behaviour faced with the sort of
rise in VED bands that we propose. That is a clear set of proposals for
dealing with one rapidly growing element of carbon emissions in the
transport sector.</p><p><a name="06101625000034"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew340"><a name="06101625000174">Gregory

extraordinarily rapid growth in carbon emissions. According to the
International Civil Aviation Organisation, average annual growth over
the past 10 years has been 4 per cent. In the UK, the growth in
passenger numbers has been even higher: 6 per cent. a year over the
past 10 years. Aviation emissions are growing so rapidly that at
current growth rates aviation would use up the entirety of the
UK&#146;s carbon allocation by 2050, allowing nothing whatsoever for
domestic heating, transport by

aviation growth&#151;not necessarily to cut it back, but merely to
slow its pace of growth. If people want to fly rather than carry out
other carbon-emitting activities, it is not, in any Liberal Democrat
view, the business of Government to tell them not to do so. However,
people need to take those decisions on the basis of a level playing
field.</p><p><a name="06101625000041">At present,
aviation is highly favoured. It is lightly taxed by comparison with
other areas of spending and it is not clear, given the undoubted damage
caused by carbon emissions, why that should be so. There is no kerosene
tax and no VAT on airline tickets, although that would be possible both
nationally and at an EU level. Aviation is not included in the
emissions trading scheme and we are some way off that happening. The
reality is that we need to work a little harder at a national level. I
agree that, as has been pointed out, there are substantial constraints
if we are not to make ourselves wholly uncompetitive. However, as we
have seen before, when the Conservatives were in government and
introduced air passenger duty, we can act at a national
level.</p><p><a name="06101625000042">The existing
air passenger duty is an extremely weak reed in the context of this
problem. Since 2000, for example, there has been a reduction in the
revenue from air passenger duty of 35 per cent., even though there has
been an 8 per cent. increase in passengers. The charge of &#163;5 for
short haul and &#163;20 for long haul, at the lowest rate, needs to
be replaced by an emissions charge based on the emissions of the
aircraft over the flight. Although we aim to tax aviation as a whole
more heavily&#151;that is what would limit its growth&#151;the
extra burden on passenger flights would be mitigated by the extension
of the emissions tax to freight. In each individual case, the charge
would depend on the fuel efficiency of the aircraft and on its load
factor. It is noticeable, for example, that the budget airlines tend to
have younger, more fuel efficient aircraft in their fleet and they also
fly with substantially higher load factors that the scheduled
airlines.</p><p><a name="06101625000043">We suggest
that those two big changes would bring in about &#163;8 billion of
proposed revenue. The idea is to raise the rate at which green taxes
are levied in the economy back up to the peak that existed in 1999,
within the space of one
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06101625000044"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew346"><a name="06101625000180">Mr.

down the road of the green tax switch, it is crucial that we make a
firm commitment to the electorate that the money that is raised from
green taxes is handed back to them and that the green tax switch is not
about raising money for the state. There are other means by which one
can handle infrastructure spending. I agree that there is a real
problem, but the whole idea of the green tax switch is to guarantee
that every penny piece raised in extra green taxes goes back into
reductions in taxes on income, in particular. That pattern of policies,
as I mentioned, has been applied in other countries that firmly believe
in tackling carbon emissions to influence climate change&#151;notably
in the Nordic countries.</p><br>

from, but the document that we voted on at our conference and the
accompanying figures made it clear that there would be a substantial
increase. We would be looking at getting roughly four times as much
revenue out of the aviation sector as is currently the case. He may be
confusing that with the fact that there are particular flights where,
because of load factors and fuel efficiency, one would not necessary
expect anything like that increase&#151;if any increase&#151;in
taxation. The burden of taxation will be
different.</p><p><a name="06101625000050">The most
thorough report commissioned by the Nordic Council from the Danish
National Environmental Research Institute in Copenhagen pointed out
that Sweden, most notably, is undertaking an overall tax shift,
replacing income taxes with taxes on energy, transport and pollution
that amount to several billion Swedish kronor. The report
says:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_28"><a name="06101625000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Nordic countries pioneered the introduction of carbon and energy taxes
and recent studies have addressed their impacts on CO2
emissions. Despite different methodological approaches, the
general result which emerges is that such taxes have made an important
difference to emission levels. In Finland, CO2 emissions
would have been 7 per cent. higher at the end of 1990s had the taxes
not been introduced, while in Demark the tax-subsidy scheme on
industrial CO2 emissions caused emissions to decline by 23
per cent. in just seven years, to a level 31 per cent. lower than would
be the case under a business-as-usual
scenario.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101625000051">Let
me deal with possible adverse side effects. Inevitably, those of us of
a progressive disposition worry about the impact of indirect taxes on
income distribution. Of course, indirect taxes may prove to be
regressive if, as is normally the case, expenditure on necessities
represents a higher proportion of the income of the poor than that of
the well-off. That is why Liberal Democrats have been careful not to
propose the extension of the climate change levy, or a climate tax on
households, before we have a far more successful scheme to improve
energy efficiency.</p><p><a name="06101625000052">The
taxes that we propose are not regressive, and one can see that in the
case of the vehicle excise duty. Poorer households do not own cars.
Some 28 per cent. of British households are without access to any car.
Moreover, even among those who have a car, it is rare to find families
that buy new cars. However, the VED rates would apply to new cars. On
aviation, too, the average income of leisure travellers from UK
airports, which was surveyed recently by the Civil Aviation Authority,
was nearly &#163;50,000 a year, or more than double the national
average. Labour Members might be especially interested to know that
nearly 80 per cent. of leisure flights are taken by people in the top
half of the income distribution, with only 20 per cent. taken by

Council
report:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_29"><a name="06101625000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Another
main result is that while energy taxes tend to be distributionally
regressive, taxes on transport, fuels and pollution are, respectively,
progressive and
neutral.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101625000053">It
is clear, however, as has been suggested, that such a policy might
adversely affect those in rural areas if special considerations were
not made. That was why we proposed during proceedings on the Finance
Bill that there should be a 50 per cent. discount on a
household&#146;s first car in sparsely populated rural areas and why
we believe that we should consider reducing excise duty rates on fuel
to offset some of the disadvantages of remoteness for rural communities
that rely on
cars.</p><p><a name="06101625000054">Overall, the
package would aim to raise the yield from green taxes back to the share
of national income at the peak of 1999. It thus represents a rise of
0.7 per cent. of gross domestic product. It would be a sensible first
step, after which we should assess its effects and other measures that
might be necessary to achieve the goals. I reiterate that the key
promise of the package is that the revenue raised from green taxes
should go back in cuts in taxes on good things, such as effort, risk
and work.</p><p><a name="06101625000055">I will now
address precisely the point raised by the hon. Member for Bournemouth,
East (Mr. Ellwood): will the revenue disappear? Certainly
not any more than it does in the case of other sin taxes, such as those
on alcohol and tobacco, or the congestion charge. There would be
behavioural effects, which is what we would want, but we would not be
trying to get rid of the behaviour altogether because the appropriate
instrument to achieve that would be not a green tax, but a regulation
to ban the activity entirely. I hope that Conservative Members will
thus be sympathetic to a proposal that is a market-oriented measure
designed to ensure that our carbon emissions are
sustainable.</p><p><a name="06101625000056"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew350"><a name="06101625000184">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman is speaking with a lot of
passion, which is important. I think that the whole House agrees on the
direction in which we are trying to move. However, as other
Conservative Members have pointed out, there is a problem. If the taxes
were to work in the way in which the hon. Gentleman suggests, we would
not have the impact on the environment that we want, so we would still
be faced with the same levels of carbon, rising sea levels and the
challenges that we are trying to
address.</p><p><a name="06101625000057"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew351"><a name="06101625000185">Chris
Huhne:</b> I do not want my response to the hon. Gentleman to
become too technical. However, on aviation, for example, a lot of work
has been done on the responsiveness of quantities to changes in price.
The price elasticity of demand is shown to be about 1.1, which
effectively means that a price increase of 1 per cent. leads to a 1.1
per cent. fall in activity, if other things are equal&#151;obviously,
one must take account of the growth trend. I am rather surprised that
the hon. Gentleman questions this clear point. There is a very small
selection of goods and services for which demand increases if the price
is raised. If one raises the price of something, demand for it
generally goes down. The measure would thus be
effective.</p><p><a name="06101625000058">I welcome
the Conservative promise of raising green taxes as a share of taxes as
far as it goes, but it does not go far enough for my taste because if

layer has since stopped deteriorating and environmental catastrophe
from that source has been averted. I agree that weaning us off fossil

in the Chamber if it had stuck to its promise, but which excludes
Labour because it has not acted on it&#151;that the Government would
move to take taxes off goods and put them on bads, and that they would
increase environmental taxation in order to combat climate change. That
was the promise in 1997. As the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)
said, you have moved in exactly the wrong direction, and your warm

the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere will take enormous effort. There is widespread recognition
that we will have to move substantially beyond the agreements reached
at Kyoto. Our ambitions must be far greater and all key emitting
nations must play a full part. Around the world the UK is recognised as
a leading voice on climate change. Last year we made climate change and
Africa top priorities during our presidency of the G8. We moved the
debate forward, and we are still doing so with the Gleneagles dialogue
process and in the UN and other forums. But we can credibly provide
leadership internationally only if we continue to show by our actions
at home that we are fully committed to tackling climate
change.</p><p><a name="06101625000068">I welcome the

instruments to meet our climate change objectives. I strongly welcome,
too, the fact that climate change is now at the top of the agenda of

the British people, who care so passionately about making poverty
history and protecting the world from what we are doing to it through
our actions.</p><p><a name="06101625000069">I put on
record the important fact that we are on course to meet our Kyoto

around 23 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, nearly double our Kyoto
commitment. The Government introduced a

measures have played a key role. For instance, the climate change levy
package, which combines fiscal and non-fiscal measures, has delivered
emissions savings of over 28 million tonnes of carbon since they were
introduced in
2001.</p><p><a name="06101625000070">I
fully accept that we need to do more, and I shall explain some of the
steps that we are taking to strengthen our domestic programme on
climate change and put us on a path to reduce CO2 emissions
by at least 60 per cent. by 2050. Before I do so, I shall address the
core argument in the Liberal Democrat motion. It is right for the
Opposition to question why we have taken some steps and not others.
Taxation, public spending, regulation and encouragement of voluntary
public action all have the potential to contribute to our objectives in
this field. The question is what is the appropriate mix of policy
instruments.</p><p><a name="06101625000071">I
can agree with the general proposition that we should tax environmental
bads and encourage environmental goods. The &#147;polluter
pays&#148; principle is a long-established Government policy. We have
programmes to support the growth of clean technology. However, I
fundamentally disagree with the Liberal Democrats&#146; contention
that environmental tax as a proportion of gross domestic product is
somehow an accurate indicator of success or failure in tackling climate
change. It is not. A decline in environmental tax revenue can be the
consequence of policy being effective and delivering behavioural
change. Climate change agreements have delivered 10 million tonnes of
carbon savings by giving an incentive to companies to pay less tax
through a reduced climate change
levy.</p><p><a name="06101625000072">The fuel
differential for biofuels also involves the surrender of tax revenue.
It is simplistic and wrong to judge policy by reference to the
proportion of green taxes as a percentage of GDP. The link between
growth and carbon emissions, strong for most of our industrial history,
has been substantially broken. It is equally fallacious to measure the
effectiveness of the Government&#146;s commitment to tackling climate
change by how much the Government spend in this area. Adding up a few
DEFRA budget lines and comparing that with the amount spent on Trident
or the Iraq war may produce a news story, but it gives a false picture
of what is being done by Government to tackle climate change across a
range of different policy instruments. I shall focus on four areas
where we are taking action, and then offer some concluding
remarks.</p><p><a name="06101625000073"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew356"><a name="06101625000190">Mr.

perfectly possible to construct a climate change policy that does not
rely on green taxes, but, in practice, international comparisons show
that there is not a single European country that has achieved a good

taxes as a share of GDP. Will the Minister name one, if he

of the areas that the UK is working to have included in the EU

the industry to meet the full costs of its environmental impacts
through a mixture of emissions reductions within the sector and
purchase of reductions that can be produced more cheaply by other
sectors. I know the Liberal Democrats also want that, and I believe the
Conservative party does too, so we are united in wanting to tackle the

instrument. In government one has to reach a judgment about the right
mix of policy instruments to achieve one&#146;s objectives. That is
what we are doing, and it is why&#151;the second point that I want to
make&#151;in July we published the results of our energy policy
review, a central theme of which was further action to deliver annual
reductions of up to 25 million tonnes of carbon and put us on track to
meet our 2050 target.</p><p><a name="06101625000082">Measures
announced in the energy review include giving people accurate
information about their energy use through smart metering, phasing out
inefficient consumer goods, moving towards our long-term ambition of
carbon-neutral housing development, and a revolutionary change in the
basis of energy supply regulation, so that companies have an incentive
to conserve energy rather than supply more of it. We also plan to
consult on a possible energy performance commitment, which will target
emissions from large commercial and public sector organisations that
are currently not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme and
climate change agreements. This could effectively save 1.2 million
tonnes of carbon a year by 2020.</p><br>

dramatically. Are the Government&#146;s proposals aimed at
stabilising a long-term price for carbon? The German Government have

the EU emissions trading scheme beyond 2012 to provide certainty for
businesses that are making long-term investment decisions. I am sure
that that is what the hon. Gentleman was referring to, and I would be
interested to hear what the Trade and Industry Committee has to say
about
it.</p><p><a name="06101625000085">We
aim to increase the level of the renewable transport fuel obligation to
above 5 per cent. after 2011 and to develop strong successor
arrangements to the current voluntary agreements on new car fuel
efficiency. With transport accounting for around 25 per cent. of UK
carbon emissions, I agree that we need to take action in that area. The
carbon savings from those measures alone will be some 2 to 3 million
tonnes. We are also increasing our commitment to renewable energy by
strengthening the renewables obligation, with higher levels of support
so that the newer technologies receive the support that they need. That
is in addition to existing measures to incentivise renewables,
including &#163;500 million of funding for a range of support
programmes for emerging technologies.</p><p><a name="06101625000086">Thirdly, we are doing more to
reduce the carbon footprint of Government. We have made a pledge that
the Government office estate will go carbon neutral by 2012. That will
save approximately 160,000 tonnes of carbon&#151;the equivalent of
taking some 150,000 cars off the road. We are offsetting all official
air travel, which will mitigate an estimated 300,000 tonnes of carbon
dioxide by 2009. New sustainable operation targets have been introduced
for each Government Department. We will shortly respond positively to
the sustainable procurement task force
report.</p><p><a name="06101625000087">Fourthly, the
Budget presented by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out a range
of important measures: changes to car taxation; an incentive package
for biofuels; and measures to encourage greater energy efficiency in
households, including an extra 250,000 homes to be insulated over the
next two years. That builds on the &#163;320 million of investment
this year through the Warm Front programme, which will help more than
100,000 households, and the energy efficiency commitment, which has
delivered net benefits to households of more than &#163;3 billion

appreciate that many hon. Members are interested in legislation on
climate change, with some 398 having signed early-day motion 178. The
Government have said in the UK climate change programme, and more
recently in the energy review, that we are carefully considering the
merits of introducing a carbon budget as a means of helping to deliver
our goals. The only issue for the Government is whether legislation
would help in the battle against climate change, support the efforts to
join individual activity with business and Government leadership, and
link domestic and international action. Legislating for targets is not
the same as legislating the means to achieve them, and it is the latter
on which we will all be judged. Consensus on goals is important, but
without effective policy there is no effective response. The challenge
for us as legislators is to ensure that we have the right mix of policy
actions to achieve our ambitious goals.</p><p><a name="06101625000093">Climate change requires change
right across society&#151;from central and local government, from
individuals and from business&#151;if we are to move towards
one-planet living. I am proud that we were the world&#146;s first
Government to set a long-term target for carbon reduction consistent
with the science of climate change, the world&#146;s first Government
to legislate for a climate change levy, the world&#146;s first
Government to introduce an emissions trading scheme, and the
world&#146;s first Government to meet and tighten its caps under the
European emissions trading scheme. All those changes were met with
scepticism, and some with opposition, but they were the right course of
action. Now we need to go further. We will do so. We must put the world
first, and I look forward to support from right across the House as we

Our planet is fast approaching what scientists call the tipping
point&#151;the point in the next decade at which, if we can limit and
begin to substantially reduce the amount of carbon we pump into the
atmosphere, we may stand a chance of abating the worst of the climate
change scenarios. If we do not, the long-term consequences will be
severe indeed. Against that background&#151;and recognising the need,
where possible, for concerted cross-party consensus on this
issue&#151;there is a lot in the motion with which we can
agree.</p><p><a name="06101625000095">It is an
undeniable truth that carbon emissions have risen since Labour took
office in 1997, while at the same time there has been a steady fall in
taxation derived from green taxes. There simply is no excuse for that.
While environmental taxes as a percentage of total taxes and social
contributions stood at 9 per cent. in 1993 and rose successively during
every year of the final term of the last Conservative Government to
stand at 9.7 per cent. in 1998, they have fallen, with one very minor
exception, in every single year since 1999. In 2005, environmental
taxes fell to just 7.7 per cent., down from 8.3 per cent. in 2004. We
are committed to reversing that
trend.</p><p><a name="06101625000096">That lack of
focus from the Chancellor is all the more extraordinary because, as the
amount of tax on environmental bads as a percentage of total taxes has
steadily fallen in recent years, our knowledge and understanding of the
impact of global warming has greatly increased. Since Margaret Thatcher
became the first global leader to warn the world of the dangers of
climate change in the late 1980s, our comprehension of the science of
man-made global warming and our appreciation of the need to take
concerted, urgent action has grown immeasurably.</p><p><a name="06101625000097">The
Government have not been blind to that science. Many Ministers,
including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs team,
have a personal commitment to the climate change agenda. Indeed, on the
international stage, the Government have endeavoured to continue to
play a leadership role. Abroad, Ministers&#146; efforts have met with
significant success, but at home Labour&#146;s record is far more
depressing.</p><p><a name="06101625000098">It is all the
more surprising to Conservative Members, who have gasped and widened
their eyes at the succession of Budgets from the Chancellor in which
new and ingenious stealth taxes have been unveiled and taxes have risen
year after year, to witness complete indifference to the one matter
about which he would have been much more certain of finding consensus
on the need to increase taxation&#151;environmental bads. Under
Labour, the Treasury has been unimaginative, unambitious and
unbelievably complacent.</p><p><a name="06101625000099">An explicit
example of a well-intentioned but unambitious policy, complacently
implemented, is the enhanced capital allowance scheme, which the
Chancellor introduced in the 1999 pre-Budget report. The building
industry has enjoyed the benefits of the ECA scheme for using emergent,
efficient technology, yet that incentive, which is now seven years old,
has fallen behind the latest round of building regulations and acts as
a barrier to applications of new and emerging technologies such as
thermal mass and natural ventilation. Individual elements of plant and
machinery capital expenditure are included in the scheme, yet holistic
and efficient

taken into account. All attempts to include additional sorts of
holistic technology outside the narrow definition of plant and
machinery have been successfully rebuffed. The Government have no
vision and no ambition.</p><p><a name="06101625000100">When the industry has contacted
DEFRA about the inclusion of new technology in the scheme, including
technology that would dramatically reduce a building&#146;s carbon
footprint, it has been referred to the Carbon Trust as technical
adviser to the scheme. However, when the Carbon Trust has been
contacted, the industry is referred back to DEFRA and Revenue and
Customs, which is responsible for the scope of the scheme. Perhaps the
Chief Secretary could deal with that point in his winding-up
speech.</p><p><a name="06101625000101">Perhaps the
greatest element of underperformance is the Government&#146;s much
vaunted climate change levy. It is a good idea and a terrific brand,
but its detailed application is profoundly inefficient. It is not
focused on CO2. The climate change levy is a tax on the
energy that business uses. It should be reformed so that it is based on
CO2 emissions from different fuels, and the rates should be
increased towards the estimated social costs of greenhouse gas
emissions. The increased revenue should be earmarked for
&#147;climate change mitigation measures&#148;. Those are not my
words but those of Mr. Tony Grayling, the Secretary of
State&#146;s special adviser. Let me make it clear: under the next
Conservative Government, the climate change levy will be replaced by a
more effective method of reducing carbon emissions, as part of an
overall framework of carbon pricing throughout the economy.</p><p><a name="06101625000102">Another perverse impact of that
inefficient environment tax is its application to UK agriculture and
horticulture, which have exceeded their climate change levy targets.
Despite that good record, the targets have been increased to
unattainable levels, while other sectors, such as aviation, remain
uncontrolled. The perverse outcome is that there is now a serious
prospect of UK-produced horticulture and UK poultry and pig production
ending and being replaced by imported produce, which will be sucked
into Britain using untaxed aviation fuel. How good can that be for
global climate change, let alone British farming? What is the DEFRA
team doing to sort out that mess?</p><p><a name="06101625000103">However, my main criticism of
the Government is that, rather than concern themselves with clear,
ambitious, accountable policy-based instruments, predicated on either
tax incentives for environmental goods or green taxes on environmental
bads, they have a peculiar fascination with short-term initiatives,
stop-go grant funding, tiny pots of money here and tiny pots of
taxpayers&#146; money there.</p><p><a name="06101625000104">One of the most extraordinary
examples of Treasury micro-dabbling in the private sector with
taxpayers&#146; money is its current participation in the 21st
century sustainable technology growth fund, which is currently making
its debut on the stock market. One fund manager who had received a
presentation contacted me, totally unable to understand the
Government&#146;s willingness to use taxpayers&#146; money to put
up two thirds of the money for that small, private sector venture
capital fund, while agreeing to take only 12 per

taxpayer&#146;s money? What would the Treasury Minister have to say
about

wholeheartedly agree with the broad thrust of the motion before us, but

a moment deny that we need to take a more responsible approach to
transport emissions. However, it is somewhat bizarre to criticise the
Government for their whole record since 1997, then just to deduce from
that a failure to tax Range Rovers and Porsche
Cayennes&#151;particularly, I presume, the turbo variety that was
scurrying around the Leicester by-election, full of Lib Dem campaign
strategists. There is, however, a clear role for the Government to
ensure environmentally friendly transport systems. The Government are
intricately involved in the transport infrastructure, and more than a
quarter of our carbon emissions come from transport. Without action on
transport, action on emissions will be limited. The Conservatives have
already announced an ambitious policy to reduce average emissions from
cars to under 100 g per kilometre for all new cars by 2022 and for all
cars by 2030. We propose to work hand in hand with the most progressive
companies to make that vision a reality.</p><p><a name="06101625000109">So why are the Lib Dems so
preoccupied with 4x4s? Perhaps it is because they have failed to think
through their climate change strategy with the same depth and breadth
that the official Opposition are employing. Both our parties have
elected a new leader in the past 12 months, albeit in rather different
circumstances. My party, embracing the need for change and renewal,
took a great leap forward and skipped a generation. The Lib Dems,
perhaps noticing how effective this had been, also decided to skip a
generation. With a novel Lib Dem twist, however, they went in the
opposite
direction.</p><p><a name="06101625000110"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew371"><a name="06101625000205">Martin

Gladstone that he was an old man in a hurry. I would certainly not
presume so to label the new Lib Dem leader, but a budget written for
three years hence, whipped out in less than six weeks after taking the
reins, does have a slight whiff of the back of a fag packet about it.
My party makes no apologies for having commissioned the most extensive
policy review process since that undertaken by Margaret Thatcher and
Keith Joseph in the 1970s, or for throwing out preconceived notions and
looking afresh at the challenges of the new century with the help of
today&#146;s experts and tomorrow&#146;s leaders. The policy review
process is drawing in not just committed Conservative party members but
experts from across the country who are keen to participate in the
intellectual renewal of a great political party and a Government in
waiting. We will not make the mistake that Labour made of entering its
first term of government without having undertaken hard thinking about
policy in opposition.</p><p><a name="06101625000119">When one
considers the failure of Labour to reduce our output of carbon
emissions, the Liberal Democrat notion that that would be reversed by
slapping more vehicle excise duty on a few gas guzzlers is frivolous.
Yes, the true cost of such cars should be more accurately reflected in
the price, and I look forward to the considered opinions of our policy
review commission. The CO2 from those large cars, however,
is dwarfed by that emitted by the UK energy sector or from UK homes.
Nothing in the motion provides an answer to that.</p><p><a name="06101625000120">The Conservatives, under my

renewable energy, especially that generated and consumed close to the
point of use. We want that ambitious big-picture thinking converted
into real measures to create a decentralised energy revolution. That
degree of ambition was sadly lacking in the Government&#146;s recent
energy review.</p><p><a name="06101625000121">We
also want far more progress on reducing the CO2 emissions
from Britain&#146;s buildings&#151;new and old, residential,
commercial and industrial. Again, little in the Government&#146;s
record points to a really ambitious programme, and certainly not to a
dramatic reduction in CO2 emissions from the built
environment. The news last week that DEFRA is slashing funding to the
Energy Saving Trust to give Ministers something new to say is
disgraceful. Although the Treasury is the worst offender,
Labour&#146;s strategy right across Whitehall lacks ambition. Even
relatively modest non-fiscal proposals to allow progressive local
councils to go further than Whitehall by insisting on renewable energy
and eco-building standards in local new developments, which were put
forward by Conservatives during the passage of the recent Climate
Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, were frustrated by the
Government.</p><p><a name="06101625000122">To return

Witney, got there first. He joined Friends of the Earth and a host of
other green NGOs in early September to call for a climate change Bill

established and could be adapted for carbon allowances. People could
have an allowance on a credit card and when they bought fuel, the
allowance could be deducted. If they needed more, they could buy the
carbon allowance at the garage. If they did not use much carbon, they
could sell that into a central pool and people with gas guzzlers would
have to buy the additional carbon to cover that. That approach may be
more efficient than simply applying tax, although I am not arguing that
tax does not have a role. I strongly urge Ministers to think about it.
We have to do the analysis, and sooner rather than later. I strongly
encourage them to do that.</p><p><a name="06101630000013">I particularly like the idea of

argument about the detail, but I hope that the UK sticks to the
principle of applying carbon trading to all take-offs and landings in
the EU, not simply intra-EU take-offs and landings. I do not think that
that is enough; it has to apply to every plane that takes off and lands
in the UK. I know that the Commission has got nervous because of
international pressure over the issue. I hope that the Government will
take steps to support the Commission and not back down on those
points.</p><p><a name="06101630000015">People can be
priced off planes. I am not sure it is the most socially equitable way
of doing it. It allows people who can pay to pollute. That is why I
would much rather have a cap on the emissions of the aviation sector,
and the activity could then be based on buying and selling the
allowances.</p><br>

time. Because of the urgency of the situation, there may be an argument
for various interim fiscal measures. Again, I would like any fiscal
measure that is applied to aviation to have an outcome. For example,
some form of carbon offset levy on tickets or on the airline companies
is worth considering. I do not believe that carbon offsets are an
answer to the issue of climate change, or that offsets should be a
substitute for reducing emissions. That has to be the priority, but
there is a role for carbon offsets because we need to take action and
it is one way of raising funds internationally to invest in clean
energy in developing countries. I welcome what the Government have done
to make all their flights carbon-neutral by offsetting. It is something
to commend.</p><p><a name="06101630000017">Some of these
measures could be included in a climate change Bill. There is an
argument for such a Bill. I support the concept. I accept that such a
Bill is not simply about legislating for targets. Targets have their
place, but there is a debate about how to apply targets and structures.
The important thing is to have a framework for action and a climate
change Bill could be an important part of that framework. It is worth
considering.</p><p><a name="06101630000018">I accept some
of the arguments made about road pricing, which has a role to play, but
it needs to be structured to achieve environmental as well as fiscal
outcomes. However, the overriding issue is climate change. We must take
an integrated approach across Government, because there are issues with
the pricing of water and of waste collection. There is an argument for
moving towards pricing waste by weight, and removing that charge from
the council tax. Housing regulations and transport policy, too, are
considerations. We must look at the way in which we can provide
incentives, so that, as well as trying to tax bad practice, we
encourage good practice.</p><p><a name="06101630000019">It is a pity
that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has left the Chamber,
because on a number of occasions he and I have discussed how we could
use reductions in stamp duty on new build to encourage the building of
low-carbon houses. He used an eloquent argument to explain why the
Treasury did not favour that general approach, but there is a strong
argument for an incentive to encourage zero emissions homes, of which
only a few thousand are being built. The Treasury might like to
consider an exemption from stamp duty, or a lower rate of stamp duty,
for houses that meet the highest standards as part of the incentives
needed in an integrated approach across
Government.</p><p><a name="06101630000020">Of course,
we should not forget the international dimension. The hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle discussed the Prime Minister&#146;s legacy, but if
he travels around Europe and internationally, he will find that the
Prime Minister is held in the highest regard for what he has done on
climate change, and for the way in which he has pushed it to the top of
the political agenda internationally; for example, it was on the G8
agenda. He has made it a big issue, and he stood with Governor
Schwarzenegger in California to argue for the type of changes that are
taking place in the US, despite the stance of the present
Administration, because there is bottom-up pressure for them. The hon.
Gentleman should accept the lead that the Prime Minister has given, and
the respect in which he is held.</p><p><a name="06101630000021">Nevertheless,

and distributed locally, and food that is flown many thousands of miles
across the world to reach the UK? Should there be a mechanism or levy

urgent and important issue that we as an industrial

Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) for his comments. When he
was a Minister, I briefly shadowed him, and I was immediately impressed
by the way in which he tried to take the Government down many of the
right roads. He should take credit for many of the policy initiatives
that the Government have taken, but he will be the first to admit that
there is still a long way to go. He rightly emphasised the urgency of
the issue for the UK because climate change science is becoming
increasingly scary. More and more of the statistics and data from
scientists suggest that the changes are beginning to happen even faster
than was predicted. Scientists studying the rate of thaw of the Arctic
perennial ice have found that it is 30 times faster than it was only a
few years ago, so clearly there is a risk that we are approaching a
tipping point, or at least that the rate of climate change is much
faster than first
thought.</p><p><a name="06101630000023"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew402"><a name="06101630000086">Susan

and the developed world are vulnerable, as he has begun to describe,
the developing world and the world&#146;s poorest people are most
vulnerable to climate change? For example, in Zimbabwe, more than 55
per cent. of people are dependent on environmental resources. The
crisis that they face is far more extreme than that in the
UK.</p><p><a name="06101630000024"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew403"><a name="06101630000087">Martin
Horwood:</b> My hon. Friend is right. There are many other
examples from the developing world of the seriousness of this issue. In
Bangladesh, millions face dispossession and homelessness through rising
sea levels, while desertification in Africa may also displace millions
of people and add to the economic chaos and disruption worldwide. Even
in the UK, we face the prospect of more flooding, more extreme weather,
more droughts, and even rising sea levels threatening major cities and
coastal towns. If the north Atlantic currents that drive the gulf
stream are disrupted, we may end up in the short term with a much
colder climate, comparable to that of Canada, which is on the same
latitude.</p><p><a name="06101630000025">The issues
are very urgent and the Conservatives&#146; approach displays some
complacency. They seem to think that we can sit back for a year or two
and gather more information, but there is a wealth of information and
policy advice available for them to read and consider.</p><br>

quibble with the detail and the pace, as I am about to do, but the hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) mentioned Margaret
Thatcher, who first said that the Conservatives were the real friends
of the earth some 20 years ago. It has taken them some time to get
their green act
together.</p><p><a name="06101630000028">I referred
to the wealth of policy advice available and some reports were produced
in the summer, notably the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research
report, which mapped out a path to a low-carbon economy with reductions
of 90 per cent. by 2050. I was pleased that the Minister mentioned the
need to go well beyond the Kyoto targets. A consensus is emerging that
those targets will not be sufficient to deliver the kind of change that
is needed. That is a positive step. The Tyndall centre has also made it
clear that a drastic change in the policy framework and much more
deliberate actions than we have had so far from the Government are
needed.</p><p><a name="06101630000029">Another
report was from the New Economics Foundation, which published something
called the happy planet index. That sounds like something that the
right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) might have
dreamed up in one of his sunshine moments, but it is a quality of life
index that balances indicators of quality of life and life expectancy
against the ecological footprint of the country. The UK comes 108th in
that index, just behind Libya, although we are ahead of Laos. The
reason is our heavy ecological footprint, which is the 18th largest in
the world, despite our relatively small population.</p><p><a name="06101630000030">The Chancellor put a few
measures in the budget and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh
(Chris Huhne) elaborated on the weakness of some of them. We need to
find measures that will change behaviour. Some of the measures on
vehicle excise duty, and the freezing of aircraft passenger duty in
recent years, have not been enough to shift behaviour substantially.
Other opportunities have also been missed. We have talked about energy
efficiency, but why is not the code for sustainable buildings
compulsory? Why does it not include an element of microgeneration in
every new build house or at least, at community level, for every new
development? Those are missed opportunities that we need to seize.
Action is needed at individual level, by companies and by
Government.</p><p><a name="06101630000031">We
need to consider what will work to change behaviour. Government
regulation, bans on the worst offending products and Government
guidelines will play their part, but they can be clumsy tools. Despite
my background in the voluntary sector&#151;I worked with Oxfam for
many years&#151;I am well aware that many of the grant-based
initiatives and projects can seem a drop in the ocean compared with the
changes effected by changing markets and the way in which economies
work. That is the beauty of using fiscal measures as one of the tools
in the policy armoury. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh noted
that the initial carbon dioxide targets

energy market&#151;the dash for gas. With gas prices rising, we may
not find that that price advantage works to the benefit of carbon
emissions in future, so more methods will have to be
used.</p><p><a name="06101630000032">A smaller
example relates to the washing machine market, which may seem mundane,
but there has been an astonishing change in recent years, as the Energy
Saving Trust pointed out: 90 per cent. of the washing machines bought
in the UK are now energy rating A. The introduction of the labelling
scheme itself has helped not only to shift consumer
behaviour&#151;obviously when price was equal consumers looked for
the most energy-efficient machine&#151;but has also changed the
behaviour of the manufacturers, because there was no market advantage
in producing anything other than the most energy-efficient model
possible.</p><p><a name="06101630000033">We have many
surprising allies in the arguments about climate change. The
Association of British Insurers has become a strong advocate of more
urgent action to tackle climate change because it can see the
commercial realities. That in turn influences manufacturers and the
economic landscape. We need to change the economic landscape of this
country and move much more towards a low-carbon economy, whereas we
have a Chancellor who, far from changing the landscape, is merely
pottering around in the flower beds in many respects.</p><p><a name="06101630000034">The Minister mentioned the
energy review as a contributor to change. He may be interested in the
comments of the Tyndall Centre about the review. It
said:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_32"><a name="06101630000072"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
absence of specific policy measures, as well as detailed quantitative
analysis, does not permit a comprehensive evaluation of the likelihood
of achieving the UK&#146;s carbon dioxide targets. There is a
significant risk that the good intentions outlined in the White Paper
will not be translated into action that shifts a growing UK economy
onto a sustainable energy path within the short to medium
term.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101630000035">Because
the Government are not doing as much as they should, the message is not
getting through to some parts of industry, notably the boss of Ryanair.
On 22 June, he dismissed other air carriers, who were trying
to form a sustainable aviation group, as lemmings. He
said:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_33"><a name="06101630000073"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
sustainable aviation group, God help us, is another bunch of lemmings
shuffling towards a cliff
edge.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101630000036">I know which cliff
edge we are shuffling towards and it is not the one that Michael
O&#146;Leary was
describing.</p><p><a name="06101630000037">There has
been progress on the labelling of low-carbon cars, on which the Low
Carbon Vehicle Partnership has been doing some work. It found
that:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_34"><a name="06101630000074"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;40% of
people who have recently bought&#151;or are about to buy&#151;a new
car are aware of the new colour-coded fuel economy
label.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101630000038">Labelling
obviously provides some incentive, but only to 40 per cent; 60 per
cent. of people ignore it. The partnership also found that</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_35"><a name="06101630000075"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in showrooms for
&#145;value&#146;, low-margin brands&#151;which also tend to be
smaller and more fuel efficient&#151;only 29% of cars were correctly
labelled&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101630000039">Labelling has
its limitations. As the hon. Member for Scunthorpe said, we need to
tackle climate change on a range of policy levels; we need to look at
education, labelling, regulation, grants and cap and trade mechanisms,
but tax must play its part.</p><br>

be simplistic, but it is true that if people change their

fuel-efficient models of car&#151;they will have more money at their
disposal. The beauty of the fiscal approach to green issues is that
sometimes we can deliver a win-win situation. The same is true of
microgeneration in the long term: the more we invest in it, by
providing it for low-income households, for example, the more we shall
tackle fuel poverty and save people money. Although in respect of this

deliver a win-win situation, and that is exactly what our green tax
switch proposals are designed to
do.</p><p><a name="06101630000043">We
should not apologise for concentrating on transport as one of the main
areas. As has been pointed out, 25 per cent. of carbon emissions still
derive from transport. The Tyndall centre report graphically points out
that, while both industrial and domestic carbon emissions have in
general been in decline since the 1970s, transport is the only major
sector that has been increasing its emissions since those years. As
part of its policy framework, the Tyndall centre report suggests how we
might approach aviation. The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle accused
us of knee-jerk reactions and fag-packet calculations, but he might be
interested in the conclusions that the Tyndall centre came to, with the
wealth of policy reviews, commissions and experts that it has at its
disposal. It
stated:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_37"><a name="06101630000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
research demonstrates that aviation is a problem sector that we must
get to grips with. It is the fastest-growing source of emissions and
there are fewer technological options for cutting carbon dioxide than
in other sectors.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101630000044">It
adds that its report</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_38"><a name="06101630000078"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;does say current rates of growth
are unsustainable, and that Government intervention&#151;such as
increased taxes and a cap on airport expansion&#151;is required to
curb that growth.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101630000045">I do

to the most important starting-point that the Liberal Democrats have
provided. Scientists are telling us that we have very little
time&#151;a 10-year window of opportunity in which not only to come
up with nice ideas, but to make fundamental changes to the way that our
economy is structured, in order to meet the three major challenges of
climate change. For us and for everyone else on the planet, those
challenges will be in the areas of food security, energy management and
water management. In examining policies, we need to shift our whole
thinking about the nature of markets, so that we can address those
challenges.</p><p><a name="06101630000061">It is
right to say that taxation is only one of the mechanisms that should be
used. We have to be very careful because, as was pointed out earlier,
there is a paradox in green taxation. We cannot use the size of the
green taxation slice as a percentage of gross domestic product as a
measure of our green policies because, in order to be effective, that
proportion needs to be as low as possible. We want to change behaviour;
we do want existing behaviour to continue.</p><p><a name="06101630000062"><b><a name="61016-0004.htm_spnew421"><a name="06101630000105">Mr.

to expand on this issue on another occasion, but I should point out
that in my view, we need to focus much more on changing behaviour than
on the ability to raise taxation.</p><p><a name="06101630000064">Carbon
emissions are also used as a proxy for climate change policies, but the
reality is that, like most people in this country, most Members of this
House would not know a tonne of carbon if we fell over it. It is
extremely helpful that people have translated the concept into
accessible terms. Roughly speaking, a hot air balloon

transpose that into aviation terms. Aviation in the UK is currently
responsible for 35 million tonnes of carbon per annum, so let us
picture 35 million hot air balloons cluttering the skies. On the most
conservative assumption, the figure of 35 million tonnes will rise to
60 million tonnes by 2030. Sixty million hot air balloons in the skies
would obliterate daylight from large sections of the UK. That is the
scale of the issue that we have to tackle.</p><p><a name="06101630000065">I doubt whether including
aviation fuel in the emissions trading scheme makes a
ha&#146;p&#146;orth of sense, and it is important that someone puts
down a marker in this debate that such schemes are a complete scam. If
one begins from the premise that in order to tackle pollution, one has
to create a fictional good, against which one then unleashes
speculation, only in doing so to deter long-term investment because it
is impossible to predict the price of that good, one should not be
surprised to end up in the mess that the European emissions trading
scheme ended up in at the end of its first year of operation. People
cheat. They make even more crass mistakes by giving away quotas to the
most polluting, rather than to the least polluting.</p><p><a name="06101630000066">I would like to believe that
things would be better if we gave quotas to individuals, but I know
that that is not true. As my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe
(Mr. Morley) knows, it is not the fishermen who own fishing
quotas now; it is the banks. The outcome is a trading circle between
the wealthy that does not address issues of sustainability.</p><p><a name="06101630000067">I urge hon. Members to look at
the work of one of the foremost authorities on this subject: William
Nordhaus of Yale university. He urges us to move from quotas to taxes
and tariffs. If we make that transition, we should not presume that the
taxes come to us as a Government. Let us look at the German model,
where the authorities have used, with incredible creativity, two pieces
of legislation in combination: the 1991 electricity feed Act, which
dealt with people&#146;s right to sell energy back into the system,
and the 2000 renewable energy sources Act.</p><p><a name="06101630000068">The German
authorities told their energy industry, &#147;Right, we&#146;re
going to set different tariffs&#151;you set different
tariffs.&#148; They required the industry to pay people a much higher
rate for energy that they supplied to the system than the industry
charged for energy that it supplied to people. The rate paid in Germany
for renewable energies is currently about 35p per KWh. I have just
completed the construction of my own eco-house, which generates more
energy than it consumes, but what do I discover but that in this
country those who generate energy are paid next to nothing for it. Many
companies pay nothing; others pay up to about 3.5p per KWh. Ten times
as much is paid to those who supply energy in Germany as is paid in the
UK. Furthermore, the authorities in Germany have told the industry to
pay for all this&#151;there is no Government subsidy. Everything must
be internally financed by the industry. As a result, Germany is pulling
away from the rest of us in terms of investment and trade in renewable
energies, as well as in terms of the skills and training that deliver a
different type of sustainable economy. We lag behind because, instead,
we are obsessed with the idea of a market in mythical goods.</p><br>

duties to a series of measures that are within our own remit. Of
course, we could do that by regulation, but we seem to have turned our
back on the process of regulation. We could have created a requirement
that all new housing should meet the minimum standard of a
SAP&#151;standard assessment of performance&#151;65 energy
efficient rating. That requirement is already in place in large parts
of Europe. Did we do it? No&#151;we turned our back on that in the
Housing Act 2004, which we passed in the last Parliament. We could have
said to owners of houses in multiple occupation&#151;the most
inefficient properties in the UK&#146;s property
portfolio&#151;that, as a condition of their obtaining an HMO
licence, those properties, too, would have to meet the minimum standard
of SAP 65. We could have given a stamp duty rebate on properties that
had been turned into energy generating properties, but we declined to
do that in the Budget.</p><p><a name="06101630000070">We could have introduced
building and planning regulations to empower local authorities to
require that all new buildings generate a proportion of their own
energy and recycle water resources. I visited a school just outside
Nottingham that recycles 50 per cent. of the water that falls on its
roof and has thereby halved its water bill. I was impressed, but I was
told that doing that was an obligation in some German states. The
Germans understood that they had problems of flash flooding that needed
to be tackled, so they told local authorities that such recycling had
to be a duty. We retreat from such action. In the name of light-touch
regulation, we abrogate our responsibilities to the future and to the
planet.</p><p><a name="06101630000071">If we are
serious about transforming our economy into one in which we can live
sustainably, within a single footprint of our ecological entitlements,
we have to have the courage to transform markets radically. We must not
be anti-market; we must become pro-ethical markets and pro-sustainable
markets. In the process of doing that, we will discover that there will
be markets that we own collectively. That would be a wonderful legacy
for this Prime Minister; to be remembered for restoring clause IV and
the principles of common ownership in the interests of a sustainable

subject. That was well summarised in the Treasury paper issued in 2002
under the Chancellor&#146;s name, which
said:</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_39"><a name="06101633000004"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For both consumers
and businesses alike, economic instruments such as tax can enable

efficient way.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101633000005">The paper went on to make an
important point that both Conservative and Labour Members
misunderstand; it said that the revenue raised by environmental taxes
could also be used to reduce the level of other taxes. Some Members
appear not to appreciate that it is possible to raise revenue and to
change behaviour at the same time within a wide range of elasticities.
Several hon. Members struggled to get their heads around this point.
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)
raised this issue several times before disappearing. Perhaps the
Treasury can arrange a private seminar to clear up some of the
misunderstandings.</p><p><a name="06101633000006">The
one element of controversy that the Minister for Climate Change and the
Environment, the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson), tried to
introduce related to whether it was a sensible objective to try to
increase the share of taxation or of the national economy raised by
environmental taxes. He described this as simplistic and wrong. Perhaps
I can encourage him to read an excellent speech written by the
Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Wentworth
(John Healey), two years ago in which he said precisely the opposite.
He said that the Government&#146;s aim</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_40"><a name="06101633000007"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in the broadest sense, was to
move the burden of tax over time from good to bad.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101633000008">In practice, the opposite has
happened. We have had an increasing share of taxation on good
activities such as work and a declining share of taxation raised from
environmental pollution. I thought it might be a bit imprudent for
departmental Ministers to talk about Treasury language as simplistic
and wrong, but no doubt the Minister has his reasons for doing
so.</p><p><a name="06101633000009">The Minister,
however, was a model of constructive argument compared with the

for Bexhill and Battle was in the House at the time, but I remember
when the Conservatives supported civil disobedience against increased
petrol duties. I have sat on the Committee that considers the Finance
Bill for many years, ever since the climate change levy was introduced.
Conservatives opposed the levy in principle, and not on the grounds of
the current, rather subtle arguments about the balance of carbon
taxation&#151;that is, of course, a perfectly sensible comment, but
it is not what they said for many
years.</p><p><a name="06101633000013">The hon.
Gentleman endeavoured to rubbish our policies by referring to Friends
of the Earth, which he now claims has endorsed Conservative
environmental policy. A few weeks ago, Friends of the Earth

check his support in Friends of the Earth.</p><p><a name="06101633000015">Many of the things that we are
advancing from these Benches are not specifically Liberal Democrat
ideas. The Conservative spokesman, in particular, seemed to overlook
the work of the Environmental Audit Committee, which has a Conservative
Chair and a majority of Labour Members. What he called the obsession
with gas guzzling Chelsea tractors is almost identical to the policy
that that all-party group put forward. The numbers were checked out
with the Department of Trade and Industry. We did not manufacture the
calculations.</p><p><a name="06101633000016">The
same Committee described the current taxation policy in relation to
aviation as &#147;scandalous&#148;, because of the
Government&#146;s failure to adopt higher aviation taxes. That did
not come specifically from Members on the Liberal Democrat Benches; it
was an all-party consensus. For a variety of reasons, it is right to
say that the Government&#146;s policy on aviation, in particular, is
scandalous. Aviation is the sector in which the growth of emissions is
most rapid and the damage is disproportionate. A typical flight from
London to Glasgow or Edinburgh produces 10 times as much carbon dioxide
per passenger as a rail journey or, for that matter, a coach
journey&#151;it is roughly equivalent. There have been repeated
studies&#151;some of them are very good&#151;from the Department
for Transport about the environmental externalities generated by the
aviation sector that are not currently captured. For many years, the
aviation sector has been grossly undertaxed. The landing charges are
hopelessly below what would be a realistic economic rate. Landing
rights are not auctioned. There is no taxation of fuel and the current
system of taxing tickets is exceedingly inefficient.</p><p><a name="06101633000017">One of the main significances
of our policy is that it is designed to make taxation of the aviation
sector much more environmentally friendly, encouraging
airlines&#151;particularly low-cost airlines&#151;to use their
capacity much more effectively. That is why we have

the approach has been endorsed by so many people on their

conclusion&#151;I want to give the Minister a chance to
respond&#151;it may be useful to go back to the basic areas of
consensus and the 2002 paper that establishes the framework within
which we should be debating the subject. The Green Alliance commented
positively on that paper, describing it as a</p><a name="61016-0004.htmbrev_42"><a name="06101633000413"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;significant driver of policy over

change of heart and tone, and it will be good to see exactly what they

successfully. However, we need a range of measures, so it is misleading

Member for Twickenham is nodding in assent&#151;but although
&#163;8 billion will come from the package that we are talking about,
we do not know where the other &#163;12 billion will come from. At

need the right mix of tax measures, trading, obligations and
regulations, so that is what we have been developing. We especially
need to deliver the promise of emissions trading. In June, we announced
a national allocation plan that will reduce UK emissions by 8
million tonnes of carbon, over business as usual, between 2008 and
2012. That amount is far in excess of our Kyoto obligations and
demonstrates our commitment to the scheme. The scheme will be a way of
tackling carbon emissions Europe wide that will be much more effective
than a UK-only tax. We will be working with the Commission and our
European partners to ensure that we have an effective scheme in place.
We want aircraft fuel to be included in the scheme as soon as possible
so that we can have the pan-European solution on aircraft fuel that we
need.</p><p><a name="06101633000031">My hon. Friend
the Member for Scunthorpe drew attention to the fact that my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister met the governor of California over the
summer to discuss US interest in participating in emissions trading.
Since that visit, and to some extent encouraged by that visit,
California has legislated for state-wide carbon reductions, which the
governor has said will require a carbon emissions trading scheme. At
the governor&#146;s request, UK Government officials are soon to
advise the Californians on how to set that up. That is the right way to
go, aiming for a worldwide approach that can deliver a change in
worldwide behaviour. Such is the scale of ambition that we need, by
contrast with the rather parochial tone of what we heard from the
Liberal Democrats this evening.</p><br>

amenity space, insufficient parking or on site turning, is detrimental
to the street scene and will be overbearing on neighbouring houses, not

Paul Truswell (Pudsey) (Lab):</b> This debate is prompted by
concerns arising from the interim report on the land use planning
process produced by Kate Barker. My fear, and the fear of many of my
constituents, is that it will effectively lead to calls for a reduction
in opportunities for community involvement. In fact, I contend that
there is too little community involvement in the planning process and
that what we have should be made to work better and even enhanced. It
should not be diluted or removed.</p><p><a name="0610171000370">In my experience, and mine is no
exception, there are few areas where there are not tensions between
developments&#151;usually housing, but not always&#151;and the
local community. Without touching the heights of hyperbole, I submit
that in my experience of 25 years as both councillor and MP, the
planning process has been the single most significant vehicle for local
people's engagement in the local democratic process.</p><p><a name="0610171000371">Shortly after being granted this
debate, I was contacted by a faith community in my constituency. Its
comments and experience of the system demonstrate that, while the
present approach has many potential components for community
participation, those are very limited in practice. It is at this point
that I regret not wearing my reading spectacles because my office has
supplied me with a rather poor photocopy. Basically, my constituents
point with some approbation to a number of Government documents. Those
include the UK sustainable development strategy and the sustainable
communities plan, the sentiments of which they welcome. They have also
raised the issue of the contents of the &#147;Diversity and Equality
in Planning&#148; document, which was produced by the Office of the
Deputy Prime Minister in January 2004.</p><p><a name="0610171000372">If I may, I will allow my
constituents to speak for themselves for a short time by reading what
they have written to me:</p><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_49"><a name="0610171000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This

well known by Planning Officers in our experience, for whom a
&#145;one size fits all&#146; attitude is deeply entrenched,
arising from complacency but effectively resulting in widespread
discrimination against significant parts of society, especially
&#145;hard to reach&#146; groups, including many faith
communities.</p></ul><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_51"><a name="0610171000406"><ul><p class="tabletext">We are
therefore concerned that the current Regional Spatial Strategy reviews
and Local Development Framework preparation are accompanied by
effective and widespread community involvement. &#145;Statements of
community involvement&#146; are required as an integral part of the
new style LDF. Time will tell whether these SCIs will deliver more
effective consultation both with policy and major planning
applications. Much will depend on individual authorities' willingness
to engage in genuine consultation and take note of responses from the
community.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610171000374">While those
are the views of just one group in my constituency, I believe from
experience that they are very representative of the concerns regarding
involvement in the planning process, and that involvement is under
threat.</p><p><a name="0610171000375">Streamlining
the planning process is a bit like trying to streamline democracy. As

in aid of my arguments&#151;democracy is the worst form of
government, apart from all the rest. In other words, you win some and
you lose some. There is rough and smooth for all parties, and the
planning process is no exception.</p><p><a name="0610171000376">Communities in my constituency
are in continual conflict with planners and developers over excessive
and overbearing housing and office developments. We are not talking
about nimbyism. It really disappoints me when civil servants and
sometimes even Ministers caricature local opposition to planning
applications as nimbyism. My constituents often recognise the case for
development, especially on derelict and redundant industrial sites.
They do not want to see decaying eyesores on their doorsteps, but they
want to ensure that there is some semblance of sustainability and
sensitivity to their needs and to the problems and character of their
neighbourhood. Such key considerations often get lost in the pursuit of
profit.</p><p><a name="0610171000377">All too often,
we see planning applications submitted at densities of up to 80 or 90
properties per hectare. In most cases, local opposition, in which I
have been proud to be involved regularly, has reduced that to 50 or
less.</p><p><a name="0610171000378">If one asks
businesses and developers, as Ms Barker did in her review, whether the
planning process is an obstacle to enterprise, they are bound to say
that it is. All regulations, whether health and safety measures, the
minimum wage, anti-discrimination legislation or environmental
protection requirements, to name but a few, are unpopular in certain
quarters, but they need to be weighed in the balance. We certainly do
not want community involvement in planning to be offered as a glib
sacrifice to the cutting of red tape or even to globalisation.
Businesses are answerable to their shareholders, and the bottom line of
their balance sheet matters. There is nothing inherently wrong in that
approach, but community involvement in the planning process, including
resistance to demands for overbearing development or inappropriate
planning permission is very much regarded as a debit on their balance
sheets.</p><p><a name="0610171000379">From a
community point of view, however, the planning process is already
skewed in favour of the developer. Applicants have a right of appeal
against refusal, but communities do not. The argument is that the
elected council that determines the planning application represents the
community interest, but sometimes councils give themselves planning
permission. Occasionally, they simply get it wrong, as the wool is
pulled over their eyes. My hon. Friend the Minister may have heard of
Silver Cross prams, whose factory was based in my constituency for most
of the last century. Some years ago, consultants were appointed to
&#147;rescue&#148; the company, and said that half the site had to
be redesignated for housing to subsidise its recovery. Having held a
gun at the council&#146;s head, they received planning permission,
and departed with cash for the sale of the land, leaving the
company&#146;s recovery to someone else. That was all legitimate, but
quite wrong in the eyes of the local community. A third-party right of
appeal would at least have allowed a challenge to that travesty, with
which the community must now live in perpetuity.</p><p><a name="0610171000380">The
UDP&#151;unitary development plan&#151;process demonstrates the way
in which the community must

<notus-date day="16" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>16 Oct 2006 : Column 705</b><br>play catch-up. Only objectors can be represented at inquiries, but the
UDP has been overridden on scores of industrial brownfield sites in my
area that have been redesignated for housing. Given the omission of the
community from the key inquiry stage, it is vital that it
retain the right to challenge each departure from the UDP. At
this point, it is appropriate to refer to the regional spatial
strategy. Despite its importance, the RSS is regarded very much as a
top-down, inaccessible part of the planning process. For example,
housing targets set at that undemocratic level often result in the die
being cast before planning applications are made at local level, which
is when they can be challenged by communities.</p><p><a name="0610171000381">Those planning issues affect my
whole constituency. Applications for over-intensive and inappropriate
development have been made, and continue to be made in Pudsey, Yeadon,
Horsforth, Rodley and Farsley, but I wish to concentrate on the
experience of the town of Guiseley. Planning permissions over the past
six or seven years have given the go-ahead for about 1,200 extra
homes&#151;a 30 per cent. increase, I estimate, in the size of the
town, without a commensurate increase in local infrastructure to
support it. In my area, developers, as I said, invariably submit plans
for housing with a density of 70 to 90 properties per hectare on
brownfield sites, which is well above the 30 to 50 properties per
hectare indicated by PPG 3. They argue that the sites fulfil PPG
requirements for greater density, because of transport links and other
factors. In almost all cases, community involvement and pressure has
led to the rejection of initial planning applications, and subsequent
ones are reduced to about 50 properties per hectare&#151;in some
cases, that is almost half the figure in the original
application.</p><p><a name="0610171000382">Developers
or even planning officers point to a local station, for example, or the
existence of a major road corridor with bus services, as evidence of
good public transport links. The community, however, points to a
station at which trains do not stop, because they are full as a result
of lack of capacity and overcrowding at peak times. They point out that
bus services have been reduced and become far less reliable in the 20
years since deregulation was introduced. Section 106 agreements can be
used to derive a contribution from developers towards infrastructure,
including crossings, road improvements, open space, public transport
and school buildings.</p><p><a name="0610171000383">However, it is often the
cumulative effect of developments, rather than a single development,
that creates the pressures and it is difficult, therefore, to apportion
section 106 contributions to individual developments over time to
address those cumulative effects. Many local authorities do not have a
coherent strategic approach to the negotiation and use of 106 moneys.
Certainly, in my experience, there is little community involvement in
determining how it is used. All too often, it is used in a very ad hoc
way.</p><p><a name="0610171000384">No one can deny
the need for affordable housing, but developers will often come up with
reasons for having less affordable housing than is needed. The cost of
decontaminating land is a favourite excuse, or developers offer to
build at lower densities if they do not have to include a full quota of
affordable homes. Councils&#146; role as the &#147;people&#146;s
champion&#148; in the

They are not always on the ball when it comes to promoting community
involvement.</p><p><a name="0610171000385">Statements
of community involvement, required by the Planning and Compulsory
Purchase Act 2004, often pay lip service to community requirements.
There is a crying need&#151;so far unmet&#151;for an action plan in
areas such as Guiseley and other parts of my constituency, such as
Horsforth and Pudsey, to be drawn up with the local community to
address how the area can cope with substantial growth in new house
building. The 2004 Act allows for those action plans, but we have yet
to see them emerge in the communities that I
represent.</p><p><a name="0610171000386">All that
adds up to one inescapable conclusion: the present system for community
involvement in planning is limited. Even as it stands, it is not being
used to its full potential, but to move away from what we have
got&#151;which may be what Barker recommends&#151;would be a
retrograde step that must be resisted. While I welcome the
Government&#146;s commitments in the policy document &#147;Public
Involvement: the Government&#146;s Objectives&#148;, there is a
wide gap between the aspirations and the experience of people on the
ground. I have listed some of the challenges to greater participation,
but there are others, which are also undermining the credibility of the
system.</p><p><a name="0610171000387">A significant
challenge relates to the poor implementation of existing regulations,
such as statements of community involvement. Many&#151;57 out of
168&#151;SCIs have been sent back by the planning inspectorate
because of basic procedural flaws, including the failure to consult
parish councils and other important community organisations. That seems
to indicate that some local authorities are not prioritising the basic
requirements of SCIs, let alone including new ways of having dialogue
with their
communities.</p><p><a name="0610171000388">The
ambition of the 2004 Act for greater participation is not being met,
largely because of a lack of resources and a culture in the profession
that continues to believe that &#147;We know best&#148;. While
planning aid has made some difference, many individuals and communities
get little or no support with the technical language and procedures of
the planning process. Developers often have access to professional
expertise to make their case, while important community voices are not
heard.</p><p><a name="0610171000389">The second and
greatest challenge&#151;as I have already suggested&#151;comes from
Kate Barker&#146;s interim report. That report, along with annex A of
the energy review&#151;a preserve of the Department of Trade and
Industry&#151;has raised questions about the merits of public
involvement in everything from major infrastructure projects to the
details of local development frameworks. My concern&#151;shared by
many people in my constituency&#151;is that those two documents
constitute an assault on local constitutional arrangements, based on a
very narrow economic analysis of the benefits of the planning system.
At the very least, it sends the wrong message to the profession and the
public.</p><p><a name="0610171000390">The interim
Barker report does not provide any analysis of the very significant
barriers to public participation that exist in the system now. Nor is
there

the development industry currently enjoys. On only one occasion does
the report touch on the unequal distribution of rights of redress.
Paragraph 4.32
states:</p><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_52"><a name="0610171000407"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
also the case that not all the processes work against development: the
lack of a third party right of appeal can work to favour economic
growth, for example, as applicants can appeal a rejected decision while
opponents of development are not able to appeal a successful
application.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610171000391">That
celebration of the absence of basic rights of redress in planning for
communities illustrates the review team&#146;s inability to consider
the wider importance of planning in local government.</p><p><a name="0610171000392">I am also particularly concerned
about proposals to abolish the right to be heard in the preparation of
statements of community involvement. The interim report raises further
concerns about existing levels of consultation in the planning process.
Paragraph 3.36 describes the requirement for statements of community
involvement as</p><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_53"><a name="0610171000408"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;overly
prescriptive about consultation, and process
driven&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0610171000393">It alleges
that:</p><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_54"><a name="0610171000409"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;complexity is
compounded by the large range of statutory consultees, local groups and
other stakeholders who are engaged in the decision-making
process&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0610171000394">There appears to
be a growing view that the right to be heard in testing the statements
of community involvement established by the 2004 Act may be under
threat.</p><p><a name="0610171000395">I accept that
although SCIs can and should be made more effective, the withdrawal of
that right would send entirely the wrong message to planning
professionals and communities. It implies that participation is to be
cut back and that the Government believe that participation has gone
too far, when precisely the opposite is true. Great care is needed to
ensure that that message does not further compromise effective
community
participation.</p><p><a name="0610171000396">The
Barker report also appears to question the established plan-led system.
For example, paragraph 4.30
states:</p><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_55"><a name="0610171000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
nature of the plan led system may also be causing a sub-optimal supply
of development, partly as plans may reflect some of the structural
problems identified above and in part because investment opportunities
that arise after the plan has been agreed may have more difficulty
gaining approval if not in accordance with the
plan.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610171000397">One can only assume
that correcting the problem will lead to the final report softening the
emphasis on a plan-led system. That would have a huge effect on the
participation debate, because there is little or no point in having
robust community rights of participation if the final plan has only a
limited impact on the way decisions are reached. Many communities would
simply ask, &#147;What&#146;s the point in
participating?&#148;</p><p><a name="0610171000398">Where
do we go from here? As the final Barker report is due out in December,
can my hon. Friend the Minister give some assurance that public
participation will be carefully considered in any reform package? In
particular, we need a more balanced analysis of planning that does not
focus solely on the needs of business; it is public legitimacy that
requires support if we are to deliver the integration of sustainable

constituents.</p><p><a name="0610174000002">One
of the key aims of the Government&#146;s reform of the planning
system centres on community engagement. We want both more and
better-quality community engagement. Our aims were first set out in
&#147;Community Involvement in Planning: the Government&#146;s
Objectives&#148;, published in February 2004. They were confirmed in
the cornerstone of Government planning policy, to which my hon. Friend
referred, planning policy statement 1, &#147;Delivering Sustainable
Development&#148;, published in February
2005.</p><p><a name="0610174000003">In its key
principles, planning policy statement 1
states:</p><a name="61016-0005.htmbrev_56"><a name="0610174000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Community
involvement is an essential element in delivering sustainable
development and creating sustainable and safe communities. In
developing the vision for their areas, planning authorities should
ensure that communities are able to contribute to ideas about how that
vision can be achieved, have the opportunity to participate in the
process of drawing up the vision, strategy and specific plan policies,
and to be involved in development
proposals.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610174000004">The statement
goes on to note that community involvement in planning should not be a
reactive, tick-box process, but enable the local community to say what
sort of place they want to live in at a stage when it can make a
difference. Effective community involvement requires an approach that
tells communities about emerging policies and proposals in good time,
and it must enable them to put forward ideas and suggestions and
participate in developing proposals and options. It is not sufficient
simply to invite them to comment once the proposals have been worked
up. Consultation on formal proposals is required, and such an approach
must ensure that consultation takes place in locations that are widely
accessible, and it must provide and seek feedback. Involvement is
clearly more effective the earlier it takes place in the
process.</p><p><a name="0610174000005">Through the
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, there is a statutory
requirement for local authorities to consult the local community on
local development frameworks via the statement of community
involvement, to which my hon. Friend rightly referred at length. This
ensures that groups are involved in development plan processes. The
statement of community involvement also has to set out the local
authority&#146;s policy on involving its community in consulting on
planning
applications.</p><p><a name="0610174000006">Regional
planning bodies are also required to prepare, publish and keep under
review a statement of public participation on regional spatial
strategies, to which my hon. Friend referred. The regional planning
body, in preparing the RSS, should work in partnership

key organisations and the wider community can be involved and inform
the strategy&#146;s content.</p><p><a name="0610174000007">My Department has produced
material to help local authorities in preparing their statements of
community involvement. Our good practice guide, &#147;Creating Local
Development Frameworks&#148;, contains a chapter on producing
statements of community involvement, and we undertook a comprehensive
roll-out programme in the autumn of 2004, including seminars in each
region on statement of community involvement production. We are taking
every opportunity to encourage good practice, including close liaison
between planning and local government group officials within the
Department, to ensure that local authorities take an approach that will
enable the best use of their sometimes scarce resources, and to avoid
the danger of consultation
fatigue.</p><p><a name="0610174000008">Statements of
community involvement have played an important role in getting the
message across to local planning authorities, developers and the public
that effective community involvement is a central and underlying
principle of the &#147;new&#148; planning system. Some 300
statements of community involvement have been submitted to the Planning
Inspectorate for scrutiny. Nearly 120 have been adopted, and a further
88 have received a binding inspector&#146;s report. Out of this
total, one statement has been found to be &#147;unsound&#148; by
the Planning Inspectorate.</p><p><a name="0610174000009">My hon. Friend referred to the
inspectorate returning a large number statements of community
involvement because of procedural flaws. There was a specific problem
with a small number of the first statements to be submitted, in that
authorities had failed to consult parish councils adjoining their area.
That matter has been resolved and authorities are clear about the
regulatory requirements. I trust that my hon. Friend accepts that this
is a developing process and that, as people become more skilled in it,
they should get better.</p><p><a name="0610174000010">At the other end of the
spectrum, we already have, I am pleased to say, a number of very good
statements of community involvement, such as those developed by
Plymouth council, among others. They state their council&#146;s aim
to go further than the minimum requirements to ensure more innovative,
effective and wide-ranging community involvement. Importantly, they
also include comprehensive coverage of how the council will engage with
hard-to-reach groups&#151;another issue to which my hon. Friend
referred.</p><p><a name="0610174000011">The
Government are committed to ensuring that planning policies and
practice take account of the communities that they serve and reflect
the lives that people live today. Widespread social and demographic
changes over the last three decades mean that equality and diversity
issues are no longer minority considerations. Local planning
authorities need to keep up with that change. It is very important that
the views of the widest community are canvassed when local planning
issues are
considered.</p><p><a name="0610174000012">Statements
of community involvement should be aligned with other work done by
councils and their local strategic partnerships to ensure that
documents within the local development framework effectively reflect
the sustainable community strategies&#151;strategies that are the
vision

environmental well-being of each council&#146;s area. My Department
will publish revised draft guidance on local strategic partnerships and
sustainable community strategies later this year, and we have also
commissioned the Royal Town Planning Institute to write guidance
providing practical advice on how to improve the relationship between
local strategic partnerships and spatial planning. That guidance will
be issued alongside local strategic partnership guidance later this
year. We are working closely with a range of departments and
practitioners to make it as useful as possible.</p><p><a name="0610174000013">My hon. Friend identified the
need to address issues around housing growth. I assure him that we are
aware of the matter and we are examining how best to do that. It is
already my Department's policy to encourage developers to enter into
more consultation with local communities on large sites prior to the
submission of planning applications.</p><p><a name="0610174000014">My hon. Friend raised the
subject of section 106 agreements. In August 2006, we published
&#147;Planning Obligations: Practice Guidance&#148; and a model
section 106 agreement, the aims of which are to improve the
development, negotiation and implementation of planning obligations.
The Government are also considering responses to their proposal for a
planning gain supplement as a means to provide additional funding for
the infrastructure necessary to support growth. There will be further
announcements on that by the end of the year.</p><p><a name="0610174000015">My hon. Friend mentioned his
desire for third parties to have a right of appeal&#151;a matter that
he has raised on several occasions. Third parties do not have a right
of appeal in the way that applicants do because it is the
responsibility of local planning authorities to act in the general
public interest when determining planning applications. Local
authorities must determine planning applications in accordance with the
development plan for the area unless material considerations indicate
otherwise; those can include views expressed by local residents and
other parties.</p><p><a name="0610174000016">The
Government do not propose to change that position, because in our view
it goes straight to the heart of the democratic process. I am sorry to
have to disappoint my hon. Friend. Elected members must be allowed to
reject their officers&#146; advice, because it is the councillors,
not the officers, who are answerable to their electorate. A third party
right of appeal could be used to delay or effectively veto many
otherwise acceptable developments, which would bring benefits to local
communities in terms of homes, jobs and regeneration of
neighbourhoods.</p><p><a name="0610174000017">I am
sure that my hon. Friend shares my desire to see more people get the
chance of a step on the housing ladder, as well as better choice and
quality for those who rent. In the Yorkshire and Humber
region&#151;an area that he and I both represent&#151;the current
target for provision of homes is nearly 15,000 a year for the next 10
years. The Yorkshire and Humber plan is being revised and it will need
to set a new target for the provision of homes that is high enough to
deliver sustainable communities with high quality, affordable housing
for future generations.</p><p><a name="0610174000018">My hon. Friend referred to
people having difficulty accessing the planning process. Both
individuals and community groups rightly complain that they cannot

or local authorities. As he said, it is for that reason that the
Planning Aid organisation exists. It provides free expert planning
advice to people and communities who could not otherwise afford it. My
Department is providing &#163;5.3 million over five years to Planning
Aid to expand its services on a national basis. We have also supported
the expansion of so-called e-planning services, which enable people to
access more information online, and 95 per cent. of local authorities
are now rated good or excellent in provision of such
services.</p><p><a name="0610174000019">Following
Kate Barker&#146;s report on housing supply, the Government accepted
the case for a significant increase in supply. We accept that proper
community involvement is necessary if we are to realise our aim to
increase house building in England to 200,000 units per year in the
medium term. As my hon. Friend mentioned, Kate Barker&#146;s interim
report on her review of land use planning was issued in July. It
provided a helpful analysis of how the planning system currently
impacts on economic development. Although I

report&#146;s analysis, it is important to remember that it was an
interim report. Kate Barker has made it clear that it is vital that her
final recommendations do not advance business interests above
environmental and social interests.</p><p><a name="0610174000020">I assure my hon. Friend that,
wherever possible, we want communities and individuals themselves to
have control over the decisions that affect their lives and that, when
they have a contribution to make and where they are part of the
solution to problems, they are not held back. Better community
involvement requires a change in the culture of planning. I hope that
what I have said today provides some reassurance to my hon.
