<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41101-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Arts  (Estelle Morris): </b> 
 Some 236 theatres receive public subsidy from Arts Council England. In addition, local authorities invest more than &#163;220 million in the arts each year, some of which goes to theatres. The figures for Wales are a matter for the Welsh Assembly.

 Notwithstanding the fact that my right hon. Friend has no responsibility for Wales, I hope that she will visit the new millennium centre theatre in Cardiff soon. I believe that it holds the prospect of being one of best theatres in the land.

<a name="41101-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I want to ask my right hon. Friend about west end theatre. She knows that it is one of Britain&#039;s greatest assets, especially for foreign tourists. Yet 46,856 seats in London&#039;s west end theatres do not receive a single penny of state subsidy simply because they are run in the commercial sector, despite the fact that many are listed buildings. Is that fair? Is not it time that the Labour Government discovered some new way, perhaps a third way, of helping?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41101-01_spnew1"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I look forward to visiting the new millennium centre&#151;I wish it well. It is nice to go to places for which one does not have responsibility now and again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I readily acknowledge the excellence, worldwide reputation and contribution to the nation&#039;s economy of west end theatres. That contribution is estimated at approximately &#163;1.5 billion. As my hon. Friend knows, there is a genuine problem about publicly subsidising commercial theatres. However, I acknowledge theatres&#039; problems and, earlier this year, the Secretary of State and I brought together all interested parties, including theatres, local authorities and our Department. We asked people to try to devise what might be a third way; we certainly hope that it will be a strategy. We look forward to the report, which we expect some time before Christmas.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41101-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Nick Hawkins  (Surrey Heath)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister also appreciate that many important listed buildings provide wonderful productions throughout the country, not only in the west end? If the Minister and the Government are considering supporting great historic buildings in which theatres perform throughout the year, they should examine not only the specific problems of the listed theatres in London but of those throughout the country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41101-01_spnew3"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I readily accept that. Let us be clear: Ministers will not decide where the public funds go. Many buildings, including theatres that are listed and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 3</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those that are not, are vital to their community and often need repair and refurbishment. It is a long haul because there are many theatres and not as much money to go round.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Approximately half the money that is believed to be generated through theatres comes from the west end. Although I do not belittle or fail to understand the importance of theatres in their communities, there is something extra special about the London west end. If we witnessed its demise, everybody, no matter where our constituencies are based, would view that as a cause for sorrow. Let us hope that we are considering a question of not either/or but, over the years, both.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41101-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend referred to the role of local government in supporting local theatres. I know that she has visited the arts centre in the mechanics building in Burnley but not the theatre. Does she acknowledge that councils such as Burnley find it increasingly difficult to fund such arts centres and theatres and need more assistance from the Government, especially when local council budgets are being squeezed so tightly?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41101-01_spnew5"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 It may be that some local authorities find it difficult but many make it a priority. When they decide that the arts and culture are essential to their community, the money is found. I congratulate and thank local authorities that have prioritised those matters and urge those that have not to do so.

 (LD): What assessment she has made of the level of protection that the Gambling Bill gives to <i>(a)</i> young people and <i>(b)</i> other vulnerable persons.  [194567]
</p>



<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41101-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 The Gambling Bill, the Second Reading of which the House will debate later today, will provide significantly greater safeguards for children and vulnerable adults than the present law. The status quo is dangerous and unacceptable because the current law does not allow Government or the Gaming Board to regulate the many new technologies, such as video roulette machines, in betting shops or online gambling sites. Without the Bill, which has been strengthened by pre-legislative scrutiny, problem gambling is likely to increase. The safeguards will enable the regulator&#151; the proposed new gambling commission&#151;and the Government to keep the position firmly under control and to act swiftly to cut back the supply of gambling opportunities, should that prove necessary.
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41101-01_spnew6"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I hope that the Secretary of State accepts that the best estimate is that 300,000 people are defined as problem gamblers. During the scrutiny process, she told the Committee that, if the Bill produced more problem gamblers, it would have failed. Does she maintain the view that the 10 per cent. of the Bill that is controversial will not add one more problem gambler to the number? Given that no one else shares that view, will she reconsider the basis of her opinion?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 4</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41101-01_spnew7"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Maintaining the current low level of problem gambling is one of the Bill&#039;s objectives and protection from harm is a theme that runs all the way through the Bill. What has been lost in recent controversy about the Bill is the sheer scale of the gambling commission&#039;s power to wind back any liberalisation of the gambling regime in the event of harm being established. Moreover, through the gambling survey, we shall have clear figures providing a baseline on which we can judge future trends. The success of&#151;and, indeed, continued access to&#151;gambling technologies will be judged on their ability to provide entertainment rather than generating problem gambling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman that, given more gambling opportunities, there will not be a single extra problem gambler. It would be ridiculous to say that. People are at risk now from gambling on the internet and from unregulated offshore sites. But&#151;

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41101-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. Other Members may wish to ask questions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41101-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Frank Doran  (Aberdeen, Central)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Secretary of State accept that the greatest protection for gambling addicts is related to the number of casinos? I support the broad aims of the Bill, but I am worried about the potential for increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Let me give an example from my constituency. Two casinos serve north-east Scotland and, so far, Aberdeen city council has had to deal with six applications for outline planning permission for future casinos. I am particularly worried about the local authorities that will be involved in the licensing. I want to ensure that they are protected properly, because at present they are squeezed between protecting the interests of local electors and the enormous cost of appeals. I want a robust licensing system. Can the Secretary of State reassure me?
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41101-01_spnew10"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Let me make three quick points. In countries such as Australia, where problem gambling has become a major issue, the proliferation of machines rather than casinos has been responsible. We have learnt from that lesson. We also see the need for a tough regulator who can act to prevent harm. Finally, local authorities will have a clearly defined power to decide that they do not want any casinos in their areas. It will be effective for three years, and renewable thereafter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41101-01_spnew11"><b> Miss Julie Kirkbride  (Bromsgrove)</b> 
 (Con): Can the Secretary of State explain why the gaming machines to be found in chip shops, for instance, which offer a &#163;5 maximum payout for a 10p stake, are so corrupting to children? What evidence has she? Can she also explain why, given that local authorities already have power to ban such machines, they have not done so?
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41101-01_spnew12"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I welcome the hon. Lady&#039;s newly discovered interest in gambling, but we are pursuing the Bill&#039;s key objective, which is to protect children from gambling and, in particular, from the risks of ambient gambling&#151;chancing on a machine when they happen to be standing around doing something else. We intend to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 5</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>remove those risks from children, which is why the 6,000 entirely unregulated machines in chip shops, minicab offices and the like are to be withdrawn.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41101-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Bill Olner  (Nuneaton)</b> 
 (Lab): I welcome much of the Bill, but I find it offensive that large American companies will be able to buy planning permission for casinos from local authorities. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that that will be dealt with in Committee, and will not happen?
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41101-01_spnew14"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 American companies are already considerable investors in the United Kingdom economy. We will accept American investment, Japanese investment and Australian investment, but we will subject it to a British regulatory regime that is right for the people of this country and acceptable to them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41101-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Malcolm Moss  (North-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): All the experts, including the Secretary of State&#039;s own Ministers, agree that accessibility to gambling opportunities is the key factor contributing to a rise in problem gambling. How then can the Secretary of State claim to be increasing protection for children and the vulnerable when greater access is to be encouraged by withdrawing the membership rules, allowing ambient access to unlimited-prize category A gaming machines for the first time ever in this country, and when regional planning policy, run through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, positively skews the location of the new regional casinos towards the greatest density of population in our city centres?
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41101-01_spnew16"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 To deal with the third point first, that is not necessarily the case because the gambling commission may well decide to issue advice to local authorities by which they will be bound about the criteria that should be applied when considering the location of the very large casinos. But that is a perfectly reasonable question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">With regard to getting rid of membership rules, modern gambling is not about membership of gentlemen&#039;s clubs. People gamble as a leisure pursuit in ever increasing numbers, so we seek to strike a proper boundary between the legitimate right of adults to choose to spend their leisure time as they wish within the law, while at the same time regulating for human frailty, protecting the vulnerable, and, in particular, protecting children from the harm that gambling can create.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41101-01_spnew17"><b> David Winnick  (Walsall, North)</b> 
 (Lab): I recognise that perhaps as much as 90 per cent. of the Bill can be supported, but is my right hon. Friend aware that there are two anxieties&#151;that there is no maximum number of casinos and, that that, inevitably, along with other clauses in the Bill, is bound to increase gambling? Why should we be involved in doing so, when already too many vulnerable people are in gambling debt and that can only increase? There is a great deal to be said for the Cabinet and my right hon. Friend reconsidering the controversial aspects of the measure and then coming back to the House. As it stands, some of us will find it impossible to vote for it at 10 o&#039;clock.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41101-01_spnew18"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I respect my hon. Friend&#039;s views. I know that gambling is an issue that will divide the House on other than the normal party political lines and I respect the views of those who feel that gambling is quite simply wrong. But in relation to the very large casinos that have been the subject of much of the controversy and publicity in the last week or so, the estimate&#151;it is an industry estimate, not a Government one&#151;is that there are likely to be between 20 and 40. I will not now but later set out in detail the tough regulatory regime, a combination of the role of the gambling commission and the planning regime, that will determine whether they develop in any part of the country at all.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41101-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 Decisions as to whether particular activities and pastimes should be recognised as sports for official and funding purposes are made by unanimous agreement between the sports councils.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41101-02_spnew0"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 Does the Minister agree that millions of people who play darts regard it as a sport, as do local and national newspapers and television?

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41101-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I know that the hon. Gentleman feels strongly about this, but I refer him again to the Sports Council, which is certainly not elitist and does an extremely good job, as he knows. The definition goes back to the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937. I ask him to reflect on whether darts fits into the category of &quot;physical training and recreation&quot;. The sports bodies say no, and that was confirmed in a review in 1997, and again by UK Sport in 2000, as he has been told on previous occasions.

 The second phase of Ofcom&#039;s public service television review, published on 30 September, represents an important contribution to the debate about the future of public service broadcasting. All Ofcom&#039;s proposals, including 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 7</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those relating to regional television in England, are currently out to consultation, following which Ofcom will publish its final recommendations in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41101-02_spnew2"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 What is the Government&#039;s vision for the future of ITV? Does the Minister understand the concern of the people working in regional ITV and watching it about Ofcom&#039;s proposal to reduce the obligations and its warning that even that reduced level may not be sustainable? Does she want ITV to continue into the longer term as a regional broadcaster? Given that, after digital switchover, the licence will not have its previous value, what system of sticks and carrots could she bring to bear to ensure that ITV remains a regional broadcaster?
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41101-02_spnew3"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The vision is one that continues ITV&#039;s current regional obligations. Members of Parliament will well know the importance of regional broadcasting as a means of communicating, at least from this place, to people elsewhere. After digital switchover, whenever it arrives, things will change, and I see the paper that Ofcom has published very much as an opportunity to discuss important issues about what regional programming might look like in the future. It is not for Government to comment now. The consultation is still open, and Ofcom will reflect on it and let us know its decision. There is a statutory framework that means that regional programming obligations will continue, but how they are manifested is not set in stone. We must keep our minds open about what changes may be necessary in the light of technological advances.
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="41101-02_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight  (South Dorset)</b> 
 (Lab): The creative industries are among the most important industries in the south-west, working closely with higher education establishments in places such as Plymouth, Bristol and Bournemouth. Those establishments in turn have a strong and important relationship with regional broadcasters, which help to sustain them as institutions. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that she will be robust with Ofcom to ensure that regional TV production is retained, in order to support the important creative industries in my region?
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="41101-02_spnew5"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I acknowledge the importance of the creative industries as a sector that is growing at twice the rate of any other industrial sector in our country, so of course we must ensure that we train for it and establish links from universities into its work. I do not foresee a future with no regional programming obligations on either ITV or the BBC, and I believe that the Ofcom report made that clear, but we are in a period of change, and change brings uncertainty. With digital switchover on the horizon, it would be silly to bury our head in the sand and think that those regional obligations could continue in exactly their current form, but I am sure that Ofcom will bear in mind the important and valuable point that my hon. Friend makes.

<br>&nbsp;<br>finance it is of diminishing value? Will she be prepared to bite the bullet and at least not rule out in advance any sensible and imaginative means of finding the resources to fund this essential local programming when, before very long, it becomes necessary?
</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="41101-02_spnew7"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I agreed with the first two thirds of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question, but it is too early to go beyond the consultation on the Ofcom document. It would be unwise, while that consultation continues, to say what the Government&#039;s plans are. The nature of the consultation is to listen. Let there be no misunderstanding: the proposal in the document concerned a reduction from three hours to one and a half affecting non-news items at off-peak hours only. He did not mention it, but I share his great concern that regional news should be covered at a regional level. That is an important element of a strong democracy, with strong accountability. Let me put it on the record that Ofcom has not suggested any change on that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="41101-02_spnew8"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Minister aware of real concern in Wales about the possible loss of an independent terrestrial broadcaster, and is she aware in particular of the important role of independent TV news? Will she assure us that she will not countenance a situation in which the BBC operates the only regional TV news network in Wales?
</p>








<p><a name="st_32"><a name="41101-02_spnew9"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point; the BBC has an important part to play in regional broadcasting, but there is an issue about making sure that more than one organisation has that obligation. I will reflect on his comments and make sure that they are fed back as part of the consultation process.
</p>








<p><a name="st_33"><a name="41101-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Simon Thomas  (Ceredigion)</b> 
 (PC): Further to that answer, does the Minister agree that ITV in the Welsh context is not just a regional broadcaster but the national English-language broadcaster? There is more to culture and nation than simply news: in fact, most people do not listen to the news but to drama and light entertainment, which also help to inform their views about democracy. From that perspective, is it not vital that we retain a commercial interest and a commercial station broadcasting in Wales, and in the regions of England?
</p>








<p><a name="st_34"><a name="41101-02_spnew11"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right in some ways. In the regions of England, it probably is the news that is most important and of most interest. The position in the other countries is different from that in England, and Ofcom recognised that in its consultation document and is giving the point special attention. I join the hon. Gentleman in saying that regional television in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is important linguistically and culturally, and I am pleased that that has been reflected in the consultation document.

 It is the London Olympics in the United Kingdom. We have always been absolutely clear about that, and that is the basis on which Opposition parties have supported the games.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that support in Scotland for a London Olympics is significantly lower than in the rest of the United Kingdom. There are some good reasons for that. She must explain clearly to those in Scotland what is in this for them.

The Secretary of State will be aware that the current plans require a great deal of the funding for the bid, if successful, to come from the Olympic lottery that is to be introduced. Is she aware that the regulatory impact assessment for the Gambling Bill shows that, if that Bill goes ahead, the receipts to the Olympic lottery will be cut, possibly by as much as &#163;27 million a year, which is more than &#163;100 million over five years? How does she plan to plug that gap?

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="41101-02_spnew21"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 We will discuss the detail of the Gambling Bill later.

The cost to both could be considerable.

 Neither the Sydney games nor the Athens games had the degree of budgetary detail established at the point at which we are now.

</p>



<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41101-03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Arts  (Estelle Morris): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issued a statement in July 2004 on the progress being made towards digital switchover. She noted that although broadcasters had not reached a full consensus, some had suggested that 2012 might be the most appropriate date for the completion of switchover. However, a final decision on the timetable has not yet been taken.
</p>








<p><a name="st_49"><a name="41101-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Sanders: </b> 
 What is the Government&#039;s response to pensioners in my constituency who get a free TV licence but who will not be able to receive any television pictures when the digital switchover takes place? Will they get a bit extra in their pensions to compensate?
</p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41101-03_spnew1"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I apologise if I have not quite understood the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question, but one of the requirements for switchover is that anybody who receives terrestrial television now will be able to receive digital television. On helping vulnerable groups, he referred to elderly pensioners in his constituency, but as he knows, we have asked that a committee be set up to advise us on that. Consideration of the help that vulnerable groups may need will be one of the factors influencing our decision about when switchover will take place.

</p>








<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41101-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 The Minister may be aware that, in many parts of my constituency, we do not have an adequate analogue service and few people believe that that situation will improve come the digital switchover. There is serious concern in the northern isles that, come the digital switchover, we will again be left behind. Will she and her colleagues therefore give some consideration to the proposals from the independent consumer expert group that at least 99.5 per cent. of the population in each region, and not just in the UK as a whole, should be able to receive a digital signal at the point of switchover?
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41101-03_spnew3"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I shall certainly consider the recommendations of any group that is looking into this matter, because I accept that it is important. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) both have constituencies in which reception of the analogue signal is not great and digital reception is even worse. That situation will remain until switchover. The dilemma of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents is that, unless we can get more spectrum, we will not be able to aid them. This is an important switchover to make, but it is absolutely right that we do not make it until we are in receipt of all the information, and that we do it in an orderly and proper way.

 (Lab): As a Member from a constituency that also has large areas without an analogue signal, I hope that we do not delay the matter indefinitely, as no resources are being spent on upgrading the analogue signal in advance of digital switchover. As well as the geographical criteria, there is an affordability criterion, which the Government recognise in providing free television licences for over-75s. I appreciate that my right hon. Friend will not want to blight the market at this stage, but will she at least acknowledge that the Government understand that some older and poorer people may need assistance in respect of the set-top box, or whatever the technology is by 2012, to help them to make the digital switchover?
</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41101-03_spnew5"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 Of course I accept that there is an issue, otherwise the Government would not have acted as they have done to introduce free television licences for vulnerable groups. That is exactly why we have set up Ofcom&#039;s independent consumer panel to look at how the whole of digital switchover may affect vulnerable groups. I am not in a position to say more than that, merely because we are awaiting the report of that panel, but my hon. Friend can rest assured that the matter is on our mind&#151;although that is not a commitment as to exactly what we will do.

Is she aware that, even at present, the system used for compressing technology and television on freeview is already out of date? She said that 2012 might be the time for digital switchover. Will she consider before the next election whether we will use the current system of digital terrestrial television or a system that can increase the number of channels threefold or fourfold?
</p>








<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41101-03_spnew7"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s question is incredibly technical, and I would not claim to match his knowledge on that point. The key issue is that we need more spectrum. Unless we get more spectrum, nothing will change, and we will neither help the constituents of the hon. Members for Torbay and for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) to receive the analogue signal nor enable the 25 per cent. who cannot currently receive digital switchover to do so. That is exactly why the Government have set up bodies, organisations, panels and consumer and broadcast interest groups to make recommendations and advise us on the technicalities. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that we will take all those matters into account before finally announcing the date of switchover.

</p>



<p><a name="st_57"><a name="41101-03_spmin1"><b>The Minister for the Arts  (Estelle Morris): </b> 
 The criteria for the allocation of lottery funds depend on the distributing body and the individual funding

<br>&nbsp;<br>programme concerned. We have set the framework in policy and financial directions for the distributors and they have drawn up strategic plans and funding policies.
</p>








<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41101-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Luff: </b> 
 The general taxpayer has often paid for many good causes through his or her taxes, particularly health and education. The purpose of the lottery is to provide money for other things that general taxation did not pay for&#151;in particular, arts, the Community Fund, heritage and sport. So why is arts funding down &#163;160 million a year under this Government, the Community Fund down &#163;140 million, heritage lottery funding down &#163;120 million and sports down &#163;140 million, while the New Opportunities Fund, all of which should be paid from general taxation, is up &#163;450 million?
</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="41101-03_spnew9"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 Part of the reason why the revenues to the original funding streams have changed is that, not this year, but previously, sale of tickets had decreased. There is a direct correlation: if not as many people buy tickets, not as much money is sent to the good causes. I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question, which I think was additionality. Of course, education, health and the environment have statutory funding, but let me take, for example, two of the things that have been funded from the New Opportunities Fund&#151;after-school homework clubs and the fruit initiative in schools. Those have never been funded out of general taxation for citizens. That expenditure has gone on at exactly the same time as there has been a massive increase in the amount of taxpayers&#039; money&#151;public funding&#151;going to the education and health services and environment. It cannot have replaced direct funding from the Government because Government funding for each of those key services has increased far more than ever it did under the Government whom the hon. Gentleman supported.

</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="41101-03_spnew11"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I will do that. It is important that feedback is given to Members of Parliament. Many right hon. and hon. Members have been helpful in working with the lottery distributors to make sure that their constituents get what might be termed a fair share of the resources. I agree that money doing direct to community use is of great benefit. As my hon. Friend will know, more than half the awards go to the 100 most deprived local authorities. I am sure he shares my pleasure at that.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 14</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>projects&#151;with the result that the money given to the original good causes last year was less than half the amount it was when the last Conservative Government left office? The Government&#039;s own report estimates that the increase in other gambling as a result of the Gambling Bill may lead to a further loss of up to &#163;70 million from the lottery. Is it not sad that on the lottery&#039;s 10th anniversary, the Government seem intent on inflicting still further damage to the good causes?
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="41101-03_spnew13"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 I can well understand the hon. Gentleman, seven years later, trying to find something to claim credit for under the previous Conservative Administration. I give credit to him. I seem to remember, but I may be wrong, that the introduction of the lottery received support from all parties in the House. Never mind; it was a good initiative and it has brought a great deal of much-needed funding to good causes and to other services as well. All I have to say in addition to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) is that if my memory serves me right, we made it clear in our 1997 election manifesto that we would look at what were defined as &quot;good causes&quot;. I would bet&#151;given that it is a day for gambling talk&#151;that people who buy lottery tickets think it is a good thing to spend lottery funding on many of the causes that we have added to the legislation, such as education, health and environment.

 Whereas last year the question could have been asked why lottery sales had decreased, I am sure the hon.

That is a result of the fact&#151;not my own opinion&#151;that Camelot has diversified the games on offer. It is cautious, and I am not being over-optimistic that it has turned the corner or that more funding will come in for distribution to good causes, but it does not become any of us not to acknowledge that after a period of declining sales, we have seen an increase in sales. I for one am pleased about that, because it will mean more money going to good causes.

 (Lab/Co-op): What recent steps the Electoral Commission has taken to bring about a higher level of electoral registration.  [194590]
</p>



<p><a name="st_84"><a name="41101-04_spnew14"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport)</b> 
 (Con): It is the duty of electoral registration officers to maintain the electoral registers, while the Electoral Commission has a statutory duty to promote public awareness. The commission directs pre-election reminders at the entire electorate and runs campaigns targeted at specific groups such as home movers, students and young people outside formal education. It also provides advice on the local promotion of electoral registration.
</p>








<p><a name="st_85"><a name="41101-04_spnew15"><b> Mr. Lazarowicz: </b> 
 Although the way in which we register electors in this country does not have the same variety as in some other countries that we could mention, different local authorities approach electoral registration in different ways, which no doubt affects the number of people who are registered. Will the hon. Gentleman ask the commission to examine how to encourage local authorities to adopt best practice in order to ensure the highest possible level of registration? In particular, will he consider asking the commission to give guidance to local authorities on ensuring that they produce publicity and advertising material in all appropriate languages other than English?
</p>








<p><a name="st_86"><a name="41101-04_spnew16"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 Yes; I understand that the commission operates in seven languages. The commission published a guidance manual in 2002 that suggested methods that registration officers could use to encourage registration, and it included a practical guide to planning and running a registration campaign. The commission continues to respond to requests from registration officers for advice in that area. In addition, the commission produces an annual canvass and other registration publicity materials, which are available on demand by registration officers.

Does he consider it a disgrace, particularly at this time, that so many servicemen may find themselves without a vote at the next general election? What action has the Electoral Commission proposed to try to rectify that?

If I tell him that in the borough of Gosport the number of service-registered voters has fallen from 4,370 in 2000 to 474 in 2004, he will recognise that I personally share his concerns. Perhaps rather surprisingly, I am advised by the Electoral Commission that it has no direct powers to investigate the statistics. However, when I spoke to its chairman this morning, he told me that he will approach the Ministry of Defence with a view to working together to assess the extent of the problem of non-registration of service personnel and to consider what steps might appropriately be taken. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that it is very much seized of the issue.

</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41101-04_spnew20"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 There are currently no centrally held data on that in relation to Britain. In Northern Ireland, Electoral Commission research found that rolling registration resulted in an increase of 2.1 percentage points in the number of names on the register during the six-month period between December 2002 and May 2003. The commission&#039;s current research project on electoral registration in Britain will investigate the impact of rolling registration by using case-study evidence from a selection of local authorities. The project is expected to be completed by the spring or summer of 2005.

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="41101-05_spnew6"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 One of the difficulties is that, because different parts of the country manage the electoral register in very different ways and are sometimes susceptible to the vagaries of local party politics, we end up with an electoral register that is very unreliable in many areas. Moreover, because many people move much more frequently than they used to, some accidentally or deliberately appear on the register at two different addresses instead of just one. Would not it make far more sense to move swiftly towards a single harmonised register?

It would also help to underpin improvements to the registration and electoral systems. A national version of the register should also provide more efficient access to those individuals and organisations that are legally entitled to copies of the electoral register.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41101-05_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. In proceedings on the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill last week, the Home Secretary said that he would make an announcement on Third Reading, and issued a press release to that effect. Third Reading never took place, however, owing to the incompetence of the business managers. In justifying his action, the Home Secretary alleged, at column 1542 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 27 October, that the Opposition had &quot;filibustered&quot;. No such filibuster could possibly have taken place, however, since the House was voting during the time allocated for Third Reading. His allegation is also an attack on the authority of Madam Deputy Speaker, since any filibustering would have been ruled out of order under Standing Order No. 42. Will you therefore require the Home Secretary to apologise to Madam Deputy Speaker for his completely false allegation, and to apologise for his discourtesy to the House in making entirely false and mischievous allegations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41101-05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I say to the right hon. Gentleman that it is not for me to bring a Minister here to apologise. I have looked at the events of that day, however, and discussed the matter with my deputies.

Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) and me on this important subject. This morning, however, in the No. 10 briefing, the Prime Minister has answered those questions. He told the press that he had not had meetings with representatives of the gambling industry. Surely it is very strange to go to great lengths to avoid my hon. Friend&#039;s and my questions, and then to answer them straightforwardly in the press briefing this morning.

<a name="stpa_0">I know that passions are running high about this Bill, both in the House and outside. But I hope that our debate can be based on the facts, on concern for the public interest, and nothing else. The Bill addresses a subject that has not been properly scrutinised for more than 40 years, because of the policy of previous Administrations, which, where gambling was concerned, was to sidestep the big issues and be content to tinker. That is a luxury that we can no longer afford. We need to address the challenges that are caused by new technology, by the internet and by the steady growth in consumer demand. We need to keep gambling crime-free by giving regulators new powers and new duties. We need to make sure that our desire to give adults freedom to gamble if they wish is not at the cost of children or the vulnerable.

<a name="41101-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">The House should recognise, however, that gambling is at the boundary between personal freedom and state intervention. On one side of the boundary is the reasonable expectation of adults who, within the law, exercise their right to live their lives as they choose. On the other is the role of the state: to recognise human frailty, and in particular to respect its duty to protect children and the vulnerable. As a Government and a society, we have three options in that respect: prohibition, a free-for-all or regulation. We have no doubt about choosing the regulatory route. The question for the House is how best to apply the regulatory framework for the benefit of society as a whole.

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_8">Let me briefly recap how the Bill came about. New regulation is, by common consent, undoubtedly necessary. Every year and every week sees new developments in the gambling market, often in poorly regulated environments. The danger of the status quo lies not in more of the same, but in the current growth of poorly regulated gambling with little or no protection for those who play. Those who argue against the Bill cannot, if they are concerned about protection, defend the status quo.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_9">We have recently seen roulette machines installed in betting offices against the wishes of the Gaming Board and similar machines proliferating in bingo halls and amusement centres. Since 1968 there have been many deregulatory measures affecting gambling. They have been brought forward on a piecemeal basis. That has been the problem. They included measures to allow the advertising of bingo, to allow betting offices to have clear windows and to increase the number of jackpot machines in casinos. Most came under the deregulation orders following the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. We can all remember who was in power at that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_10">The Lords deregulation Committee pointed out how unsatisfactory a piecemeal approach can be and initiated the process that led to the establishment of the gambling review body in the late 1990s, under the chairmanship of Sir Alan Budd. So the Bill is not a radical departure. It is a continuation of adapting to change since we last legislated for gambling 36 years ago, but this time, the Bill does so comprehensively rather than in fragments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_11">Part 1 of the Bill provides definitions, including the new licensing objectives that I have set out. Part 2 establishes the gambling commission, which will control commercial gambling to ensure that it is fair and safe. Parts 3 and 4 consolidate and modernise gambling offences. Part 4 concentrates on the new offences to protect children, which I know are of concern to the House. Parts 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 set out the new licensing system to be administered by the gambling commission and local licensing authorities. The commission will take over the Gaming Board&#039;s responsibilities for casinos, bingo, gaming machines and the lottery.

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="41101-07_spnew15"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I promise my hon. Friend, who I know has taken a great interest in this matter, that I will deal with it in some detail. I know that it is of such concern to Members to understand how the triple lock will operate in order to prevent the proliferation of new casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_12">The gambling commission will regulate through conditions on operating and personal licences, and for the first time, anybody who is licensed to run gambling premises will be obliged to pursue social responsibility as a condition of their operating licence. If operators breach the terms and conditions, they will face very tough sanctions. Unlike the Gaming Board, the new gambling commission will have the power to impose unlimited financial penalties on operators who breach their conditions. Local authorities will take on the licensing of premises under the guidance of the gambling commission. In Scotland, licensing boards will license premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_13">Part 10 establishes a new regime for gaming machines that accommodates the developments in technology that have occurred since 1968. Part 11 provides for a new regime for charity lotteries. Parts 12, 13 and 14 deal with gambling that is small scale, incidental to other entertainment, or non-commercial. Part 15 provides new powers for effective inspection. Part 16 addresses advertising, and part 17 gambling debts. Lastly, part 18 deals with Bill-wide provisions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41101-07_spnew16"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport) (Con):</b> 
 The right hon. Lady&#039;s Department said that the Bill would be revenue-neutral, implying a very substantial reduction in gambling duty. Although that statement was later slapped down, was the reduction in gambling duty discussed when the Labour party fundraiser Lord Levy met representatives of the international gambling industry?
</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41101-07_spnew17"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 No, it was not. Secondly, the reference to revenue-neutrality was an error. It was a term in common use that was misunderstood. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Let me explain. The point being made was that revenue is not a motivator for this legislation. It is my job as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to establish the regulatory framework; it is the Treasury&#039;s responsibility to establish the taxation regime. [Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] Precisely. The taxation regime will follow once the regulatory regime is in place. I do not think that anything has changed very much on that front in the past seven and a half years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_14">To reduce the risk of harm, the Bill provides new powers to regulate the way in which gambling is offered. Our controls are currently limited to specifying what can be offered and where that can happen. The Bill will give us powers to change the way in which gambling is offered to avoid harm.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_15">We have a low level of problem gambling in Britain. Approximately 0.6 to 0.8 per cent. of adults report the types of behaviour that are associated with problem gambling. However, for them, gambling can be a dangerous and destructive addiction. It can ruin the

<a name="41101-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_16">There is a parallel between alcohol and gambling. Both are legal pursuits, both carry an associated risk of addiction and the state has chosen not to proscribe but to shape supply. The Bill gives Ministers and the commission the power to respond to new risks, increase controls and avoid harm. We will get evidence, through a substantially increased programme of genuinely new research, which has already started. A national gambling audit will take place every three years.

 No, I must make progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_18">Much of the comment on the Bill claimed that the country wanted no more gambling and no more casino games. Although I respect the views of those who wish that demand did not exist, I ask hon. Members to examine the evidence. Many hon. Members know about the growing popularity of roulette machines in betting offices. From none two or three years ago, there are now more than 20,000, and the number continues to rise. As I have said before, the machines are on probation. Under the Bill, they will be under effective legislative control for the first time.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">I suspect that all Members will have seen the countless advertisements for internet casinos and for poker rooms. Companies that conduct research into the internet estimate that some 16 per cent. of Britons visit an internet gambling site every month. Three years ago, 250,000 British people travelled to Las Vegas; next year, that is likely to double to 500,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_20">What is more, many of the problems that we have faced over the past few years have arisen because gambling companies have been trying to install casino games on non-casino premises such as betting offices, bingo halls and amusement arcades. Anyone passing a betting office in the high street today is likely to see a huge poster inviting them to bet roulette. They are just as likely to see that as to see a picture of a horse. The industry is doing all that it can to get roulette into the high street, because wherever it succeeds in doing so roulette proves very popular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_21">Some, I accept, would react to that evidence by suggesting that we prohibit such choices; but if we have learnt anything at all about the history of regulating gambling, it is that if the law does not allow people to gamble safely, they will find ways of gambling at higher risk. We do not want to drive gambling underground or offshore. Expenditure on gambling is rising by about 3.5 per cent. each year, and it is predicted that that rate of increase will continue, with or without the Bill. People will go on choosing casino games whether we like it or not; the question for us is, how do we direct that demand?

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="41101-08_spnew13"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>context of a clear undertaking that there will be no new casinos if local people do not want them. I want to explain what is in the Bill, how we intend to achieve our aims, and how rigorous the safeguards are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_23">The Bill will certainly remove some of the more outdated restrictions on casinos. It will abolish the permitted areas that limit casinos to 53 former county boroughs, including those that had populations of 125,000 or more between December 1970 and October 1973. That explains why, believe it or not, it is possible to have a casino in Mayfair but not in Greenwich. The Bill will also abolish the membership rules requiring a 24-hour wait between joining a casino and playing games.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_24">We consider it reasonable for British consumers to be allowed access to casino games on properly regulated casino premises. We would rather people gambled on machines in the carefully controlled environment of a casino than on dodgy internet sites at home. Our strategy, however, is intended to avoid the mistakes made by other countries such as Australia, which allowed a widespread proliferation of high-price machine gambling in the high streets. What we propose for the casino industry in Great Britain is a restrained modernisation that protects the public from problem gambling.

<a name="stpa_25">How do we decide whether regional planning priorities should determine where a casino goes, or whether it should be a matter for the local planning authority?

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_26">Sir Alan Budd, in his review, recommended a minimum customer area for new casinos of approximately 200 sq m to discourage too many small casinos. However, the Government have decided that the minimum size should be considerably larger&#151;over three times larger&#151;at 750 sq m. The net effect will be fewer new casinos than Sir Alan proposed, and only the largest casinos, with a minimum area of 5,000 sq m, will be entitled to house the new style machines. We will cap machine numbers in all casinos, and we will keep the present &#163;2,000 prize limit for the two smaller categories of casino.

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_27">A number of casino operators have announced proposals for new leisure developments in different parts of the country, although the figures given in some newspapers for new regional casinos are wildly off the mark. Of course, these are all just proposals; almost 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 34</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>none of them has gambling licences or planning permission. If the developments go ahead on the scale envisaged, they will no doubt bring significant economic and employment benefits to the areas in which they are located. For instance, the company that proposes a &#163;125 million development on disused land in a regeneration area will, if it is approved, provide a host of new leisure facilities, of which a casino would be a relatively small component. Overall, the development would provide hundreds of construction jobs, employ over 1,000 staff and provide significant support to Leeds United football club.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para12">
<a name="stpa_28">Let me set out clearly for the House the very tight framework within which such new casinos will be allowed. I have spoken before about the triple lock that applies, and I want to explain each step in turn. I am very aware that there are calls from some quarters for a national cap on the number of the new regional casinos. The Joint Committee looked carefully at the issue and did not recommend a cap. I share the objective that regional casinos should be relatively few in number, but I do think that a cap may be a blunt instrument. My preferred alternative is for tough planning and licensing tests that may well be difficult for a number of proposals to pass, but do allow some flexibility for local communities. I am dirigiste only about the ends, not the means, and all sides agree that this cannot be left purely to the market, so let me set out how the regime would work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para13">
<a name="stpa_29">The first lock is the operating licensing system. Anybody who wishes to operate a casino in the UK must apply to the gambling commission for an operating licence. Applicants will be rigorously tested to ensure that they measure up to the three statutory objectives in the Bill: to protect children and vulnerable adults, to keep gambling crime free and to ensure fair play for consumers. The gambling commissions&#039;s job of assessing licence applications will not be a question of ticking a box. Each and every application will have to go through careful and rigorous consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para14">
<a name="stpa_30">The second lock is the premises licensing system, for which local authorities will be responsible. The Bill requires every local authority to have a gambling licensing policy that covers all gambling and betting premises, including casinos, and it empowers local authorities to consult the public on their licensing policy, including the casino element of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-08_para15">
<a name="stpa_31">I understand the concerns that right hon. and hon. Members have expressed about local authorities finding the development benefits too tempting, so I will listen closely to the argument that the power to consult on the licensing policy should be replaced with a duty. That duty is already implicit in the planning procedures, but I am happy to consider making it more explicit. At this point, or at any time it chooses, a local authority may resolve, under clause 157, not to allow any new casinos in its area. It has a wide discretion to exercise that power, and in deciding whether to exercise it, it may have regard to &quot;any principle or matter&quot;, and the power lasts for three years and is renewable. The Joint Committee did not recommend the power of resolution. I decided to add it to the Bill because I wanted local authorities that do not want new casinos to be able to say so clearly and categorically, and to be protected from any of the risks that might follow.

Local authorities can and must test any application for a premises licence against the three licensing criteria in the Bill and can refuse any application that does not meet them.

For regional casinos, we will make sure, under the provisions of the new planning regime, that regional spatial strategies are updated to take account of the Bill. Regional authorities will be able to analyse the best locations for regional casinos from the point of view of economic growth, tourism promotion and regional sustainability, as well as existing regional development plans.

We will also make sure, for small and large casinos, that local development frameworks are updated to take account of the Bill, again assuming that a local authority has not imposed a blanket ban. All the usual safeguards and protections in planning law will be available to local authorities and local communities.

<a name="41101-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_37">Some Members and, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said, the Joint Committee, have expressed concern that some casinos may bypass the planning system because of the absence of a separate use class for casinos in planning law. The current law theoretically allows any leisure facility, such as a swimming pool or cinema, to be converted into a casino without triggering planning controls, although, obviously, a premises licence&#151;therefore, the planning regime&#151;would be invoked. After the Joint Committee&#039;s second report, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister undertook to review the possibility of a new use class for casinos and invited comments by the end of October. I am delighted to announce today that he and I have agreed in principle to require change of use to a casino to be subject to planning control. Subject to further detailed

<a name="stpa_45">There is no more important area to keep children away from harm than the internet. The evidence published over the summer that some British companies were failing in this area is profoundly disturbing. Any internet operator seeking a licence from the gambling commission will need to demonstrate precisely how it intends to exclude children from play.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_46">I want to say a few words about our approach to the lowest-prize gaming machines, which children can use. These machines are found in leisure sites such as seaside fairs and funfairs, but they are also available in a wide range of premises such as fish and chip shops and taxicab offices. I have received many representations from those who disagree with children being allowed to use gaming machines at all, and I have sympathy with those who observe that Britain is unusual in allowing children to play on any category of slot machine, but I think that it would be wrong of the Government to ignore the fact that children have been permitted to use amusement machines for many decades without clear evidence of an impact on the level of problem gambling among children.

<a name="41101-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_47">Such amusement machines have also been a traditional and well-loved part of the family leisure and seaside experience.

We must remain vigilant and cautious in relation to future risks, so I assure the House that on this issue and every other aspect of the Bill I will listen very carefully to the views of hon. Members.

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. In the context of the many seaside communities around the country, is it not her experience, as it is mine and that of many hon.

Is that not the higher standard that we are trying to achieve in this Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_93"><a name="41101-10_spnew10"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is because those high standards of supervision are exercised in so many of these arcades that the evidence of problem gambling among children has not been produced. We want that vigilance to increase. That is why there is a reserve power in the Bill to be used should evidence of problems arise some time in the future, but as my hon. Friend made clear&#151;I know that many hon. Members with constituency interests have found this&#151;by and large, the regime in seaside arcades and family entertainment centres is very responsible. By withdrawing category D machines, as they are called, from fish and chip shops and minicab offices, we deal with the risks of ambient gambling and of exposing children to gambling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-10_para5">

It provides vital new powers to protect children and put an end to socially irresponsible practices. It puts Parliament and the regulators back in control, with the power to toughen controls and the evidence on which to act. Crucially, it puts power firmly in the hands of local communities. New casinos will come to their area only if they want them&#151;full stop.

It is why we agreed with the words of the then junior Home Office Minister responsible for gambling when he asked, &quot;Why should we stop people choosing to spend their evenings playing roulette?&quot; It is why we understood the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson), the Opposition spokesman on culture, when in his day job as editor of <i>The Spectator</i> he wrote&#151;I paraphrase: &quot;Opposition to the Gambling Bill is nothing but low protectionism and in the case of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, a knee-jerk reaction to absolutely anything the Government does, dressed up as moral principle&quot;.

There are still major flaws in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_55">Until now, the history of gambling regulation has been one of gradual and cautious liberalisation. For 30 years, the UK industry has been a model of responsibility. It has been largely free of organised criminal activity and the level of problem gambling is much lower in this country than elsewhere. It was for that reason that the previous Conservative Government felt able to introduce measures to liberalise the rules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_56">In 1994, the waiting period for membership of casinos was reduced from 48 hours to 24 hours and casinos were allowed to apply to serve alcohol after midnight and to accept debit cards, but not credit cards. Two years later, the Home Office issued a consultation paper on proposals to allow limited local advertising and to extend the number of permitted areas for casinos to 21, in order for them to be allowed to be established in some seaside resorts and conference towns. I point out to the Secretary of State, in response to her remarks at the end of her speech, that the Government said specifically at that time that there was a need to maintain tight control of casino gaming and that they did not support allowing resort-style casinos in this country.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="41101-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 The measures to which I referred, which were implemented by the previous Conservative Government, were subject to enormous consultation. They represented a modest step forward. We are faced today not with a modest step forward but with a massive change that will completely alter the nature of gambling in this country. The hon. Gentleman refers to the industry having been consulted. The industry is deeply unhappy with many of the recommendations and feels, in particular, that the new rules suddenly announced in response to the second report of the Scrutiny Committee were subject to no consultation whatsoever.

<a name="stpa_60">An area where regulation is most urgently needed is that of remote gaming. Gambling on the internet has become a huge business in the space of a few years, and it is predicted that the industry will be worth &#163;10 billion globally within the next five years. At present, such gambling can take place only on websites hosted outside the UK&#151;it is, of course, impossible to stop such gambling, as has been found in Australia and the United States, where they have tried to do so. Many offshore sites offer no player protection and few safeguards against under-age access or criminal activity.

 My right hon. Friend speaks for many operators in seaside arcades and amusement centres who are deeply concerned about the powers in the Bill to prevent children from continuing to use machines such as penny-falls and cranes. The Secretary of State has said that the power will be reserved, but many people feel that there is no evidence that such machines have ever led to any harm. While that reserved power is in the Bill, such people will continue to believe that the Government will impose controls at a future date. I say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mr. Simmonds) and the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith), who have all raised the same point, that we continue to believe that that particular clause is unnecessary and that it should be removed.

I heard from the owners of that arcade that those machines do not corrupt; all those machines do is give a lot of amusement to young children, which is an historical tradition in seaside resorts.

 I agree with my hon. Friend and hope that he won a teddy bear from the crane. However, I do not think that the experience will have corrupted him or led him to gambling addiction.

Conservative Members accept that there is a case for a further relaxation in some aspects, such as restrictions on advertising, the confinement of casinos to permitted areas and the 24-hour delay before membership is granted. However, regional casinos of the kind proposed have never been seen before in this country&#151;nor, until now, have we permitted the introduction of category A gaming machines. Those machines, which have unlimited stakes and prizes, have proved to be the biggest cause of problem gambling in Australia following the liberalisation that took place there, so it is absolutely essential to proceed cautiously in that respect.

 It is absolutely essential that this debate is conducted on the basis of fact, not fantasy, myth and mistaken beliefs. The expectation is that about 10 per cent. of machines in regional casinos will be category A machines that do not have a specified stake or prize. If there is any evidence that they are causing harm, it will be for the gambling commission to reduce the stake and the prize. That deals with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns.

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="41101-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 The fact is that regional casinos will be allowed up to 1,250 machines, which, as they can be of any category, could all be category A; it is not sufficient for the Secretary of State merely to say that her expectation is that they will not be.

 As my hon. Friend knows, I have been following these issues for many years. The Government have not accepted the concerns expressed by many people in the industry and on both sides of this House and in the upper House, as reflected in the excellent report by the Joint Committee chaired by our hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), that if the Government&#039;s proposals are proceeded with we will lose the regenerative effect of the casinos on some of our run-down resorts, whereas if the Committee&#039;s recommendations were accepted we could ensure that the regenerative effect occurs.

<a name="stpa_65">I want to return to my point about the Government&#039;s original intention, which, as the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) suggested, appeared to be based on cautious liberalisation. We were first told that there would be a limited number of resort destination casinos and that they were so called because they would be located in seaside resorts and away from centres of population. Limiting the accessibility of jackpot machines was said at the time to be crucial to the Government&#039;s objective of protecting children and the vulnerable. However, the Government have been seduced by the prospect of the millions of pounds of investment being offered by the overseas operators who want to come and set up in this country. According to some of those companies to which I have spoken, they are willing to invest tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds in each one of the new mega-casinos; in doing so, they would provide thousands of jobs. Of course that is a tempting prospect, but those companies are not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 46</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proposing to make that investment out of altruism. The return on their investment will come from the 20,000 people they are hoping to attract through the doors of each casino every week.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="41101-12_spnew12"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> 
 I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has had time to look at the report of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which looked at the original draft of the Gambling Bill some time before the Joint Committee, chaired by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), produced its report. The Select Committee&#151;which included several of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Conservative colleagues, none of whom demurred for an instant at the time, although they are now doing so&#151;listened to the Bishop of Blackburn putting very clearly the argument in favour of the regeneration of Blackpool. He wanted to see that financial investment being made. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the bishop has succumbed to temptation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_119"><a name="41101-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 I would say two things to the hon. Gentleman. First, the proposals on the table today are very different from those that were on the table when his Select Committee was examining the issue. Secondly, he cites the Bishop of Blackburn, but I hope that he is not suggesting that the Churches generally support the Bill. He only has to look at the remarks of a number of archbishops, and of representatives of the Methodist Church, the Salvation Army and many other religious groups, to see that they are bitterly opposed to many of the provisions in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_120"><a name="41101-12_spnew14"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend accept that while the Bishop of Blackburn might want to see Blackpool being regenerated through the possibility of one resort casino being established there, that is a very different matter from splattering casinos around every major city and town in the United Kingdom? There are so many questions that need to be answered on the Bill, particularly in regard to the super-jackpot machines. If we were to pilot these new casinos in a small number of areas&#151;perhaps Blackpool could be one&#151;we could test their impact on the country.

The Secretary of State said this afternoon that her adviser&#039;s comment that the tax regime would be revenue-neutral had been somehow misunderstood.

In particular, the scrutiny Committee proposed limiting the number of casinos by increasing the minimum non-gambling area from 1,500 to 4,000 sq m. Doing so would have helped to ensure that casinos were closer to leisure complexes offering a different range of attractions, rather than simply giant gambling dens. More importantly, it would have increased the size of total investment required, which in the Committee&#039;s view would have limited the likely number built to about 20 to 25.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way; he is being very generous. Several hon.

Only if the Government or a central body decide the location of each super-casino can one impose a national cap. If we allow local and regional authorities to make those decisions, it is difficult to set a national cap.

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="41101-13_spnew12"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 The Government have already said that regional planning bodies will play a key role in the process. It would be perfectly sensible to suggest an initial cap of, say, one or two casinos per region. It would then be for the regional planning bodies to decide where they should be located. That would represent co-operation between national Government and regional planning bodies, and it would be up to local authorities to determine particular sites. That seems a perfectly sensible way forward.

We had understood that that was originally the Secretary of State&#039;s own view, but in deciding the most suitable areas for regional casinos, regional planning bodies have been told explicitly that they must take account of planning guidance that requires major new facilities to promote the vitality and viability of existing town centres.

I have to say that &quot;inconsistency&quot; seems to me to be a considerable understatement. If the Secretary of State is to deliver the Bill&#039;s objective of protecting children and the vulnerable, it is essential that the planning guidance for the location of new casinos should be changed.

<a name="41101-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_78">Another difference between the draft Bill and the one before us today relates to new category A, so-called &quot;million pound&quot; jackpot machines. Originally, the Government proposed that they should be allowed in all casinos and be subject only to the machine-to-table ratio. They also proposed that in regional casinos there should be no limit on numbers at all. Although it was not a recommendation of the scrutiny Committee, the Government then decided to restrict category A machines to regional casinos alone and impose a cap on the number of machines at 1,250. By doing that, they will increase the attraction of regional casinos and severely disadvantage existing UK operators. Those companies rightly point out that they will be unable to compete if they are prevented from offering any category A machines in their existing casinos while the new regional ones can contain up to 1,250 such machines. The pressure on them to convert into regional casinos will be enormous and will lead to still more proliferation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_79">The answer, as the scrutiny Committee again pointed out, is to allow a limited number of category A machines into small and large casinos, or alternatively to increase the maximum stake and prize that category B machines

<br>&nbsp;<br>can offer. That would help to address the problem of the cliff edge that the Government have created between large and regional casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_80">As I said earlier, however, we also believe that there is a case for further limiting the number of category A machines. Most operators predict that the maximum number of 1,250 machines in regional casinos will, as the Secretary of State confirmed, contain a mix of different categories. We believe that, within the overall limit, it makes sense to impose a further restriction on category A machines so that we can monitor the effect of their introduction in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_81">There is one more measure of protection that we believe is necessary. At present, the membership requirement for UK casinos allows operators to bar from their premises those who are known to be problem gamblers. It is another important safeguard to try to stop gambling addiction. Yet by scrapping the membership requirements, that protection will be lost. The lack of any form of identification requirement also removes a vital safeguard against money laundering. Indeed, it may well be in breach of the EU&#039;s third directive on money laundering.

 The hon. Gentleman may want to withdraw that comment and I undertake to write to him separately about it. The allegation is untrue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="41101-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for her assurance that those reports were untrue. I, of course, accept her word on that, but it does not change the fact that the Government are proposing to exempt large casinos from the requirement to identify those who are involved in transactions of more than &#163;700. I would be interested to know whether the Secretary of State also denies the report that the Association of Chief Police Officers has protested about that. Is that also wrong?
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="41101-14_spnew2"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I am very happy to say that, given that one of the objectives of the Bill is to keep gambling crime-free, we have of course consulted the police throughout. Discussions on the money laundering directive are a matter for the Treasury and still continue. In its final shape, the Bill will ensure that we keep crime out&#151;money laundering or any other crime that could infiltrate gambling in this country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="41101-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 The most effective way of preventing money laundering is to retain the requirement that those undertaking large transactions must provide identification. Under the Bill, that safeguard will be lost. The safeguard against money laundering and the membership requirement, which would provide an additional layer of protection for those who are suffering from gambling addiction, are to be removed simply because they do not happen to satisfy the American business model.

 The hon. Gentleman is talking about measures to protect vulnerable people from being seduced by gambling. There has been a furore in the popular press about the Bill having the effect of increasing and enhancing gambling among vulnerable people, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that if that same popular press were really concerned about protecting people from being seduced by gambling, they could play their part by removing the racing sections from their papers, which not only encourage people to gamble, but advise them on how to do so?
</p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="41101-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 We are concerned about the Bill partly because it represents a completely new and different form of gambling from anything that we have seen before. It is for that reason that we are urging caution. I am interested that the Secretary of State said that my comments on the membership requirement were incorrect. In that case, perhaps she will reconsider whether it would be wise to retain a membership requirement both to tackle problem gambling and to deal with the danger of money laundering.

<a name="41101-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_82">The Bill initially enjoyed widespread support, but by refusing to listen to those who have advocated a cautious approach combined with sensible safeguards, the Government have managed to unite almost everyone against it. People are against the Bill, not because of snobbery but because it will disadvantage responsible and long-standing UK companies, lead to a proliferation of casinos in our towns and cities and risk creating a massive increase in problem gambling. The Secretary of State has said that she is listening and is prepared to amend the Bill. It is a pity that she was not willing to do so earlier.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had a difficult task introducing the Bill today. As we have been good friends for more than 33 years, I hope that we will remain so at the end of this debate and of future ones. I feel fairly confident that she was not referring to me in her reference to a whiff of snobbery, and I hope that she will excuse me from any charge of opportunism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">I support most of the Bill because we clearly need to modernise the laws on gambling, but I oppose the proposal to make it easier for multinational casinos to rip off hard-working British families. There is no public demand for the provisions in the Bill. Before there was any unstimulated demand, shall we say, opinion polls showed that more than 90 per cent. of the population believed that there were enough opportunities for gambling already. People have come to my advice surgeries about housing, schools, pensions, passports 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 53</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and policing, but in 25 years I cannot recall one person coming to see me because they wanted us to increase the opportunities for gambling. I have, however, had quite a lot of people coming to see me because their lives have been ruined by their spouse&#039;s gambling away all the family income. We should not do anything that is likely to increase the opportunities for that. There is no public demand for the changes, so we appear to be changing the law to make it easier for casino companies to tempt hard-working British families to lose their money so that they can make profits. It is worth remembering that the casinos cannot make profits unless most punters lose their money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_84">In future, we shall permit extra temptations that are not currently on offer. It will be possible to walk into a casino with no cooling-off period of 24 hours. There will be an enormous number of machines and prizes of possibly &#163;1 million in those places. We are lifting the restriction on advertising so that casinos can deliberately stimulate demand that does not exist without such stimulation. That will increase gambling, especially through slot machines, and the evidence shows that slot machines are a major source of problem gambling and of people getting hooked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">I am not only worried about those who may get hooked on gambling. I believe that, at a time when we are discussing the need for more people to save, be careful with money and put money aside for their pensions and for the future, it is foolish of the Government to say, &quot;We&#039;re going to make it easier for you to blow it at a casino.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_86">The Government claim that there will not be a large increase in the number of casinos but just 20 or 40 new ones. Ministers have referred to those figures as &quot;a modest increase&quot; on the existing 134. An increase of 40 on 134 is 30 per cent. If the trade unions presented a proposal for a 30 per cent. increase in the national minimum wage, I do not believe that the Cabinet would regard it as a modest increase that should be approved.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">The problem is not only 40 more casinos but that they will be much larger. If they are allowed 1,250 slot machines each, it means, as I understand it, that each new one will have more slot machines than those in all the existing casinos put together. That increases the opportunity for gambling. The bigger prizes on offer make it more likely that people will gamble and that there will be more gambling.

<a name="41101-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">We are told that the Bill will permit the regeneration of inner cities. Have we reached the stage when the only way in which we can regenerate our inner cities depends on inviting American casino companies to bail us out? That is not the best way to achieve regeneration. If we stick it on top of 24-hour drinking, the combination will not greatly assist the prevailing situation in many of our inner cities.

<a name="41101-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">We are told that there will be not only a casino built at each location but hotels, restaurants and entertainment facilities, as if they would tempt people away from the tables and machines. They will not. The hotels, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 54</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>restaurants and entertainment will be there to attract people to the casinos so that they go to the restaurant and afterwards to the tables; stay at the hotel and go to the tables, and go to a show and subsequently to the tables.

<a name="stpa_90">I have every sympathy with the people of Blackpool and of other holiday resorts. It would be a good idea if the Government acknowledged that Blackpool and one or two other places might benefit from one of the new casinos. They could choose the places&#151;I have never objected to central Government&#039;s making a few decisions now and again. If that happened, we could ascertain how the casinos worked. A private Bill that covered several places could subsequently be promoted or a measure could be introduced from the centre. That might show us what could be done and bring benefits to those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_91">However, if there are to be big casinos in every major centre of population, the holiday resort casinos can forget the massive improvement in takings that they expect because people will not go to Blackpool if they can go to a casino nearer home in Manchester. All the points that I have made so far concern the public. Let me say something about the harm that I believe the proposals are doing to the reputation of the Labour party and the Labour Government. They are putting off a lot of people whom we would do well not to put off&#151;a lot of concerned people who are already unhappy about one or two aspects of the Government&#039;s policies.

<a name="41101-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_92">People come up to me and ask &quot;Why is he doing it?&quot; I think they are referring to the Prime Minister. They consider the Bill to be contrary to the Labour party&#039;s normal slightly paternalistic, slightly puritan image. It is also rather at variance with the greater emphasis on religious belief that has been common in Government in recent times. And it is contrary to things that the Chancellor and others are saying about the need to save and put money aside for pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_93">There is no public demand for the Bill. The demand is coming from American gambling companies. They may have changed; but in the eyes of the British public&#151;who may remember films made years ago&#151;they are connected with organised crime, money laundering, drugs and prostitution. That is the sort of word association that occurs to people, and I think it is very damaging to our party. It does make people wonder &quot;Why are they doing it?&quot; I think that that question itself is very damaging to us as a party.
</p>

 I join the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) in thanking the Secretary of State, and indeed expressing admiration of her for coming here today in the light of her recent bereavement.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 55</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_95">The hon. Gentleman was right to praise the work of the Joint Committee, and in particular its Chairman, the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). The Secretary of State has accused the Bill&#039;s opponents of grabbing opportunism from a passing bandwagon. She fails to understand that many people who initially supported much more of the Bill were influenced by the Government&#039;s failure to note some of the Committee&#039;s recommendations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_96">The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford summarised his party&#039;s concerns. We share many of them, as our amendment makes clear. It explains why we will vote against Second Reading, notwithstanding one welcome U-turn by the Secretary of State about which I shall say more later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_97">As others have observed, much of the Bill is welcome. It provides a much-needed updating of existing legislation. Like many other people, we are pleased about the stronger, broader regulation that will result from the replacement of the Gaming Board with the gambling commission. It will be stronger because the commission will have greater powers to rescind licences, impose higher fines and enter and inspect premises. It will be broader because it will cover remote gambling such as internet, betting-exchange and interactive television gambling.
</p>








<p><a name="st_157"><a name="41101-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Banks: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman was good enough to acknowledge one concession made by the Secretary of State, among a number of others. But how can he say that he supports at least 90 per cent. of the Bill, and then vote against its Second Reading? He could try to make further improvements during a Committee stage that he will deny the Bill if it is not passed tonight.
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="41101-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 First, the Secretary of State&#039;s concessions are not actually in the Bill. Secondly, we are concerned about many other matters, which I shall enumerate shortly. Thirdly, as I shall explain, in many instances we feel that the Government&#039;s basic premises are seriously flawed. For those three reasons, we will vote against the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_98">I was referring to the need to have control over remote gambling. The Secretary of State rightly points to the 3 million to 4 million people involved in internet gambling. We note that those involved in providing it&#151;for example, Sportingbet&#151;are reporting significant increases in turnover. Yet at the same time it is deeply worrying to learn that it is very easy for children and young people to become involved in that. A recent survey showed that an 11-year-old girl was able to register with 30 out of 37 internet gambling sites, so we accept entirely that regulation is needed to protect the vulnerable and to ensure integrity.

 If the hon. Gentleman sincerely believes that the Bill cures the problems to which he has just referred, how can he support opposing the Bill at this stage? I could understand his party voting against it on Third Reading if the improvements that he desired had not been made, but how can he possible justify it at this time?

<p><a name="st_160"><a name="41101-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 I think that I have already answered that question in reply to the hon. Member for West Ham (Mr. Banks), but while 90 per cent. of the Bill may well be good, and I believe that it is, if the 10 per cent. is so very bad and continues to be so, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not accept that we should support it, and I want to deal now with my serious concerns about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_99">May I refer in passing to the broader remit of the gambling commission? I welcome the fact that it will require casinos and others to have higher standards in respect of social responsibility and that those involved have agreed to a target of a &#163;3 million contribution to a fund to alleviate some of the problems caused by gambling, but I remind the House that that figure is only 0.035 per cent. of the &#163;8.5 billion that is spent annually in this country on gambling, and I suspect that it is unlikely to prove to be a high enough figure, so I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State will have reserve powers to impose a levy if that is the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_100">To return to the point that has just been made, I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill, particularly those proposals relating to the new super-casinos and the enormous number of unlimited-prize machines that there might be within them. We are worried about the likely number of such casinos, their location, the speed of their introduction and the controls over them. We are particularly worried about the introduction of the unlimited-prize machines in such large numbers without any significant research having been done into the likely effects that they will have on problem gambling. The Secretary of State has told us that only 10 per cent. of machines in super-casinos may be of this type, but even if that is the case&#151;I suspect that it will be far more&#151;we will still be introducing 5,000 of these machines in this country without any sort of trial. I am also worried that the Secretary of State in response to the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said that it will be for the gambling commission to decide what that percentage will be. For the sake of anyone thinking of investing in these new super-casinos, I hope that the gambling commission will be up and running and have made a decision on what that proportion will be, because presumably that will directly impact upon a potential investor&#039;s decision whether to set up such a casino.

<a name="stpa_102">We have some concerns and some suggestions about how the Bill could be improved. As the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said, recent opinion polls show that people do not want increased gambling opportunities, not least because of the inevitable increase in problem gambling that they will create. Many people do not want regeneration in their area if it comes on the back of creating significant misery for many people locally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_103">We already have more than 300,000 gamblers&#151;probably far more&#151;and the Bill as it stands will inevitably increase that significantly. Everyone seems to believe that&#151;every independent commentator&#151;except the Secretary of State. The whole House will surely have been surprised when she said to the Joint Committee:


</p>
<ul>

Many of us will recall John Patten&#151;now Lord Patten&#151;making the wonderful promise that he would eat his hat garnished if he did not meet his targets in relation to grant-maintained schools. The real question is what the Secretary of State will do if the Bill fails under the criteria that she set. I am sure that we all desperately hope that it will not involve her parading as a croupier. She at least tempered what she had said when she told my hon.

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="41101-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to one way of showing just how large a number a third of a million people is. He will be well aware that the clear evidence is that with the introduction of what could be 5,000 highly addictive category A machines the number is likely to increase significantly. It is not only the public and politicians of all parties who are concerned about this but the British businesses that will be affected. The Government said in the White Paper that

<a name="stpa_105">It is strange, then&#151;perhaps the Minister can explain it to the House&#151;that the Government plan to remove category D machines from fish and chip shops and taxi offices but there has been no consultation whatever with representatives of those businesses, although estimates show that up to 600 of them are likely to close as a result. In passing, he might explain what the difference is between ambient gambling in a fish and chip shop or taxi office and in a motorway service station. Many people are confused about that aspect of the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_106">Businesses are also concerned about what appears to be preferential treatment for American casino operators. The British casino industry is understandably worried that the odds are being significantly stacked in favour of the Americans. It is the British businesses, not the American ones, who have, over 40 years, built an enviable record of integrity, fairness and social responsibility. They have raised issues of integrity about membership. We are not talking about a return to the 24-hour rule, but about having at least a membership requirement so that a record is kept of all those who enter premises. Surely the Minister and the Secretary of State have been consulting the police, and I would be amazed if the Minister tells us that the police and others have all said a membership registration scheme would not assist on money laundering or on the issues of problem gambling.

Many people have real concerns, some of them very basic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_108">The Government&#039;s arguments for more casinos do not seem to add up. They cannot even tell us how many casinos there are. Last week, on the Floor of the House, the Prime Minister told us there are 120. The DCMS website says there are 122. In response to the Joint Committee, Lord McIntosh said there were 126. More recently, in a press release, he said there were 130. The House of Commons Library, whose figures I prefer to believe, says that the figure is none of those, but is 131.

The Secretary of State says in articles in today&#039;s papers that there will be 85,000. Leaving that aside, in the run-up to the Bill jobs have actually been lost. British gaming machine manufacturing jobs have been lost to America, and further job losses are predicted. The Henley Centre claims that there will be &quot;no significant employment gains&quot; as a result of the Bill. It argues that

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;certain sectors of the leisure industry, for example pubs, restaurants and hotels, will be put under great pressure in their competing leisure offerings with casinos.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_111">In other words, it is likely that super-casinos will merely displace jobs, not create new ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_112">If the super-casinos are going to take away some existing gambling business, a threat is also posed to such things as the national lottery. What will be the impact on good causes? As I said at Question Time, what will be the impact on our Olympic funding package? The regulatory impact assessment is quite clear that there will be implications. Even if national lottery sales decline by just 2.5 per cent., that would lead to a loss of almost &#163;50 million a year for the good causes, of which &#163;27 million would be from the Olympic lottery fund. Over five years, that figure would be more than &#163;100 million. The Minister must explain how the funding gap will be closed in our plans for the Olympic bid.

 Is the hon.

 I am grateful. The honest and truthful answer is that I was not aware of the report, but if the hon. Lady will make it available, I shall be delighted to read it. My point, though, is a simple one: there are conflicting bits of evidence about the issue, and it is wrong of the Government to claim categorically that all the additional jobs will be created when there is conflicting evidence about that. Surely, as many hon. Members have suggested, a far better way forward, adopting the precautionary principle, would be to move slowly, possibly by having just one new super-casino in each region. Then, we will have an opportunity to judge whether the hon. Lady&#039;s evidence or the Henley Centre&#039;s evidence or the Prime Minister&#039;s evidence is correct.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Bill. He told the Joint Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;I see gambling reform, which would be introduced by the Gambling Bill, as having three aspects: one is regulation, and that is clearly what the Bill is about, and that is most of what you have been covering; the second is the tax regime; and the third is the location regime. You will not fully understand the gambling reform unless you have all those three legs of the stool in place.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_115">I am sure that he is absolutely right, but there is nothing in the Bill about the tax regime, which Lord McIntosh said was crucial if we were to understand the reform. The Secretary of State told us from the Dispatch Box only an hour ago that the tax regime for gambling was nothing to do with her and that it was all to do with the Treasury. However, if we do not have a clear understanding of the tax regime, how can we know how many new super-casinos there will be? Lord McIntosh agrees with me, but there is nothing in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_116">Lord McIntosh said that the location regime was the second of the three legs, but what there is on that is wholly inadequate, confusing and flawed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_117">We are also expected to be confident that the industry will ensure that there will be only between 20 and 40 of the new casinos. That is what the Prime Minister and the Government have claimed. The Government say that that range is an industry prediction, but I would be interested to know which part of the industry made that prediction. When I ask people in the industry whether they made it they say, &quot;No, it&#039;s what the Government have told us, and because we find it so difficult to decide how many it should be, we haven&#039;t disagreed with them.&quot; I hope that the Minister can say which parts of the industry have told the Government that the range will be between 20 and 40. If he cannot say now, perhaps he will put the answer in the Library, because people in the industry are not capable of making such a prediction.

<p>
<a name="41101-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_118">When people in the industry try to work out the figure and find how difficult it is they take into account the fact that there have been about 100 planning applications already, and the fact that it is reported that MGM has recently said that 10 per cent. of its global profits would come from the UK alone. Will the figure be only between 20 and 40? Who knows? But let us not be so complacent as to believe that it will be.

We should not be talking about regional casinos, but about leisure destination casinos. The Committee recognised the danger of super-casinos on the high street because of the clear link between casual, &quot;walk in and play&quot; gambling and problem gambling.

He raised the issue of the power of local authorities. Of course, the Government have suggested that authorities will be all-powerful in this matter. They have certainly been helped by today&#039;s announcement of the U-turn on the creation of a separate use class for all casinos.

Local authorities will not have powers to talk about public nuisance, as they do in respect of licensing, or to address saturation.

 The Bill contains three licensing objectives that underpin the functions that the gambling commission and licensing authorities will perform: to protect children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by gambling; to prevent gambling being a source of crime or disorder, being associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime; and to ensure that gambling is conducted fairly and openly. I am astonished by the attitude of the Opposition parties. Whatever they say about parts of the Bill that they support, they cannot have it both ways.

<p>
<a name="41101-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_130">The third objective&#151;that gambling should be conducted fairly and openly&#151;is surely important. It is a recent development that, to some extent, gambling is hidden away&#151;remote gambling&#151;but it is a growth industry and is an increasingly popular pursuit for women. The Bill recognises and accommodates the significant technological changes that have occurred in the past 40 years. It requires regulation where the player is not present on the operator&#039;s premises. For example, operators based in Great Britain must obtain an operating licence to authorise the provision of gambling via remote communication&#151;for example, via television or the internet. Moreover, the new licensing system has quite sensibly been designed to keep pace with technological developments so that, subject to appropriate parliamentary approval, gambling delivered by new, unforeseen methods can be regulated in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_131">That area of gambling is currently unregulated, so for that reason alone doing nothing is not an option. We must ensure that children and young people are properly protected, and the Bill will, for the first time, impose restrictions on such gambling.

<p>
<a name="41101-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_132">My principal interest in the Bill is as a former Minister for Tourism and the current secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on tourism. Our tourism industry is worth a staggering &#163;80 billion to the UK economy, yet our tourism deficit stands at around &#163;14 billion. For every pound spent in the UK by a tourist from overseas, Britons spend &#163;2 abroad. The number of visits abroad by UK residents is approaching three times the number of overseas visits to the UK. There is a desperate need to reverse the trend by offering better value for money and a more innovative product.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_133">That is particularly true of our seaside resorts. As the British Resorts Association pointed out in its excellent report, &quot;Behind the Fac&quot;ade&quot;, serious pockets of deprivation are hidden behind the fac&quot;ade of the sea front, because of the seasonal nature of employment and the declining quality of the tourism product on offer. Let us take Blackpool as an example. I make no apology for citing Blackpool. It is situated in my region, the north-west, and many of my constituents know it well. Over the past 15 years it has seen little private investment and no major interventions to ignite regeneration and transform the resort product.

<a name="stpa_134">Annual visits have decreased from 13.2 million to 10.6 million, visitor nights from 16 million to 10.5 million, and spending by overnight visitors from &#163;800 million to &#163;500 million. The resort&#039;s income profile has become more seasonal, with the summer season becoming shorter and the peak less pronounced. The average annual hotel occupancy rate has fallen to 22 per cent., and more than 20,000 bedrooms have transferred lawfully or unlawfully to the private rented residential sector. I will not dwell too long on the facts about the town as my hon. Friends who represent Blackpool are much more knowledgeable about local circumstances than I am.

They would, however, provide direct employment for 7,500 people and ignite a resort-wide regeneration programme that would include residential, retail, professional services, leisure and entertainment development, airport expansion and transport infrastructure development, and support about 27,300 jobs.

<a name="stpa_163">The likely effect of an unlimited number of regional casinos would be the demise of small casinos. The competitive inequality of machine entitlement and allowing only regional casinos to have category A machines will greatly favour incomers rather than the incumbent UK operators. The potential proliferation of regional casinos, with their unlimited-prize payouts, will bring them too close to centres of population, with the resultant risk of increasing problem gambling. Although I accept that it will be for local authorities to decide whether to allow regional casinos, it will be difficult for them to decline the prospect of financial benefit to their communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_164">Representatives of the gaming machine companies have made suggestions to address the concerns expressed by many hon. Members about the potential proliferation of regional casinos. One suggestion is that the number of regional casinos should be restricted. The gaming machine companies have also suggested that the minimum size of the regional casinos should be increased, but that no category A slot machines should be introduced until after the second prevalence study, and then in small numbers only.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_165">The UK gambling industry is used to maximum prizes, and the doors should not be thrown open to the unlimited cash prizes offered by category A machines without a consideration of the consequences. Category B slot machines could carry increased stakes and prizes, in which case we could maintain the principle of controlled stakes and prizes in this country. Such action would protect our home-grown gaming machine companies and the associated jobs in constituencies such as mine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_166">Another concern is the number of machines that will be allowed in pubs under the Bill. Although the Bill sets a maximum number of two machines by right, with more by application to the local authority, the principle of grandfather rights was established throughout the first drafts of the Bill and the submissions by the Joint Committee. Concerns have been raised because the Bill provides for grandfather rights in premises that are

<br>&nbsp;<br>regeneration, which would be undermined by the proliferation of major casino developments in the communities from which Blackpool traditionally draws its visitors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para21">
<a name="stpa_177">That danger of proliferation has attracted most of the current criticism. The outcome of our first report was to remove many of the potential dangers in the initial White Paper. The concept of the third category of casino&#151;the regional casino&#151;with a maximum of 1,250 gaming machines also results from the first report. I am disappointed that the Government have not accepted the framework for regional casinos that we offered in our second report, which I still believe provides a sound basis from which to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para22">
<a name="stpa_178">A mistaken perception exists that every new casino development will be a Las Vegas-style regional casino, which is not what much of the industry wants or wanted. However, the decision announced in June not to allow existing casinos any entitlement to unlimited-prize category A machines has had the perverse consequence of encouraging UK operators to ratchet up their plans to develop large regional casinos. The Committee saw that coming, which is why we recommended that the Government should not concentrate on limiting the number of casinos with category A machines, but instead should focus on how many of those machines will be available in aggregate, where they will be located and who will operate them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para23">
<a name="stpa_179">Are category A machines more harmful? No one knows. They are certainly untested in the UK market, and we need proper research based on their operation. It is not strictly necessary for a regional casino to have 1,250 machines all in category A. As Mr. Tobin Prior of Kerzner Casinos admitted to us,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;there is a misplaced fear that all Category A machines are going to have some amazingly high jackpot which is going to lead to compulsive behaviour which is not borne out in reality. It is not a sustainable business strategy and a mix of lower frequency lower pay out machines will predominate on the gaming floor in the &#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000 pay out category.&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para24">
<a name="stpa_180">The Committee saw those volumes, albeit in euros, during our visit to France. Of course, even a &#163;10,000 payout is five times the &#163;2,000 maximum that is currently available on category B machines in casinos and which the Government intend to retain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para25">
<a name="stpa_181">The Government have the opportunity to achieve several objectives by making relatively modest amendments to the Bill. First, as the Committee recommended, they could increase the category B maximum payout to at least &#163;5,000, or perhaps &#163;10,000. That could be done through the regulations. Secondly, they could restrict the number of category A machines in regional casinos to no more than, say, 250&#151;a fifth&#151;with the rest being category B and C. That could be achieved by amending clause 163(3). The Government&#039;s decision to limit the number of premises with unlimited-prize category A machines would be preserved, but there would be greater fairness to the existing industry, as well as a removal of much of the incentive in favour of big regional casino developments that might lead to more modest proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para26">
<a name="stpa_182">However, changes to machine entitlements alone will not be enough to convince a sceptical public that Britain is not about to become the Las Vegas of Europe. I doubt whether there is a market for more than 20 regional casinos over the next 10 years. My preference would be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 71</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for national strategy to achieve no more than that number, not through a cap in the Bill, but through a planning strategy. The likely locations are already well known, and guidance to regional planning bodies could limit numbers to two casinos per region, with perhaps three or four in London, making 20 in all. That could be achieved through planning policy statement 6. It is essential to prevent anyone from circumventing planning policy by introducing a separate planning category for regional casinos. I warmly welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s remarks about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para27">
<a name="stpa_183">Planning guidance needs to err on the side of caution and to reflect the fact that regional super-casinos should not&#151;must not&#151;be located in largely residential areas or be included in mixed-use developments, including new housing. I therefore warmly welcome the Government&#039;s decision to allow local councils not to issue any new casino licences in their district. Conservative councillors are now predominant in local government, and I am confident that they will have the wisdom to implement that where appropriate. The Minister may laugh, but I say that because one would think from reading some of the newspapers that they are incapable of making decisions. That is not so. There is a snag, however. If they say no to all casinos, that is fine, but if they say yes to one or two they could end up with significantly more. The Government still have not addressed the danger of the floodgates opening to a larger number and the problems of saturation that that would bring. Such saturation would undermine the statutory objectives of the gambling commission, which should be the focus of everything that we decide to do through the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-19_para28">
<a name="stpa_184">The Government, across all Departments, must give priority to the Bill&#039;s statutory objectives; otherwise, they will not succeed in what they wish to do. If there is cross-departmental co-operation on the issue of planning and control, there is no reason why the Bill should not succeed in its joint aims of strengthening the protection of children and the vulnerable while allowing new opportunities that are sensibly controlled and robustly regulated.

Leeds could not accommodate that; the demand simply would not be there. Operators would be unlikely to start building these things to compete with each other in a city of that size because they would not want to involve themselves in that amount of competition.

They can find out who put the money on, and to see that there is an integrity in gambling. That has not been the case before. However, they need the resources to be able to follow that up.

There are close similarities between these arguments and those relating to the production and sale of alcohol. The role of the state is surely to ensure that the activity is properly regulated and to provide care and help for those who cannot cope. The Responsibility in Gambling Trust will be able to do that well, because it will have the advantage of funding and the ability to introduce a statutory levy if required. I am very much in favour of the setting up of the new trust.

That would bring about a huge proliferation in gambling. We put &#163;1 on the lottery to try to win several million. I see no difference between that and allowing the smaller casinos to have much larger limits on their payouts.

The DCMS had one set of priorities, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister had another, and the Treasury was, as usual, lurking in the background with its own aims and objectives. Our report highlighted those conflicts, but unfortunately, they have not been adequately resolved. In our final submission to the Government, we said:

Finally, they are concerned about the issue of retaining roll-overs so that they can generate high prizes, which was proposed by Budd, and confirmed in the White Paper, but is not mentioned in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_213">I have talked to my constituents in Blackpool about the development of what were originally resort casinos, what they would prefer to be destination casinos, and what are currently called regional casinos. Interestingly, they would only want them in the town if they were part of a genuine regeneration effort. Blackpool council is to be applauded, as it conducted an extensive consultation exercise back in 2002, as did our local newspaper, <i>The Gazette</i>, and people were fairly evenly split on whether they were in favour of resort casinos coming to Blackpool. When they were asked about the regeneration potential, however, the number of those in favour went up markedly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_214">The other question is: what do we mean by regeneration? No definition of regeneration has been offered and I would urge both Ministers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and their colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to provide one. To me, regeneration means attracting new

<br>&nbsp;<br>jobs, new schools and new opportunities, and it must be part of a much wider package. We cannot just build developments&#151;development and regeneration are different. New regional casinos are different from swimming pools, ice rinks or velodromes, which can just be deposited in areas of a town or city&#151;casinos are large complexes offering entertainment 24 hours a day, with large high-value jackpot machines. They are major enterprises and must be part of a much larger plan to achieve the regeneration for which my constituents would look.

<a name="stpa_215">The Government are relying on regional planning organisations through their regional spatial strategies, but I must ask the Minister whether that is enough. In the north-west, I am pleased that the regional development agency, the regional assembly and the Government office for the north-west have come together and commissioned a research paper, from which they will develop an interim policy framework, which will help inform their regional spatial strategy. Are other regions doing the same? What happens if individual policy framework documents conflict with each other? How will the RSS interact in different regions? The Government should consider developing a national policy framework within which regional planning bodies can operate. If we are given a definition of regeneration, we can all work from it, and the process will offer transparency.

<a name="stpa_216">I was going to mention concerns about use class orders, but I am pleased about the Secretary of State&#039;s announcement earlier, and her statement about pulling together a policy document before new casinos are allowed. There was a real fear that some casino developers would take advantage of the lack of existing planning rules, and sneak in their proposals via local authorities that would welcome whatever money they could get. I spent 12 years in local government, yet I find myself saying&#151;for perhaps the first time in this place&#151;that local authorities should not necessarily have that key role, because it could lead to a proliferation of large casinos. There must be a national strategy and a regional perspective, but of course, it is local authorities that could and should consult their local communities, and which understand them best.

<p>
<a name="41101-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_217">But even if the RSS worked properly, if agreement were then reached at regional level to have as many as seven large regional casinos in each area, 90 per cent. of people in this country would be half an hour away from such a casino. How can regeneration be achieved on the back of that? We must also consider concerns about the resulting proliferation of gambling. If those who might be addicted to gambling are half an hour away from a large regional casino, the dangers associated with such addiction will be greatly increased. Some in Blackpool have argued to the Joint Committee that destination casinos can address that problem. When people have to travel further, they plan how they are going to spend their time and money. That would be a much better system, and hopefully it would address some of the concerns that many Members have expressed.

The most worrying aspect of this debate is that neither the Government nor anyone else have made a convincing case as to why we require such casinos at all; nor have they explained convincingly that we can be certain that casinos will not impact adversely on communities.

<p>
<a name="41101-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_220">We need to look at the evidence in considering the unwelcome and unreasonably optimistic view that this proposition will somehow bring great benefits. Some 25 years ago, the inhabitants of Atlantic City, in New Jersey, were told that wonderful things would happen if they went in for the big casinos. They were told that things would be terrific&#151;that what was a pleasant and prosperous little place would become very exciting. In fact, in the first nine years following their introduction, crime rose not by 10 or 20 per cent., but by 107 per cent. Businesses closed down all over the place, and the number of hotels reduced dramatically. Where before there were 2,100 hotels and businesses in Atlantic City, now, only 60 independent hotels remain. Unemployment, far from disappearing, got into a bad way. In 2002, unemployment in New Jersey as a whole was running at only 3.8 per cent., but in Atlantic City it was 9.9 per cent. What was promised to be great proved not to be great at all.

My fear is that we will do enormous damage to existing casinos. I represent Southend-on-Sea, which has three casinos. I was not terribly happy when the first one came, but in fairness, thanks to the activities of the current and previous Governments, gambling in Britain is run in a remarkable way, and more sensibly and properly than in almost any other country. As someone who lives locally and who travels quite a bit, I have not received a single complaint about any of the three casinos, except for complaints from two people who claimed that they had been excluded from them because of bad behaviour. Those casinos operate on the basis that people cannot simply walk in. They have to be members and to apply for membership 24 hours beforehand, and if they do not follow the rules they can be excluded.

The gaming and betting industry employs 82,000 people, and last year it generated an income of &#163;1.76 billion. It is a big industry that works extremely well. I hope that the Government will say whether they have given any thought to the impact on existing casinos&#151;of which there are many&#151;of these dramatic new regional casinos. Such casinos are huge and will cost a fortune. If they offer massive prizes from their wonderful machines&#151;one Member congratulated the Government on ensuring that they will contain only 1,250 such machines&#151;the effect on existing casinos could be devastating.

If we go ahead with what are a substantial number of regional casinos, the effect could be devastating. Of course, they could also increase the amount of gambling; indeed, in order to pay for the new premises, there would have to be a huge increase in gambling.

The impression that I gained was that under the proposed minor changes, young people would not be able to use certain machines. Such a proposal seemed very unusual indeed. Apparently, young people were to be prevented from using category D machines, such as cranes that grab toys, coin pusher games involving 10p and 2p coins, and redemption machines that issue tickets as prizes.

How would they like to run a business employing many people and spending much money, if all the time they were subject to the danger of a Government bringing in new regulations that could put them out of business?

<a name="stpa_228">Over the past few weeks, considerable criticism&#151; some justified, some not&#151;has surrounded the publication of the Bill. I was a member of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee and I certainly found the whole exercise very positive in helping to create, by and large, a good Bill. I remain cautious, however, about some of the Bill&#039;s provisions and I will want amendments in certain areas before I give it my wholehearted support.

<p>
<a name="41101-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">One of the criticisms is that the Bill is being rushed through, but I do not accept that. To counter it, I would say that, over the past 30 or 40 years, the gambling laws have been tidied as deemed necessary at the time. For instance, when casinos were first permitted in the early 1960s there were more than 1,000 of them, but serious problems about their legitimacy led to their being regulated and reduced to a realistic number soon afterwards. According to Library statistics, we now have some 131 casinos.
</p>

<a name="41101-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">Another review was conducted at the time of the Gaming Act 1968, but it was not until the mid-1990s that it became apparent that serious reform was required. Indeed, it could be said that the Gambling Bill before us now was initiated in 1996 by the Gaming Board&#039;s call for substantial reform of the 1968 Act. In March 1997, the then Conservative Government were in the process of significant deregulation of the casino industry via two deregulation orders, which were introduced to avoid the need for primary legislation. It is worth noting that a significant element of those orders was to increase the number of casinos in the UK by 21 without primary legislation, so I am surprised by the Leader of the Opposition&#039;s current stance, especially given that he was Home Secretary at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">The Bill clearly provides more protection for the vulnerable and children while allowing for a more regulated industry, coupled with possible regeneration of many areas of the UK. The safeguards and benefits have largely been absent from previous reforms. Fortunately, the general election stopped the Conservatives&#039; proposals for 21 more casinos being passed without the proper scrutiny of primary legislation, hence the Bill before us today.

The Gaming Board still urged major reform, spurred mainly by technological progress and by people&#039;s ability to gamble in a less regulated and protected environment through the relatively new betting exchanges, remote gambling and betting on horse racing via TV from the comfort of their own homes. In other words, we were in an era of 24-hour, seven-days-a-week gambling, much of which was unregulated.

I was pleased, therefore, when, in 1999, the Home Secretary announced the setting up of an independent review body to look into all aspects of the gambling industry, which led to the publication of the Budd report in 2001. After significant consultation, the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee was formed last year and reported earlier this year, leading to the Bill before us today.

<a name="stpa_234">The concept of resort, regional or destination casinos, as the Committee wanted to call them, provides an opportunity for the regeneration of many areas of the UK, particularly seaside resorts, by enabling local authorities to make gains from section 106 moneys for other add-on facilities. However, the number of casinos must be restricted: it is no good allowing market forces to dictate how many and where they will be put. There must be an element of direction, and I suggest that a maximum of two resort casinos in each region would be more than enough, as they would represent a fair geographical spread of the investment. Perhaps as an interim measure, we could restrict the number to one per region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_235">That investment would result from regional planning bodies being able to determine the permitted areas, taking into account the regional economic strategy and, just as importantly, discussion and consultation with the local planning body and the local community.

<a name="stpa_236">Another area of concern that directly affects my constituency and those of many other hon. Members are the new restrictions on existing family amusement centres, which have been an integral part of the British seaside resort for many years. I can remember when I was a child visiting the amusement arcades during the summer months. Even then, anyone under 14 was summarily kicked out by the attendant for being under age&#151;not that I was, of course, I hasten to add.

<a name="stpa_237">In my view, the British Amusement and Catering Trades Association&#039;s code of conduct protects children, who will not, I believe, face any more risk of becoming problem gamblers under the Bill. Currently, children under 16 have to be accompanied by an adult, which provides even more insurance that such venues will not turn children into the problem gamblers of tomorrow. I am sure that there will be some isolated cases against that argument, but the experience and knowledge that I have gained from having lived in Great Yarmouth all my life lead me to believe that these centres are an accepted, well regulated and necessary part of the British seaside resort.

<a name="stpa_238">Another matter of concern is the restriction to be placed on family amusement centres, which could reduce their viability.

There is no evidence to suggest that problems are being created for children or for whoever plays these machines. I would certainly welcome funding for a report to look further into that matter. Another issue is the protection of existing amusement centres through &quot;grandfather rights&quot;&#151;a matter of great concern to many working in the industry at seaside resorts. Those and other issues must be dealt with in Committee.

<a name="stpa_239">Overall, it would be foolish for us not to agree with many of the measures that the Bill will introduce. Recent negative press reports have whipped up hysteria based on fears rather than facts and have done no service to the debate on a serious issue. Indeed, comments from across the spectrum&#151;from the industry itself to the charities that deal with problem gamblers&#151;have welcomed many of the Bill&#039;s proposals, which in some cases give real protection to the vulnerable in our society and to children for the first time. The critics tell us that if the Bill goes through, it will create another &quot;Australian model&quot; with a huge increase in problem gambling, when the truth is that there is more chance of the Australian model coming to the UK if the Bill fails.

It will also provide real opportunities for regeneration. I shall support the Bill on Second Reading, but I will press for amendments on the issues that I have highlighted&#151;unless, of course, the Tories and Liberals have their way and stop the Second Reading. In that case, there will be no Bill and no further protection for children and the vulnerable from such problems as internet gambling.

In particular I want local authorities to be able to say no, not for three years before facing court cases, pressure and lobbying, but on behalf of their populations and for it to mean no. I want membership of casinos to remain a requirement, although perhaps not 24-hour membership. I do not want alcohol to be served at gaming tables, because that befuddles people&#039;s minds and leads to more betting. Lines of credit should not be offered in super-casinos either.

At Question Time, the Secretary of State failed to answer my question about how the Bill would benefit children. In fact, the Department has done no research that shows what harm is done to them by the existing gaming laws. I see no reason to prevent fish and chip shops and cab firms from retaining their modest slot machines offering a &#163;5 payout for a 10p stake. Local authorities already have the right to ban machines from such premises, but they do not choose to do so. Why are the Government choosing to do it now?

We are talking about a harmless pursuit that promotes economic activity in seaside resorts. The Minister denies that there would be a problem, but there is a problem: his intention to put a black spot on seaside arcades by creating a power that could shut them down overnight. Any seaside arcade owner thinking of investing in gaming machines will be deeply worried, not just by that part of the Bill, but by measures to cut the stake to be levied and the value of the potential prize.

<br>&nbsp;<br>clubs throughout the country that use gaming machines as a direct means of raising income? They are licensed to have the machines, but do not allow children under 18 to use them. Will not the Government have to find a way to replace the money that many small amateur sports clubs will lose?

<p><a name="st_217"><a name="41101-24_spnew12"><b> Miss Kirkbride: </b> 
 That is a good point. Last year, the Government rightly gave sports clubs of that kind rate relief, but depriving them of the machines could do more damage than depriving them of the relief.

<a name="stpa_268">Members have mentioned the changes relating to category A gaming machines. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page), who has left the Chamber, said he did not see how the new regime would make a difference, but it would produce an environment very different from the one to which we are accustomed. Category A machines are programmed by very clever people to be enticing, hypnotic and addictive. The player feels that he is one point, or one fruit, away from the &#163;1 million prize: he need only chase his losses, and everything will be all right on the night. That is very different from gambling on the horses, because the bookmakers close. It is very different from gambling on the lottery, which can be done only twice a week. These premises will be open 24 hours a day and can be visited by people on their way to work and on their way back. Even on the Government&#039;s estimate, they will be available in up to 40 towns and cities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_269">The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) said that he thought casinos should be available in every region, and what was the problem? The problem is this: people who are addicted to gambling will be able to play addictive slot machines every hour of the day, every day of the week, every week of the year. Again, that is very different from what we have been used to.
</p>

<a name="41101-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_270">The hon. Gentleman gave an interesting response to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) about the number of casinos already in Glasgow. I was surprised to learn that Glasgow already supports six casinos and that planning is under way for five super-casinos. The Government&#039;s proposals will do great damage to existing casinos because as they are not allowed to operate category A machines, they will be wiped out by the new regime&#151;not that I am suggesting that they should be allowed category A machines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_271">There is clearly an incipient demand for casinos of this kind, especially in poorer communities, and the idea that no great social change will ensue from the Government&#039;s proposals is strictly for the birds. With 40 super-casinos across the country, the bulk of the population will have regular access to such gaming. I think that that will herald serious social changes. It will also displace many existing businesses. It will damage pubs, clubs and restaurants in town centres. In order to recoup investment in casinos they will have to drag the punters in by offering cheap booze and meals and free entertainment. Those who do not gamble will have a very nice time, but those who do will be in deep trouble. Their names and addresses will be taken down, and when they have not been there for a week they will be reminded that if they go in they can have &#163;10-worth on the slot machine free&#151;and hey presto, they will end up spending much more than they expected to. I do not think that people appreciate just how such organisations work and it will come as quite a shock as and when the proposals are unleashed.

<a name="stpa_272">Money laundering has not been referred to in the debate to my knowledge since it was mentioned by the Secretary of State. It is shocking that the Government are even considering changing the money laundering regulations in order to allow people to take away their chips. If any hon.

It is quite wrong, but clearly it is the only way that the big American casino operators will be persuaded to come to Britain. It is disgraceful that that should even be considered.

Who will provide the returns on the investments made by the casino operators in our town centres? It will be those who can least afford it, the people who think that their lives can be changed by a big win on the category A machines, and it has to be a lot of people if tens or hundreds of millions of pounds of investment is to be recouped.

One day it will come up and I will clear up as well. I might not have learnt how to beat the odds while I was at Ladbrokes, but I did come to appreciate how efficient, profitable and socially responsible a business Ladbrokes is, and I am certain that those attributes are also shared by other bookmakers such as William Hill and Paddy Power.

<br>&nbsp;<br>industry is one of the best regulated, and most orderly and efficient in the world. For those who have a moral objection to gambling, such virtues will be of no consolation, but gambling remains a leisure activity for the vast majority of those who participate, and it is essential that they should have confidence in the industry&#039;s probity. One of the main attractions of the British gambling industry for those at home and overseas is that it is overwhelmingly free of corruption and is not controlled by criminal interests. I wholeheartedly support the Bill because I believe that it will reinforce such a well-merited reputation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">The reaction to the Bill, especially in the media, has bordered on the grotesque. I will always respect those with a moral track record against gambling, but spare me the anti-Government moralising of the <i>Daily Mail</i>. If the Prime Minister was declared to be the son of God, and there are some Labour Members who believe that he is, the <i>Daily Mail</i> would undoubtedly be whipping up support for the devil. On gambling, as on many other social issues, I am a libertarian. Providing an individual&#039;s activities do not imperil, attack or destroy the lives and interests of other individuals or species&#151;or species&#151;Government involvement should be minimal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">Life is not of course simple and straightforward, and there will always be those who take any activity to excess, whether it is gambling, drinking, smoking, eating, shopping, or, indeed, sex. Such people need help, but I assume that we would not seriously consider banning the activities in order to protect the obsessive minority to the detriment of the responsible majority. In such situations, the Government&#039;s job is to offer advice and information to enable people to make informed choices, and where necessary the Government should regulate. That is precisely what the Bill sets out to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">I particularly welcome those parts of the Bill that seek to update casino rules that are both silly and patronising. The 24-hour membership rule is the most obvious example, but membership of a casino should be retained and that can be considered in Committee. I know that the British Casino Association would support that. However, if the Bill is defeated on Second Reading and there is no Committee stage, many of the good points made tonight cannot possibly be addressed.

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">I find it strange that in London, for example, only certain boroughs, such as Westminster, Camden and Kensington, are allowed to have casinos. I personally would like to see a casino in the east end as part of leisure and recreational facilities. Indeed, in 1990 when I proposed in the House the idea of a directly elected mayor for London, which I believe was not universally welcomed at the time, I also proposed that part of the resources available to the mayor should derive from gambling profits in London. I recommended then, 14 years ago, the liberalisation of gaming laws to allow the setting up of municipally owned casinos in London and elsewhere, operated by others maybe and under licence, particularly riverboat casinos on the Thames, which would add to the attraction of the city. It is right that the city should be able to benefit from such things.

<a name="stpa_282">Much of the opposition to casinos, which we have spent much time discussing, has centred on their possible proliferation and the likelihood that this part of the industry will be dominated by American big business. The first objection is addressed by the Government&#039;s assurances with regard to regional local authority determination, although there is good support on both sides of the House for a planning strategy for casinos, and that too should be considered closely in Committee.

<a name="41101-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">The idea that the American industry will take over the whole of the British casino and gambling industry is alarmist.

At the moment, bookmakers in this country cannot accept sports wagers from US residents, either online or by telephone, nor do they accept casino, poker or other kinds of gaming. The federal legislation, the Wire Act, explicitly prohibits sports betting and, it is claimed, internet casino wagering as well.

<a name="41101-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">As we know, internet gambling is the fastest growing unregulated part of the British gaming industry, and it seems right that we should regulate it, but we should also try to persuade the United States to bring its gambling laws up to date. It is wrong that the Americans should have the right to refuse a business operation based in London, Gibraltar or elsewhere, and we should push them hard on that. If they are to have access to our gambling industry, we should insist that they bring their laws in line with ours. Officially, one cannot bet online or on sports fixtures in the US, but anyone in any bar in New York knows that in fact one can. The American gambling regime is much like ours before 1961.

The mood of the House has been clear, and even those who have supported the Bill in broad terms have said that there is quite a lot wrong with it. The hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) offered the most sensible compromise solution when she said that all the stuff relating to casinos should be scrapped and the rest kept. I might be prepared to go along with that, but the fact remains that this is a very bad Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">The Government&#039;s strongest argument is that the status quo is indefensible, and they have attempted to portray all those who seek to defend it as fantasists. Frankly, there is not much wrong with the status quo. For the past 40 years or so, gambling has been well regulated and we have had fewer gambling addicts than in other countries. The situation is reasonably under control and people can enjoy themselves without going to the extremes seen in countries such as America and Australia. Of course, the status quo gets out of date from time to time, and I understand that internet gambling must be controlled, but why not have a Bill devoted to that subject alone? Let us deal with it head on. There is no need to change radically the whole basis of gambling regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_290">The situation in this country is fundamentally satisfactory, and with occasional tinkering&#151;perhaps quite major tinkering from time to time&#151;we can avoid throwing out the baby with the bathwater and keep what is good about the current set-up. Other countries are envious of what we have achieved: a balance between the liberal approach of allowing people to gamble if they want to and avoiding the damaging consequences that have become obvious in many other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_291">The Bill will inevitably lead to a proliferation of super-casinos. Let us not forget where all this started: the mob wanted somewhere to launder their money, so Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky founded the casinos that are the forefathers of today&#039;s. Then America took it a step further and casinos were built in depressed places such as Atlantic City in the recession of the 1980s. I have full sympathy with the seaside resorts argument, and there is undoubtedly a problem in places such as Blackpool, but let us deal with that specifically&#151;there is no need to change the whole scenario. Again, the Americans set up casinos on Indian reservations to help their depressed economies, and we have seen the consequences of such ideas in Australia as well.

<a name="41101-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_292">When the Government are told of the appalling growth of gambling addiction in Australia, they say, &quot;Oh well, it would be different here.&quot; Frankly, I doubt it. Whatever regulation we have, I bet the inevitable market forces will break through and make maximum use of any gaps left in the legislation. I am the realist on this, not the Government. If they think that they can staunch the problem by regulation, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. The weight of demand will burst through.

Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor) pointed out how many hotels and restaurants had closed as a consequence of such development.

 The fact that the country&#039;s gambling laws need to be tidied up and brought up to date is not in dispute. Most Members will also welcome the proposal to consolidate into a single Act of Parliament all the legislation relating to the various categories of gambling. I am equally confident that the formation of a gambling commission to license operators and key personnel working in the gaming industry with significant powers to regulate, supervise and enforce high standards of conduct and social responsibility throughout the industry will be welcomed. The measure of democratic control given to local authorities by conferring on them responsibility for licensing gaming premises also has the broad support of Members of Parliament and of much of the gaming industry and the public at large.

<a name="stpa_299">Having said all that, I believe that that is where consensus on the Bill in its present form comes to an end. The Bill&#039;s publication has triggered an outcry from Church and religious groups as well as charitable institutions and welfare organisations. It has caused anger and resentment in many parts of the leisure and gaming industry, and it has caused great alarm in the minds of many Members and among the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_300">The issue of greatest concern to us all is problem gambling. The British gambling prevalence survey suggested that we have somewhere between 275,000 and 370,000 problem gamblers. Gambling addicts, like those who suffer from alcohol and drug addictions, are usually in denial of the problem. Those who accept that a problem exists are keen to hide it. It is not unreasonable to assume, therefore, that the official estimate of the number of problem gamblers significantly understates the problem. Even if we accept the official estimates, taking the mid-range figure of one third of a million problem gamblers, most of those people will have parents, spouses, partners and children, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that in excess of 1 million of our citizens&#039; lives have already been blighted by problem gambling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_301">The Budd report highlighted many, but by no means all, the potential negative consequences of problem gambling, including financial hardship, debt, exposure to loan sharks, bankruptcy, resorting to theft, imprisonment, neglect of family, the breakdown of relationships, domestic and other violence, poor health, absenteeism, stress, depression, anxiety, suicide, burdens on charities and burdens on the public purse. We can all imagine the psychological scars left on the children of families whose lives are shattered as a result of a parent&#039;s gambling addiction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_302">It seems to me that a top priority for the Bill should be the introduction of measures aimed at reducing the incidence of problem gambling and procedures designed to mitigate the effects of gambling. We must ensure that the Bill&#039;s passage does not exacerbate the situation by bringing about a significant increase in problem gambling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_303">The Bill starts well enough. The measures to establish a commission and protect young people and children, as well as the promise of a gambling prevalence study every two to three years, show a commitment by the

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government to tackle problem gambling. However, the lack of detail on what is to be done and how the Bill will be applied makes an objective assessment of those measures&#039; effectiveness impossible. If the Bill were simply about establishing a gambling commission to oversee and regulate all aspects of gambling in Britain and to introduce measures to tackle problem gambling, protect children and transfer the licensing of premises from magistrates to local authorities, I would, even given the lack of detail, be more than happy to support it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_304">Of course, the Bill does much more than that. It removes a number of regulatory measures, which will allow a significant expansion of gaming in Britain. The only limits to expansion appear to be market demand and local authority resistance. On one hand, we are considering a series of non-specific measures designed to tackle problem gambling, while, on the other, we are considering removing existing regulations to allow an unknown, but probably sizeable, increase in gambling. That will undoubtedly lead to a significant increase in problem gambling. To allow a virtually uncontrolled expansion of gambling without having put in place and tested the protective measures that the gambling commission may introduce is, frankly, a recipe for disaster. I could not support that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_305">Surely a far more sensible approach, as many hon. Members have said, would be to allow a limited number of pilot projects in designated areas and to evaluate their impact on gambling behaviour. That would present an opportunity to identify and address any problems that arose before the Bill&#039;s full provisions were introduced throughout Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_306">It is self-evident that just as alcoholics do not become alcoholics by choice or overnight, but do so through repeated heavy drinking, so gambling addicts become that way because of repeated participation in gambling activities. It logically follows that increased participation in gambling among the population will involve a proportionate number of people who have the social, psychological and emotional characteristics that make them vulnerable to gambling addiction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_307">I shall make a couple of observations about the Government&#039;s proposals for casinos. The first relates to the decision to allow alcoholic drinks to be served at gaming tables. I am very uneasy about the wisdom of that decision for two reasons. First, casinos tend to have a highly charged atmosphere, in which it is easy to get carried away. Consuming alcohol while gambling is fraught with danger, and it should not be encouraged. Secondly, having to leave the gambling area to have a drink provides an opportunity for punters to chill out and take stock of their situation. I ask the Minister to give further thought to that.

<a name="stpa_308">The other issue that I wish to raise regarding casinos has caused much anger and concern in the gaming industry. It is the arbitrary and prescriptive way in which casinos have been classified. I am unable to detect any logical, moral or commercial imperative that led the Government to draw up their plans for casinos. I believe that those plans should be removed from the Bill and that the gambling commission, local authorities and the industry should be allowed to develop a limited number of pilot projects that meet the needs of the area in which

<a name="stpa_309">Finally, I raised earlier this afternoon an issue that concerns me as the Member of Parliament for a seaside town and which causes similar concern to businesses that have amusement arcades in Morecambe and BACTA, which represents them. Clause 56 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;The Secretary of State may by order create an offence of inviting, causing or permitting a child or young person below a specified age to use a Category D gaming machine.&quot;</p>

<a name="41101-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_310">I must ask once more, because I do not think I had a sufficient answer earlier, whether the Government are really contemplating bringing in a law under which a parent could be prosecuted for allowing a child to roll a 10 pence piece down a chute or operate a crane in an attempt to win a small cuddly toy. If they do not intend to do that, why can they not remove clause 56? For what reason should it remain if it is not to be implemented?

<a name="41101-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_312">I do not believe that legislating to allow the proliferation of gambling is in the interests of individuals, communities or the country. Gambling is a particularly pernicious activity when it affects poorer members of society who cannot afford to lose, but who will always do so. The problems with the Bill are synonymous with the problems with gambling itself: it gives a little, but takes far more back and on an ever-increasing scale. The result? Only the Treasury in the short term and the casino companies in the long term are winners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_313">The only value in the Bill is the attempt to modernise and streamline gambling laws that have been unreformed for 40 years. I welcome the establishment of a more powerful gambling commission and the extension of the legislation to cover internet gambling, although the proposals duck the worldwide nature of internet gaming. However, I fear that any winnings that could be reaped from such reforms will not be banked but lost, as deregulation permits a rash of super-casinos to be created across Britain, making the inclusion of measures to protect children appear no more than a sop to our conscience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_314">The Prime Minister has estimated, we are told, that in the absence of a statutory limit the Bill will lead to between 20 and 40 new super-casinos with 24-hour access and unlimited jackpots. The Government have rejected the Joint Committee&#039;s proposals for higher minimum casino sizes and non-gambling facilities, even though those proposals would limit the number of casinos and where they could be. The Bill would leave casino corporations free to use section 106-type agreements to seduce cash-strapped local authorities and pave the way for what I would call a plague of casinos throughout the country, despite the Prime Minister&#039;s reassurances.

<a name="41101-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_315">Increased ease of access to gambling is the key problem. People will be able to gamble day or night across the country immediately they choose to do so. Prior to the Bill, the 48-hour, then 24-hour, cool-off period during which new members could not use casino facilities was deliberate. It ensured that the decision to gamble was a considered choice. The removal of that safeguard will allow people to act immediately, lured by the false promise of financial gratification or acting on impulse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_316">Previous legislation was also based on the premise that gambling facilities would be sufficient to meet the unstimulated demand for them. In contrast to that, the Bill will sanction the development of casinos across the country, and that increased supply will in itself stimulate demand. That is a complete reversal of what went before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_317">The Budd report recognised the link between deregulation of gambling laws and an increase in problem gambling. That connection has been well proven in Australia, where deregulation of the gambling industry, and in particular, the increased immediacy of access through slot machines at casino entrances has become a major cause of poverty. The cost to the community in Australia is 5.6 billion Australian dollars, on top of the 1 billion Australian dollars already staked and lost. The logic is indisputable. If something is more widely available, it is more easily available to people who risk becoming involved beyond their means. One does not need to be a bookmaker to realise that that is not a very good bet for this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_318">Problem gambling is defined as

<a name="stpa_319">and it affects some 350,000 individuals and their families across Britain. It would be splitting hairs to try to distinguish between problem gamblers and people with problems who gamble. The net effect is the same. Gambling addiction is best considered as a continuum&#151;a slippery slope made more greasy as more opportunities to gamble exist. Ease and speed of access is provided and the pernicious promise of unearned, instant gratification is promoted.

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_320">I am not an absolutist. I recognise that there is a considerable difference between a weekly &#163;2 flutter on the football pools and gambling in casinos or online. However, the general principle remains. Gambling does not do individuals any good, nor is it to the common good. It does not increase the wealth of the nation, but sucks in and makes more destitute the poorest in our society, leaving them with nothing except the desire to try their luck again.

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para23">
<a name="stpa_322">Responsible opposition to the deregulation of the gambling industry should not be derided, as it has been, as an illiberal extension of the nanny state or snobbery. However, the fact that such initiatives are coming from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport raises the question: what type of culture the Government are trying to promote? Do we really want a culture that penalises saving and actively encourages the waste of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 99</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>gambling? My motivation for opposing the Bill is not puritanical but utilitarian. Any Government have a duty to reduce the harm that individuals can do to themselves and their families rather than to facilitate it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para24">
<a name="stpa_323">Why are the Government therefore legislating to deregulate casinos? We know that the promised regeneration that doing so may bring will not be cost-free, and will be undermined by the accompanying social degeneration. We know that 93 per cent. of the population are against the Bill and that the vast majority opposed casinos opening in their neighbourhood. In this instance one can acquit the Government of trying to be populist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para25">
<a name="stpa_324">The Bill, particularly the provisions on casinos, seems to be driven by a financial consideration, whether as an objective or a welcome side effect. Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Excise collected &#163;1,530 million in gambling duty between 1998 and 1999&#151;22 per cent. of the gross gain in yield. It is estimated that by 2010 deregulation of gambling will have delivered at least &#163;400 million a year more in taxes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para26">
<a name="stpa_325">Tax revenues from gambling, combined with the regenerative measures that casino companies will have to implement in exchange for planning permission mean that the Government&#039;s pockets will be lined by the deregulation. I can see no other reason for that relaxation in gambling. However, in years to come, the inevitable damaging impact of gambling will have to be dealt with and paid for. If the Bill becomes law, expensive initiatives will have to be developed and financed to combat the effects of gambling on individuals and society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-26_para27">
<a name="stpa_326">The financial myopia of the Bill, and a desire for taxation by stealth, typifies the Government&#039;s entire strategy. They give with one hand, then take back far more with the other, while ignoring the harmful side effects. I hope that the House will reject this damaging, short-sighted and blinkered proposal, which would do some good, but would do a great deal of harm as well.

 I salute the Secretary of State for being here today, given the sadness that she has been through recently, and for the example that she sets to others on the Treasury Bench. In her opening speech she said that she was prepared to listen, although the normal procedure is that when Secretaries of State have finished speaking and the Opposition start, they do not appear again until the winding-up speeches.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_327">Having listened to the debate, my right hon. Friend will know that there have been two themes that have knitted together almost every contribution to it. The first theme has been that there is no contention but that most of the Bill is needed to bring up to date the legal framework within which gambling operates in this country. Equally, there has been a concern about the possible or likely side effects of licensing mega-casinos, and I wish very briefly to develop three themes that bear on the consequences of those mega-casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_328">It is significant that, in the arguments that the Government have used in defending the existence of that part of the Bill, they have not been playing the ball; they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 100</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have been kicking the players. A number of allegations have been made against those who may oppose the introduction of mega-casinos in this country. It has been suggested that we might be against gambling. The record shows that I have supported every gambling Bill that the Government have introduced since I have been a Member of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_329">It is also said that there is more than a whiff of anti-Americanism about those who oppose the casino proposals. When the Government are really under pressure on the Iraq war, they sometimes give the nod to the Lobby that I am prepared to go out and defend them. I willingly do so; I am proud of the special relationship that we have with America. I am just so sad that it is not strong enough for us to convince our American colleagues that there is a difference between policing and bombing. I speak as somebody who is very pro-American and who knows that Europe is free because of the lives that Americans gave, so there is no hint of anti-Americanism in what I have to say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_330">Neither am I part of that lobby&#151;it has had some recent conversions, thank God&#151;that believes that people should not spend their own money. I cite just one example. Back in 1975, which I know is before many of my hon. Friends were born, I tried to persuade our party that our policy should be to sell council houses and use the revenue to build new stock. I was told that our supporters were not capable of managing their own homes. I find it just slightly galling that some of the people who say I am being patronising in opposing the new super-casinos opposed the sale of council houses in those early days in the belief that our supporters were not up to spending their own money and running their own lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_331">So none of those arguments holds as far as I am concerned, but the Welsh nationalists put a very serious argument earlier. What does it tell us about the Government&#039;s regeneration schemes if we now have to depend on mega-casinos to reach those parts of our poorest areas that none of our other regeneration policies has touched? I use the phrasing from a lager advert, which shows that I am a drinker as well. We have to accept the argument that the Welsh nationalists put in saying that, despite all the initiatives that the Government have taken to try to bring some of our poorest areas towards the level of the average areas of our society, let alone the richest ones, we have not succeeded as we had hoped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_332">There is therefore an attraction for me in the Government&#039;s argument that we should think of mega-casinos as an agent of regeneration, but I do not believe that they can hold that line unless they are prepared to concede a cap on the number of casinos. If we have more than one casino in the north-west, no casino will be situated in Blackpool, despite the eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble). They will go to Manchester, Liverpool or some of the other richer places. Indeed, if more than one licence were granted, and one casino went to Blackpool and another went to Manchester, the Secretary of State would need all the resources that the armed forces have in this country to drive people up the motorway away from the Manchester casino and into Blackpool. Regeneration will not take place in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 101</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>areas for which she is holding out hope in the Bill unless she is prepared to limit severely the numbers of super-casinos for the whole country, and I believe that she should limit them to one per region. I know that some of my hon. Friends will think that I am weak in thinking that we might have six or so pilots around the country, but I believe that experiments should be tried in each of our regions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_226"><a name="41101-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Martin Salter  (Reading, West) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend consider another measure to which the Secretary of State&#151;I say this while she is in her place&#151;might like to like to give some thought? If the Government are serious about ensuring that the super-casinos can happen only with the will of the local communities and authorities, they should write into the Bill in Committee the ability for local authorities solely to determine any planning application and not allow the casino operators the right to go to appeal. We all know what happens when giant corporations can, in many ways, hold local councils to ransom over the planning appeal process.
</p>








<p><a name="st_227"><a name="41101-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Field: </b> 
 We know precisely that, but I intervened on the Secretary of State earlier because of my fear that, under the European convention on human rights, she will not be able to hold the position of not allowing appeals. Although the Government will have a lesson dealt out to them by the referendum in the north-east&#151;I think that we will get the result this week&#151;I believe that the only way of guaranteeing that local people will have a say will be to give them a vote on this matter in a referendum. Even in the European Court, there would not have to be an appeal if the people themselves so decided.

<a name="stpa_333">If we are serious about using the Bill as another agent of regeneration where all our other policies have failed, we cannot have more than one casino per region.

The thought is that we are involved only in high politics, but our concern on Second Reading is on the principle. As to the thought that we might vote against the Government to try to influence them and risk the Bill, that is precisely what I ask my hon. Friends to do this evening. We have never defeated the Government. They know that, if they have a tough time on Second Reading, a number of us are prepared to vote against them in the Lobby and many more are prepared to abstain, and their hand will be weakened on Report.

 We will never throw the Bill out. We have never been able to throw out a Government Bill on Second Reading, but the more of us who tell the Government that we are unhappy with their proposal and that we will vote against it or abstain, the more power we will have on Report. Of course the whole House wants, say, 90 per cent. of the Bill. Should there be a major uprising and should the Government be defeated, we know perfectly well that they would announce from the Dispatch Box that they would introduce that 90 per cent. tomorrow in a separate Bill. They will not be defeated. That is not the issue. We do not wish to defeat the Government. What we need is a large vote against and an even bigger abstention, so that when we come to the Report stage the Government hand is so weakened that our wish will carry the day.

We have laws about drugs, tobacco advertising, alcohol sales and gambling because of the individual and social consequences that would flow from a free-for-all. I make no apologies to those from the libertarian camp when I suggest that by continuing to restrict gambling, we are becoming or continuing to be a nanny state.

<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 104</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_343">Whether we like it or not, gambling disproportionately affects those with the least disposable incomes. Recent research has shown that more than three times as many problems arise for gamblers in households where there is an income of less than &#163;15,000 compared with those in households with an income of &#163;32,000 or more. This July, personal debt in the United Kingdom topped &#163;1 trillion for the first time. Citizens Advice tells us that it has seen a 44 per cent. increase in the number of people seeking help with debt problems over the past six years. Average household debt, excluding mortgages, is now &#163;7,000 per household. Problems of personal debt are becoming worse by the day and the Bill would only add to the numbers of those who become mired in gambling debt and fall into unsustainability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_344">Why would that happen if we passed the Bill? Experience in this country and elsewhere shows that, if we make it easier for people to do something, more of them will do it, even though that might harm them and their families. If the Bill becomes law, it will make it easier for people to drop into a super-casino that is placed in a highly accessible location, either in the high street or out of town. Is it fanciful to imagine that new super-casinos might be placed in a new development with a supermarket on one side and some sort of cinema complex on the other? They will be placed where people will be enticed to pop in once they have done their shopping or, even worse, before they have shopped for the family for the week.

<a name="stpa_345">Many new players will be attracted by the prospect of a life-changing jackpot from category A machines. Less time to reflect on the consequences of stuffing money that someone can ill afford into a one-armed monster will mean that more people will, on impulse, do precisely that. The Bill will lure more people into casinos, and some of them into the swamp of addiction and debt.

Although the Secretary of State has tried to reassure us that there will be some sort of restriction because of market or industry predictions about the number of super-casinos, if no restrictions are placed in the Bill there is no guarantee that over the next five or 10 years there will not be a major casino in every community.

<p><a name="st_231"><a name="41101-28_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Grogan  (Selby) (Lab):</b> 
 I am a gambler. I love gambling. I love the thrill of being beside the rails at a race track cheering my horse home or tearing up my betting slip in frustration. I love going to casinos to play roulette and I love going to Walker&#039;s bingo hall in Selby, which is one of centres of the community where people meet their friends. When the great Selby floods occurred three or four years ago, the community met in the bingo hall to discuss its response because the bingo hall was the only building big enough for the purpose.

<a name="41101-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_350">I hope that I will not be accused of being a snob or do-gooder if I express my profound doubts about aspects of the Bill. To paraphrase a former American President, &quot;It&#039;s the machines, stupid.&quot; Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming Association, told the Joint Committee that slot machines are now the economic driver for the casino industry. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) was right that the Bill will be a massive culture change. At the moment, casinos in this country contain 800 category B machines with a maximum payout of &#163;2,000; one new super-casino will contain more machines than that. No one in the British industry wants those machines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_351">In the past few days, the British Casino Association has said that its reputation for integrity and honesty, the need for a low level of problem gambling and the recent public debate mean that no category A machines should be located in this country. The other casino operators&#039; associations have long held that view, as has the British Amusement Catering Trades Association, so no British organisation based in the gaming industry advocates those machines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_352">It is not hard to see why British gaming associations take that view. The Secretary of State discussed prevalence studies and examining experience, but experience around the world, whether in Australia or in America, shows those machines&#039; potential addictive capacity. The Bill will allow rows and rows of machines to be situated in gambling warehouses. The machines are designed to mesmerise people and keep them making three or four pulls a minute to try to win &#163;1 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_353">I do not want to be distasteful, but some big casino warehouses in the States change their carpets every three months, because some gamblers are so keen not to miss out on a win that they do not go the bathroom and stand in front of the machine all night. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is distasteful, but it is true, and that is how addictive some of those machines are. We must examine whether we want category A machines in this nation and whether we should restrict them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_354">One argument is that if one has doubts about the Bill, one is elitist and is stopping the emancipation of the working classes by preventing them from going to casinos. If one examines who goes to casinos&#151;I do&#151;it is a cross-section of the British population. Only 7 per cent. of people currently go to casinos, and BACTA conducted a survey of their social class: 26 per cent. are A/B; 31 per cent. are C1; 22 per cent. are C2; and 22 per cent. are D/E. People who go to casinos are spread around the regions, one third of them are women and they are ethnically mixed, so casinos currently attract a small but diverse percentage of the population. The argument that some parts of the country do not have

<br>&nbsp;<br>access to casinos is strong, and I can understand changes to the permitted area system and having some new casinos, but not in the way envisaged in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_355">I want to say a word about the Bill&#039;s implications for bingo. The bingo industry has tried, with some success in recent years, to build upon its strengths. What will happen to bingo as a result of the Bill? One cannot mix bingo, roulette wheels and machines in small casinos, but one can mix those activities in large casinos and really big regional casinos. The Government&#039;s regulatory impact assessment says that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;the regulations may lead to the formation of combined bingo clubs and casinos with a gaming floor of over 1,500 square metres&quot;,</p>

<a name="41101-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_356">which


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;might lead to an increase in machine gambling among C2, D and E income earners and a reduction in bingo admissions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_357">It goes on to say that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;a widespread conversion of bingo clubs to casinos, which offer greater opportunities for machine gambling for their profitability, presents a risk of an increase in problem gaming among present bingo players.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_358">We must think seriously about the extent to which soft and hard gaming should be mixed up. There is no need to be elitist about this. We can learn from the American experience&#151;60 per cent. of all profits at Atlantic City are made from pensioners. The big casino companies bus in pensioners, offer them a couple of free games of bingo, then say, &quot;You&#039;ve got an hour to wait until the bus home&#151;why not have a game on the slot machines?&quot; That is the economic driver. If we do not have such a mix in small casinos, why should we have it in large ones?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_359">The question of whether size matters has been debated. As the Secretary of State said, the Government have raised the minimum size of small casinos to 750 sq m. They rejected the Committee&#039;s view that for regional resort casinos it should be raised to at least 7,500 sq m. If size matters among small casinos, why does it not matter at the top end of the market as well?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_360">This has been a fascinating debate in which virtually every Member&#151;bar two, I think&#151;supported a limit, to some degree, on large resort casinos. Almost no one adopted the Government position that it should be left to the market, because most of us recognise that this is a major, radical change that will, according to the regulatory impact assessment, benefit the casino industry but harm much of the rest of the gambling industry. There will be a series of unintended consequences across much of our social fabric. For example, many community pubs depend on small category C machines, and it is not clear whether those that serve food as well alcohol will be able to keep them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_361">I urge the Government to think again and to put a cap on the number of super-casinos&#151;a move that would have widespread support in the House. I take the leadership of my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), whom I will be proud to follow into the Lobby. We need to send the Government the message that unless they compromise in Committee or on Report, an amendment will be tabled to try to impose such a cap; and, given the tenor of today&#039;s debate, that could turn out to be an interesting vote.

 I agree with the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) that this has been an interesting debate. The speeches made by hon. Members on both sides of the House show that there are substantial differences between us. The subject certainly stirs up a lot of passion. It makes a refreshing change to come into a Chamber that is relatively full by the standards of today&#039;s House. I know that many of those who want to participate may not have the opportunity because of time constraints, but it makes a substantial difference if Members are here listening to the arguments and a certain amount of dialogue takes place across the Chamber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_362">As Members of Parliament, we all, through our constituency surgeries and mailbags, get a good handle on where there has been bad law in the past and what should be a Government priority in future. Gambling is not necessarily an area that I would have said we needed to jump into. I have learned a great deal during the debate from Members who have lived with the issue over a period of time. The legislation that the House has passed previously, which goes back principally to the 1960s, has done a pretty good job for this country and has lasted very well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_363">At that time, the aim was to create a legal industry and to keep it away from crime. We have created a very successful industry in which last year &#163;63.8 billion was gambled in one form or another, of which &#163;7.8 billion resided with the industry&#151;&#163;3 billion for gaming, &#163;2.3 billion for the national lottery and &#163;2.5 billion for horse-racing associated gambling. There are also 130 casinos and a quarter of a million gaming machines in the country, so we do have a pretty successful industry. We have been left, however, with a bit of a compromise, in that gambling is available to those who go and look for it, but we do not have the kind of in-your-face casinos that entice us in with flashing lights and fountains that we see in foreign countries and places such as Las Vegas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_364">The 24-hour membership rule means that people have to be pretty committed and think through the consequences before they go in and start gambling. This has been an impediment. I have always thought that that rule was a bit like the warning on a cigarette packet. Anyone who is tempted is made to think again and consider their position before they start to participate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_365">I am sure that most of our citizens, being sensible people, like a bit of fun. We have heard that quite a few Members of Parliament like to have a bit of fun gambling small sums of money. However, gambling can be addictive, and some people have a problem with it. I think that we have all come across people who have gone out in the evening with their car and arrived home without it, or who have ended up having to pile up loans on their house. As politicians, we must pay attention to the fact that the consequences of the Bill could be very dire indeed for some people. The Henley Centre has suggested that there are about 400,000 addicted 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 108</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>gamblers in this country, and has expressed concern that these proposals could lead to a considerable increase in that number. I do not think that we, as legislators, should lightly walk away from the possible consequences of what we are doing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_366">The legislation that we already have on the statute book has passed the test of time pretty well and left us with a robust industry that is free of crime and works pretty well. We all understand, however, that the internet, remote communication and online gambling have changed the name of the game, and that there now needs to be a change in the law. I am sceptical, however, about whether we need to redo all the legislation. The moment we start to do that, we shall find that the vested interests of all sorts of people who benefit from the present legislation will be threatened. This applies to quite a lot of fish and chip shop owners in Poole, as well as to people who run takeaways and minicab firms, who might be surprised to lose their gaming machines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_367">There is also widespread concern in the leisure industry, including the ten-pin bowling industry, and among certain pub people that, under the Bill as it is presently framed&#151;we hope that it will be amended in Committee&#151;they, too, could lose their gaming machines. Many of these are small businesses that derive a good percentage of their income from these machines, so the changes that the Government are trying to push through present them with a challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_368">Members on both sides of the House have talked about the penny-pushers and the grab-a-toy and grab-a-gift machines in seaside town entertainment centres, which provide relatively harmless fun. These, too, could be encompassed by the legislation if we are not careful. Almost all the small businesses that have written to me have expressed some concern and many have made a pitch for grandfather rights in regard to keeping particular privileges. I hope that the Committee, when it gets to work on the Bill, will look carefully at the interests of the small businesses that will be affected by it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-28_para19">
<a name="stpa_369">I have concerns about the super-casino concept because it would change the culture of this country. We must therefore be very careful about how we proceed. The history of our legislating on this matter is to be gradual and cautious, but the Government are departing from that in their present proposals. The suggestion of the Joint Committee that we should limit the number of casinos per region was probably more sensible, and the proposals from hon. Members on both sides of the House for pilot schemes in certain areas also have their attraction.

<p><a name="st_233"><a name="41101-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State has argued that the opposition to the Bill is born of snobbishness. It certainly is not; it is born of a concern for aesthetics, and for what we want our towns and cities to look like. I certainly do not want them to be dominated by pubs and clubs where people can drink all day, and by casinos where they can gamble all day and night. This debate is about what we want for our country, in terms of amenity and quality of life.

<a name="41101-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_370">There are difficulties in relation to what may be a massive increase in the number of machines and the increase in the number of casinos. We may be moving a little too fast, and I would want such development to slow down. As we have heard, if, as it appears under the current proposals, super-casinos can go to centres of population, they may go to more prosperous areas, which may mean that places such as Blackpool, which have been looking forward over the years to such leisure visitors, may lose out if centres such as Manchester are allowed to develop super-casinos. There is a dilemma over to how we allow larger casinos to develop.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_371">I am not a fundamentalist on this matter. In some of our seaside resorts, if casinos provided people with an added reason to visit, hotel rooms would be upgraded and the salaries of many local employees would increase, which might be a boon. If that development were replicated all over the country, however, it would not have the advantages of a place such as Blackpool because it would rely purely on local trade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_372">The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) was important&#151;a local authority can reject any casino in its area. Once it gives permission for one, however, it is pretty much impossible to stop permission being given for further casinos. He also raised the problem of saturation. Of course, there is a market reason why there may not be saturation, but equally it may be that all the casinos pile into one area. On the south coast, for example, Poole might decide that it did not want casinos, whereas two miles down the road, Bournemouth might be saturated. That may be a decision of Bournemouth borough council, but it might have an implication for good or ill on my constituents in Poole. I see the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), who represents an area a little further along the coast, is nodding. Those issues must be examined in detail in Committee.

<a name="stpa_373">Other aspects of the Bill are welcome, such as tidying-up some of the lottery legislation, particularly, as was mentioned, in relation to hospices. I welcome parts of the Bill, but I have concerns about the general thrust and the spin that the Government have put on it, and which has caused such concern in some of our national newspapers. I suspect that we will debate the finer details of the Bill for some time.

For example, if the Bill is passed, children in Weymouth will no longer have access to fruit machines suitable only for adults, kids in Portland will no longer be able to gamble on the internet as easily, and if a child in Swanage should manage to side-step those regulations, for the first time, those responsible for allowing that child to gamble will be liable to prosecution.

<a name="41101-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_376">Just as I welcome those new protections for children, I welcome the regulation for the first time of betting exchanges and fixed odds betting terminals. I also welcome the new industry-funded trust of &#163;3 million each year to counter problem gambling, and the creation of a gambling commission that will monitor problem gambling and have the power to investigate, prosecute and enter premises, seize goods, void bets, levy unlimited fines and remove gambling licences. These new protections are essential in an industry that has been transformed by technological advance since legislation last came before this House in any substantive manner, more than 30 years ago. The legislation has to be modernised now, as many people have said, and we would be sleeping on the job if we did not act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_377">I have been concerned for some time with problem gambling, hence parliamentary questions that I tabled in January about plans to ensure that the gambling industry funds a trust to help those with such an addiction. I have therefore observed from afar the problems in Australia, which some Members have mentioned. The recent modernisation of gambling in Australia is often cited as a reason not to enter into such a process in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_378">In fact, the Australian model has served to demonstrate the dangers of unrestricted liberalisation under the banner of modernisation, and has proved a timely example of what not to do here in the UK. Problem gambling has soared in Australia because of the decision to allow high-end gambling machines in everyday high street locations, such as pubs, bars and restaurants. For example, in Victoria and New South Wales, there are no restrictions on these &quot;pokie&quot; machines, so exposure has risen dramatically. In contrast, the Gambling Bill proposes that machines be removed from 6,000 unlicensed high street locations. This is a completely different form of modernisation from the Australian pig in a pokie.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_379">Many Members would prefer that this issue simply go away, but contrary to what the media would have us believe, we are not introducing gambling to the unsuspecting UK consumer. Gambling is here now; it is popular and it is not going away. Many Members may not be aware of the extent of prizes currently available in bingo halls. My hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) spoke eloquently about bingo halls and I am sure that he has played the national bingo game. Some 500-plus licensed bingo clubs link up every night except on Christmas day, and prizes of &#163;100,000 on weekdays and &#163;200,000 on Sunday nights&#151;the Sabbath&#151;are offered. On selected occasions, prizes can range from between &#163;500,000 and &#163;1 million, and the highest pay-out so far in a bingo hall was &#163;985,000. Indeed, it is ironic that although companies such as Gala 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 111</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and Rank offer those prizes as part of a national game of bingo, under this Bill such prizes in their casinos will be limited to only &#163;2,000.

<p><a name="st_236"><a name="41101-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mike Hancock  (Portsmouth, South) (LD):</b> 
 What does the hon. Gentleman expect the average spend to be in an evening in a bingo hall? I suspect that it will be no more than &#163;15, whereas the average spend in a large casino in the United States is some $150 per person.
</p>








<p><a name="st_237"><a name="41101-29_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman asks that question, and I can tell him that the average spend in a bingo hall is &#163;30 a week, and &#163;60 a month in a UK casino. Individual punters in this country spend more on bingo than they do in a casino.

<a name="stpa_380">Ultimately, most people realise that the best way to leave a casino with a small fortune is to go there with a large one. Despite all the opportunities that we currently have to gamble, the two angels have not yet descended on the gates of Sodom, and society is still intact. The UK has a successful and highly responsible industry, as many Members have said. The national debate thus far has seemed oblivious to this fact, and we can improve the Bill by building on the success of our domestic industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_381">Put simply, it is not the role of Government to restrict unreasonably or to suppress artificially an industry that has shown itself to be responsible. Rather, it is their role to create an environment in which business can thrive and individuals can act free from constraint, and in which regulations and safeguards ensure that the vulnerable are protected, and that the integrity of our social fabric is maintained over the long term. The Bill aims to strike that balance and I will vote in favour of it this evening. Given that 90 per cent. of it increases public protection from the negative effects of gambling, it is surely logical for Members from all parts of the House to give it a Second Reading tonight, and then to thrash out our differences over the other 10 per cent. during the remaining stages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_382">In the second half of my speech, I will focus on that 10 per cent. I share the concerns expressed about letting the market determine the number of regional casinos. I am worried that we seem to be standing ready to throw the doors open to a plethora of relatively unknown, untested and outsized casino operators, with unproven social responsibility credentials here in the UK. I am concerned that the market free-for-all that the Bill would create in respect of regional casinos will compromise its aims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_383">We currently have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the developed world. If we are to preserve that, we surely need to be able to monitor the situation as it unfolds. The currently favoured big-bang approach would not allow that, and it could therefore negate some of the protections introduced by the Bill, consigning them to the status of mere retrospective measures. We have the opportunity now to adopt a more gradual roll-out, allowing the progressive relaxation of regulations, while monitoring the effects and ensuring that the protections are effective. Why not take that opportunity?

<p><a name="st_238"><a name="41101-30_spnew0"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that a more gradualist approach would also allow our indigenous business sector, with its well-deserved reputation for integrity, to leap in as a builder of this sector? It would allow our businesses to benefit themselves, as it is not open only to international investors. Internationally, not just America, but South Africa, Europe and others will be involved.
</p>








<p><a name="st_239"><a name="41101-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Knight: </b> 
 I quite agree; that is precisely the tenor of what I am saying. A gradual roll-out would allow the established British industry to adapt to the new regulatory framework and to compete on more equal terms. Its solution would be to delay the introduction of category A machines or the capping of their stakes and prizes for an initial period. Meanwhile, the stakes and prizes for category B machines could be raised, perhaps up to &#163;10,000, effectively narrowing the gap between large and regional casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_384">I can see the self-interest in those proposals and I am cautious in case it negates the regenerative effect while allowing the later proliferation of category A machines in the existing 130 casinos. Their limited size would mean fewer actual machines than in the regional casinos, but I understand the Government&#039;s view that we should restrict the number of outlets and their geographical spread. Personally, I am attracted to the Joint Committee&#039;s alternative proposal of an aggregate national cap on the number of category A machines, as outlined earlier in the debate. However, those in the industry who argue that we should retain membership are correct. In that respect, I agree with those on both sides of the House. I believe that the directive on money laundering will require proof of identity, so there would be little extra regulatory impact in requiring membership. I agree with removing the 24-hour rule, but believe that membership adds a moment of reflection for the individual and a helpful form of control for the operator.

<a name="stpa_385">Some sort of cap on the number of regional casinos, at least in the short term, would assuage fears of a gambling explosion and allow us to test the market over time. My constituent, Mr. Dave Harkison of Swanage, e-mailed me last week, suggesting a limit of two per region, which I think is pitching it in roughly the right place. That limit might be best achieved through planning.

<p><a name="st_240"><a name="41101-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Nick Hawkins  (Surrey Heath) (Con):</b> 
 First, I have followed the debate on this area of the law throughout my time in the House. As the Minister and other hon. Members are aware, I have, not once but twice, been the shadow spokesman for my party on gambling&#151;first when the Home Office was the responsible Department and again until May this year now that gambling is the responsibility of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. My first involvement was as the Member for Blackpool, South in my first Parliament.

<a name="stpa_388">I should refer hon. Members to my entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests, as many other hon. Members have done, but point out that the major part of my speech this evening will be about casinos. The British company that asked me to do some consultancy work for it after I left the Opposition Front Bench in May is not involved in that field, so there is no conflict of interest when I speak about casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_389">My involvement in considering the original plans for resort casinos began when I was approached in the very early 1990s by Leisure Parcs, which was the pioneer of the concept in the UK. The main people behind the company&#151;Mr. Trevor Hemmings and Mr. Marc Etches&#151;came to the House at that time and gave briefings on more than one occasion to Members of all parties who had an interest in the matter. They pointed out the way in which resort casinos in other countries, particularly in parts of the USA, had successfully been used to create regeneration.

<a name="41101-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_390">The main burden of my views throughout the history of the Bill&#151;the Budd report, the Government&#039;s White Paper, all the work of the wonderful Joint Committee, which as many have said has been so ably led by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), and all the work by Members of all parties&#151;has been to try to ensure regeneration. I share that view not only with my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, but with my hon. Friends the Members for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), who is on the Front Bench and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page), as well as with the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) who is on the Government Back Benches.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_391">If the Bill is not right by the end of its parliamentary process, the great irony will be that the very people who have spent years trying to promote the idea of resort casinos might find that the areas where they have been trying to pioneer the concept do not benefit. As Members from all parties have said, if we do not get it right and mega-casinos are allowed to proliferate everywhere, the run-down resorts that most desperately need regeneration will not end up with super-casinos and will not be regenerated. That is why the Government were so unwise not to accept all the recommendations of the Joint Committee.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>influential Government Members in another place were members of my hon. Friend&#039;s Joint Committee. I welcome the concessions that the Secretary of State has announced today on such things as use class orders, and I want to consider the Bill constructively. I hope that I am lucky enough to serve on the Committee that will consider the Bill. I expect that it will be given a Second Reading because of the Government&#039;s huge majority, despite some Government Back Benchers voting against it, but I should point out that the Labour peers who served on the Joint Committee made it clear in all their work that they cared about regeneration just as much as I do. I therefore hope that in Committee the Government will be prepared to accept&#151;at least to consider seriously&#151;many amendments, because I suspect that if they do not do so, they will have to accept amendments from those influential Labour peers who served on the Joint Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_393">Throughout my time dealing with the industry, I have worked closely with the British Amusement Catering Trades Association&#151;BACTA. Its concerns, on behalf of small arcades and machine manufacturers whose businesses are not restricted to seaside resorts but can be in any town in the country, must be safeguarded. I share the concern that hon. Members have expressed that if we end up with a Bill that damages the existing casino, arcade or racing industries, the Government will have done a very bad day&#039;s work. I hope very much that we will not end up with such a Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_394">I recognise in particular the importance of a national strategy on planning guidance, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale have rightly said. I hope that the Government will think carefully about how the Bill can be amended to ensure that casinos can provide regeneration and that they are located where that regeneration is needed most.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_395">I doubt whether I am the only hon. Member to suspect that the Government ignored the Joint Committee&#039;s recommendations because of the dreaded influence of Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury. One can imagine the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with all the disapproval that he might initially have felt, given his background in the manse, for expanding casinos, telling Ministers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, &quot;If you must do this, I&#039;ve at least got to maximise the tax take.&quot; I believe that that is why the Government have decided not to accept the Joint Committee&#039;s recommendation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is desperate for new tax revenue to plug the black holes that are becoming increasingly apparent in the rest of his policies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_396">We support something that has a positive benefit, especially for run-down seaside resorts. We must be careful that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not get the planning guidance wrong. The planning confusion that the Joint Committee&#039;s report clearly sets out poses a genuine danger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_397">Regeneration must happen in a way that is similar to successful examples in some cities in the United States. With other hon. Members, I had a presentation from the mayor of one of those cities. If I recall correctly, the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), who chaired the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, on which I now sit, said that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 115</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Bill should include something akin to a section 106 agreement. Such a provision would enable the money that the casinos make to be hypothecated so that local communities get it. The Treasury and Governments of both parties have had a fixed objection to anything that smacks of hypothecation. However, it needs to happen. We now have some forms of hypothecation, for example, the use of money that is raised by speed cameras and the congestion charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_398">The Secretary of State has been under huge pressure from her Back Benchers about the needs of the seaside arcades, the need to keep crane machines and coin-push machines, the potential problems for pubs and the need perhaps to allow the lowest category of machines to stay in fish and chip shops and pubs. On the basis of research, we do not perceive any great danger from those but there are potential difficulties, in the view of many trade associations, in the case of a massive proliferation. Several hon. Members have spoken about the dangers of organised crime and the problems of the so-called FOBM and FOBT machines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_399">I agree with the comments made early in the debate by the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson). She spoke about the need for Blackpool and similar resorts to reinvent themselves. If the Bill is amended sensibly in Committee and the Government accept the sort of proposals that my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale and the Joint Committee made, we can get the measure right and provide for regeneration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_400">I want briefly to make a couple of other points. The British Horseracing Board suggests that the Bill provides an opportunity to deal with so-called sleeper bets. As a long-standing member of the all-party group on racing and bloodstock, I believe that the Committee stage could helpfully deal with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_401">All those with an interest in racing will be worried by the news last week from a senior police officer, who is in charge of the current inquiry into some people who are involved in racing, that further arrests have taken place and that those under investigation now number more than 100. The huge inquiry will continue well into 2005. I shall not comment on any matters that are sub judice, but for the good name of racing, it is crucial that it is perceived to be a clean sport. I believe that it is 99 per cent. of the time. However, the Bill could stop betting on horses or dogs to lose. That would be helpful.

<p><a name="st_241"><a name="41101-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Dismore  (Hendon) (Lab):</b> 
 I am not much of a gambler. The last bet that I placed was on the outcome of the 1997 election&#151;I like to bet on certainties. However, I am a trade unionist and I want to approach the debate from a slightly different angle: the perspective of the casino worker. I declare an interest as a member of the GMB, which supports my constituency party and is one of the main unions that organise casino workers in the United Kingdom. Currently, 90 per cent. of casino operators in the UK are trade union-organised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_402">In partnership with the Transport and General Workers Union, the GMB has formed an alliance with Unite Here, the United States trade union that organises casino workers on the other side of the pond. It has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 116</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provided valuable advice and assistance to the UK unions in approaching the debate. It showed that casinos can be significant creators of new jobs. We are considering not only jobs at the gaming tables but a range of ancillary services, for example, in catering and hotels. Those staff and services make a wider contribution to the regional economy. That, however, depends very much on how the industry is regulated, and the approach to the work force. A good employer can create worthwhile careers and decent conditions for casino workers; a bad employer means exploitation, poverty wages and appalling working conditions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_403">That is illustrated by two examples from America. In Mississippi, the superficial reality is that when casinos were allowed tourism increased, as did tax revenues for local communities; unemployment declined, and there were more jobs. The real reality, though, is that the fastest-growing jobs were low-wage jobs; erratic and round-the-clock work schedules made child care difficult; and jobs were of poor quality, with unstable work loads, limited prospects for long-term stable employment, and little hope of career advancement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_404">Contrasting evidence comes from Atlantic City, about which we have heard a good deal in a different context. All 12 casinos there are union-organised. Between 1977 and 1996, the income of casino workers&#151;cooks and housekeepers&#151;increased by more than 100 per cent., compared with only 16 per cent. for similar workers in the state of New Jersey more generally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_405">I believe that companies with bad employment records should not be allowed to operate in the United Kingdom. An example is the Las Vegas Sands casino, whose chief executive is a man called Sheldon Adelson. I have seen a detailed briefing on his activities, provided by Unite Here&#039;s research department. It is pretty horrific. He has been described by the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal</i> as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;perhaps the most vilified man in Nevada.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_406">He has been involved in repeated conflicts with governmental and regulatory agencies. Earlier this year the Nevada Gaming Commission imposed a $1 million fine on the Venetian casino, which he owns, for rigging contests and violating other Nevada gaming regulations. He is in ongoing litigation with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over issues dating back to 1999. He is an extremely litigious individual. I suspect that the Government&#039;s triple-lock proposals would lead to a number of legal challenges and judicial reviews should he be allowed into the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_407">Mr. Adelson has come under fire over working conditions, for failing to remit proper back pay, and for attempting to have workers and their supporters arrested for protesting. He subcontracts a substantial number of jobs, with substandard wages and benefits. He uses his wealth to try to oust politicians who cross him&#151;so I am probably on his hit list now, as some other Members may also be after tonight. He has repeatedly been characterised as difficult to work with, and as

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_408">That is the sort of person whom we could end up dealing with. We must ensure that such operators have no place in the UK&#039;s gaming industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_409">The gambling commission must be required to take into account a casino operator&#039;s previous employment practices&#151;overseas if necessary&#151;when deciding on an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 117</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>application. I believe that there should be at least two employee representatives on the commission to represent the interests of the workers in the industry. An applicant should be required, in particular, to show that he has enhanced family-friendly policies to compensate for the unsocial hours that casino workers have to endure, and that he pays due consideration to the health and safety of staff&#151;especially as casinos will no longer be &quot;member only&quot;, and there could be much looser controls of customers and the risk of assaults by dissatisfied customers. There should be help with travel arrangements for those who must work late and antisocial hours; and there ought to be a smoke-free workplace for those who must work such long hours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_410">Operators should also be expected to provide decent careers and training opportunities. There are good examples of that in Las Vegas, where a scheme administered jointly by the union and casino operators has financed a job training school for catering workers. Some 2,500 students take advantage of the programme each year, and the number is expected to double over the next couple of years. That is a good example, but I think a training levy would be a more effective way of ensuring that those who work in casinos have proper career opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_411">It is likely that national lottery income will fall if people use other forms of gambling. I think that casino operators should also be expected to replace any losses sustained by the lottery through a levy for a good causes scheme to support charities that might otherwise lose out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_412">I share many of the reservations that have been expressed about the expansion of the casino industry with the regional super-casinos. It is important that we consider the number of casinos that will allowed, but if, as I think is inevitable, there are more casinos, whether on a pilot scheme or regulated by legislation or the market, we must ensure that those who work in the casinos are properly looked after, that their interests are represented by the gambling commission and that we do not import into the United Kingdom rogue operators, but operators who will provide a decent working environment for their staff, with decent careers and decent job opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_413">If casinos are properly regulated, they can make a major contribution towards employment in Britain and towards economic regeneration, but that depends on their being properly regulated.

 The origins of the Bill were to provide Blackpool, and probably no more than Blackpool, with a resort destination casino, and for the past two and a half to three years, Blackpool has campaigned hard to be considered for that resort destination casino.

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_414">If one looks at resort destination casinos in Las Vegas, one sees an interesting product, which is not just about the gambling floor but which offers a wide range of entertainment to people of all ages, with subsidised restaurants to attract families and with subsidised accommodation so that people spend as much as

<br>&nbsp;<br>possible on the gambling floor. I do not think that anyone here has an objection to the high quality environment that exists in Las Vegas being transported into the United Kingdom. The objections come when we move to the Bill where the idea of one resort destination casino has changed to possibly 20 or 30, and, it has even been said, 40 regional casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_415">I am pleased that the Government have listened to at least one part of the protest that has raised its head in these proceedings, and, in particular, what Liberal Democrats were calling for in relation to category D machines, which the Government have now conceded can continue to operate, but, according to the Secretary of State, a reserve power will be kept. There is a problem with that in that an amusement arcade operator will think twice about investing in future category D machines. That power could well lead to uncertainty, and we may have pushed the Government halfway there to at least conceding that category D machines should not be included in the Bill, but we now need to push them a bit further not to have that reserve power in the hands of the Secretary of State so that those amusement arcades are safe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_416">I want to raise an issue that no one else has raised and that is the position of offshore water-based gambling on ships. Would a vessel that is permanently moored be a regional casino under the Bill and, if it was moored in one place and then moved to another, which local authority would license it? It is not beyond the realms of possibility that an entrepreneur could convert a vessel into a casino and moor it within our territorial waters, providing a shuttle service to land in order to maximise the reduced costs of operating a casino at sea and to get round some of the tighter regulation that the Government rightly pride themselves on having included in the Bill. I should like to know whether the Government have considered that possibility. There is also the possibility of riverboat casinos, which may be small casinos, but the question remains as to which local authority would grant the licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_417">We have heard that the Bill creates a new gambling commission, which will have responsibility for regulating all forms of gambling. The Secretary of State said that it would have the duty to oversee those who wish to enter the gambling industry. As the Government&#039;s proposal for lots of casinos is aimed at bringing in money from overseas&#151;mostly from the United States&#151;I wonder whether it should be based in Las Vegas rather than in Newcastle upon Tyne, at least for that part of its work that involves investigating the background of those who want to operate casinos in this country.

<a name="stpa_418">The Government say that the Bill will increase opportunities for adults to gamble, while decreasing opportunities for children to gamble.

In a few resorts, casinos may well do that, but I cannot see&#151;I have not heard a strong case for it tonight, nor have I seen any evidence to support the Government&#039;s case&#151;that 20, 30 or more regional casinos would bring such benefits.

<br>&nbsp;<br>jackpots. Those who have not visited a category A environment, as found in the United States, do not know what they are letting themselves in for. These places are geared to maximise the amount of money that people spend, and they operate for 24 hours a day in a windowless environment with no clocks in sight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para18">
<a name="stpa_420">There is clearly a need to reform our gambling laws, which pre-date the internet and the concept of online betting. There is also a case for relaxing the 24-hour membership rule for small-stakes bingo, whereby holidaymakers in my constituency, for example, have to be turned away from bingo halls unless they applied 24 hours in advance. Nobody argues that the laws do not need some reform, and we welcome parts of the Bill, but we have major concerns about the casino proposals. It strikes us that it is no coincidence that the UK, with the tightest rules on gambling in the world, has the lowest rate of gambling addiction per head of population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para19">
<a name="stpa_421">The right of individuals to choose whether to use casinos has to be balanced against the potential social cost of gambling, and especially so-called problem gambling. Indeed, it has been estimated that each problem gambler costs the state &#163;35,000. Government research shows that casinos in accessible locations that offer casual gambling pose a heightened threat of gambling addiction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para20">
<a name="stpa_422">Other social costs can include late-night noise and disturbance, but local authorities do not have sufficient powers to consider those factors in licensing casinos, while in contrast, the new alcohol licensing laws allow for refusing planning permission on the grounds of public nuisance or saturation. I hope that that can be considered in Committee, if the Bill gets there.

<p>
<a name="41101-31_para21">
<a name="stpa_423">I fear that, unless it can be amended, the Bill will open the door to mainly US-run and owned super-casinos with no real stake in the community other than a mission to extract as much money as possible from punters&#039; pockets. With it could come the associated crime and criminality of the Las Vegas underworld. I fear that the Government&#039;s claim that they wish to encourage economic regeneration will in fact lead to social degeneration. The idea that seaside resorts were at the heart of the original proposals will fall by the wayside. If major cities are allowed to have super-casinos, that is where the punters will stay. They will not be attracted to the seaside resorts.

<a name="stpa_427">People talk about problem gambling. The Henley Centre tells us we have about 370,000 problem gamblers, and it forecasts that that number will rise to 700,000 by 2007. Without the Bill, it says, the increase would be much shallower. If we pass the Bill&#151;let us not kid ourselves&#151;we will see an exponential increase in problem gambling. People ask why that should happen here where we have tightly regulated gambling. Just look at what happened in Australia, which does not have such constraints. About 0.8 per cent. of United Kingdom gamblers are problem gamblers, but in Australia it is 2.3 per cent.

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and his Committee for their outstanding work. It has been said more than once that if the Government had listened more carefully to the Committee&#039;s recommendations, particularly those in its second report, they would not be in the mess they find themselves in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_429">Modernisation of the gambling laws is long overdue. The current law has been overtaken by technological changes such as the availability of internet gambling and betting exchanges. We accept the need for change to address such issues. We also support the Bill&#039;s stated objectives of protection from harm, fairness and prevention of crime and disorder resulting from gambling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_430">As our reasoned amendment sets out, we do not support the parts of the Bill that discriminate against our indigenous British industry, which has worked hard over the past 40 years to establish a reputation for responsibility, probity, integrity and safety. It is surely 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 121</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the role of Government, when introducing new legislation, to promote a level playing field and a licensing and regulatory regime that does not discriminate against British-based operators in favour of foreign-based investors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_431">Inward investment is welcome, but it should be balanced, fair and complementary. It is disingenuous to argue, as the Government do, that new investment in regional casinos is open to all, when one group of potential investors is working with one hand tied behind its back. Existing casinos will not be able to compete if the Bill remains unchanged, since it denies them any category A machines. It is generally accepted that the presence of such machines will bring the punters over the threshold. Indeed, so crucial are such machines to the development of the resort or regional casinos that the Americans have told us that they would not contemplate investing here unless they had access to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_432">To continue that theme, concern has been expressed in the press about special treatment being afforded to foreign-based casino operators, largely American, who have perhaps been offered the carrot of favourable tax treatment on the one hand, and on the other a strong Government lobby to improve anti-money-laundering EU directives. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride). The Association of Chief Police Officers has also made representations to the Government about money laundering. It is vital that the Government assuage any fears in the industry that they are doing anything that could be interpreted in any way as favouritism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_433">There is also the question of the Government&#039;s true motivation in introducing the Bill now, which several hon. Members raised. Indeed, there seems to be confusion at the heart of the Government over why they are doing so. The Government told the Joint Committee that a key aim of the Bill was to raise revenue, which was a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) raised. However, a special adviser in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport contradicted that by saying that the expansion of regional casinos would be revenue-neutral.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_434">The Government make much of the potential for regeneration. Indeed, at times they seem to be positively seduced by the prospect of substantial investment in deprived areas. Regeneration, however it comes, seems extremely attractive on the face of it, not only to run-down and deprived areas but to the many local authorities that are looking to promote economic development in their areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_435">The hon. Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) and for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) posed the essential question: what is the definition of regeneration? Is it to be consistent and recognisable in each region of the country? Does the planning system allow for measurable benefits to accrue from permissions for regional casinos?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_436">To move on from that point, but to remain with planning, there is an unanswered question about section 106 agreements. Are they morally right? My right hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_437">Perhaps the key question relating to regional casinos is that of proliferation&#151;a matter raised by many hon. Members on both sides of the House, including my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale and the hon. Members for Great Yarmouth and for Selby (Mr. Grogan). The Joint Committee sought in its second report to address that problem by setting for regional casinos threshold sizes of a minimum overall floor area of 7,500 sq m, of which 4,000 sq m would be used for non-gambling activities. The Government chose not to accept that recommendation, but in doing so failed to address the potential for proliferation. That is where their public relations started to go badly wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_438">Given the problems of gambling addiction, which my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) and the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) raised, it is surely necessary for the Government to have a view on the potential accessibility of gaming machine gambling. That means that they should not only have a clear view of what would be an appropriate number of regional casinos&#151;and hence on accessibility of category A machines&#151;but establish and promote clear unequivocal mechanisms in legislation that will achieve their objectives. Many hon. Members spoke out against leaving that to market forces, and the Government&#039;s failure to give a clear steer on that question is at the heart of their credibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_439">Several hon. Members argued that the control of numbers could be achieved by putting in the Bill a cap on the number of casinos. That could be done in a number of ways, either as an absolute number overall or as a limit per region&#151;say, two&#151;with regional planning authorities and local authorities determining the location of casinos through existing or amended planning legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_440">Other hon. Members asked for pilot schemes or trials in one or two locations, but these proposals are light years away from the Government&#039;s expectation of having from 20 to 40 regional casinos. Who came up with these figures? Many hon. Members&#151;the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders)&#151;questioned the rationale behind the assertion made, and no conclusive arguments were forthcoming from the Government, so we are left concluding that there is no rationale, and the Government are left looking at best disingenuous and at worst incompetent and uncaring.We are being asked to take a quantum leap into the dark, and I get the strong impression from tonight&#039;s debate that a significant number of hon. Members are not prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_441">Labour Members have challenged the Opposition many times during the debate not to vote against Second Reading. If they really want reasons for voting against it, they should look no further than the excellent speech made by the hon. Member for Bridgend or, for that matter, the voting intentions of some of their own Back Benchers. Given the track record of this arrogant Government, why should we trust them to allow the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 123</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fundamental changes that we require in Committee to the clauses that we strongly oppose, which chiefly relate to regional casinos?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_442">This Bill leaves too many unanswered questions. What is to be the tax regime? When will the Treasury publish its proposals? What could be the effect on indigenous British casino operators? How many regional casinos will there be? Why should we believe assurances of close working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on planning issues? What is the scale of potential increase of gambling addiction? These and other questions trouble the House as a whole. They may cover only a proportion of the Bill, but they are disproportionately represented in the scale of their potential impact. Given the record of this Government, we believe that the only way to bring about change is to challenge their fundamental thinking head on. That is why we shall not support them on Second Reading this evening.

<p><a name="st_245"><a name="41101-33_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 This has been an encouraging and, to a large extent, constructive debate. Some 30 Members have contributed, for which I thank them. The quality of the debate reflects the concerns and interests of hon. Members on both sides of the House. The right hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir Brian Mawhinney) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) put a very strong case in arguing for no change to a large extent. That reflects an attitude something like that of my mother, who is a very strong Methodist and is 87. She gave me a lecture when I took her to church a week last Sunday on why there should be no change. Such matters split families as well as the House, but I genuinely look forward to continuing the lively debate in Committee, because I believe that that is where these changes can start to take place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_443">I want to remind the House where we have come from in the past five years. Five years ago, Professor Budd was asked to look at gambling in this country. The Lords deregulation Committee asked him to do so, and many people were concerned at the time that remote and internet gambling had to be brought under control and addressed in law. In 1968, a Labour Government had to legislate to bring gambling under control, remove it and clean it up. Indeed, I believe that Budd, &quot;A Safe Bet for Success&quot; and the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee&#151;I congratulate the Committee, which worked under the able chairmanship of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)&#151;brought to the House considered work, along with a Bill that will restore control over gambling. That has been central to the Government&#039;s thinking, as it was in the 1960s. We must do the same at the beginning of the 21st century. More importantly, we must look at legislation that can respond to the ever-changing needs of society as it is today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_444">I ask Labour Members who are thinking of voting against the Bill to look at Budd, the work of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee and what we said in &quot;A Safe Bet for Success&quot;. This is about protecting the vulnerable. The three principal parts of the Bill are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 Unfortunately, I cannot give way. I have only 10 minutes left. Those on the two Front Benches have tried to get as many Back Benchers in as possible. That was the condition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_446">Some have suggested that the national cap on regional casinos ought to be 20 or 30. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained the tough triple lock that we are putting in place through the Bill. First, there will be the gambling commission. Then, under clause 157, there will be local powers for a licensing authority to say no if it wants no new casinos. Finally, there will be a tough planning system. We are confident that this combination will put casinos in the right place, run by suitable people, and keep them out of places where they are not wanted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_447">A number of hon. Members spoke about the Government acting together. The combined planning and licensing systems will achieve regeneration in the right place. Regional planning bodies will be able to specify suitable locations for regional casinos. Several hon. Members asked how those could be directed to places of need. If casinos are proposed outside the appropriate areas, the proposal can be referred to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_448">We have strengthened the planning regime further with the announcement from the Secretary of State of the use class order, so there will be no escaping the location controls that we envisage. Suitable locations for regional casinos will be considered by regional planning bodies. If they think regional casinos can help to regenerate seaside resorts, they can guide developments to those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_449">It has been interesting to hear the numbers bandied around. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) suggested a formula for one or two casinos per region. With nine regions, that would make 18 regional casinos, plus Scotland and Wales, which would give a total of 22. The bottom line proposed by the industry is about 20&#151;between 20 and 40. The official Opposition Front Bench spokesman spoke of regionalisation. The official Opposition and the Liberals intend to vote against Second Reading, claiming that we will not direct the proper number of casinos to the regions, yet their proposals would produce more regional casinos than projected by those in the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_450">The risk to problem gamblers was another topic of concern. If there is a risk to problem gamblers because of the location of casinos, the gambling commission can advise against licensing them in those locations. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 125</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>licensing authority must have regard to such guidance. I am trying to answer serious questions that were posed about the potential for development on estates in built-up areas to encourage problem gambling. That would be covered by the commission&#039;s guidance on licensing, and we would expect it to act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_451">The hon. Member for Bath asked about individual applications and how they could be rejected. They can be rejected under clause 157. We have said clearly that that would not contravene any European measure. To suggest otherwise is to mislead the House. The provisions of the Bill would enable local authorities to take action so that casinos were not located in built-up areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_452">If we had taken the Budd review at face value and incorporated its recommendations in the Bill, many Opposition Members would have argued forcefully against the proliferation of casinos, because that would have meant many more small casinos than proposed in the Bill. The Joint Committee&#039;s recommendations would have meant more casinos, with category A machines being used in the large casinos. It is estimated that the recommendations would have doubled the number of casinos. We have taken a cautious approach, and a number of Members asked us to do so. We estimate that the increase will be about a third. Given the Budd report, the outcome of the scrutiny Committee and the contents of the Bill, we have taken a cautious approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_453">There are real concerns, and there are some who have had the opportunity to visit Australia, where gambling has got out of hand. The Australians deregulated in a way that even they wish they could roll back, but that is difficult. We took a great deal of advice from people in Australia and throughout the world, and that is why we have adopted our approach. One of the recommendations from the Joint Committee that we did not accept was a 3:1 ratio for machines to tables. We have proposed 2:1. We tightened up on that recommendation. The Joint Committee recommended category A machines in all casinos and we have recommended such machines in only regional casinos. Again that is a cautious approach and a tightening up of the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_454">The Joint Committee recommended an increase in stake and prizes for machines in small and large casinos. We have kept them at their present level, which we believe is the right approach. Via the gambling commission there can be an incremental release over a period if it thinks that that is necessary. We have, as it were, moved back from the Budd report and from the Joint Committee and we have a much more cautious Bill than the measure that would have been if the recommendations of those two bodies had been taken forward.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_455">The hon. Member for Bath talked about the Human Rights Act 1998 being used to resolve local conflicts. We have checked that through and we believe that what the hon. Gentleman said was incorrect. Local authorities are allowed to consider more than the three licence objectives when resolving local issues on casinos. They are able to take the views of local communities into account. They are unable to do anything that is unlawful or irrelevant to them.

<a name="stpa_459">Registration for casinos and members&#039; clubs is allowed. Any casino that wants to run a registration system can continue to do so.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_460">The Bill sets out a clear direction for bringing gambling under control again, as we did in the 1960s. If Members vote against Second Reading, they will be allowing young people&#151;children&#151;to be exposed to internet gambling, to remote gambling, in a way that would be wrong and irresponsible. We can take the other parts of the Bill on board. We can deal with the issues relating to regional casinos in Committee. I am sure that we can find a solution to the problems that have been raised.

<p><a name="st_274"><a name="41101-38_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North):</b> 
 There seems to be a conspiracy among the authors and authoresses of school textbooks that publish information that is never close to being interesting. There are of course exceptions. The writers believe in formula, which dulls interesting phenomena such as climate change and questions such as why are there seasons; the mists, why; the storms, why; and why do birds know the prospects of weather change even more sharply than Penny Tranter or even Michael Fish&#151;if I want to know the weather I watch the birds rather than the BBC or ITV? Do people really contemplate the planet we live on? Are we mystified about where we come from? The Queen is worried about climate change. Did hobbits with small brains once roam the earth? Other questions include, how did the Norfolk broads form, and how do our brains and hearts function?

</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_461">That is what school teaching, and higher education, too, should be about. It should be attractive, because we really want to know. The fault lies, I think, in our education, which is still seen by many as a chore, something that they really have to suffer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_462">School trips and field trips are an important part of education. They give us the opportunity to view our heritage, to be inspired and to be instructed. We can understand where we come from and the county where we live, enabling us to feel proud. I want to talk particularly about science field trips to such places as the Norfolk broads and the Holt and Wells study centres, which are a small part of what goes on in Norfolk. What we do in our counties can help with how we handle issues on the planet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_463">I have been sent evidence from the Norfolk environmental education service, and I conclude that it is struggling to advance its services to our young people. For example, it operates two outdoor education centres&#151;the Eagle canoe club and Filby water activity centre, near Great Yarmouth. It is working with Whitlingham trust, just outside Norwich, to deliver water-based learning opportunities in the new Whitlingham country park, which has had great amounts of money from the New Opportunities Fund and Sport England&#039;s active England programme. It is being overseen by the Norwich rivers heritage trust, which is full of good folk from the region who are interested in young people going to that new outdoor centre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_464">From the environmental education service, I learn that minibuses are in decline, that the centre needs more support and help and that more people are unable to fund field work opportunities at A-level. Interestingly, it says that pupils cannot afford that, but I think it is the schools are having the trouble. They are cutting back and having trouble with visits and exercises in the field.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_465">We are all very proud of the investment in education and the new schools, but why not involve young people in the schools in planning the new buildings so that they can feel proud about how the buildings can be constructed to deal with the environmental problems that are created? What a good way that would be to learn about environmental policies and science.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 144</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_466">Let me return to school visits. Outdoor centres are fine, but my experience as a governor of schools and from trips that we have set up&#151;and, of course, as a constituency MP; people write to us and we are lobbied by the Field Studies Council, the British Ecological Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and so on&#151;is that there are many problems. Many people are frightened by health and safety legislation. I deprecate what the NASUWT has said about the problems and its encouragement to teachers not to involve themselves in vibrant courses that are part of the education process. Other unions do not feel quite as bad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_467">We need to note that accidents are pretty rare. Figures I have seen from the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority show that there have been 57 deaths on school trips, 19 of which occurred during adventure activities between 1985 and 2004. The figures are not increasing, but the perception and fear of litigation remains a serious concern for teachers, provoked by organisations that ought, in my opinion, to know better. Risk can never be avoided in life, but what a chance field trips offer for students to think positively, examine risk and learn about risk and management as part of life skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_468">Bird migration, frog spawning and similar issues can be raised. Why are there four seasons, I often ask myself. Do other people ask that, too? Why not five, for goodness&#039; sake? I cannot think what the fifth might be, but it is interesting that those are questions people may ask.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_469">There is a new subject called phenology, and I find that there are science centres&#151;one at Bayfordbury in Hertfordshire&#151;where the study of nature&#039;s calendar is very important. There they find that, for example, chestnut trees bloom sooner, and many other things happen at different times of the year&#151;and they ask why. We cannot just say, &quot;Climate change,&quot; to people without them asking, &quot;What is climate change?&quot; I think that we should be able to expect our young people&#151;our kings and queens&#151;to understand climate change, but they will not be able to unless they can observe, ask the questions and do the experiments during their education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_470">We often live in a world of fear, and it is time to dispel that feeling. When an Education Minister, a colleague of my hon. Friend the Minister who is here tonight, told me that people do not need to see the milky way for real because they can watch it on a computer screen, I started to think of phrases such as &quot;heathen&quot; and &quot;poor soul&quot;. People need to see the thing for themselves.

<p><a name="st_275"><a name="41101-39_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend will know of my involvement with geology in a previous life. Does he agree that one of the great ways of exciting young people about the science of geology, and to get them to think about the planet on which they live, is to take them to some of the more exciting rock outcrops and show them some of the great fossil deposits? That cannot be done in a lab.
</p>








<p><a name="st_276"><a name="41101-39_spnew1"><b> Dr. Gibson: </b> 
 I absolutely concur. Although there is great stuff on the media, such as the programmes made by the BBC unit in Bristol, that is not enough. There is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 145</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>nothing like seeing things for oneself and asking questions. That is what inspires, and makes people want to study science and get involved in some of the mysteries of life&#151;because we definitely have not found out everything yet, and more ought to be done about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_471">There are other factors that inhibit people from doing field trips. At key stage 2, participation in field work is rather sporadic and varying, and individual school commitment is often dependent on a specific member of staff; when that individual leaves the school there is a vacuum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_472">There is a need to bring back field work in biology. It is statutory in geography but only &quot;recommended&quot; for science. Very little field work is undertaken at key stage 3, despite the national strategy for science, and the situation is little better at key stage 4. The skills shortage of biologists with field work experience in schools will be perpetuated unless biologists themselves provide access to specialist field courses; I compliment organisations such as the Field Studies Council, which is doing that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_473">My figures say that the uptake of A-levels in biology and geography is falling nationally, and that there is difficulty in planning field courses because students will not commit themselves to A2 until they know their AS results. It is often easier not to teach ecology-based modules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_474">Funding has become a major issue. It is difficult when parents decline to contribute voluntarily, as is often asked of them. As a governor, I know about that&#151;and of course, the poorer kids do not get encouragement from home, because of financial restrictions. School budgets are often too small to remedy deficits. When the money comes through from central Government to school budgets, often that money is not used for field courses, but is diverted into other pathways&#151;worthwhile pathways, no doubt, but we miss out on that particular type of activity. Schools withdraw from making residential visits, and that means that inclusion and fair opportunity for all in education becomes a real issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_475">There is also a lack of training to prepare teachers. This is an essential argument, I say to those weary willies who argue that health and safety is an issue. Risk management, and teachers going out of the classroom, is important both for initial teacher training, when people have the opportunity to study field sciences, and for serving teachers. There is a need for all key stage 2 teachers and all science specialists at key stage 3 and above to receive some training during ITT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_476">Serving teachers are doing a wonderful job in the classroom&#151;but gosh, we could do a lot more in their training to make them want to get out there and see the world as it really is, to understand the patterns of life and impart them, and to instruct young people and give them the enthusiasm that takes them onwards. We have a history of academic field work in our education system; it is a learning mechanism and helps personal development. We want to ensure that quality can be delivered in an atmosphere of safety, allowing all pupils the opportunity, and the right, to such experience. I say that it should be for the many, not the few&#151;a phrase that will be familiar to those who are present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_477">I do not think that the answer that I often get from my schools about sponsorship of the school pond by a local industry is enough. Of course, that is fine, but I want to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2004 : Column 146</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>see ring-fenced moneys to ensure that our young people are sent out there to look at things in a safe environment. In that way, we will solve many of the problems that everybody talks about, holding their hands up and saying, &quot;Why don&#039;t young people want to do these interesting subjects?&quot; If we do not give them the chance to go out, see things and ask the questions, and if we do not have a curriculum that encourages them to do so, is it any wonder?

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="41101-39_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Mr. Stephen Twigg): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing this important debate, which is also timely, considering that this subject has been under consideration by the Select Committee on Education and Skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_478">Shortly before the summer recess, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out our Department&#039;s five-year strategy for children and learners. As part of that strategy, we place great emphasis on the challenge for every school to be an environmentally sustainable school with a good plan for school transport encouraging walking and cycling, an active and effective recycling policy and a school garden or other opportunities for children to explore the natural world. We also say in our challenge for secondary schools that we want to widen opportunities beyond the classroom. Those opportunities often provide some of the most memorable experiences at school, such as being involved in the school trip or drama production, or playing in the school team.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_479">I would like to place tonight&#039;s debate very much in the context of those commitments in the five-year strategy. There is a relevance across the curriculum, as I think my hon. Friend set out powerfully in his speech, in science, geography, personal social and health education and citizenship. There is an enormous challenge, of which he reminded the House, to make science in the curriculum exciting and attractive for children and young people throughout their school days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_480">The 10-year science and innovation framework sets out the Government&#039;s ambition, and in particular, the contribution to be made to economic growth and public services by science. Clearly, science education is absolutely central. My hon. Friend referred to the national network of science learning centres for teachers and technicians. There is a major &#163;51 million partnership between the Government and the Wellcome Trust to enable those centres to be established and to act as a focal point for the profession, pulling together regional resources to help improve science teaching and learning. The first three regional centres opened their doors on 1 October this year, with others already offering courses on other sites in the interim, and all nine due to be open at the beginning of the next school year, next September.

<a name="41101-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_481">One aspect of the work of those centres is enabling young people to learn about and use field work, to manage interesting experiments in the laboratory and to have confidence to use a range of strategies together with in-depth subject knowledge. We have funded both the Association for Science Education and the Geographical Association to develop training courses

<br>&nbsp;<br>that will increase teacher skills and confidence in leading outdoor learning. That will be achieved through some of the science learning centres starting next year.

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_482">Clearly, freeing up teachers to teach is at the heart of the work force reform changes in our schools. The extra role for support staff is very important and can contribute to the encouragement and organisation of outdoor activities. Such staff can contribute by acting as local environmental volunteers, for example, or providing cover for a teacher who is out on field work, away from school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_483">In the 10-year science and innovation framework, we are committed to training a new cadre of higher level teaching assistants so that every secondary school in England can recruit at least one by 2007&#150;08. Of course that is not enough. We also need to recruit more science teachers to enable the work to continue into the longer term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_484">My hon. Friend rightly reminded the House of the importance of involving children and young people in these areas. He referred in particular to the challenge of building new schools and involving young people in some of those decisions from an early stage. We have an ideal opportunity to do that with the &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; programme, which aims to rebuild or refurbish all our secondary schools over a 15-year period. As a Government we must rise to the challenge of ensuring that children and young people in our schools and in our communities are part of those decisions right from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_485">Last year we published, &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&quot;, our strategy for primary schools. That strategy encourages a rich and exciting curriculum, with better use of resources and opportunities in and beyond the classroom, to make learning more flexible and imaginative. Outdoor learning is central to the agenda of &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&quot;. I am pleased at the welcome that the document received not only in education, but in terms of the environment and outdoor learning. Getting children out of the classroom to explore the natural world is a powerful way of making science and the broader curriculum come alive. I tread with care when I disagree with my unnamed ministerial colleague whom my hon. Friend mentioned in his speech. I have no doubt that there can be no substitute for the excitement of outdoor learning and seeing the natural world with one&#039;s own eyes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_486">There is an exciting joint project between science learning centres and the Woodland Trust to tie in with the BBC&#039;s spring theme. Each of the regional centres is providing training for primary school teachers on how the arrival of spring can be measured by identifying trees in bud and the appearance of insects. Schools will be able to record their results on the Nature Detectives website as part of a national experiment. These are projects that we want to encourage, so that we can see the flowering of outdoor learning and field work, about which my hon. Friend rightly spoke.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para16">
<a name="stpa_487">I turn to the important topic that my hon. Friend mentioned&#151;some of the barriers that exist or are perceived to exist to outdoor learning. It is important that we build the case for such learning. I concur with my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the Field Studies 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Council for the work that it does. The study that it published earlier this year provides us with substantial evidence that field work effectively planned, well managed and well taught can offer learners opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills in ways that add value to the everyday educational experience in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_488">Our own programme, &quot;Growing Schools&quot;, is funding further research, including in-depth case studies at outdoor sites, and investigating teaching and learning processes, learning outcomes and wider benefits. We are also conducting action research with a group of teachers, field centre staff and farm educators to trial teaching and evaluation strategies. That will report in April next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para18">
<a name="stpa_489">I very much agree with my hon. Friend about the importance of school trips. I recognise that there are barriers to schools doing field work. There are practical issues and others that are less tangible. I am keen to send out the message that we want to help and support teachers in realising that by following good practice, we can ensure that visits are as safe as possible, and we can be confident that unfair accusations against teachers and other staff can be swiftly dismissed. Our own investigations through &quot;Growing Schools&quot; show that there is a generally shared view of the barriers to schools undertaking learning outside the classroom. We want to work with everyone&#151;the teacher unions, the head teacher associations, the other unions, the &quot;Growing Schools&quot; national advisory group and the whole range of national organisations&#151;to make sure we get this right. I would also like to put on record my thanks to the subject associations, especially those involved with geography and science, for the important role that they are playing in supporting us in developing this important work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para19">
<a name="stpa_490">We have produced practical and well-received guidance on health and safety, with five booklets aimed at specific target audiences for local education authorities, for schools and for group leaders, and these are available on our teachernet website. We are doing all that we can to manage the risks. There are risks&#151;my hon. Friend is right&#151;but it is possible for the current system to be harnessed in the way that he described to the educational benefit of children and young people in our schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para20">
<a name="stpa_491">Some people are also keen on the idea of a statutory entitlement to a set number of days of outdoor learning and I can see some attractions in that sort of approach. What we want to do, and what we are doing as a Department, is to work closely with a wide group of partners towards a common vision. A number of our partner organisations have put to us the idea of an outdoor learning manifesto and I am keen to explore that further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101-39_para21">
<a name="stpa_492">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me this opportunity to respond on behalf of the Government and for making a powerful case this evening for the importance of field work in science, in geography and throughout the school curriculum at every stage. I join with him in saying that I think there is a continued and, I hope, growing role for that excellent work in the outdoor classroom.
