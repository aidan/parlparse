<a name="stpa_2">On 10&nbsp;March, the Minister said

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Regions will be able to set their own targets for microgeneration within any national target that we may set, and it would be more appropriate for them to do so, rather than central Government setting them. On those grounds, I oppose amendments Nos. 8, 9, 10, 16, 18&nbsp;and 20.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">That raises a number of important questions. I should like to hear from the Minister at some stage whether he intends to table amendments&#151;probably not at this stage, but when the Bill goes to another place&#151;to give effect to what I have just read out. We shall come to that shortly in another context.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The Minister may think that his words are sufficient, but not all of us are that trusting. We would feel more secure if such important matters were spelt out in the Bill. That, then, is the first question: should this not be subject to an amendment, probably tabled in the House of Lords?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">There are a number of other questions to be discussed. By what mechanism would the regional targets match the national targets? If we are to have a bottom-up approach rather than just a national target, I am intrigued by the question that then arises. Has the Minister thought out the way in which regions will be able to set their own targets within any national target?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">That gives rise to several further questions. The obvious one is whether the process is to be voluntary. Can some regions set targets while others cannot? If all regions set targets, what will happen if the sum of the regional targets does not match the national target? There are a number of potential difficulties. How far has the Minister&#151;or, more accurately, his officials&#151;thought this through, and how do they think it will work? We cannot have Ministers throwing statements into a debate without our having any idea what they mean and how they would be given effect. I am sorry that the Minister was not able to accept my amendments, and I hope that we shall hear some further explanation from him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">That brings me to amendment No. 12. On 10&nbsp;March, the Minister said


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The word &#039;appropriate&#039; is deliberately broad, whereas amendment No. 12, tabled by the right hon.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60317-01_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">That is followed by the key words&#151;at least in this regard the Minister is entirely consistent:

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">That is fine as far as it goes. It is a very reassuring statement of the Minister&#039;s good intentions. As we know, however, Ministers come and Ministers go. I am not sure that any succeeding Minister would necessarily be bound by what this Minister has to say. That is why 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1707</b>

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60317-01_spnew1"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South) (Con):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend is making a controversial point. Is not one of the difficulties caused by the fact that this is a private Member&#039;s Bill, the procedure for which is primarily designed to deal with uncontroversial matters? I have a sneaking suspicion that I shall hear a fair amount from my right hon. Friend this morning, and perhaps from some of his colleagues. Would not the solution be for the Government to introduce measures as controversial as this Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60317-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I could not agree more, and I have made that point many times over the years. I regard it as my duty as a Member of Parliament to pay particular attention to private Members&#039; Bills precisely because they do not have the benefit of the same governmental scrutiny as Government Bills. My hon. Friend is right: if a Bill is substantial and has controversial elements, the private Member&#039;s Bill procedure is not ideal. If the Government wish to suggest that the Bill is essential or vital to the national good, they should be legislating and not leaving it to a Member. I shall not digress further, however, as I do not wish to test your patience this early, Madam Deputy Speaker. In fact, I hope that I do not do so at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">If my hon.

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60317-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I was just trailing what is to come, Madam Deputy Speaker. I wished to forewarn the House about the exciting debates that we will have later. I am warming the House up a bit for those debates&#151;if that is an appropriate term in this subject.

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">We were talking about the word &quot;efficacious&quot;. Although claims are made for the benefit of microgeneration, it should not be assumed that simply to install something that provides power will be the right thing to do in all circumstances. That is why I think that we need a balanced approach, represented by the words

</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">I am using the term &quot;environmentally&quot; in a much broader sense, because we must not forget that those pioneers who developed our planning laws and the regime that supports them saw environmental matters rather differently. Times change, but in my view &quot;environmental&quot; does not mean only matters to do with the climate. It must continue to mean matters of planning and development. In that context, I mean visual appearance, sound nuisance and intrusion into domestic and community life. Those subjects will arise again later, but in the wording of amendment No. 12&nbsp;I was trying to set the scene for a much more balanced approach than has so far been suggested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">One of the difficulties that we have had throughout proceedings on the Bill is that&#151;for the best of reasons&#151;we have not really heard yet from its promoter, from the Minister or from its enthusiastic supporters how they see the crucial balance between the benefits that they claim for microgeneration and the planning difficulties that could arise. It will be important to be clear about that balance before we proceed much further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">On the issue of cost-effectiveness, we must be clear about the likely cost implications of such installations and on whom the costs will fall. Will it be the domestic or business premise owner, the generators or distributors of power or the taxpayer through the Government? That is not sufficiently clear from the Bill, although I would welcome clarification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-01_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">I do not want the Bill&#151;or, to take up the point made by my hon. Friend, any other Bill&#151;to float through the parliamentary process without our having an opportunity to hear about all its different aspects and to take a balanced view of it. That is the value of the parliamentary process. The Committee stage allows the Committee to consider certain aspects of the Bill, but on occasions on which there is an outbreak of consensus, especially between the main political parties, it is even more important that Bills are subjected to careful scrutiny. We need to ensure that the enthusiasts have not run away with themselves. There is a long history of legislation that has received so-called all-party support and has turned out to be thoroughly bad. The best example is probably the Child Support Agency, which we still have not got right, after all these years&#151;

 Indeed, and I am eager to get on to the very important debates that are coming up. I just wanted to warm myself and the House up and get people&#039;s minds thinking along the right lines. I wanted also to see if I could persuade the Minister to clarify his position on the regional-national balance, but he does not look as though he wishes to try to do so.

 Good morning, Madam Deputy Speaker. I suspect that this will be one of the shorter speeches of the day.

<a name="stpa_18">Let us look first at the Government amendments. In passing, it is interesting to note that the Government now seek to amend the Bill substantially.

I have tabled some modest amendments, but this pretty substantial set of Government amendments deserves our attention. Those who have made some mild complaints about the fact that someone has dared to seek to amend such a

 Does my right hon. Friend realise that one of the amendments in this group&#151; No. 80&#151;has been produced by the Government since we adjourned last Friday?

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60317-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I am glad my hon. Friend picked that point up, because I was going to mention it later on. It is significant that if we had rushed through the Bill last week, we would not have had the benefit of the Government amendment that has since been tabled. The Bill might therefore have been defective in some way. The world should be grateful for the fact that the House lingered over the Bill last week to enable the Government to come forward with their later thoughts in the form of amendment No. 80, to which I will come shortly.

<a name="stpa_21">One of the alleged benefits of our membership of the European Union, or, indeed, of the Union itself is that it deals with cross-border environmental matters. Yet, here we are, as I read this amendment, seemingly acknowledging that the approaches taken to these important environmental matters could be different, even within this tiny country of the United Kingdom or within the British Isles, and that the Scottish Parliament might well take a different view. That surely cuts right across all the arguments that I have ever heard about how it is vital that environmental matters are dealt with at not just a national but a trans-national level.

<a name="stpa_22">It would appear that we might have a problem here. If we take the amendment literally&#151;and we can do only that because the Minister did not bother to explain it&#151;we envisage that the Scottish Parliament could digress from this Parliament in its approach to climate change and microgeneration. That is doubly unfortunate, since I would have thought that one of the environmental benefits of having Scotland as part of the United Kingdom is that it is almost certainly much richer in the

Therefore, the idea that the Scots might head off in a different direction, courtesy of devolution and the Scottish Parliament, seems unfortunate.

This was touched on at col. 1088&nbsp;of the <i>Official Report</i> for 10&nbsp;March 2006, when there was an interesting exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and the Minister. We&#151;that is the House, because I do not think we were being properly guided on that occasion&#151;got a little confused about whether we were talking about microgeneration being solely concerned with renewables or whether it went beyond that. That subject will come up in a moment when we look at the relationship between the Energy Act and the Bill, but at that stage we were talking about targets and the Minister was helping to clarify matters. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;The target of 10&nbsp;per cent. is for renewables .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . It is not a target for microgeneration&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10&nbsp;March 2006; Vol. 443, c. 1088.]</p>

<a name="stpa_25">That set the scene for what I want to explore in some of these amendments, which is how far microgeneration, as we now want to define it, is involved with renewables only or whether it can involve any other source of energy.

 Is not this debate useful? Are we not starting to elicit some really useful information? Thank goodness for the parliamentary process, because the Minister has just reaffirmed that this matter, which is outstanding from the Energy Act, will come to fruition at the end of this month. I am grateful to him. It is important because before we embark on Third Reading we might want to have that document from the Government in order to set a proper context for that debate. That is another good reason why it would have been wrong to rush through a parliamentary stage ahead of the Government producing the document referred to in the Energy Act. I am grateful to the Minister, but we should all think a little about how far we want to rush things before getting that report, which must be relevant to the final consideration of the Bill in this House and in another place.

I am not really a suspicious sort of chap, so I hope that I do not evince too much suspicion by hoping that the report was not delayed artificially because the promoter of the Bill and the Minister assumed that we would have completed our consideration. Things should have been the other way round. Fortunately, because the House has chosen to debate the Bill properly and in proper detail, our Third Reading may take place after we have the benefit of the report, which would be a huge advantage.

They may think that by remaining silent they will somehow accelerate the Bill&#039;s progress and rush it through the procedure, because delay is unacceptable&#151;a bizarre interpretation of the legislative process, to say the least&#151;but in fact they are simply forcing us to try to elicit information through the tabling of amendments and the initiation of debate.

<a name="stpa_64">That stems partly from concern about incineration and the resulting noxious substances and partly from the fact that getting the waste to the place where it is burnt and made into refuse-derived fuel involves transport over long distances, storage and the building of substantial plants.

Why does Government amendment No. 52&nbsp;specify particular sources of energy but leave others out of the debate?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_65">The main point that I want to make concerns capacity. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred to that. I have already commented on the use of &quot;sustainable energy&quot; in the Bill&#039;s title as basically meaning anything that the promoters of sustainable energy want&#151;anything other than nuclear. Similarly, many people outside the House will have been misled by the references in the Bill to microgeneration. When people talk about microgeneration they probably have in mind the sort of generating equipment that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition is to put on his premises in, I think, Notting Hill, where he still lives. That windmill will generate about 400W of power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">The Minister is doing better than that because I read in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on Monday, I think, that he is minded to install on his premises a windmill that will generate 1kW of power. It looks as though the Minister has not seen that article, but if it did not come to him in ministerial press cuttings, he needs to get a new supplier of ministerial press cuttings. The article said that the Minister is to have a generator on his premises which will generate a maximum of 1kW of electricity. Obviously, that shows that the Minister&#039;s household uses a lot more electricity than that of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. I will not cast aspersions because of that.

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="60317-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 I absolutely agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, but you will have noticed that subsection (3) of Government amendment No. 52&nbsp;says that maximum capacity in relation to the generation of electricity is 50kW; in other words, the equivalent of a windmill 50&nbsp;times the size of the one that the Minister is going to have on his house or of 50&nbsp;windmills of that size in the Minister&#039;s garden. The Minister laughs, but in doing so he is probably trying to ridicule the notion that that amount of generating power in a domestic garden could be regarded as microgeneration, and that, of course, is exactly my point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_67">Why are we allowing the definition of microgeneration to include units that generate up to 50kW of electricity&#151;more than 50&nbsp;times what is needed for the Minister&#039;s house and more than 100&nbsp;times, indeed 125&nbsp;times, what is needed for the house of my right hon. Friend? When we start talking about microgeneration of up to 50kW, we are talking about very big developments&#151;enormous windmills or whole series of windmills. Why should microgeneration be deemed to include electricity generation 50&nbsp;times or more what an individual household needs? I cannot 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1722</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>understand that. I support the principle of microgeneration and the idea of reducing the need for the national grid to operate and allowing more energy production to be, I think the expression is, decentralised. I cannot for the life of me see that if a household chooses to put up to 50kW of electricity-generating capacity in the garden or on the house that should be described as microgeneration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">I am disappointed that the Minister, when he came to look at the contents of the Energy Act 2004&nbsp;and redrafted its provisions in the amendments that we now see before us, stuck to the figure of 50kW. I hope that he will explain how 50kW can genuinely be called, in popular parlance, microgeneration. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues will think about this subject because if we are to get public support for decentralised power production, surely we need to gain the confidence of the general public. If somebody living, for example, in a seafront bungalow in Bexhill in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) could put up 50&nbsp;windmills in their garden on the basis that it would be microgeneration and then sell almost all that surplus electricity into the national grid, and their neighbours could do the same thing, my hon. Friend would find that Bexhill, far from being a very attractive retirement area with south-facing views over the channel, would basically become an industrial landscape.

 If we get on to the next group of amendments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the hon.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that remark so far as it goes, but I had hoped that he would explain why he feels that microgeneration needs to be defined as anything up to 50kW rather than, perhaps, 1kW, which would surely be much more consistent with the popular understanding of microgeneration. Perhaps when the Bill reaches the other place we will have to ask their lordships whether there is a possibility of introducing into the Bill something called mini-microgeneration, which could be up to 1kW rather than up to 50kW. Whatever the promoter of the Bill says&#151;we will come on to the debate about the planning aspects in due course&#151;the Bill will say that 50kW of electricity generation is regarded as microgeneration.

 My hon. Friend has stumbled across an important part of the Bill. If, for simplicity, we say that one house uses 1kW, amendment No. 39, in effect, provides that a group of 50&nbsp;houses could be covered by a scheme; but clause 16&nbsp;allows up to 20MW, or 20,000kW per scheme, which would supply 20,000&nbsp;houses. Surely the point of the debate is to seek justification of the 50kW limit, when it would seem sensible to reduce the limit to 1kW or perhaps 5kW and thus seriously define the micro in microgeneration.

 You have stolen my thunder, Madam Deputy Speaker, because I was going to say exactly the same thing. However, my hon. Friend has raised a pertinent issue for the next debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_74">The Minister has caused a great deal of confusion, because he said that the maximum is designed to promote community energy schemes, and will apply to groups of houses or flats or small communities comprising large numbers of households. However, in the provision, microgeneration applies to individual households or households within the curtilage of a dwelling house.
</p>








<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60317-07_spnew13"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 That was my reading of the Bill. Clause 9(6) explicitly says that a dwelling house


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;does not include a building containing one or more flats, or a flat contained within such a building&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_75">and it goes on to define a flat. It is not until clause 16, as my hon. Friend said, that community energy projects appear in the Bill. It is therefore important to maintain the distinction between the so-called microgeneration required for domestic dwellings and so-called community energy projects. I am sure that that distinction will emerge much more clearly as the debate proceeds.
</p>








<p><a name="st_125"><a name="60317-07_spnew14"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is right. I shall not press the point any further, because I hope that when we debate the amendment that I have tabled to clause 16&nbsp;he will be able to explain that there is an even higher maximum for microgeneration under that clause than there is under Government amendment No. 52.
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60317-07_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 Would the Government not be in a better position to promote community energy schemes if they lowered the limit for individual residential householders? Householders would appear to be in a good position to receive permission for a wind turbine 50&nbsp;times the size of the turbine covered by the

An AIM-listed company says that a small, lightweight fuel cell which, I believe, almost fits into the palm of one&#039;s hand, can deliver 1kW. Surely, it is not so out of touch as to underestimate by a factor of 10&nbsp;the power needs of the average home? If my hon. Friend is right, one would have to buy 10&nbsp;of those compact fuel cells to supply one household&#039;s fuel needs. I hope that we can get to the bottom of the matter because, as my hon.

That introduced a definition of greenhouse gas in clause 23&nbsp;covering any of the six gases specified in the Kyoto protocol. Surely technology that increases one greenhouse gas but reduces another is not necessarily good technology. Do we not want the impact of technology on each greenhouse gas to be measured?

<a name="stpa_79">Questions were raised about the differences in the definitions of microgeneration and community schemes. Perhaps I can help the House. Microgeneration is for households and community schemes&#151;for example, solar panels on church halls, or the wind turbine that I saw on the building at the Daventry country park when I was asked to visit it&#151;whereas the community energy schemes referred to in clause 16&nbsp;are intended to cover both small scale community installations that could be classed as microgeneration, and larger schemes such as district heating.

 Can the Minister say a little more about what a large scheme might be in this context? We are talking about microgeneration, which would be understood by the layman in a particular way. Now that the Minister has spoken of a large scheme in the context of community projects, could he give the House some idea of the scale? What sort of size of building or installation does he have in mind when he talks about a large scheme?
</p>








<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60317-08_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The technology would determine which section applied to the scheme. It could be a new school.

I rather regret in some respects that I cannot undertake my duties in my own borough today because of the delays that have been caused. The scheme could be a new library, a big new community centre, a new church or church hall or a sports hall.

Presumably, such a scheme would require planning permission in the normal way. If permitted development orders are introduced, the alternative is that 400&nbsp;wind turbines could be constructed on an estate of 2,000&nbsp;houses. Such a development might be beneficial in terms of climate change, but in terms of visual amenity there would be many different views as to whether it was acceptable.

 That is the case with some of them, but not all. If my right hon. Friend had read the open debate in the columns of one of the national newspapers within the past 10&nbsp;days, he would have seen very different positions being taken on the subject by people all of whom would describe themselves as having the best possible environmental credentials. They can agree to disagree, or strongly disagree, with each other on these issues. That is why it is all the more important that there should be provision for somebody other than just the Secretary of State, whoever he happens to be at the time, to get involved in debating whether permitted development orders should be allowed to be used so that these very large generating plants can be constructed without the need for any planning permission or any chance for local involvement in whether they are a good idea.

<p>
<a name="60317-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_98">What size or nature of development could be constructed under a permitted development order under the clause without planning consent? That is the question that several of us are concerned about, and I will try my best to answer it. I know that in due course the promoter of the Bill wants to enter into the debate to give us some assurances. We do not allow permitted development orders to deal with such things as bus stops, bus shelters, street cabinets or even telecomms masts, although we all know from our constituency casework just how controversial those can be. Not long ago, I attended a meeting of the Greater London authority, where no less a person than the Mayor of London answered a question about the location of a bus stop in Richmond. He took the view that he, as the regional authority leader, should be the sole determinant of where that bus stop should be positioned. Under the clause, we would not have that safeguard even for a large microgenerating plant, because it would all be dealt with under permitted development orders. What would our constituents have said in the past, before the health and visual amenity aspects became big issues, if any Government or Secretary of State said, &quot;We think that all these telecomms masts should be put up without the need for any planning permission to be obtained, because it is a jolly good thing that people should be able to communicate by mobile phone&quot;?

Some of us have been receiving representations from constituents who are concerned about the contents of some recent legislation, and we are having to say to them that it is too late to do anything about it because it has already gone through.

 The Minister is shaking his head before he has even heard what I am going to say. The article said that it will have blades that are 1.75m in diameter. In the old-fashioned language of the metric martyrs, that is about 5&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in. That is a fairly significant size. However, that is a very small capacity turbine compared with the maximum 50kW capacity that is permitted under the Bill. Under clause 9, microgeneration as defined in the Government amendment to the Energy Act 2004&nbsp;could have a capacity to generate 50kW. If the Minister were to table an amendment to redefine it as relating to a maximum capacity of 1kW, that might allay many concerns. However, clause 9, coupled with the provisions about the maximum capacity being 50kW, will put our constituents in grave jeopardy and cause them enormous anxiety.

In that case, one would make an application, fill in a form, pay a fee to the local authority and discuss it with the local planning authority, which in due course would develop a policy in its local plan process. That might cover the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) made about whether we should have many individual pieces of generating plant or whether one larger piece of community generating plant would be preferable.

They could ask questions, such as that asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) about the implications for bird strike, the butterfly population and so on.

We know how sensitive our constituents are to night-time noise. I have personal experience of that. We once had a family house quite close to a farm that operated equipment late at night to dry bulbs produced in west Cornwall for the early English spring market. The noise was highly intrusive, but the equipment could run at night under permitted development powers because its use was related to agriculture. There was nothing that a concerned neighbour could do, except to plead with the farmer&#039;s common sense and to ask him to limit the use of the machines to daytime or to put in proper noise insulating material.

There are those who oppose any form of wind turbine, no matter how large or small or whether it is in the country or on someone&#039;s house; and there are wind power enthusiasts who would favour allowing any wind turbine anywhere, whatever its size and wherever it was located. I do not support either of those extremes. The clause is intended to make it possible, in the right circumstances, for microgeneration installations to be placed on people&#039;s houses without the unnecessary bureaucracy that is too often involved at present. That bureaucracy varies from authority to authority, which lessens the possibility of wider use of the technology.

I therefore think that the permitted development order procedure is appropriate.

: Although my hon.

I have no doubt, however, that his worries are unconnected with the intention behind the clause. I welcome what I believe to be its true purpose, which&#151;as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) said&#151;is to permit the installation of domestic appliances, probably the size of a television aerial or satellite dish, which are unobtrusive in any normal sense of the word.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="60317-12_spnew5"><b> Gregory Barker: </b> 
 That is a good point, but this is not enabling legislation. The clause simply asks the Minister to produce a review, which would have to be laid before the House. That would be the proper time to engage fully in the debate on which we are embarking now, and to apply the necessary scrutiny and ask the questions that are being asked today. Once the review had been presented to Parliament, a statutory instrument would be required, which would have to be debated and, if necessary, voted on in the usual way. At that point I am sure that the sensible suggestions in the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) about the parties whom the Secretary of State should consult and the concerns that he should take into account in his review&#151;such as safeguarding conservation areas, protecting visual amenity, reducing noise and avoiding risks to health and safety&#151;will be properly debated. All we doing now is beginning the process, not reaching a conclusion, prescribing behaviour or forestalling in any way the sensible, rational debate that must follow. We believe that if microgeneration is to enter the mass market and become accessible to the domestic householder, a way must be found of making it just as easy to erect small domestic appliances as it is to erect a satellite dish or television aerial. Therefore, I do not believe that those of us who strongly support the Bill would be well served by the rejection of the clause.

 It would be worse because there would then be no compulsion on the Secretary of State to review the permitted development status, and it is important that that status is reviewed, for the reasons that I have set out. We need to streamline the process by

It is not the intention of anyone that a 50kW wind turbine be erected in the garden of a bungalow in Bexhill. As we are at the very beginning of the process, we cannot expect the Bill to prescribe every single outcome of the Minister&#039;s review. I accept that it is broadly drafted, but I hope that the Minister may be able to reassure us that the review will be conducted under sensible terms of reference and with a clear purpose in mind&#151;to enable the fast-tracking of small domestic apparatus, not the nightmare scenarios that my hon.

 Let me continue by saying that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been conducting a review of householder development consents. The review was set up to address the problem that the planning legislation governing minor consents is unnecessarily complex, possibly too constricting and may be interpreted in different ways by local planning authorities across the country. The ODPM proposes to look at ways of simplifying the relevant sections of the secondary legislation, known as the general permitted development order, to make it easier for households to install microgeneration technology without the need for a planning application.

There is clearly some confusion, but this clause is about facilitating small-scale microgeneration, a kilowatt or two. We are not talking about a provision that would allow one of those 50kW jobs to be installed in a suburban back garden. We thought that was obvious, but I am happy to suggest that my colleague, the Minister for Housing and Planning, the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), will write to the hon.

If the Minister had come to the House today and said that this provision relates to microgeneration up to 1kW or 5kW, we might not be having a debate of this length. However, because we are placing a capacity of up to 50kW in the Bill, under PDOs that could, despite the Minister&#039;s good intentions, lead to the establishment of wind turbines that local residents might find unacceptable.

In addition, there is a range of other considerations that cause certain things that are not fundamental to the extension, or the change of the appearance of the property, to remain outside the planning regulations. If one thinks about it for a moment, that is a good thing because otherwise no one could do anything without being snowed under by the requirement to have planning permission, and local authorities could not operate because every time that someone put a porch on their house, or some such, they would have to apply for planning permission.

 Yes indeed, and that underlines my point that there is a boundary on permitted development orders that local authorities can apply, and also, through the general permitted development order, a boundary on the extent to which permitted development orders apply in any event. If one applies that logic, a biomass plant might extend the curtilage of a particular properly by more than 15&nbsp;per cent., which would be outside the terms of the general permitted development order. Similarly, if a wind turbine went well above the roofline or beyond the building line, that would also be beyond the terms of the general permitted development order, so there are boundaries anyway.

<a name="stpa_126">The difference that is suggested is very modest indeed. It would simply clarify the terms under which microgeneration devices&#151;which were not in existence when permitted development orders were first thought about in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990&#151;

The suggestion in clause 9&nbsp;is that if a review agrees that that is a good idea, householders who wanted to put solar panels on the roof who, in other times and places, might have considered that it was necessary to apply for planning permission, would not after that general permitted development order was put in place have to do so in any local authority in the country, subject to all the conditions and the constraints that I have mentioned.

<a name="60317-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">The result for microgeneration would be that there would be clarity throughout the country in terms of what one could or could not do. A person who was installing a modest device would not have to go through the red tape. Cost is also involved. The price of a small wind turbine, such as the Leader of the Opposition is considering for his house, comes to about &#163;1,500. As things stand, the Leader of the Opposition would have to spend perhaps &#163;300&nbsp;or &#163;400&nbsp;of that &#163;1,500&nbsp;on seeking planning permission, with all that that entails, to get that device on to his house.

<a name="stpa_128">Our suggestion is both modest and economical.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The same applies when we consider the safety of such devices. The hon.

The truth is that if one had a solar panel on one&#039;s roof that produced electricity when it was not being used in the house, a two-way meter could place current completely safely&#151;without danger to small children, pets, or anyone else&#151;into the national grid.

<a name="stpa_133">I was saying that we are now presented with a wide spectrum of possibilities. I am now picking up the points made in this debate by my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle, and I am about to pick up a point made by the Minister&#151;I thought that that was what debates for. The Minister said that we have had a review of this important area of planning and development and referred to a kilowatt or two. He was trying to reassure the House, and that is very welcome, but I am not sure that his words here will be sufficient reassurance for people out there who might be worried about the potential intrusion of these microgeneration devices. It may not be enough simply for the Minister to say, &quot;Don&#039;t worry folks. Although my amendment refers to 50kW, it won&#039;t really be anything like that; it will be a kilowatt or two.&quot;

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="60317-15_spnew0"><b> Dr. Whitehead: </b> 
 What I attempted to explain, perhaps not as well as I might have done, was that it would not be acceptable to place a huge wind turbine of 50kW on someone&#039;s roof because the roof would not support it; it would not be within the permitted development order outline; and it would go above the roof line and outside the building line. A kilowatt or two would be about the limit for the size of a wind turbine to be placed on a person&#039;s house. With respect, the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments are a red herring.

<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60317-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I am sure that if they were not relevant, Madam Deputy Speaker would see to that. She does not need the hon. Gentleman&#039;s assistance. We are discussing the potential in clause 9&nbsp;for the whole regime to be altered in a way that we cannot predict.
</p>








<p><a name="st_243"><a name="60317-15_spnew4"><b> David Howarth: </b>

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60317-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I thought from what was said by the promoter and the hon.

I believe that the powers available to Ministers in clause 9&nbsp;could go a lot further than is being suggested.
</p>








<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60317-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend think that the point being made by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), who is a distinguished lawyer, is that this whole clause is effectively a waste of time because there is nothing to stop the Minister now from consulting on a list of permitted development order changes? He does not need this Bill to do that. Why has he not done it in the past two years?
</p>








<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60317-15_spnew7"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 We have a difficult choice to make. Either everything is hunky-dory and we do not need the provision, or it is so ineffectual that we do not need to bother with it&#151;or anything in between; take your pick.
</p>








<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60317-15_spnew8"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 The point of clause 9&nbsp;is to place an obligation on the Minister to carry out a review that he already has a power, but no obligation, to carry out.
</p>








<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60317-15_spnew9"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 In that case, we need not have the clause at all. The Minister could give us an undertaking and we could all go home quickly.

<a name="60317-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_134">Another of the criticisms that have been levelled at the Bill from the start is that it is in that dangerous area of gesture legislation or motherhood legislation. It is about making people feel good, especially some of the single-interest groups, which seem to influence so many Members of Parliament these days. Legislation should not be for such purposes: it should be for specific and clearly beneficial purposes. It should not be about making a gesture or making people happy, or pleasing this or that group. I am now being told that all the clause does is say to the Minister, &quot;Do a review, old boy,&quot; but if the Minister were to say simply, &quot;I&#039;ll do a review, don&#039;t worry,&quot; we could dispose of the matter very quickly.

<p>
<a name="60317-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">The Minister went on to talk about &quot;sensible-scale microgeneration&quot;, but what is sensible is very much in the eye of the beholder. It is like our good old friend &quot;reasonable&quot;. It sounds reassuring, but in the terms of what I believe we are discussing today&#151;potential intrusion into people&#039;s lives, albeit for the best of motives&#151;sensible is not good enough.

<a name="stpa_138">I hope that when we come to Third Reading, we shall have an opportunity to range much more widely over the concept of climate change, the United Kingdom&#039;s role in that, and the role of microgeneration within that, so that we can set the Bill in context. That is certainly for Third Reading, not for Report. In that part of the Bill, there is a tension or perhaps a conflict between, on the one hand, the environmentalists&#039; desire to reap the alleged benefits of microgeneration and, on the other, constraints on planning, capacity and so on. If we do not get it right there is a danger that there will be a backlash such as the one against telecommunications masts which, although in a very different way, it was thought would improve modern communications and the quality of life in general.

<a name="stpa_139">Under the Bill, we face the prospect that devices such as solar panels would be installed. Little has been said about them, because they would not be intrusive, although I accept that others may take a different view. Other devices that would be installed include wind turbines, about which a great deal has been said, as many people are worried about their visual impact, noisiness and the risk that they pose to health and safety. A more difficult problem&#151;I acknowledge that my hon. Friend faced a challenge in trying to use description when illustration would serve much better&#151;arises when we try to envisage what a microgenerating plant, whether it runs on biomass, biofuel, heat and power or fuel cells, would look like or how big it would be. Again, we are taking a great deal on trust, because we have only my hon. Friend&#039;s assertion that a domestic wind turbine could have blades up to 6&nbsp;ft long if it was located on the ground in a back garden rather than on a building. It would therefore be a fairly tall device, but it is difficult to imagine the size of a building or an installation that

<a name="stpa_140">Such things are unknown and uncertain, and we have been asked to take a great deal on trust. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) naturally says that we should not worry, as the proposals are modest and serve a terribly good cause. The Minister said that a kilowatt or two should be enough, so we should not worry. My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is a huge enthusiast for such power, but we have a duty to look at the measure from a different angle on behalf of people who are not environmental enthusiasts. They value their present quality of life and would prefer not to worry about the climate in 50&nbsp;years&#039; time. They are, however, worried about visual amenity and the effect of the devices on the value of their property&#151;that has not been mentioned, but it is a valid consideration. All those factors should be taken into consideration.

Instead of saying that we trust the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister and the parliamentary process to make sure that everything is okay in the end, I have attempted to ensure that the Bill includes a mechanism that will reassure people. Despite his mild criticism that I should have used another formulation in preference to &quot;shall have regard to&quot;, my hon. Friend accepted that the amendment is a step in the right direction, as it refers deliberately and explicitly to the desirability of

<a name="stpa_143">My hon. Friend touched on health and safety. Labour Members made some unnecessarily derisive remarks about that, but we ought to pause and consider the implications of, for example, a wind turbine of considerable size in a back garden, or one of the more exotic generating plants located on the ground inside or outside a building. There must be a distinct safety element to such installations. We all know that existing gas central heating appliances, for example, are rightly subject to severe safety regimes.

 Before my right hon. Friend moves on to his other amendments, will he address the concern that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1751</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there could be several 1kW windmills in one site? For example, the owner of a property in the green belt, where no development is allowed, could decide to engage in the generation of electricity and put up 50 1kW windmills. That could create an enormous amount of noise, similar to the noise from the halyards at a marina.
</p>








<p><a name="st_252"><a name="60317-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Indeed. My hon. Friend makes an important point. Necessarily, this is all rather speculative. We have not had a chance&#151;although we may get one on the next group of amendments or the one after that, or perhaps on Third Reading&#151;to explore the intriguing idea of surplus energy generated for domestic requirements being sold back to the grid. If that could be made to work properly, if we could get the pricing relationships right and so on, there could be a temptation for people to put in much more capacity than they needed for their own family and domestic purposes to make some money.

<a name="stpa_145">I am all in favour of making money. I am still a capitalist. I know that that is out of fashion in this modern age, but I still believe passionately in profit, capitalism and even tax cutting. I am not criticising any possibility the Bill might give to the capitalist instinct in all of us, but the worry is that that incentive might induce people to install more potentially intrusive equipment and capacity than they might otherwise do. We have not considered that aspect and none of us is certain what the effect might be. That should give us some pause for thought.

Of course we&#039;ll pay due regard to their views.&quot; To avoid all doubt and misgiving, it would be better to have in the Bill an obligation on the Secretary of State, in the context of the mechanisms in the clause and the aim of this part of the Bill, to consult any


</p>

<a name="stpa_147">Local authorities play a key part in the Bill since in our sitting last Friday we agreed to insert the Minister&#039;s new clause bringing them very much into play. Having brought local authorities in, it would be a good idea if they were consulted on the important provisions in clause 9. The list that I propose is not intended to be limiting or exclusive. I put into the list the bodies that I thought were relevant to the sort of considerations that I hoped would be in play in the review and the process of looking at the relationship between microgeneration and planning. Obviously, the Royal Institute of British Architects sprang to mind as a group of people to whom it would be very useful to speak, to find out how they saw the relationship between the built environment, as I think we are now supposed to call it, and all this exciting new technology.

Of course, there is also a serious point about the relationship between whatever form of microgeneration we happen to be talking about&#151;it may be photovoltaics, solar panels, which do not have to be on roofs, as they can be mounted away from a building, wind turbines or some of the more exotic technologies&#151;and building design and construction, on which they all have a bearing.

 The Minister should not be so eager to move on all the time.

We legislate by careful consideration, scrutiny, debate and amendment. Those are the processes by which we try to make our legislation good and workable, rather than &quot;moving on&quot;&#151;this pathetic desire that people have to rush through the legislative process because a very small and vocal number of people outside expect legislation to be introduced at their whim. We will decide the pace of legislation and what is proper, because this is Parliament scrutinising legislation, not the Minister getting his way.

It is those very people, our constituents, who may be uneasy about the process set out in the Bill. I am in the business of trying to give them a degree of reassurance.

 Indeed. We know of many occasions on which so-called consultation has been carried out in such a peremptory way, or so late on, that it has had little or no impact.

It is disappointing that we

 But what is to stop someone bulk buying 50&nbsp;generators, and then putting up 50&nbsp;windmills? I accept that they may be no larger than a TV aerial, but I do not know of anyone who has more than one television aerial or, for that matter, more than one satellite dish. The hon. Member for Eastleigh is looking at me in a certain way; perhaps he is the exception to my proposition.

<p><a name="st_262"><a name="60317-17_spnew2"><b> Dr. Whitehead: </b> 
 It is subject to current planning law.

<p><a name="st_263"><a name="60317-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman comes at me with these short statements. He thinks that permitted development rights allow for one television aerial or one satellite dish without the need to get planning permission. That is fine, but unfortunately he has said nothing to suggest that the power would be used to prohibit the erection of more than one 1kW windmill generator on one particular set of premises. I am glad that I gave way to him because I recall our days in Southampton when we closely debated political issues, and it is good to renew that acquaintance across the Chamber, but he has not satisfied my concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_161">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about bureaucracy and bureaucratic obstacles. I also understand how unsatisfactory some people, in particular the enthusiasts for microgeneration, might find a situation in which some local authorities allow people to put solar panels on their houses or to erect windmills without the need for planning permission, but others do not. Surely, however, it is a virtue of the nature of our society that we believe in localism, which necessarily involves individuality and diversity. He seems to want to promote uniformity and stereotyping. That cannot be a good thing. The idea of putting up lots of new windmills or photovoltaic equipment may be thought of as a good thing in some parts of the country, but why should an elected local authority not be able to decide the policy for itself?

<a name="60317-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_162">If we remove the clause, it will not prevent the use of permitted development orders to relax the planning regime for some parts of the microgeneration industry. It will not do that at all, and any suggestion that the clause is a vital part of the Bill is misconceived. However, the Minister has, I think, accepted that as drafted, clause 9&nbsp;is open to misinterpretation. He says that it does not reflect his intention, but we are dealingwith legislation that has to be precise in its

<br>&nbsp;<br>content. I hope that he will support me in the Division Lobby when I put the amendment to a vote. Removing the clause from the Bill will enable the Government to table a much better drafted version in the other place to make his intentions clearer and to put safeguards on the face of the Bill. I would welcome those, but at the moment they are articulated only in terms of expressions of intention by the Minister and the promoter, rather than being guarantees, which they would be if they appeared in the Bill.

 We are now getting to the exciting bit of the Bill: dynamic demand technologies. This is high-tech, futuristic, blue skies material. Therefore, my comments will probably be fairly limited.

There will be a cost; it could be social&#151;there could be all sorts of costs&#151;but there is bound to be a cost for new technology and it is important that we identify it. That is why my amendment would make that a part of the process set out in clause 15, whereby the Secretary of State will on our behalf examine the new technology and report back on it.

<a name="stpa_176">Bills such as this tend to express good hopes, good wishes, motherhood, aspirations, 50-year perspectives, saving the planet and global everything, but at some stage we have to get down to the realities on the ground, in the home and in the back garden. Who will buy the equipment? Who will install it? Who will pay for its maintenance? Who will ensure that in cases such as we have been discussing matters are recorded accurately? All those things are, or should be, relevant to any consideration of taking forward such technology. It does not come free, in money terms or many other terms, including environmental and social terms. So what my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch and I are trying to do throughout today&#039;s proceedings is to show that we should bring greater honesty and clarity to the process involved in the Bill, and that it is not good enough to brush these things aside and say, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, folks; it will all be very good indeed and we are doing our bit to save the planet, so let&#039;s get on with it.&quot; I believe that we should always have an eye to what is practicable, what is achievable and what is in this case acceptable in terms of costs.

 Clearly that is just a convention, not a requirement, and on this occasion it appears that the convention has been breached.

<a name="60317-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_179">Dynamic demand is a system whereby a machine&#151;be it a refrigerator, a freezer or a microgenerating device&#151;that is not necessarily to be switched on all the time can detect the difference in the current that is coming into that device. That means, and it is potentially very important, that where a current fluctuates it indicates the extent to which there is a load on the circuit in general&#151;that is, how much current is going around the grid and how much is therefore being supplied and used or not used. Where a machine is able to make use of current intermittently and switch itself off when it does not require that current, dynamic demand technology enables that device to do just that, and that would mean 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1761</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that if dynamic demand technology were to be made available on a widespread basis for machines such as that, it would enable the grid to operate much more efficiently. It would no longer be necessary, for example, to bring in coal-fired power stations for one hour in every three months to cope with a peak; that peak could be smoothed out as a result of dynamic demand technology judging by an intelligent device how that current is going and therefore whether that machine should draw that current off or not, or should export that current into the grid or not.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_180">The cost of achieving that is absolutely minimal, inasmuch as all that is needed is to place in each device a small piece of electronic equipment, costing probably a few pence, which could be supplied with the device when it was installed. To all intents and purposes, therefore, it is not a serious cost in the way that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested. However, the benefits, as I am sure he would agree, are enormous in terms of energy use, not just in terms of the use of the grid, but in terms of the use of energy by the specific device. So the net saving in the generation of electricity in general and the use of electricity by the device that the person has installed in their house would be enormous.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation. If the technology is that simple, if he knows so much about it, and if it costs only a few pence, why do we need a 12-month review by the Secretary of State to establish how wonderful it all is? Why do we not just get on with it anyway? Why do we need a rather elaborate clause to achieve all the things set out in it when he seems to know about the matter already?

 As the right hon. Gentleman will imagine from the account I am giving, if the system is to work well, it will require the widespread installation of dynamic demand devices into various machines that could collectively make the change to the way in which electricity is used from the grid, or exported to the grid, to achieve the savings that I outlined. A report that sets out, for example, the collective changes in manufacturing protocols that might be necessary to place the devices in machines would be a good way of going about things. I would imagine that standards, arrangements and protocols on the stage at which the devices come on stream would be part of a report to investigate the potential for dynamic demand technology and the savings that could result from it. It would be prudent and appropriate&#151;partly because of several of the points that the right hon. Gentleman makes&#151;to have such a report to ensure that the technology is implemented in a beneficial way, rather than a haphazard way that does not work at all. It is wise to suggest that a report making conclusions that would lead to the widespread establishment of the technology is produced in such a way.

 It is always a pleasure to have one&#039;s modest amendments grouped with Government amendments.

No doubt, the Bill will benefit from that in the long run. We shall judge the Government amendments in a moment, but their presence validates the process in which we are engaged in a useful fashion. Conscious of the clock, I shall keep my remarks fairly brief on this occasion and skip lightly through my amendments and the Government&#039;s.

<a name="stpa_193">Clause 16&nbsp;raises the slightly shadowy concept of the community energy scheme. Even though a definition is attempted, it is not at all clear to me what a community energy scheme will be, of what it will consist, what its scale might be and&#151;harking back to our earlier debate&#151;what the size or scope of the required equipment might be. If I am not mistaken, it was in the context of community energy schemes that my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and some of my other hon. Friends, including my good friend the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), voiced some reservations about the megawattage that might be required to power a community.

<a name="60317-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">My concern is to ensure that when setting about the process of promoting the schemes the Secretary of State will have to consult what I consider to be the relevant bodies&#151;local authorities, distributors and suppliers of electricity and the Health and Safety Executive. The aim is to ensure that the schemes are seen in the proper context. Although we might go into it on Third Reading, I shall not on this occasion explore in detail precisely what a community energy scheme might mean and how it might work, because the subject gets a bit complicated when we get into issues such as qualifying premises, the fact that there must be at least five dwellings, relevant plant, and so on.

<a name="60317-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">However, if the concept is to be promoted we must tease out what it means. Clause 16&nbsp;refers to investment and the provision of advice and assistance. Considerable commitments would be made by the Government, communities or electricity generators and distributors,

 In my constituency of Kettering, major planning applications for thousands of houses are about to be submitted. The local rumour is that there will be two applications, each for 5,000&nbsp;houses.

The clause says that generation will not exceed 20&nbsp;MWe. Earlier, there was a dispute about the typical consumption of a single household, but whatever it is to the nearest kilowatt, 20&nbsp;MWe represents a considerable generating capacity.

 A great deal of debate and public comment on the Bill has focused on microgeneration. Although that is an important part of the Bill, may I reiterate that the measure deals not just with microgeneration, but with the wider encouragement of renewable energy? It is therefore wrong to view the clause as a microgeneration clause. Community energy may well be promoted by microgeneration, but the purpose is not microgeneration per se.

 I am grateful to the promoter of the Bill for that explanation. Nevertheless, I think that he would concede that we are talking about potentially quite large generating plants of a capacity that would provide power for a community, however defined. My hon.

 Indeed. The clause could facilitate district heating schemes, but it would not change the planning regimes that apply to such schemes.

 My hon. Friend spells out the reality of the parliamentary process. With the best will in the world, let us assume that the Bill receives its Third Reading in June, which seems the most likely outcome now. It must, quite properly, still go to the House of Lords and undergo scrutiny there. We are talking about Queen&#039;s consent to such a Bill towards the end of this year.

Courtesy of a Government new clause that we debated last Friday, we have already amended the Bill to bring local authorities generally into the process. Although some of us were not desperately happy with that, we envisaged that county and perhaps district councils could have a role to play; mysteriously, the Greater London assembly did not appear anywhere, and we are still wondering about that lacuna. Reaching out to parish councils as the clause seeks to do is a step too far. I am not sure what added value parish councils, excellent though they are, could bring to the complexities of the subject that we have dealt with today and last Friday.

<a name="60317-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_201">I want to elicit more information about how a parish council can come anywhere near to doing the sort of things that are spelled out in clause 17, which refers to the encouragement and promotion of microgeneration of items such as efficiency in fuel use and reduction in energy use, as well as

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;production in their area .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of biomass, or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any fuel derived from biomass&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_202">I must admit that that is not quite what I thought parish councils were supposed to be all about. I would be very surprised if they were prepared to give priority to the activities set out in clause 17&nbsp;over and above what we would normally expect them to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_203">Matters become even more mysterious when we look at the amendments standing in the Minister&#039;s name. I struggled to understand his desire to insert the words

<a name="stpa_204">That is an intriguing phrase. I do not know what he envisages in referring to &quot;any other persons&quot;, but perhaps he will tell us in due course. Furthermore, Government amendment No. 48&nbsp;states:


</p>

Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) shakes his head, but I beg to differ. Clause 17 enables parish and community councils to play their part in encouraging or promoting energy-saving measures in a variety of ways. The measures listed are perhaps only a starting point, since the clause allows for further energy saving initiatives to be added in the future as new techniques become available.

<a name="stpa_217">Much has been said about microgeneration but the measure is about a great deal more than domestic appliances. It is about decentralisation of energy. Although it constitutes only a modest step, I hope that it is the first step in a significant direction for the country&#039;s energy policy, which will encourage much greater decentralised energy. If we are to move towards a decentralised model, that will require more community schemes. In many, although not all cases, especially in rural areas, the most effective, efficient and cost-effective way of embracing the new model will not be individual householders adopting their own kit but an efficient, small community form of domestic heat and power generation. I do not mean windmills or even solar or photovoltaic technology but gas-fired, combined heat and power or biomass fuel technology. Those work best, economically and efficiently, if they are adopted by several householders coming together on a relatively small scale. They are especially applicable to rural areas. Surely it is best for those schemes to be brought together in a democratic forum, where everyone in a village could have a voice, feel that their concerns were incorporated and the result was a genuine community plan. It is important to have a facility&#151;it is only a facility&#151;so that, in some circumstances, there is an opportunity to give some sort of financial encouragement when there is community consent.

<a name="stpa_223">It is absurd to suggest that wind turbines would have to be 20&nbsp;times as large in order to generate 20&nbsp;times as much as 1.4MW. I am envisaging, say, 20 1.4MW turbines, which would constitute a gross intrusion on any community. The Minister mentioned biomass. We do not need those excessive limits even for biomass. According to a helpful written answer published on 10&nbsp;February 2005, the total output from the 11&nbsp;biomass power plants operating in this country amounted to only just over 100MW. There is no need for such high limits to accommodate one biomass plant. I fear that we are talking not about community schemes, but about enormous schemes.

 I hope my hon. Friend will accept that those of us who support the measure do not just want biomass and wind turbines, although of course they are important. We also want to decentralise the electricity generation system, so that communities are served by smaller power plants rather than the country being served by 1,000MW or 2,000MW plants through a vast grid. In that context, surely, the limits proposed by the Minister are reasonable.

 I am grateful for that intervention, because it returns me to a major issue for my constituents. They will be expected to take most of the waste fuel from the whole of Dorset so that it can be converted to energy. What worries my constituents and me is that the proposed plants are so grotesquely large. It is causing a good deal of consternation. We think it would be better to have smaller plants in small Dorset towns&#151;perhaps one in Dorchester, in my right hon. Friend&#039;s constituency&#151;than to have waste transported across the county to those very large plants. I recognise the virtue of the plants, but a plant with a capacity of up to 20MW cannot be described as a modest plant. A 4MW limit would allow much more local combined heat and power, which is greatly preferable to the centralisation that we are experiencing in my constituency.

I am not sure that we have quite got to the bottom of the meaning and importance of community energy schemes and projects, or that we are completely satisfied that there will be sufficient protection against the development of what could be substantial generating plants. We have been given reassurances, and I hope that they are carried through in whatever way may be appropriate&#151;in guidance and so on. I hope that one of the things that has emerged strongly from this debate is that we must get the balance right between the desire for good things such as microgeneration, sustainable energy and renewables on the one hand and people&#039;s quality of life on the other. It is one thing to attempt to look decades ahead and save the planet in the next century, but it is quite another to take care of the quality of people&#039;s everyday lives today, and that should concern us as much, if not more.

<a name="stpa_229">We will probably have to agree to disagree on parish councils. Few parish councils will have the resources available or will be prepared to give sufficient priority to this kind of work, over and above what they do day by day in their communities. There has obviously been some interesting to-ing and fro-ing between my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) and the Minister about how to get the pitch about parish councils right. My view, which I expressed in my amendment, is that it would probably be better to leave them out of it altogether. However, at this stage of the Bill, I will be content to let matters rest there.

<a name="60317-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">We have had helpful explanations. The Minister has been helpful throughout. He has given us his explanations in his usual courteous way, and the promoter of the Bill has been much more helpful today than he was last Friday. He has been rewarded by some good progress on the Bill. I am very grateful that he brought along his hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), who has put us right in his knowledgeable way. I am sure that the Bill will be that much the better for it. So, for all these reasons, I am not going to press my amendment to the vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

 My right hon. Friend referred to the international context for the Bill. On 12&nbsp;January, I received a response to my parliamentary question about carbon dioxide emissions, which stated that the UK would reach a total of 525&nbsp;million tonnes by 2020&nbsp;compared to 556&nbsp;million tonnes at present, so there is likely to be a decrease. However, in the United States the amount is set to rise from just over 5,000&nbsp;million tonnes to 6,763&nbsp;million tonnes by 2020.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and later in my remarks I shall quote further from the Prime Minister on exactly that point. The Prime Minister spoke words of very great wisdom. He has a clear view of the realities of climate change, emissions and the like and I am sure that we shall want to explore that, too.

<p>
<a name="60317-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_238">One of the things on which we may want to spend some time, and which has been somewhat neglected up to now&#151;largely because nobody saw fit to table probing amendments or examine it&#151;is the reference in the long title to

 I am very pleased that we have managed to hold this Adjournment debate on the European Union-Morocco fishing agreement, which has enormous significance for many people living in the Western Sahara region. I know that this is a complicated day for us all, so I am really grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for being on the Front Bench to answer the debate. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who has taken an enormous interest in issues surrounding Western Sahara and Morocco.

<p>
<a name="60317-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_248">In 1974, the Spanish occupation of the Western Sahara ceased. Morocco then marched into that part of the Western Sahara and declared it to be Moroccan territory. There ensued a war that lasted some years, which was very brutal and resulted in many deaths and much destruction. The Polisario Front, which led the campaign for the independence of the Western Sahara, secured the support of the African Union and many people all around the world. It was ultimately expelled from the territory and 165,000&nbsp;Sahrawi people live in refugee camps in Algeria at the present time. I have had the good fortune to visit those camps in the Western Sahara. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I think I am losing the attention of some Members of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, who appear to be having a meeting of their own in the Chamber while we should be discussing Morocco.

 Order. The hon. Gentleman is quite right. Hon. Members will either listen to the debate or leave the Chamber.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

<a name="60317-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_249">I was explaining that the Sahrawi refugees live in refugee camps in Algeria. They have created an effective and sustainable community. Illiteracy has largely been conquered and there are good education and health services. That is thanks to the support of Algeria, yes, but also because of a great deal of aid from the UN, the European Union and our Department for International Development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_250">The refugees&#039; dream and hope is to return to Western Sahara. Part of the arrangements surrounding the 1991&nbsp;ceasefire was that the United Nations, through its organisation MINURSO&#151;United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara&#151;would arrange for a referendum to be held on the basis of the 1974&nbsp;census so that all the Sahrawi people could vote on whether they wished to achieve the independence to which they are entitled under the terms of international law. Tragically, the referendum has never been held because of disputes about the electoral roll and, I believe, Moroccan intransigence. The situation remains in a degree of stalemate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_251">Law is very much on the side of the Sahrawi people. The issue has been taken to the International Court of Justice. The Sahrawi claim, put by the Polisario, for the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1782</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>independence of Western Sahara is endorsed by a large number of countries and, especially, the African Union. It is worth mentioning that it is the only example in Africa of a border dispute involving an African country and what it claims is part of its territory&#151;the Western Sahara&#151;in which the African Union supports the independence movement. The situation is thus unique.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_252">My hon. Friend the Minister is aware of many of those issues because he is a former Foreign Office Minister. He is well aware of the concern and support of many of us for the Sahrawi people and what we believe to be their legitimate claim. The arrangements that are made for agreements between international bodies such as the United Nations and the European Union, and representatives of the Sahrawi people, are thus highly significant. I therefore want to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister the fishing agreement between the European Union and Morocco.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_253">Morocco, like any other country in the world, is entitled to conclude a fishing agreement with the European Union&#151;about that there is no dispute. However, it is not entitled to conclude a fishing agreement that includes the waters to the south of the recognised border between Morocco and what I shall term for the benefit of this contribution &quot;the occupied territories&quot;&#151;Western Sahara&#151;which makes up a significant part of the coastline. The waters are rich in fish, and the area is also rich in minerals and phosphates, which is part of the reason behind Morocco&#039;s determination to hang on to its illegal occupation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_254">The purpose of the debate is to draw the attention of the House and the Minister to the agreement that is about to be ratified by the European Union and to ask what the British position will be. Let me quote from a group called Fish Elsewhere. In answer to the question:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">&quot;Did the EU Legal Opinion say that fishing in Saharawi waters was legal&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_255">it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">&quot;The legal opinion then discusses under what circumstances would EU vessels be legally allowed to fish in the Western Sahara. It concludes that it would only be legal providing it was not &#039;carried out in disregard of the interests and of the wishes of the local population&#039;. The legal opinion states that it &#039;cannot be prejudged that Morocco will not comply with its obligations under international law vis-&#224;-vis the people of Western Sahara&#039;, hence we cannot be sure that the Agreement would be illegal.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_256">There is thus an area of debate and discussion. Fish Elsewhere has done a great deal to draw the attention of EU member states to the situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_257">I understand that the Minister cannot comment on the foreign policy implications of the situation because he is a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister&#151;I would not expect him to be able to do that&#151;but will he inform the House what position the British Government intend to take? The EU is divided. France and Spain strongly support a fishing agreement and Morocco&#039;s claim that it has the right to fish in the waters off Western Sahara, but a number of other countries are very doubtful about the legality of the matter and do not want the EU to conclude an &quot;illegal&quot; agreement that would then be challenged in the International Court of Justice. Many of them also have a great deal of sympathy with the plight of the Sahrawi people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_258">I go back to the legal opinion that I just read out, which talked about the local people. Ever since the expulsion of the Polisario from Western Sahara in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1783</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>1970s, a large number of Moroccan settlers have been moved in. It could be argued that those settlers are the local people. I would argue that although they are obviously resident there, the legality of that residence is in question, and the local people are those who were expelled and who now occupy the refugee camps in Algeria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_259">Will the Minister indicate to the House that the British Government are prepared to vote against the EU-Morocco fishing agreement if it includes the waters off the Western Sahara&#151;those of the Sahrawi people? Will he do his best to ensure that as many other countries as possible vote accordingly?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_260">There is an issue here of simple human justice. An area of land, which under the decolonisation procedures should have become a newly independent territory, was occupied. Since then the Polisario Front has kept the people together, campaigned for justice and the right of return, and gained a lot of international support. If we condone that occupation by agreeing to Morocco&#039;s &quot;right&quot; to fish the waters off the Western Sahara, we are condoning the occupation and the illegality of what Morocco is doing. The people who stand to gain from that are a number of extremely large, powerful fishing companies, particularly in France and Spain, and those who stand to lose are the poor people who have lived out all these years in the refugee camps in Western Sahara. I hope that when he comes to reply the Minister will be able to offer some assurance on these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_261">I would like to quote from a letter to me from my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud who, like me, takes a very close interest in matters concerning Western Sahara and is a strong supporters of the Sahrawi people. He says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">&quot;I am deeply concerned at the implications of this agreement. It flies in the face of the pressure that the UN has been applying over the years to try to resolve the situation in the Western Sahara. I am appalled that narrow EU fishing interests have been prioritised over the wider rights of the Saharawis and this gives a green light for Morocco to carry on with its illegal occupation of land and waters. What safeguards have been put in place to ensure that over fishing does not take place thus removing a potential source of revenue for a future independent Western Sahara? Surely the EU realises the sensitivity of this issue and should not put narrow economic interests above its long held political view in support of the UN that a referendum should be held on the future of the territory.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_262">To put it simply, I hope that this EU fishing agreement does not go ahead in so far as it takes away the fishing area of the Western Sahara people. I hope that we get a very strong declaration of support for a UN-organised referendum so that the people of the Western Sahara can, once and for all, decide their own future. If they wish to live in an independent country, in what was formerly a Spanish colony, it is their right to do so. That is a right enshrined in international law, and above all it is our duty to try to support that right within international law.

<p><a name="st_444"><a name="60317-26_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Mar 2006 : Column 1784</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) on the commitment that he has shown on this issue over many years. He has an interest not only in Western Sahara but, for the purposes of this debate, in any potential impact of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement on that part of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_263">May I start by apologising to my hon. Friend for the fact that, as he acknowledged, many of the points that he raised are the responsibility of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office? I know that he held discussions with the Minister for the Middle East, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), back in the autumn, and he may want to renew that contact now. I shall certainly make sure that the concerns that he has raised today that are relevant to the Foreign Office are communicated to my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_264">The proposed new fisheries partnership agreement between the EU and Morocco is due to come into force in May 2006&nbsp;for a period of four years. It is made under the provisions of the European common fisheries policy and, as my hon. Friend said, the Commission has competence to negotiate such agreements on behalf of the EU. The agreement has yet to come before the Agriculture and Fisheries Council for adoption, and we are still waiting for an opinion from the European Parliament. If they have not already done so, I urge my hon. Friends the Members for Islington, North and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who has a deep interest, to raise their concerns with Members of the European Parliament, who have a role to play in these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_265">From a purely fisheries perspective, the agreement reflects the new fisheries partnership approach based on the Fisheries Council&#039;s reforms of 2004&nbsp;in respect of such agreements. For example, article 6&nbsp;of the protocol to the agreement provides for more than a third of the EU&#039;s financial contribution to be used for the implementation of a national fisheries policy based on responsible fishing and on the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. That reflects the improvements to such third-party agreements in terms of their transparency and sustainability that were championed by the United Kingdom in particular. The agreement is based on the scientific assessment of stocks in Moroccan waters and consequently excludes fishing possibilities for cephalopods and shellfish, which have been over-exploited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_266">In addition to the fisheries aspects of the agreement, my hon. Friend has raised its potential effect on the disputed status of Western Sahara. I give my hon. Friend and the House the following assurance. The UK Government would not support an agreement if we felt that it would prejudice the question of the status of Western Sahara. The delimitation of the agreement is identical to that of the previous EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, which expired in 1999. The UK Government&#039;s position remains the same: the status of Western Sahara should be dealt with under the United Nations process. We regard the sovereignty of Western Sahara as undetermined, pending UN efforts to find a solution and we fully support that UN process.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_267">As my hon. Friend also said, the European Commission has recently produced legal advice that suggests that there is nothing in the draft fisheries agreement that is inconsistent with international law governing the status of Western Sahara. The Fisheries Council will clearly want to explore that advice further when discussing the draft agreement. The UK Government are considering the Commission&#039;s advice in discussion with other member states who, like us, have been seeking reassurance on the matter, and we have placed a reserve on our position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_268">I am aware of concerns expressed by War on Want and others that few Sahrawis will benefit from the agreement because of the structure of the fishing industry in the areas concerned. The Commission has expressed the view that the Western Sahara people will benefit from the agreement, but I have asked the Commission to study and respond to War on Want&#039;s evidence as a matter of urgency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_269">Morocco is obliged under international law to ensure that in non-self-governing territories such as Western Sahara economic activity does not adversely affect the people. It is clear in paragraph 24&nbsp;of the letter of 29&nbsp;January 2002&nbsp;from the UN&#039;s legal advisers to the Security Council that the exploitation of the resources of

 Does my hon. Friend accept that, in that regard, &quot;people&#039;s&quot; includes those who are in the refugee camps in Algeria?
</p>








<p><a name="st_446"><a name="60317-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is not for a Fisheries Minister to express a view on who properly speaks on behalf of the people of Western Sahara. I am sure that my hon. Friend has his own view, but that too is an issue on which he will have to seek confirmation from my colleagues in the Foreign Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_270">We are concerned to ensure that obligations that are self-evident in the case that we are discussing are honoured.
